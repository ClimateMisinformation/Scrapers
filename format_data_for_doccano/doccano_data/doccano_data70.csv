"With just 11 years left to prevent irreversible damage caused by the climate emergency, there are still options to wean the world’s economy off its reliance on fossil fuels. However, anything less than putting Britain on a war footing will not be enough. The government response so far has been timid. Theresa May introduced a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050, but there are reasons why the Conservatives haven’t gone further: her party is hard-wired to fail. Clinging to a belief in the power of free markets, it neglects the fact that to decarbonise the economy greater investment from the state is required. Free-market advocates detest big government. But faced with the scale of the challenge, only government has the weapons powerful enough to tackle the crisis. So far May and her allies have been held back by their unswerving belief in the market economy and the mobilisation of private capital. Political will can be transformative. The government’s independent committee on climate change has a target for spending of 1-2% of GDP by 2050 on greening the UK economy, for both the public and private sector. But faced with the gathering crisis climate activists are starting to push for greater government investment. Doubling the UK’s investment rate – with the bulk coming from the state – in green infrastructure, technologies and industry should create millions of good jobs and build low-carbon wealth. State funding will be required to support people working in industries incompatible with a green future, such as mining, oil and gas, heavy industry and energy-intensive transport. When the state invests, the private sector is encouraged to raise its investment alongside these efforts. Last week, the government launched a half-hearted attempt to encourage more financing of green projects using market-based solutions. It might show that the Tories are moving in the right direction, but their plans came straight from the neoliberal playbook. Ministers announced with aplomb that companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would be forced to disclose their risks from climate change by 2022. Tinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency If only investors knew the scale of the risks, they would price them accordingly – penalising those with carbon exposure and rewarding those without. It is undoubtedly a positive step. Every little helps. But Tesco shouldn’t need to tell investors it would lose money if the world goes up in smoke. News of melting glaciers, vanishing biodiversity and extreme weather events is telling enough. On the left there is more momentum. John McDonnell has argued for the forcible ejection of companies from the stock exchange that do not have a plan for tackling climate change. Labour would create a sustainable investment board, supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. Climate activists are angling for a mass government mobilisation equivalent to Roosevelt’s New Deal, which lifted America from the morass of the Great Depression. In an attempt to outline a roadmap to a Green New Deal in Britain, the left-leaning thinktank Common Wealth is this week launching a bundle of papers. There will be six policy reports in total over July that will add up to a guide to turbocharging the low-carbon economy, while supporting communities through the transition. Mathew Lawrence, its director, argues that to finance the transition the largest ever peacetime mobilisation of resources will be required. “Tinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency,” he says. Markets on their own cannot drive a society-wide reorganisation of production and consumption at the pace and scale required. “We need a government-led process of economic restructuring,” he said. Among the measures are proposals to retool the financial system. A report will say that the green investment bank – sold off under Tory free-market dogma – should be brought back under state control. The Bank of England could adjust financial stability rules to penalise commercial banks for holding brown assets on their balance sheets, while promoting more green lending.  There can be no economic stability in a climate emergency. The foundations of our prosperity came close to tumbling down in the 2008 financial crisis. Brexit threatens our future living standards. But global heating stands to surpass them all. So far the UK is lagging behind. Ministers might talk about a bright new future of electric vehicles, with encouraging news that Jaguar Land Rover plans to build its electric XJ car in Britain. But its target of 2040 for ending petrol and diesel car sales would mean polluting cars still being sold in Britain a full decade after irreversible damage to the planet could be complete. There is evidence that government intervention can work. Despite deriving most of its wealth from fossil fuels, Norway has used spending and tax cuts to drive up the sale of electric vehicles to count for half of all cars sold. And it targets the end of petrol and diesel car sales by 2025. Britain has had some success. The carbon intensity of Britain’s energy production has improved markedly with the rapid increase in wind energy. As coal-burning power stations are phased out, about half of energy production is now from renewables and nuclear. Some Tories are moving in the right direction. Last week, the Conservative Environment Network set out a manifesto that included banning fracking, a sevenfold increase in offshore wind by 2050, an earlier ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans, as well as fertiliser and pesticide taxes. They should be encouraged to go further still. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt broadly welcome the thrust of the debate, but neither leadership contender has endorsed the recommendations. Both have made profligate tax and spending commitments in their campaign, with little reference to the emergency facing the climate. Rather than entering into a bidding war on tax breaks for the rich, the next prime minister should commit more money instead to a real response to the climate crisis. The scale of the emergency requires it."
"Jessie Sims is one of 600 people in Stroud, Gloucestershire, to have had their homes retrofitted to make them more energy efficient. In 2013, the district council replaced the windows and doors, insulated the loft and floors, and installed solar panels on the roof as part of its programme to become carbon neutral by 2030. “I think it’s brilliant,” she says. “I used to have an old-fashioned storage heater, which cost a fortune to turn on and didn’t work well. Now it’s cosy and I’ve halved my fuel bills.”  Last week, the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on councils to lead the way in cutting carbon. “Local government and local communities are absolutely essential to confronting the climate emergency,” he said. It follows the announcement by Theresa May last month to commit to net zero UK carbon emissions by 2050. Stroud has been tackling the causes and effects of global heating since the 1990s. In 2009, it adopted a carbon management plan and in 2015 announced that it had become the first local authority in Europe to become carbon neutral. Energy-efficiency measures and renewable-energy installations include solar panels on all municipal buildings, secondary glazing and internal insulation on the council’s grade II-listed building, and ensuring all its electricity and heating comes from renewable sources. By creating a local waste-management company in partnership with neighbouring authorities, it boosted its low recycling rates to 61% and now sends the least waste per capita to landfill. Last month, it outlined its plans to become a carbon-neutral area by 2030, by ensuring all its own vehicles are electric or hybrid; making all homes (not just social housing) energy efficient; shifting to very low or zero carbon renewable electricity and heat generation; and tree planting. It also envisages a “dramatic” reduction in emissions from road transport by switching to walking, cycling and renewable-powered public transport. “We’ve reached all the low-hanging fruit,” says Simon Pickering, chair of the district council’s environment committee and a Green party councillor. “It will no longer be business as usual to cut the energy use of all buildings by at least 80%, generate over half the district’s electricity needs from renewable sources and transform how we travel.” With the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year warning that the human race has just 12 years to limit the most devastating impacts of global heating, stark images of the toxic effect of plastic on marine life in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II, and Greta Thunberg and British pupils going on strike from school over the climate crisis, there is growing public awareness – and demand for action. Stroud may have started tackling its emissions earlier than most, but Nottingham is arguably the most ambitious council, having set a target for the whole city to be carbon neutral by 2028. It has met the previous target of cutting CO2 emissions by a quarter by 2020 two years early. Every new council house built has solar panels while council leaseholders have been offered discounted rates. It aims to plant at least 10,000 trees by 2023 and is creating bee-friendly areas in all neighbourhoods. It has one of the UK’s largest fleets of electric buses and claims to have the world’s largest fleet of biogas double-decker buses. The waste-collection depot has solar panels on the roof, to charge the council’s fleet of electric dumper trucks and street sweepers. A workplace parking levy on employers providing 11 or more parking spaces for staff generates £9m a year, which is ringfenced for renewable transport schemes and has already paid for the city’s new tram system. The trams are powered by the council’s not-for-profit energy company, which supplies all its electricity from renewable sources. Sally Longford, deputy leader of Nottingham city council, says: “The idea of being carbon neutral is scary for a lot of people, but a carbon-neutral city has benefits for everybody.” Retrofitting and tackling congestion and air pollution improve health, lower bills and create good green jobs, she explains. Oxford city council, meanwhile, is holding a citizens’ assembly to shape its action plan. It is on target to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 and plans to introduce a zero-emission zone in the city centre. It will also be trialling what it believes is the world’s largest hybrid battery to power ground-source heat pumps serving around 300 homes and increase electric vehicle-charging capability. Across Great Britain and Northern Ireland, more than 100 local authorities have recently announced a climate crisis. “In the past eight months local authorities representing more than half Britain’s population have declared a climate emergency in their areas,” says Kevin Frea, deputy leader of Lancaster city council and co chair of UK Climate Emergency Network.  But Simon Brammer, head of cities at sustainable energy charity Ashden, which has just produced a toolkit for councils, thinks they need to do more. “We think cities need to respond much faster,” he says. “They are responsible for producing up to 80% of the UK’s CO2 emissions.” And too often, these declarations are butting up against development demands. Manchester city council’s plan to become carbon neutral, for example, explicitly excludes airport emissions – and, indeed, the council has a part share in the airport . Norwich and Herefordshire councils have been criticised for approving ring roads, despite having declared a climate emergency. And while lots of local authorities have committed to tackling global heating, many have yet to do so, including most of the home counties and many other county councils. Cumbria county council has even approved a new deep coalmine. Planning laws can hamper council plans for new developments to be zero carbon or carbon neutral, or to approve onshore wind farms. From 2006, authorities were able to insist that houses were built to the highest energy standards, but this regulation was scrapped in 2015.  A report by the Association for Public Service Excellence (Apse), published later this week, says local authorities need to take an organisation-wide response to action on climate issues: from councils’ corporate financial strategy to all council services, in particular housing, waste and recycling, transport and infrastructure investment. Climate-emergency declarations are welcome, but they are statements of intent unless they are followed up in the short-, mid- and long-term with measurable outcomes, it will say. “Local councils can be at the heart of tackling climate change, but to translate declarations into tangible carbon-reduction actions there is a huge question of resources,” says Paul O’Brien, Apse’s chief executive. “If we are serious about tackling waste, sustainable housing development, air quality – to name just a few of the issues that contribute to carbon emissions – we will need a real step-up in the resources available to local councils. Climate action matters, but there is a disconnect between what local councils can realistically deliver when resources are being choked by austerity.” Back in Stroud, Sims is clear that cutting carbon has been beneficial for her as well as the planet. She says: “Now I eat well and heat well.” • Additional research by Jessica Murray Last year, Bristol city council became the first local authority to declare a climate emergency. It committed to making the council carbon neutral by 2025 and the whole city by 2030.  Now it has just published its implementation plan, which once passed at a full council meeting later this month, commits the council to a 200% increase in renewable energy, low-emission public transport, building a new waste centre to improve recycling rates, installing solar panels on 10,000 council houses, retrofitting 7,000 homes with insulation and other energy efficiency measures each year, as well as training councillors and staff in climate change issues. Other measures include assessing all major projects against their impact on emissions, expanding the number of electric car-charging points and a dramatic reduction in single-use plastics. In a statement, Bristol’s elected mayor, Marvin Rees, said the climate emergency was “one of the biggest global threats facing our planet”. “We might be one city in the context of a worldwide issue, but it’s vital we take immediate action,” he said. “Our response must be inclusive, to ensure that everyone benefits. “The report shows our biggest challenge is consumption of goods and services from outside Bristol. This is a fundamental challenge to city government, corporations and citizens to take urgent action to change behaviours.” But it is hard to see how the city will achieve its ambitious green targets if controversial plans to expand Bristol airport, which Rees strongly supports, are approved. The proposals are designed to double passenger numbers by 2045. North Somerset – a unitary authority that has also declared a climate emergency – will rule on the planning application for the airport. Some argue the council isn’t going fast enough. Green party councillor Carla Denyer, who proposed the climate emergency motion, welcomes the decision to introduce an annual carbon budget and to set a tougher carbon neutrality target but criticises the lack of concrete detail. “Eight months after full council declared a climate emergency, this is still a plan to produce a plan,” she says. “We need an end to the ‘business as usual’ approach, replaced with rapid and ambitious action, and unfortunately there isn’t enough of that in this report.”"

A wave of commotion has just been unleashed by the very recent FOX News report on Google’s contemplating of changing the way it ranks website pages with its famous search engine. Also read here.

Towering arrogance from speech-rights midgets? The self-appointed gate-keepers of the Truth: Image cropped here.
Rather than ranking websites on their popularity, a Google research group is looking into ranking websites based on how “factual” they are. If implemented, it would literally mean Google taking on the gatekeeper role of who deciding fact from fiction. Google has already created a “knowledge vault” containing “commonly believed facts”. In summary sites found to deviate from what Google considers facts, would be automatically down-ranked in searches. Result: dissident opinions would surely get buried.
Though the system may have some merits, it is chock-full of pitfalls and it risks the establishment of an information dictatorship – a so-called Orwellian Ministry Of Truth. In other countries such information control programs are the sort of things one associates with tyrannies and dictatorships, like Iran, North Korea, Red China, Russia, Venezuela or Islamic fundamentalist states. Note in all these states, leaders are convinced it’s for the overall good of the people.
“That is very troubling,” writes Jim Lakely, Director of Communications of the Chicago-based think-tank The Heartland Institute in an e-mail. He thinks there is no doubt that the ‘facts’ of politicized sites who clearly have a defined agenda will get favorable treatment in Google’s ‘knowledge vault’ while dissident sites will be locked out.
“I worry about this issue greatly… My site gets a significant portion of its daily traffic from Google,” Anthony Watts told FoxNews.com. “It is a very slippery and dangerous slope because there’s no arguing with a machine,” he added.
While Google maintains this project is only in the development phase, others are not so sure. One climate science dissident, who wishes to remain anonymous for the time being, believes that Google is already “heavily biased and directing traffic away” from climate science skeptic sites.
When it comes to science, the move reveals that Google seems oblivious to how the discipline works. It that is so, it makes the omnipotent company all the more dangerous. Science is always hotly disputed. For example is used to be a universal “fact” that saturated fats were bad for human health – before dissidents forced a rethinking. With Google’s new proposed policy, dissident voices would never see the light of day and progress would be stunted as a result. Dissidence is the life blood of science itself. By removing dissidence, as Google unwisely moves to do, science itself would de facto get starved and be catapulted back to the Dark Ages and the times of the Inquisition.
Global warming alarmists have long been working to get Google to suppress dissident voices on the subject of climate change. In 2009 conservative news site Newsbusters here wrote:

Former Vice President Al Gore a few years ago advised Internet behemoth Google about “aspects of search quality.”Such was reported by the New Yorker in its October 12 issue (subscription required). […] given the ongoing concerns about Google’s political leanings and how its search algorithms might be manipulated to favor liberal news outlets over conservative points of view, the very idea that Gore might have had any input to this process is worrisome to say the least.”
Thus we see that the Google project has long been in the works, and so the preparation appears to be grand and fundamental in scale. It cannot be that an organization with the power and might of Google would take it upon itself to police the world’s body of knowledge and to decide who is trustworthy and who isn’t. This borders on dangerous megalomania.
Censorship can be fought
The irresponsible and arguably arrogant deeming of “unreliable sources” is not something that Google alone is contemplating, but was already once reality among some powerful government institutions worldwide just months ago. For example Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment issued a 123-page publication that singled out German and American journalists and scientists who it claimed were responsible for “spreading doubt and false information“ on climate change. Among them: Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon, Frederick Seitz, Joe Barton, Pat Michaels, John Christy and Ross McKitrick.
Fortunately the German journalists and scientists who were targeted did not take the state-sponsored attack lying down. The brochure is no longer available. A small victory for the freedom of scientific dissent.
So will Google and its many backstage operators be successful?
If anything, the move confirms yet again that the globalist alarmists have lost the argument and that the public debate has become unwinnable for them. This is the reason for the “state-of-emergency” scale move. Despite their huge advantages in the media and state funding, they are unable to explain the harsh winters, the models’s failure, the sea ice growth and the many other warmer Holocene periods. Now they are forced to shut down dissidents, a-la-Inquisition.
But it will never work. Every lie has a short shelf-life and can be propped up only for so long. Eventually it gets stale, and no one is left to swallow it.
Google’s move, however, is indeed extremely worrisome and very serious. The new US Congress needs to move swiftly and forcefully, and to put these obviously out-of-control Google executives on the hot seat for a serious grilling or two and a little schooling on the virtues of un-monopolized dissent. The human right to be heard, and to not be silenced, is at stake here. Sympathetic lawmakers need to be contacted.
Kennedy aptly concludes: “Whoever controls the Truth, controls the world“.
The power to determine the truth belongs to the people, and not to Google.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online center-left Die Zeit features an interview with Prof Hans von Storch, Professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg and Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre in Geesthacht, Germany.

The focus was on mainly storm activity and its possible link to man-made climate change.
In the end the very green-oriented Die Zeit did not get the sound bites it likely had hoped to get.
All within natural varibility
In the interview, in response to the question of storm frequency and intensity, von Storch, a renowned climate scientist with 40 years of experience, says:
We see no intensification in storm activity at our latitudes, and our climate models also indicate that we cannot expect it.
Also since 1950 they have not become systematically more frequent or stronger. Therefore we believe that Christian [October 2013 North Sea storm] moved within the range of normal variability.”
Von Storch also tells Die Zeit that storms do not occur with a rather regular periodicity, saying that “sometimes there are decades when they rumble a lot, and some decades when they don’t.”
The north German professor also tells Die Zeit it is very difficult to make comparisons between the storms of today and those of decades ago because the data recorded back then are nowhere near as complete:

If you simply compared the pressure values with those from a few decades ago, then you would reach the conclusion: Yes, the storms have become more powerful. But that would be a faulty conclusion.”
The reason for this, von Storch explains, is that the measurement of the storms core pressure was very inadequate and readings were often taken by ships that were not located near core of the storm. Today satellites provide very reliable data for comparisons.
Climate models do not indicate future intensification
On the future of storms and increased intensity, von Storch tells Die Zeit no one can rule it out, of course, but thinks it’s “implausible“. “Our climate models do not lead us to expect it.”
Von Storch also cautions against putting too much emphasis on model results:
Ultimately, however, observations and not climate models decide. We always have to expect that we will know the truth only afterwards. We can’t predict everything with certainty.”
“Pause” has led to more attention on natural fluctuations
Next Die Zeit looks at the warming pause, which it writes it has been confirmed “by some scientists” and asks if the “pause” has ended. Von Storch replies:
At least one finds no strong evidence showing that the long-term warming pause in the climate system has ended. The debate over this postulated ‘pause’ in the end has had a good side: Natural fluctuations have gotten more attention. We understand the climate a little bit better.”
In summary, von Storch sees 1) no data supporting a trend of stronger, more frequent North Sea storms, 2) models do not show an increasing trend, 3) recent storms have been within the range of natural variability, and 4) the pause has been substantial enough that it has shifted more focus onto natural factors.
The AGW theory of catastrophic warming has taken a significant blow.

"When Andrea Carnevali’s son started at St Mary’s Catholic primary school in Chiswick he was alarmed to find that pupils were sometimes kept indoors at break times, despite a large playground. The reason was the nearby six-lane A4 road, which has up to 100,000 vehicles thundering past the school each day. As evidence mounted about the impact of poor air quality on children’s health, the headteacher restricted time outside.  Carnevali and other parents decided to take action. Within months they had crowdfunded almost £100,000, and last month a 126-metre “living wall” of 12,000 plants was installed as part of a clean-air initiative at the school. They hope the wall – designed to trap exhaust particles, absorb sound and increase biodiversity – will transform one of London’s most polluted schools into one of its greenest. “We’re immensely pleased,” said Carnevali. “The council is monitoring changes in air quality, and we hope for a 40% improvement – but even 10% would be good.” St Mary’s living wall is one of many being installed around the country by local authorities and private developers. Tennis fans may have noticed two enormous living walls flanking the giant outdoor screen at this year’s Wimbledon championships. And they are increasingly a feature of hotel and retail developments. A stunning vertical garden graces Elephant & Castle underground station in south London, part of a plan to improve air quality at one of the capital’s busiest road intersections. In a variation on a theme, “living lamp-posts” were installed this month as a trial in Ebury Street in Belgravia, central London. They will be monitored for air quality improvement for a year; if the pilot is successful, it could be extended to some of the other estimated 494,000 lamp-posts in central London. In Hull, the council is considering a proposal to transform Whitefriargate, a historic thoroughfare now blighted by empty shops, with vertical gardens. “Demand is definitely growing. There’s been a steady rise in interest over the past two years, and a noticeable increase since the beginning of this year,” said Calvin Dalrymple, a living wall consultant with ANS Global, one of the country’s leading suppliers, and the creator of St Mary’s living wall. “It’s being mainly driven by local authorities, but also a greater awareness in the private sector of the need for sustainable architecture.” According to Benz Kotzen of the Green Roofs and Living Walls Centre at the University of Greenwich, “we need every tool to try to improve things, and there just isn’t enough capacity in urban environments to create green infrastructure at ground level. “It’s no longer good enough to have a building facade that just keeps out the weather. In the future, building facades will need to be much more functional – cleaning the air, collecting energy and improving biodiversity.” Vertical gardens could also be used to grow food, he said, adding that herbs, strawberries, tomatoes and rocket did particularly well. Living walls range from simple wire structures to support climbing plants to sophisticated modular systems, using soil or hydroponic manmade substrate, and solar-powered irrigation. The cost ranges from £200 to £800 per square metre. The main challenge with maintenance was working at height, said Kotzen. “Growing plants vertically is no more difficult than horizontally, but all gardens need maintaining.” Not everyone is a fan of the trend towards vertical gardens. “They’re not a solution, except for the wealthy,” said Mick Crawley, professor of plant ecology at Imperial College London. “There are much cheaper and more effective ways of improving air quality.” Local authorities struggling to pay for essential services would be better advised to plant trees, he said. London’s first living wall, installed in 2005 by Islington council at a children’s centre at a cost of £100,000, withered and died within four years after the irrigation system failed. “Living walls will die if they’re not designed properly and maintained,” said Dalrymple. “There are four key things to longterm sustainability: correct water management, correct substrate, maintenance and plant selection taking into account shade, wind and elevation.” With between 28,000 and 36,000 deaths in the UK each year attributed by Public Health England to long-term exposure to air pollution, living walls are expected to become more common. But the benefits go beyond improvements to air quality. Lucy Dunhill, who is behind the Hull proposal, said: “Visually, Whitefriargate is very depressing, with boarded-up shopfronts and very bad acoustics. Your eyes are not drawn up, you keep your head down when you walk along Whitefriargate.” Her green walls plan will, she hopes, “become an attraction in itself as well as improving the environment”. Andy Wayro, landscape design manager at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, said its living walls were aesthetically pleasing, had reduced noise and connected people to nature. “The feedback from players and the general public has been really positive,” he said. At St Mary’s in Chiswick, children have been planting a section of the wall with wild strawberries, thyme, rosemary, sage and lavender, using wooden markers to allow them to monitor growth. “The children adore it, and so do the teachers,” said Carnevali. “Apart from any environmental benefits, they say it makes them happier and calmer.”"

Today’s modern wind turbines now soar to heights of up to over 200 meters, can have outputs of well over 5 MW, and blade tip speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour, thus making them especially lethal to avian wildlife, and hazardous for human health through infrasound.

Source: academia.eu, Erin F. Baerwald et al.
21,000 square meters of “swept area” of annihilation 
To give an idea of their scale, Danish company Vestas, for example, offers an 8-MW offshore turbine with a total height of 220 meters that is equipped with a monster rotor diameter of 164 meters. The result: horrendous blade speeds and pressure gradients. Flying wildlife stand no chance. Worse is the growing size of the hazardous swept area.
Vestas boasts that its V164-8.0 MW® turbine has a swept area of more than 21,000 square meters, which is “equivalent to almost three football pitches“. Vestas bellows: “When it comes to profitability, the bigger the swept area the bigger the revenue.”
Unfortunately for birds and other wildlife it is also: The bigger the swept area, also the bigger the wildlife annihilation area. But wildlife be damned.
Huge number of fatalities
Wildlife fatalities from wind turbines are poorly documented and mostly unknown. Estimates are on the low side and thought to be much higher, as the industry attempts to play down their real danger.
Birds, bats and other animals can be killed by turbines in any one of three ways: 1) through loss of their habitat due to the disruption of a vast installation area, 2) direct impact with high speed moving blades (birds) and 3) from barotrauma, where bats are the primary victims.
The most sinister of the three is barotrauma, which is a common way bats are killed by wind turbines.
Study shows mayhem

An article published at academia.edu by Erin F. Baerwald et al of the University of Calgary confirms the violent deaths that bats suffer from wind turbines. Bats do not even need to come into contact with the moving blades. It is enough for them to be close to the end of a moving blade to become victims of barotrauma. As the turbine’s blade slices by at 300 km/hr, the negative pressure in the blade’s wake causes the air in the bats’ lungs to expand and incur lethal injury.
Barotrauma typically occurs when an organism is exposed to a significant change in ambient pressure, such as when a scuba diver, a free-diver or an airplane passenger ascends or descends, or during uncontrolled decompression of a pressure vessel.
The academia.edu article writes:
The decompression hypothesis proposes bats are killed by barotrauma caused by rapid pressure reduction near moving turbine blades [1,4,5]. Barotrauma involves tissue damage to air-containing structures caused by rapid or excessive pressure change; pulmonary barotrauma is lung damage due to expansion of air in the lungs that is not accommodated by exhalation.”
Moving turbine blades create zones of low pressure as the air ﬂows over them. Animals entering these sudden low pressure zones may suffer barotrauma; academia.edu article writes:
Pressure differences as small as 4.4 kPa are lethal to Norway rats Rattus norvegicus) [6]. The greatest pressure differential at wind turbines occurs in the blade tip vortices which, as with airplane wings, are shed downwind from the tips of the moving blades [7]. The pressure drop in the vortex increases with tip speed, which in modern turbines turning at top speed varies from 55 to 80 m/s. This results in pressure drops in the range of 5–10 kPa (P. Moriarty, personal communication), levels sufﬁcient to cause serious damage to various mammals [6].” […] 
Even if echolocation allows bats to detect and avoid turbine blades, they may be incapacitated or killed by internal injuries caused by rapid pressure reductions they cannot detect.”
188 dead bats examined
Baerwald and her team examined 188 dead bats killed by a wind turbine facility in southwestern Alberta:
Of 188 bats killed at turbines the previous night, 87 had no external injury that would have been fatal, for example broken wings or lacerations (Table 1). Of 75 fresh bats we necropsied in the ﬁeld, 32 had obvious external injuries, but 69 had haemorrhaging in the thoracic and/or abdominal cavities (Table 1). Twenty-six (34%) individuals had internal haemorrhaging and external injuries, whereas 43 (57%) had internal haemorrhaging but no external injuries. Only six (8%) bats had an external injury but no internal haemorrhaging.
Among 18 carcasses examined with a dissecting microscope, ten had traumatic injuries. Eleven bats had a haemothorax, seven of which could not be explained by a traumatic event. Ten bats had small bullae — air-ﬁlled bubbles caused by rupture of alveolar walls — visible on the lung surface (Figure 1A). All 17 bats examined histologically had lesions in the lungs consistent with barotrauma (Table 1), with pulmonary haemorrhage, congestion, edema, lung collapse and bullae being present in various proportions (Figure 1). In 15 (88%), the main lesion was pulmonary haemorrhage, which in most cases was most severe around the bronchi and large vessels.”
In summary, the wind turbines are extremely lethal to wildlife on a scale so horrendous and embarrassing that it is being kept out of the public’s eye. What’s worse is that these turbines, and the growing swept areas of annihilation they bring with them, have been installed by the thousands and plans are being made to install many thousands more – many in natural areas. Wildlife will have no chance.
This is all endorsed by Greenpeace and the WWF.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChief Executive Johannes Teyssen of German power giant Eon announced yesterday the spin off of its fossil fuel and nuclear generation operations, saying it will focus instead on renewables like wind power, energy efficiency technology, and smart grids. The announcement yesterday sent shock waves through Germany’s power generation market and the political landscape.
The moves produces a host of important questions? Who will take over the massive conventional power generation operations Eon is spinning off? In a nutshell, what is going to happen to a large part of Germany’s steady base-power supply in a power grid that is becoming increasingly dangerously precarious?
Daniel Wetzel at Die Welt writes of the “hidden dangers of the power revolution” and that Eon’s move is of “importance for the future of the German energy market, for the electricity supply security and the competiveness of the entire nation.”
Another blow was delivered on Monday as Vladimir Putin announced that Russia was cancelling the construction of the South Stream pipeline as a result of political conflict over the Ukraine crisis. The pipeline was planned to deliver huge amounts of natural gas to stabilize the European energy grid.
Over the past years, government intervention has made fossil energies unattractive and is forcing a shutdown of its 9 remaining nuclear reactors by 2022.
Where will the power come from when the wind doesn’t blow?

Today Holger Steltzner at Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes that the Eon move presents the German government with 2 major problems: “It has to make sure that the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants succeeds, and it must explain where the power will come from when the wind doesn’t blow.”
23 billion euros to subsidize 2 billion euros of renewable power
Steltzner describes a hostile German power market that has been grotesquely distorted by massive government subsidies in wildly fluctuating renewable energy sources. Stelzner writes:
With 23 billion euros annually, the government subsidizes renewable energy that is worth only 2 billion on the market.”
An irresponsible and reckless experiment?
In summary Germany’s wildly executed Energiewende experiment has just gotten a whole lot more interesting: a major gas supply pipeline from Russia has been cancelled, and the future of a large part of Germany’s electric power supply backbone is now in the dark. And if the trend continues, a whole lot more risks ending up in the dark.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA heated exchange has just taken place at Twitter between Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski and some of Germany’s leading climate alarmism politicians and ideologues who are pushing for a fast-track green coup d’état.
The row swirls around a critical opinion piece written by Bojanowski – on the roadmap-for-politicians IPCC final Synthesis Report. The Spiegel piece is titled: “Final IPCC Report: At the IPCC alarm comes before accuracy“. 
In it Bojanowski identifies a number points where the IPCC misleads the public and needlessly sounds the alarms. At Twitter Bojanowski calls these points “gross problems” that “need to be discussed”. 
In summary, the ever inquisitive Spiegel journalist writes that the IPCC final report “should rationally inform of the science  – rather it suppresses central contradictions“. He also adds that “the new synthesis report suppresses important scientific findings“. 
Bojanowski brings up some gross examples of IPCC factual suppression and how the UN body made glaring contradictions. The first concerns the subject of species extinction. In the 2013 IPCC main report, no predictions were made on to what extent species were threatened, demonstrating that too little is known to make reliable forecasts. But the latest synthesis report claims species have already began dying off due to climate change.
Bojanowski also points out that the latest synthesis report writes of numerous species having been forced to relocate because of climate change. But the main 2013 report writes: “There’s very little confidence in the conclusion that already some species may have gone extinct due to climate change.”
Another misleading claim by the new synthesis report is that today’s climate change is happening faster than at any time from natural causes over the last 1 million years – thus stressing out species. But learned-geologist Bojanowski cites the main IPCC report’s real findings:
At the end of the ice age, as the first part of the UN climate report shows, in large parts of the world climate fluctuations of 10°C in 50 years, i.e. 20 times faster than in the 20th century, took place and large climate-caused species extinctions are not documented.”
The Spiegel journalist also writes how the IPCC is not really being truthful with its predictions for the future. In the new synthesis report for policymakers the IPCC warns of a 4°C warming by the end of the century, and that this will be a formidable threat to species. Here the IPCC even asserts “high confidence”.
However, Bojanowski reminds Spiegel readers what the experts wrote in the main IPCC report (translated from the German):
Climate models are unable to illustrate key processes with respect to species development which foremost impact the susceptibility of species with respect to climate change.”

In a nutshell Bojanowski comes down hard on the IPCC report – for blatantly putting alarmism ahead of scientific accuracy.
Some German activists and Green politcians have reacted irritably to Bojanowski’s article. Green Party honcho Dr. Hermann Ott tweeted:
@GYGeorg …sad! Dear@Axel_Bojanowski, we have discussed so often about climate change – for what? @sven_giegold“

 Bojanowski replied (not sure what he means with “twse”):
@GYGeorg@sven_giegold Dear @Hermann_Ott ,IPCC without critique, even if sometimes make mistakes like for example twse the Synthesis Report, would be sad, would it not?
Ott responds:
@Axel_Bojanowski (3) ..and when we destroy confidence in science then the door and gate are open to chaos, see USA @GYGeorg@sven_giegold“
Bojanowski replies:
(1)Dear @Hermann_Ott also science has to earn its trust,gross problems like those in the S’report have to be discussed @sven_giegold“
Looks like the IPCC was caught red-handed playing it fast, loose and alarmist with the science, and now the howls of objection from the warmist ideologues are beginning in earnest.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote about the first part of an analysis (on Germany winter temperatures) by Kowatsch and Kämpfe appearing here at EIKE. Winter temperatures in Germany have been falling for a quarter of a century now. Much to my satisfaction, that post has been widely shared among social media.
Today I’m writing about the second part: What is the primary driver behind Europe’s variability, i.e. what causes periods of cold winters and periods of milder winters? The main drivers, Kowatsch and Kämpfe conclude, are oceanic cycles.
Figure 1 below shows a plot of German winters since 1881. Shown is the temperature lower curve and the number of days with westerly winds (upper curve) – along with their corresponding smoothed curves.

Figure 1: Germany’s mean winter temperature (lower blue curve) follows the course of the frequency of days with mild westerly winds (W, SW and NW, violet upper curve). Both are accompanied by a smoothed curve).
It’s no surprise that the more days a winter has with winds coming from the west (Atlantic), the milder the winters turn out to be. A correlation here does not surprise us. Here the mechanism that drives Europe’s winters is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the pressure difference between southwest Europe (Portugal to the Azores) and northwestern Europe (Iceland).
When the NAO is very positive it means there is a powerful Azores high and a powerful Icelandic low which serve to pump Atlantic air eastwards into Central Europe (Figure 2, right). If the Azores high and the Iceland low are both weak, then cold air from Eastern Europe or Siberia can make its way over across Europe and the winters tend to be much colder (Figure 2, left).

Figure 2: Prevailing weak NAO pattern shown left leads to cold Europe winters. Strong positive NAO pattern shown right leads to mild winters (Source: UKMO).
Next Figure 3 shows the NAO chart for the past winter, which was most of the time was highly positive, meaning many mild westerly winds swept in from the Atlantic and over Europe.

Figure 3: Winter 2014/15 saw an overwhelmingly positive NAO, thus producing a mild winter for Western and Central Europe. 
So what drives the NAO air pressure difference? Kowatsch and Kämpfe have analyzed this and found there is a strong correlation between NAO and the Atlantic Multidecadal Osciallation (AMO). Figure 4 below shows the inverse relationship between the AMO and the winter-time westerly wind frequency over Europe:

google_ad_height = 200;

Figure 4: The higher the AMO value, the less westerly weather that occurs.
Not only does the AMO drive the NAO, but it is also is a major factor driving Arctic sea ice extent. Arctic sea ice extent does not drive the winters over Europe, as some scientists have been hypothesizing over the recent years. Rather it is the AMO that is driving the Arctic sea ice and the European winters as well.
Although good satellite sea ice data records for the Arctic go back only 35 years, one sees a distinct relationship between the AMO and wintertime Arctic sea ice, see Figure 5 below:

Figure 5: As AMO values rise (green curve), sea ice area (blue) reduces significantly.
EIKE adds:

And there are clear indications that this relationship applies over the long-term as well. During the 1930s, i.e. during the last AMO positive phase, large melting of the sea ice and strong melting of the Greenland glaciers were observed.”

And when the severe winters of 2009/10 and 2012/13 caused the proponents of the global warming theory to scramble for an explanation, they concocted and put out the tale that “melting Arctic sea ice was disturbing the large scale circulation and thus favored winter cold at the middle latitudes“.
The scientists claimed that especially the low levels of Arctic sea ice in September were suddenly responsible for causing cold winters. Yet, the following chart shows no relationship at all:

Figure 14: The extent of September Arctic sea ice has no impact whatsoever on winter temperatures over Central Europe (Germany). Arctic sea ice cover in blue; Germany winter temperatures in red. The same is true for other times of the year (autumn ice cover or winter ice cover to winter temperatures show no relationship).
EIKE warns that the climate system is much more complicated than meets the eye: “Still the complicated and yet to be researched relationship between ocean currents, AMO, sea ice and large weather patterns have with a high probability an impact on Europe’s climate and weather, and there exists no easy explanations”. Studies have shown that solar activity also play a role in Europe’s winters.
At the end, Kowatsch and Kämpfe look at the (lack of) success that institute’s and experts have had in forecasting the winter of 2014/15. It shows that the science of forecasting is lacking terribly. Of the 7 forecasts examined, 2 were completely faulty, 3 were poor, and 2 were only about half correct and would not earn a grade any higher than a C -.

"The government’s own advisers have declared themselves shocked that the UK has no proper plans for protecting people from heatwaves, flash flooding and other impacts of the climate crisis. The Committee on Climate Change said the UK’s climate crisis preparations were being run like Dad’s Army and left the population at real risk, adding that funding for programmes to tackle problems resulting from global heating had been cut.  The CCC’s annual progress reports, published on Wednesday, also found that just one of the 25 emissions-cutting policies it said were vital in 2018 had been delivered in full. Lord Deben, who chairs the committee, said ministers could be sued in court if the failure to act continued. Theresa May announced in June that the UK would be the first major economy to set a legally binding target to end climate emissions by 2050. However, the CCC said the targets for 2025 and 2030 were likely to be missed by an even bigger margin than last year. Targets do not themselves reduce emissions, the report says, and new policies were essential to deliver cuts. It said the UK government risked embarrassing itself when, as is likely, it hosts a crucial UN climate summit in 2020. The CCC assessed government plans for adaptation to the climate crisis in 33 priority areas. “There are no areas where government is planning properly,” said Chris Stark, the CCC chief executive. He said it would be prudent to prepare for a 4C rise, a level scientists see as catastrophic. Debden said: “The whole thing is run by the government like a Dad’s Army. We can’t possibly go on with this ramshackle system; it doesn’t begin to face the issues. It is a real threat to the population. “You need to make real changes to protect people here and now from the climate change that we know is happening. We are not even preparing for 2C [rise in global temperature] let alone the position we might be in if the world does not [drive emissions down to zero]”. Lady Brown, who chairs the CCC’s adaptation committee, said the fact its analysis was based on the government’s own assessment of climate risks made the failings “even more shocking”. The CCC said the number of policy officials working directly on adaptation fell from several dozen in 2013, when the first national adaptation plan was published, to a handful for the second publication in 2018. Government funding for services to help regions, businesses and people adapt has ceased, the report says, and ministers have failed to start communicating with the public over the need for changes in behaviour, such as eating less meat and using less water. A government spokesman said: “As the CCC recognises, we are the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions, have cleaned up our power sector [and] cut emissions faster than any G7 country while growing the economy. “We know there is more to do. We’ll set out plans in the coming months to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather including flood protection, tree planting and peatland management.” The CCS’s assessment acknowledges good progress in a few areas, such as phasing out coal burning and planning for flood protection. But its assessment of carbon cutting measures pointed out the government had held back onshore wind farms and should end the sale of petrol and diesel cars soon after 2030, not in 2040 as planned. It said tree planting rates had missed targets every year since they were set in 2013. The one action out of the 25 requested by the CCC for 2018 that was delivered was that a carbon tax on power station emissions continues after Brexit. The UK is already seeing the impacts of climate change, the CCC said, with deadly heatwaves like the one in 2018 now twice as likely as a few decades ago, leaving a fifth of homes and buildings prone to overheating. “It is outrageous that the housebuilders have done absolutely nothing as far as I can see to ready the houses they are building now,” said Deben. Brown said the UK was getting more short, sharp bursts of rain that caused flash flooding, particularly in towns and cities, but urban green space had fallen from 63% in 2001 to 55% in 2018. “That needs to be going up,” she said. “It helps absorb water, cool the urban heat island and gives us better places where our kids can go out and play, which will help with health.” MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs parliament’s business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “The CCC reports show the government has failed dismally to back up its rhetoric with ambitious policies which deliver the cuts in emissions the UK needs to achieve.” Doug Parr of Greenpeace UK said: “This is a truly brutal reality check on the government’s current progress in tackling the climate emergency. The new prime minister really must take the government’s net zero commitment and turn it into something practically meaningful.”"
"There is so much bad news about the climate emergency that it is easy to sink into a heatstruck daze and suppose that we can do nothing to prevent catastrophic global change over the next 50 years. This would be a mistake. There are still things to be done which will diminish future damage and – more hopefully still – undo the effects of some of our past crimes against the environment. Research has just shown that there is far more land in the world on which trees can be planted than anyone had supposed. This matters. There is no doubt that reforestation must form part of any strategy to diminish the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and so avert the kind of temperature rise that will cause a civilisational breakdown as the seas rise and the deserts spread on land. The new estimates show that with a truly heroic effort, it would be possible to plant or allow to regrow enough trees around the world to remove from the atmosphere two-thirds of the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities. The figures involved are boggling: a trillion trees, covering in total an area as large as the US and China combined. The total cost is estimated at $300bn, a figure to make even a Bezos blink. But the prize is almost beyond price. Without the sequestration of carbon the world will bust through 1.5C of warming and head for much worse. Planting trees is by far the least expensive and most practicable way available at present to do this.  It won’t be enough, of course. Important – vital – as these efforts are to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and undo some of the damage we have done in the last century, they will be wholly inadequate without a corresponding effort to stop the production of more greenhouse gases. Here the signs remain extremely gloomy. The time for change was yesterday. A study published in Nature this week shows that the power plants already built, under construction or planned will all by themselves consume enough fossil fuels and emit enough carbon to break the 1.5C barrier and probably the 2C one as well. Any serious attempt to stabilise the climate even at that uncomfortable level must start with a commitment to plan no more power stations that run on fossil fuels, and to lower drastically the number of planned ones that are actually built. When measured against the size of the challenge, even a reforestation plan on this scale does not appear ambitious. But it is, in political and economic terms, especially when measured against the willingness up to now of politicians and consumers to do what they must. The most obvious obstacle is the raging pace of deforestation in the world today, especially in the tropics. Last year was the third worst since proper records from satellite images began in 2002; and unlike the two worse ones, the damage recorded in 2018 was all done directly by humans, rather than by fires. Although the government of Indonesia, previously one of the worst offenders, has managed to reduce the amount of land being lost to palm oil plantations, the real problem lies in Brazil, where the land is cleared, often in a very wasteful way, for soya beans and pasture – both used for meat production – and the populist rightwing Bolsonaro government appears to be deliberately accelerating the pace of forest destruction.  Reforestation and the preservation of existing forests is also a marker of the way in which the green movement is not just about economics. It must also speak to our spiritual sides if it is to mobilise a global coalition. Trees, and still more forests, do not just remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They seem to suck some of the darkness and self-obsession out of the humans in their shade. They remind us that we share the earth with life forms older than we can imagine and stranger than we can ever understand, and that we’re bound to them in webs of mutual interdependence. Preserving and restoring the great forests would be worth doing for itself even if it had no economic use. But the climate emergency means that this plan is also a precondition if the next century is to have much more than a subsistence economy."

Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and his WBGU have just released their latest Special Report: Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement. The 126-page report is the 9th of its kind since the first one was published in 1995.

Professor Schellnhuber telling German Parliamentarians to act as he and his WBGU recommend, or else sea levels will rise 230 feet. Photo cropped from bundestag.de.
Totalitarian designs
The latest Special Report is shrill and the underlying message is: Time is running out and unless policymakers do as us German scientists say, the world will end in catastrophe. The Special Report suggests that the normal democratic processes are failing and that governments must start heeding the instructions of the elite German group of Potsdam scientists. Schellnhuber, a person who openly admits having no background in sociology, insists that he and his fellow WBGU scientists be given the helm in all decision matters concerning climate policy.
Schellnhuber, the WBGU Chairman and Director of the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), once recommended a watering down of democracy and more policy-making power being placed in the hands of far-sighted “experts”.
4 recommendations
The alarmist, climate doomsday obsessed site Klimaretter here writes that Hans Joachim Schellnhuber not long ago appeared before German Parliamentarians to present the “impending climate catastrophe” up close and “to explain the four recommendations of the Council”.
The climate alarmist Klimaretter gives their four recommendations:
First recommendation, Klimaretter writes:
First the expertise of climate science must be securely anchored in the political process of climate action. Also when, as Schellnhuber emphasizes, policy making and science are of two different realms, science is essential for keeping the world climate policy on course: ‘Without a compass, you cannot steer a ship.'”

Here we see Schellnhuber & Co. are not content with simply supplying governments with data, but they also insist on being the ones guiding future policy for global society. But how can we know that their science is not being tainted by their political convictions? We can’t. This is why it is so dangerous to put so much into the hands of such a tiny group…who happen to be the most alarmist at that.
The second recommendation, Klimaretter writes:
Secondly there should be the right for countries to file climate protection lawsuits in constitutional courts in order to increase the societal pressure on the governments. A strong involvement by the civil society is decisive in pushing climate protection forward. The ‘global societal contract for climate protection’ does not only manifest itself in demonstrations such as the recent one in New York, but also in the strengthening of the Divestment Movement.
Not only do the WBGU scientists want to be the ones running planetary policymaking, but they want it institutionalized.
Third recommendation:
Thirdly the two-degrees Celsius target has to be established as international law because only by limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius can the consequences for the societies in many countries be managed. A continued business-as-usual CO2 emission would not only lead to a melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, but also of the East Antarctic. That would bring about a sea level rise of 70 meters.”
Here the scientists, who to many readers, by now are surely beginning to appear as the quintessential mad scientists, are claiming that sea levels will rise and drown large parts of the planet if their requests do not become binding international law. Hard to be believe they’ve made it this far.
Fourth recommendation
Schellnhuber warns that time is running out and is calling for “flat zero” global carbon emissions already by the year 2070 in order to reach the 2°C target. “At the latest by 2030 Co2 emissions must reach their peak and start downward.”
That demand, and their seemingly complete unawareness of the 18-year pause and growing scientific literature showing only moderate CO2 sensitivity, suggests that the WBGU are very remote from reality.
Since the WBGU was established in the early 1990s, they’ve published 9 lengthy special reports and 14 even lengthier flagship reports…all pushing for radical societal transformation. Seems the Potsdam scientists are more preoccupied with being the architects of social adventurism than serious scientists objectively looking at the recent data and findings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe descriptions of urban warming dwell on the heating of the air by the local infrastructure. There is more to it than simple conduction to the air mass from warmed surfaces.
In the far infrared, where the peak radiation wavelength is determined by the temperature, much of the energy from warmed surfaces is absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere within a meter or so. These gases then re-radiate to any other nearby surfaces or gases further away and conduct by collisions with other air molecules to heat the air. There are also windows in the infrared spectrum that let warm surfaces radiate directly to other surfaces. Thus for a temperature measuring instrument, the temperature measured is a combination of the air temperature conducted to the thermometer by air flowing past it and IR heating from nearby surfaces. This is why in the polar regions when measuring very low temperatures, a person approaching the thermometer will raise the temperature reading.
This second source of increased temperature causes “urban warming” even where the location is strictly rural. A measuring station at an isolated research station or farm can have “urban warming” when the thermometer is in close proximity to just one heated building.

Figure 1 is a visible and FLIR IR image of the MMTS station at the Perry, Oklahoma Volunteer Fire Department. The image is from an article by Anthony Watts here, used by permission.
Painting the MMTS white only reduces direct heating by sunlight at visible wavelengths. In the long wavelength IR, any paint, black, white, or any other color, has the same emissivity, more than 0.9, and will absorb IR equally well. In Figure 1, the west-facing uninsulated door is very warm compared to the north-facing wall. It is being heated both by the sun and the building interior. The MMTS is slightly warmer (perhaps 2 or 3 degrees) than the mounting pipe. The pipe is unpainted, somewhat shiny, with a lower emissivity, reflecting more of the IR. Thus it appears black, where the MMTS is a warmer dark purple.
Pierre has posted on a German study of the temperature shifts with the installation of electronic thermometers here. This shift is due to the different way a glass thermometer in a wooden shelter responds to IR in the vicinity and the way a compact modern MMTS responds. There is also the issue of the need for cabling that leads to a distance bias to the nearest building.
Every weather station should be checked for IR emissions in the “view-shed”, the surrounding surfaces and buildings. This should be done at several hours of the day, to catch sunlight warming all the surfaces, and internal building heating variations.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt EIKE distinguished German physicist and climate expert Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke writes how we are witnessing a notable paradigm shift in climate research today: the resurrection of medieval scholasticism. In plain language: the science of the Dark Ages.

German climate physicist Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke says today’s climate science paradigm has shifted to a “medieval scholasticism” and is a real threat to science and society as a whole. Photo: EIKE. 
Scholasticism dominated medieval western Europe and was based on the writings of the Church Fathers, with strict adherence to traditional doctrines. To say the least, it was effective in stifling enlightenment.
The breakthrough from this crusty, dogmatic approach, Lüdecke writes, came with Galileo, who gave highest priority to systematic and numerical measurement, which today remains the standard method of science. With Galileo’s approach hypotheses or theories that are not confirmed by measurements get discarded and are no longer pursued. The method led to giant leaps and bounds in technology, medicine and science, from which today humanity is benefitting immensely.
Richard Richard Feynman summarized Galileo’s approach beautifully, saying that if a hypothesis disagrees with observations, then it’s wrong.
This fundamental approach, the Lüdecke writes, is no longer in use in climate science and, what is worse, the old medieval scholastic method is even now dangerously invading other fields of science.
According to Lüdecke, the key question today: Is the climate change witnessed since 1850 unusual, and thus due to man, or is it well within the range of natural variability the planet has seen throughout its history? The German physicist says a hypothesis’s burden of proof is clearly not on its skeptics, but on the one proposing the hypothesis. He writes:
It is senseless to favor a certain hypothesis – senseless according to our still valid scientific paradigm – when no confirming measured data can be shown to support it. One can occupy himself with a hypothesis, put it at the center of his research, and even have complete faith in it. However one cannot use it as a basis for taking rational action without first having confirmed measurements. In summary: If we cannot observe any unusual climate activity since 1850 compared to the times before that, then we have no choice but to assume natural climate change.”
In order to assume there has been “unusual activity”, Lüdecke says, it would be necessary to have comprehensive data about the oceans before 1850. This doesn’t exist, and so a comparison is not possible. Lüdecke reminds: “It is mandatory to prove that the climate data since 1850 are indeed unusual when compared to the period before that.” A comparison is already very difficult to do with atmospheric temperatures. With ocean data: “Who today can tell us what temperature distributions the oceans had back during the Medieval Warm Period?” Lüdecke writes Assuming that today is unusual without being able to compare it to anything from the past is not science at all, he tells us.

When it comes to extreme weather events, there are plenty of paintings and recorded accounts showing that they too existed earlier on, and that today’s events are nothing new, Lüdecke writes. Even the IPCC has reached that conclusion. The German climatologist puts the assumptions of more future extreme weather events in the category of “crystal balls” and not modern science.
Prof. Lüdecke also blasts the over-emphasis on climate models, writing that “the models fail already for the past” and that they cannot even predict the next El Nino correctly or the missing tropospheric hot spot. He writes:
Using the R. Feynman yardstick these climate models are not only inaccurate or a bit false; they are totally false. […] Anyone selling climate forecasts from climate models as scientific is using a medieval paradigm. He is conducting moral sciences instead of physics.” 
Ouch. Lüdecke also then calls the alliance between the IPCC and policymaking “dubious” and one that was set up with the target of reaching an already predetermined result. He calls the manner in which policymaking is moving ahead “embellished nonsense”.
In his conclusion the German professor advises those engaged in a discussion with alarmists, or listening to a presenation by an alarmist, to not go easy on them. There are three points, he advises:
1. The modern science paradigm of priority on measurement over theoretical model remains valid. The climate alarmist must prove that his hypothsies is confirmed by observations and measurements. It is not up to you to prove his hypothesis is false.
2. When the climate alarmists “starts beating around the bush” insists he name a peer-reviewed paper that proves, based on measurements, that the climate change since 1850 is unprecedented compared to earlier times (there isn’t any).
3. Don’t let yourself be drawn into the discussion over climate models. That the models are unable to describe the climate development means they are false, as to point no. 1.”
The distinguished professor ends by blasting climate policymakers, warning they are bordering on “criminal activity” in their conscious misuse of science to formulate policy:
We are allowing hundreds of thousands of people in the poorest developing countries to starve in order to be able to finance climate protection and energy transformation that are not based on today’s valid science paradigm. That is not only idiotic, but also borders on criminal activity by the politically responsible persons.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn Empirical Review of Recent Trends in the Greenhouse Effect
By Robin Pittwood, Kiwi Thinker
Abstract
The core of the human caused global warming proposition is that an increasing level of greenhouse gases acts to reduce heat loss from the planet making the atmosphere here warmer. The amount of warming anticipated by the IPCC models is from about one to several degrees C for a doubling of CO2 concentration.
But a conundrum has arisen lately:  While CO2 has continued rise significantly the temperature has not.  There has been no global warming since about 1997. Scientists on both sides of the debate have noticed this and have offered something like 55 explanations as to why this could be so. Some of those explanations lock into the dogma built into the IPCC models, taking for certain that the greenhouse effect is increasing, but because there is no atmospheric temperature rise, they then have to explain the retained heat is somewhere else.
Is the greenhouse effect occurring as the IPCC models propose?
This study analysed two important factors directly associated with the greenhouse effect, atmospheric temperature and outgoing radiation and finds that outgoing radiation has not declined. The missing heat has gone back to space as usual.  But more importantly the (lack of a) trend observed in an empirical derivation of the Stefan Boltzmann relative emissivity factor directly contradicts the greenhouse theory built into the IPCC models.
Article
Regular readers at any of the main climate change blogs will be aware that since about 1997 there has been nearly no global temperature rise. And they will know too, that this is despite atmospheric CO2 concentration continuing to rise. To date there are some 55 ideas to explain this slowdown in global warming. Some of the ‘explanations’ presume the so-called ‘greenhouse effect’ must still be increasing as the IPCC models calculate; it’s just that the heat has been hidden elsewhere, maybe deep in the ocean.
This study, based on 34 years of satellite data; outgoing long-wave infrared radiation (OLWIR) and temperature, demonstrates otherwise.
I used three data sets, OLWIR from NOAA, and the average of both UAH and RSS for global temperature.
I obtained monthly average OLWIR (W/m2) for each 2.5 degree latitude by 2.5 degree longitude area of the globe. After converting the netCDF files to Excel, I scaled each 2.5*2.5 area’s OLWIR to account for the varying size of its area, resulting in a global average OLWIR.  (There was some missing data mid 1994 to early 1995. I populated this by a linear interpolation).  The resulting annual average OLWIR is shown in the graph below for the years 1979 to 2012. A linear regression fit shows a generally increasing trend in OLWIR over this period.

The temperature data is also plotted on the graph below. A linear regression fit shows a generally increasing trend for the years 1979 to 2012.
The relationship between temperature and emitted radiation follows a universal law of physics, Stefan Boltzmann’s law states the emitted radiation is the product of the fourth power of absolute temperature and an emissivity factor. A reduction in the emissivity factor means less outgoing radiation for a given temperature.  That would indicate a stronger greenhouse effect.  An increase in the emissivity factor means more outgoing radiation for a given temperature.  That would indicate a more transparent atmosphere.  The study derived earth’s emissivity factor for each of the 34 years and the results displayed.

Using an average global temperature of 287 Kelvin added to the temperature anomaly, the relative emissivity has been derived for each year using the formula:
j / (k*T^4)
where j is OLWIR, k is the Stefan Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
If the greenhouse effect was increasing, relative emissivity should be declining. A quick look at the graphs shows clearly this is not the case.

Our planet’s relative emissivity has been flat-lining, despite increasing CO2 concentration over the study period. The derived emissivity factor, being basically constant, directly contradicts all of the IPCC models. No increased greenhouse effect is observed.
Findings:
The two primary findings of this empirical study are:


Outgoing radiation has not declined over this period as expected by IPCC models. The missing heat has gone back to space – as usual and as per Stefan Boltzmann’s law, via OLWIR, and,
The increasing greenhouse effect expected by IPCC models, has not exposed itself. There has been no increased greenhouse effect over this period. [A closer inspection of the relative emissivity trend shows the atmosphere is even becoming a little more transparent – though little should be made of this given the variability of the data].


Conclusion:
The core of the human caused global warming proposition is that an increasing level of greenhouse gases acts to reduce heat loss from the planet making the atmosphere here warmer. But is the greenhouse effect occurring as the IPCC models propose? This study analysed two important factors directly associated with the greenhouse effect, atmospheric temperature and outgoing radiation and finds that outgoing radiation has not declined. The missing heat has gone back to space as usual.
But more importantly the (lack of a) trend observed in an empirical derivation of the Stefan Boltzmann relative emissivity factor directly contradicts the greenhouse theory built into the IPCC models.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger of the German climate blog Science Skeptical here has an analysis of Germany’s electrical power cost development since its renewable energy feed-in act was enacted in 2000. Germany’s Feed-in Act, the so-called EEG Gesetz, requires power companies to buy at exorbitant rates all renewable energies produced. Result: sky-rocketing prices.
I’ve shortened the text somewhat while translating.
===================================
Germany’s electricity price just behind leader Denmark in the EU: Since the introduction of its Feed-in Act in 2000, the electricity price has more than doubled!
 By Michael Krüger
 (Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Since the EEG renewable Feed-in Act took effect in 2000, it has been promised by green energy proponents time and again that the power price would fall in Germany. So what does the reality look like today? On this subject I have found the news from the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency) on the latest power prices in the daily media.

The first chart above is a comparison of the per kilowatt-hour price of power for all EU countries. Germany (Deutschland) now has the second highest electricity prices after Denmark. The second chart shows the per kilowatt-hour feed-in surcharge levied on consumers. The final chart shows the cost of one kilowatt-hour of electricity households must pay – currently at 29.13 cents per kilowatt-hour.
In 2000, when the Feed-in Act was introduced, Germans paid only 13.94 cents per kilowatt-hour, which at the time had hardly changed since German reunification in 1991. After the liberalization of the power market in 1998, the price of power even dropped some. Today, in 2014, the price is now 29.21 cents per kilowatt-hour, i.e. it has more than doubled in 14 years. The cost-driver is the EEG Feed-in Act surcharge, which has risen from 0.41 cents in 2003 to 6.24 cents today. It represents 22% of the cost of a kilowatt-hour.
Conventional power plants inefficient in standby mode
Because of the expansion of renewable energies and because they must be bought first by the power companies, the conventional power plants no longer operate at full-capacity. If the wind blows briskly and the sun is shining, then the conventional power plants must reduce their production. And when the wind dies down and the sun doesn’t shine, then the conventional power production must ramp up again. As a result the capacity utilization and the output of the conventional power plants is substantially reduced and generation becomes inefficient and more costly. A businessman who is only allowed to sell when the weather is bad of course cannot earn anything and would soon go bankrupt. The very same is true today with conventional power in Germany. 
Moreover, the situation is getting worse as renewable energy continues to expand. Conventional power plants have since become so uneconomical that power plant operators prefer not to build any new ones and to switch off the old ones. New plants are no longer being planned and old power plants are being left on because the federal government has made it illegal to shut them down in attempt to keep the supply intact. Naturally all the added costs ultimately have to be borne by the power consumer.

Windparks to nowhere
Renewable energy producers are paid compensation to the full amount – even when their power is unneeded and cannot be fed into the grid because no line is available to feed the power into the grid. This is the case because grid expansion is progressing too slowly to keep up with the expansion of renewable energies. There exists windparks for example, that are located away from any grid feed-in point and are unable to feed in the power. However, the consumer still has to pay for the power they never feed in. Other costs that need to be passed on to the consumer are the expansion of the power grid, which is necessary for transmitting the renewable energy, for example to bring the wind power produced at the North Sea to southern Germany and to deliver solar energy produced in the south to northern Germany.
Another cost driver is the Emissions Certificates Trading introduced for CO2 in 2005. Currently CO2 emission certificates cost about 5 euros per tonne, but were as high as 30 euros. These were costs that naturally got passed on to the consumer. German environmental activist group BUND announced with glee that expected rising costs of emissions trading certificates would add another 2-4 ct/kwh. Super.
Cost of green energies: social and environmental blight
Summary: The points listed above have resulted in Germany’s electricity prices more than doubling since 2000. An end to the rising price spiral is nowhere sight despite more promises from the renewable energy proponents. Power consumers in Germany now have to pay almost twice as much as the consumers in neighboring France (which relies heavily on nuclear power) and more than double than consumers in the USA. The EEG renewable energy Feed-in Act does not decrease the prices, rather it causes them to skyrocket. It is only a question of time as to how long Germany can keep this up.
Proponents of renewable energy often like pointing to the social costs of conventional energy, but they ignore the social costs of renewable energies, which take up lots of natural space, crowd out wildlife and litter the landscape. Then there are the economic costs and social damage that high power costs inflict. Production and jobs move to foreign countries where energy and labor are cheaper.
Electricity is increasingly becoming a luxury
Consumers are seeing less money in their wallets, which in turn impacts buying power. Electricity is increasingly becoming a luxury, and energy poverty is spreading. The number of consumers getting their power shut off is on the rise in Germany. Just in 2011 in Germany, 6 million households (15% of all German households in Germany) were threatened with a power cut-off. The energy supply cut-off to 1 million households had already taken place. The power was turned off for 300,000 households. The trend is upwards.
The blame of course for all the misery gets placed on the evil power companies, grid operators, and the former conservative-free democrat government of the previous years.

"Lydia Lunch turned 60 this year, but age has done little to dim this counterculture icon’s lust for life. Decades after her start as the nihilist 16-year-old frontwoman of 1970s no-wave band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, the New York-born “apocalyptician” is a revered veteran of the US underground: a writer, spoken-word performer, musician, actor and artist. Lunch’s style is raw and incendiary, all sex and death and taboo-busting feminist rage. And in 2019, the sexagenarian is as unapologetic and active as ever – still writing, touring, collaborating and performing. Lunch is in Colchester when we speak, luxuriating in a “fabulous cottage-type hotel” conveniently situated near the cultural centre where she’s set to play that night with her band, Big Sexy Noise. On the stage and the page, she’s a formidable presence – seducing, goading and tongue-lashing her audience. In conversation, via Skype, she’s surprisingly jovial: affable, accommodating, disarmingly witty, a potty-mouthed doyenne dealing out double-entendres. Is she misunderstood? “Oh, chronically! But I get off on it. I’m not a miserable person, I just deal in miserable subjects.”  The last time the Guardian spoke with Lunch, in 2015, she was scouting around for a home for her archive, an honour that’s since gone to New York University. “They’re opening a new exhibition space next year and I think they’re gonna launch it with my archives, which is great.” It’s a fitting location: although she left for good in 1990, and doesn’t consider it home (“even when I lived there”), New York informed much of who Lunch became, and the art she’s made since. Lunch’s work is defiant, thrilling and unflinching. Her latest release, So Real It Hurts, is just so: an anthology of new and established writings that include everything from violent feminist revenge fantasies to diatribes on pollution and politics (and yes, Trump) in the Anthropocene epoch. They detail deviant delights, heroes sung (Hubert Selby Jr) and unsung (Herbert Huncke) alike. They offer alternative historical testimony documented in killer style: pre-gentrification New York, (the “devil’s litterbox”); the no-wave scene (“a collective bowel-cleansing caterwaul … a mad collective of death-defiant miscreants”); and the start of the race riots of 1967, witnessed first-hand by an eight-year-old Lydia when her hometown – which became the centre of the chaos – erupted into violence, with a baseball-bat carrying hoard “stampeding directly in front of my house”. The anthology, she tells me, “was rejected by 26 American publishers – and I’m quite happy to say that. I wanted that stamped on the front cover, actually.” She eventually found a publisher, Seven Stories, that appreciates her calling as a “stubborn, independent town-crier”. “I asked them, ‘Why do you want to publish this book?’ And one of them said, ‘Because I laughed at every chapter.’ Finally! Someone gets it. Yes! I mean, this [life] shit is deadly serious, so lets have a party and celebrate the fact that we’re still alive in spite of this nightmare. That’s what my whole career has been about.” Opening the anthology is an introduction by the late celebrity chef and travel writer Anthony Bourdain. Were they friends? “We knew of each other. He’d read something I’d written for a photobook of [Bourdain’s partner] Asia Argento. And we’d met when he did his Lower East Side special. One of the questions I asked him was, ‘How did you do it?’ How did he go from being a heroin addict scumbag cook to [a sober and successful celebrity]? He said, ‘It was a total fluke.’ I just think that’s great. Because some people are born ambitious and they plan for success; other people just do what they do, and wherever it goes is where they get.” Like Bourdain, Lunch found community through food as a young runaway. As legend tells it, the young hellion earned her nom de plume after gaining renown as both an expert food thief and an on-the-fly chef, transforming produce she’d filched into nourishing lunches for fellow punks such as Dead Boys. In 2012 she released a cookbook, The Need to Feed, telling Vice: “Cooking is one of the most intimate things this side of sex – cooking leads to good sex. You are touching something that someone else is digesting. Your DNA is on the food they eat. It’s a form of impregnation – which is basically what my entire artistic motive is, anyway.” Does she still enjoy cooking? “I do. It’s very witchy. But you’ve gotta be careful about where your food comes from – especially in the UK and the States – because we end up consuming so much poison.” Lunch knows a thing or two about toxins. Before she was old enough to pick her own poisons, Lunch grew up on one of America’s Superfund sites: land contaminated by life-endangering hazardous waste. At last count, says Lunch, there are 39,000 hazardous sites spread across America. So Real It Hurts points the finger at big conglomerates and the US Department of Justice. But this isn’t a new theme for Lunch; she’s been speaking out about environmental justice since her early20s. “I think those of us doing spoken word when I got started, under Reagan and Thatcher – John Cooper Clarke, Exene Cervenka, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra – I think we comprehended more than we knew. I go back to some of the speeches I wrote in 84, and I’m like, yup, I could do that one tonight.” She’s cheered by today’s climate activists, citing Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion (“big fan”), but is also incredulous at current political inaction. “I mean it’s just ridiculous that we’re still having this conversation. There were 379 tornados in 13 days in America last month. In India? Drought. China? Flooding. I was in Mexico City a month ago; they have the worst air pollution in decades. You can’t get away from it. There’ll be more plastic in the ocean than fish soon. I mean, wake the fuck up.” I tell her that a recent investigation has revealed that British people are ingesting a credit-card-sized amount of plastic every week thanks to microplastics in our air, food and water supplies. “If only we could shit those credit cards out and use ’em at the ATM, eh?” Lunch’s sense of humour is dark, delightful and revelatory. In the chapter Motherhood: It’s Not Compulsory, we meet Lunch the baby whisperer, an intentionally childless hellraiser with an almost supernatural ability to soothe other people’s fractious children. In Assume the Position, she divulges her “decades-long” kink for cops, detailing her various illicit and comic encounters with the long arm of the law. And in Detox, we find Lunch in self-help guru mode, encouraging us to indulge in regular masturbation and ditch toxic household cleaning products for DIY vinegar concoctions: “With all the money you save from not making multinationals richer, you could get a massage once a month for the rest of your life! Or, start saving for your own funeral. It might come sooner than you think.” Many of us – Lunch included – are surprised she’s still around given her propensity for extreme living. In the chapter Drunk on Fuck, she writes of reaching a point where her libido and the need “…to possess, to consume…” had reached danger point, prompting a long bout of celibacy. Is she dating again now? Does she still enjoy lovers? “Is that an invitation?” she parries mischievously. Lunch has described herself in previous years as a self-confessed adrenaline junkie, obsessed by “death’s black magnetism”. She’s survived childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence, dated various unhinged lovers (from a suspected psychopath to an ex-alcoholic who went on to murder his wife), escaped deranged stalkers and haunted the same streets as such serial killers as Richard Ramirez. “I didn’t think I’d live this long either, it wasn’t my goal actually, but I’m not gonna resist it [life] either. I’m having too much fun. I’m too stubborn to die, too much to do still.” Would she change anything, if she could go back? “God, no. Not a lick of it. And if she could go back and talk to her 16-year-old self? “I’d say, ‘Keep going, kid; you’re on the right track.’” She remains a cult figure, despite collaborations with the likes of Sonic Youth and Nick Cave. But a critical reappraisal of Lunch’s work is overdue; her “varied and hairied” career is the subject of an upcoming documentary by long-time friend and collaborator, Beth B. Besides, says Lunch, looking for evidence of her legacy in “the usual, convenient places, like music” may well be folly in 2019. “Maybe today’s counterculture exists elsewhere, in architecture, science, medicine.” What makes Lunch happy these days? “Laughing after I’ve cried. I think my rebellion – as I’ve said for years – has always been and will always be pleasure. It’s in talking, in sharing conversation with others; it’s in laughter; it’s in stretching both middle fingers up into the air and saying, ‘Still here, motherfucker’. Yeah.” • So Real It Hurts is out now, published by Seven Stories.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s early November and now is a good time to look at some of this year’s global crop harvest results. Let’s recall that global warming models projected poor harvests and hunger in the future due to droughts (and floods).
But that is hardly the case…at least certainly for this year. And recall how Joe Bastardi last spring projected a “Garden of Eden” harvest for the US Great Plains. Looks like he was right. The story is similar many places worldwide, and not just the US.
10-foot corn
For example Bloomberg here reports of a record US corn harvest in 2014, writing:
From Ohio to Nebraska, thousands of field inspections this week during the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour show corn output in the U.S., the world’s top producer, will be 0.4 percent above the government’s estimate. Months of timely rains and mild weather created ideal growing conditions, leaving ears with more kernels than normal on 10-foot (3-meter) corn stalks and more seed pods on dark, green soy plants.”
All-time high of 3.631 billion bushels of soybean
Bloomberg also writes here that the US production of soybean “will jump 10 percent this year to an all-time high of 3.631 billion bushels, and inventories before the 2015 harvest will be double a year earlier.”
In Europe the story is the similar. Last May the online marktkompass here already wrote of record wheat harvests:
In all regions of Central and Eastern Europe the weather for growth was close to being optimal and the yield potential has drastically improved.”
“All-time records” in Europe
In Germany’s agricultural state of Mecklenburg West-Pomerania, corn and barley reached record harvests. The online bauwesta reports that both winter and summer barley harvests set all-time records. Overall across Europe Crop Site reports this year’s cereal harvest “has generally been strong in Europe and Ukraine“.
Doom and gloom media silent on bumper crop yields
Moreover, numerous analysts report of falling grain and commodity prices. All of this, of course, is great news for consumers and a planet that still has close to a billion people who do not get enough to eat. Yet the good news is generally not getting reported by the doom-and-gloom obsessed media.
“Bounty of wheat, barley and oats”

Almost every country one looks at in Europe, one is finding record bumper crops this year. The usually gloom-obsessed UK Guardian also reported in September on UK 2014 harvests:
Long sunny spells after a mild winter and early spring delivers a bounty of wheat, barley and oats. […] 2014 could be the biggest yield ever for wheat when the final data is released in October.”
If climate change is supposed to be resulting in poor harvests, higher food prices and acute hunger for the poor, as many experts have warned incessantly, then the opposite must mean that climate change is not happening at all, or that it is having a profoundly beneficial effect for man instead.
Glut of apples
The Guardian also reports of bumper apple harvests and that “growers still face losses due to glut of apples and supermarket price wars.” The Guardian adds, “A cold winter gave the trees a good rest, then plenty of rain – especially in August – helped plump up the fruit, and then a dry September allowed the picking to get started early.”
If anything, all the bumper crops are leading to only one single food crisis: the rock bottom prices farmers are getting for their crops!
“bumper world harvest this year”
thompsonslimited.com here reports that the bumper-crop low-price crisis has also not spared Canada for almost everything from apples to zucchini. It writes that the “world commodity prices are worryingly low for arable farmers following a bumper world harvest this year.”
Russia “in awash in grain”
www.martellcropprojections.com here writes that Russia “is awash in grain from a bumper harvest in the growing season just ended.  The 2014 grain harvest increased to 105 million tonnes threatening to break a record.”
The Crop Site also reports of record rice production in Bangladesh, and bumper maize harvests in Pakistan. Even Scotland’s 2014 cereal harvest “is estimated to be the largest in 20 years, with favourable conditions expected to produce more than three million tonnes of cereals.”
So, if you are not moping about all the good news on this year’s global harvest, and failed predictions of catastrophe, and wish instead to celebrate the good news with glasses of cheer, the wine-searcher here reports that France is “looking forward to a bigger and better wine harvest“. Indeed all the natural ingredients needed for fermenting or brewing your favorite spirit appear to be in bountiful supply this year.
Visions of Ehrlichian-style widespread crop failures and mass starvations postponed yet again. And they show absolutely no signs of ever materializing any time soon.
In fact one could easily argue that the world is better fed today than at any time in human history. We can in part thank higher CO2 concentrations and warmer climate for that.

================================
Why there is global warming
by Harold Faulkner
People in the USA are being told by the U.S. government and media that global warming is man-made. If that is true, how can the government and media explain the high temperatures the Earth has experienced in past years when there were far fewer people?
Let us look back in the world’s history: for example, between roughly 900 AD and 1350 AD the temperatures were much higher than now. And, back then there were fewer people, no cars, no electric utilities, and no factories, etc. So what caused the Earth’s heat? Could it be a natural occurrence? The temperature graph shows the temperatures of the Earth before Christ to 2040.

In the book THE DISCOVERERS published in February 1985 by Daniel J. Boorstin, beginning in chapter 28, it goes into detail about Eric the Red, the father of Lief Ericsson, and how he discovered an island covered in green grass.
In approximately 983 AD, Eric the Red committed murder, and was banished from Iceland for three years. Eric the Red sailed 500 miles west from Iceland and discovered an island covered in GREEN grass, which he named Greenland. Greenland reminded Eric the Red of his native Norway because of the grass, game animals, and a sea full of fish. Even the air provided a harvest of birds. Eric the Red and his crew started laying out sites for farms and homesteads, as there was no sign of earlier human habitation.
When his banishment expired, Eric the Red returned to congested Iceland to gather Viking settlers. In 986, Eric the Red set sail with an emigrant fleet of twenty-five ships carrying men, women, and domestic animals. Unfortunately, only fourteen ships survived the stormy passage, which carried about four-hundred-fifty immigrants plus the farm animals. The immigrants settled on the southern-west tip and up the western coast of Greenland.
After the year 1200 AD, the Earth’s and Greenland’s climate grew colder; ice started building up on the southern tip of Greenland. Before the end of 1300AD, the Viking settlements were just a memory. You can find the above by searching Google. One link is: www.greenland.com/en/about-greenland/erik-den-roede.aspx. 
The following quote you can also read about why there is global warming. This is from the book EINSTEIN’S UNIVERSE, Page 63, written by Nigel Calder in 1972, and updated in 1982:
The reckoning of planetary motions is a venerable science. Nowadays it tells us, for example, how gravity causes the ice to advance or retreat on the Earth during the ice ages. The gravity of the Moon and (to a lesser extent) of the Sun makes the Earth’s axis swivel around like a tilted spinning top. Other planets of the Solar System, especially Jupiter, Mars and Venus, influence the Earth’s tilt and the shape of its orbit, in a more-or-less cyclic fashion, with significant effects on the intensity of sunshine falling on different regions of the Earth during the various seasons. Every so often a fortunate attitude and orbit of the Earth combine to drench the ice sheets in sunshine as at the end of the most recent ice age, about ten thousand years ago. But now our relatively benign interglacial is coming to an end, as gravity continues to toy with our planet.”

The above points out that the universe is too huge and the earth is too small for the Earth’s population to have any effect on the earth’s temperature. The earth’s temperature is a function of the sun’s temperature and the effects from the many massive planets in the universe, i.e.:
The gravity of the Moon and (to a lesser extent) of the Sun makes the Earth’s axis swivel around like a tilted spinning top. Other planets of the solar system, especially Jupiter, Mars and Venus, influence the Earth’s tilt and the shape of its orbit, in a more-or-less cyclic fashion, with significant effects on the intensity of sunshine falling on different regions of the Earth during the various seasons.”
Read below about carbon dioxide, which we need in order to exist. You can find the article below at: www.geocraft.com/ice_ages.html.
FUN FACTS about CARBON DIOXIDE
– Of the 186 billion tons of carbon from CO2 that enter the Earth’s atmosphere each year from all sources, only 6 billion tons are from human activity. Approximately 90 billion tons come from biologic activity in earth’s oceans and another 90 billion tons from such sources as volcanoes and decaying land plants.
– At 380 parts per million CO2 is a minor constituent of the Earth’s atmosphere–less than 4/100ths of 1% of all gases present. Compared to former geologic times, the Earth’s current atmosphere is CO2-impoverished.
– CO2 is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. Plants absorb CO2 and emit oxygen as a waste product. Humans and animals breathe oxygen and emit CO2 as a waste product. Carbon dioxide is a nutrient, not a pollutant, and all life– plants and animals alike– benefit from more of it. All life on Earth is carbon-based and CO2 is an essential ingredient. When plant-growers want to stimulate plant growth, they introduce more carbon dioxide.
– CO2 that goes into the atmosphere does not stay there, but continuously recycled by terrestrial plant life and earth’s oceans– the great retirement home for most terrestrial carbon dioxide.
– If we are in a global warming crisis today, even the most aggressive and costly proposals for limiting industrial carbon dioxide emissions and all other government proposals and taxes would have a negligible effect on global climate!
The government is lying, trying to use global warming to limit, and tax its citizens through “cap and trade” and other tax schemes for the government’s benefit. We, the people, cannot allow this to happen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA recent publication in Nature purported it had finally detected the radiative forcing of increasing atmospheric CO2.
German physical chemist Dr. Siegfried Dittrich slams the media’s assertions of proof that CO2 was guilty of the warming, claiming they are faulty and that they were passed on uncritically by German news weekly FOCUS ONLINE. Here’s the translation:
==================================
Climate Warming From Carbon Dioxide?
By Dr. Siegfried Dittrich, on the DPA German News Agency release appearing at Focus-Online 27 February 2015: “Climate warming through carbon dioxide: The proof: CO2 is indeed guilty of the greenhouse effect“.
‘The real guilt by CO2 for the greenhouse gas effect is finally proven.’ This was the subheading of a DPA release appearing at FOCUS Online on 27 February.
Later in the text it is written: ‘For the first time we are seeing the enhancement of the greenhouse effect in nature’, and at the Hamburg-based Max Planck Institute for Meteorology it was gleefully added that finally also the magnitude of the anthropogenic impact has become visible.
It all goes back to the latest surface radiation measurements recently published in an essay in Nature (details here and here). However no one seems to have noticed that the measurements actually showed the exact opposite of what is claimed to have been proven above, namely nothing other than what serious climate critics have always been saying about anthropogenic greenhouse effect.

The number for the increase in CO2-dependent back radiation given by Nature of 0.2 watt/m2 per decade is indeed in reality nothing more than trifle. Why would the earth be shocked when 1367 watts per square meter strikes the surface at noon along the equator? The ever-changing deviations from this so-called solar constant mean value are in fact considerably greater than the above given 0.2 watts/m2.
According to the IPCC, the surface radiative forcing increase in the event of a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration is exactly 3.7 Watt/m2, a figure that has been independently confirmed on multiple occasions. Over the last decade the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased some 20 parts per million. Currently it stands at about 400 ppm. Here any undergraduate student is able to compute that the resulting surface radiative forcing increase is approximately 0.2 watt/m2, which has been confirmed by the above mentioned measurements.
Also the resulting global temperature increase can be computed using one of the IPCC equations, which also can be derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law.
In Nature it is expressly remarked that the measured difference in surface radiative forcing of 0.2 watt/m2 is solely for cloud-free zones on earth. With an average 40% cloud cover and a 30% overlap between the present water vapor and CO2 absorption spectrum, the above calculated temperature value gets reduced from 0.06°C to 0.03°C. Here in reality we are talking about an effect that is barely measureable, and one that has no dramatic impact when combined with the fictional water vapor amplification, which incidentally the superfluous ‘Energiewende’ is based on ad absurdum. It is more than regrettable that FOCUS uncritically passed on these misinterpretations. A correction should be made immediately.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that a couple of surface temperature data sets are showing 2014 was a “record warm year,” people are wondering if it means the warming pause is over, and if so, how much climate sensitivity to CO2 there really is.
Online Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski (a geologist) has an analysis of 2014’s “record warm year” and asks if it means global warming has resumed after “a pause since the end of the 1990s”. He describes how climate scientists have been dumbfounded by the “unexpected warming pause”. A number of scientists blame the oceans for absorbing the heat out of the atmosphere. Japan’s meteorological services report that global surface temperature has risen 0.7°C in one hundred years, he writes.
On the significance of the warm year, the Spiegel science journalist quotes the German Climate Consortium: “The following years will allow us to judge the extent global warming at the surface of the earth has resumed.” And even the most alarmist organizations are conceding the global warming pause is real. For example the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) indirectly admits to Spiegel that the global temperature has paused, but reminds us that the 14 warmest years on record occurred over the past 15 years.
On the future of warming, Bojanowski describes a science fraught with uncertainty when it comes to future projections:
The UN IPCC continues to predict a hefty global warming should carbon dioxide emissions not be drastically reduced. But there are major uncertainties in the calculations and for this reason short-term fluctuations will remain unexplainable.”

Readers should note at this point that this too also has to apply for “short-term” warm fluctuations, such as the one from 1980-1998. That one too must have been in large part due to natural factors.
Bojanowski sums up his analysis by pointing out there is also uncertainty not only at the earth’s surface, but in the troposphere as well, writing that “satellite meaurements are astonishing” researchers:
Moreover satellite measurements for upper air levels, which have been taken since the mid 1990s, show hardly any warming. Because of this, scientists are debating if the sensitivity of air temperature with respect to greenhouse gases is possibly less than assumed.”
Bojanowski also points to conflicting scientific literature and papers when it comes to the stability of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. He adds, “The uncertainties show that the decisive questions about the future cannot be answered using short-term fluctuations.” And:
A warm record here, a warming pause there – the concerns and questions surrounding climate change remain the same.”

"About a quarter of the world’s highest-emitting, publicly listed companies fail to report their greenhouse gas emissions and nearly half do not properly consider the risks from the climate crisis in decision-making, new research has found. The findings show the distance even the world’s biggest companies still have to cover to meet the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to the group of investors coordinating the report.  The research covered a sample of 274 of the world’s highest emitting companies which are publicly listed, and therefore must make official disclosures of key financial data. It was carried out by the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics and commissioned by the Transition Pathway Initiative, a group of investors supportive of the Paris agreement, with about $14tn (£11tn) in funds under management. Of a smaller sample of 160 of the biggest emitters, only one in eight – 20 companies – globally were found to be reducing their emissions at the rate necessary to meet the Paris goal of holding temperature rises to within 2C of pre-industrial levels. Simon Dietz, co-director of the Grantham Institute, said: “It’s over three years since the Paris agreement was signed, and this research shows the corporate sector is improving its climate planning and performance, but not fast enough. Cutting through the noise, we can see that barely 12% of companies plan to reduce emissions at the rate required to keep global warming below 2C.” The researchers examined companies in key sectors including oil and gas, steel and aluminium, utilities, car manufacturing and air transport, which combined account for more than 40% of emissions from public companies around the world. New rules have been introduced in the UK that require big companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. In many countries they are not required to do so but are encouraged by many stock exchanges and investor groups. The Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure, backed by the Bank of England, has said such reporting is essential to allow investors to make properly informed decisions about their portfolios. Faith Ward, co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative, said investors would be taking note: “This research shows clear leaders and laggards emerging within sectors from airlines to aluminium, and that gives investors an investment-relevant decision to make today. “As the effects of climate change accelerate, we can expect to see more capital flow away from those companies that bury their head in the sand, and towards those companies aligning with a 2C pathway.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo much for Germany’s transformation to “green” energies.
Germany’s Bun­desnet­za­gen­tur (Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway) is the federal authority overseeing and regulating the German electrical power grid, among other networks.
At its site it has a link to an expert assessment report that analyzes the needs of and risks to the German power grid for the coming 2014/15 winter.
The name of the report: “Examinations for the winter of 2014/15 with respect to risks for system security and the necessity for reserve power plants”.
The 102-page highly technical assessment examines a variety of scenarios in order to see how well Germany’s electrical power grid will hold up this winter. Looking at the report’s conclusion, one can only conclude that the power grid is more unstable and prone to a collapse than at any time in Germany’s post-war period. It’s a debacle knocking at the door.
In the summary on page 97 for example it writes (link added):
Scenarios were parameterized on the basis of historical data and realistically form expected critical situations, but do not necessarily show the worst-case scenario.
Considered scenarios show massive threats to the security and reliability of the electric power supply system which are not manageable without a substantial intervention by the ÜNB and the use of a secured redispatch-potential.
There are no safety reserves for managing additional critical or unexpected situations.”
On page 98 the report re-emphasizes.

In critical situations a substantial threat to system security is to be feared.”
The report’s summary adds: “Ssecure management of the expected critical situations requires comprehensive measures.”
This all means that on a cold winter day, Germany’s power grid could could very well collapse and citizens be left in the cold and dark for hours or even days. Parts of the report have been blacked out, which is hardly reassuring to the reader.
So why has Germany’s power grid, once one of the world’s most stable, become so vulnerable? An editorial piece at the Financial Times sums it nicely. It writes: “Merkel’s decision to phase out nuclear power has been a huge mistake.”
The FT piece writes that Germany has added a huge amount of intermittent wind and solar energy. Not only does this energy act to destabilize the power grid, but it also is costing German citizens and the economy a bundle. What a bargain: Poor quality for high cost! The FT writes that the Energiewende is “designed to make the economy predominantly dependent on renewable sources such as wind and solar power“, and adds that these are “burdens on households and businesses“, something that “Germany can ill afford”, the FT writes.
What’s worse for clean-energy-minded Germans is that the elimination of nuclear energy has led to an increase in coal burning. In the end, Germany’s power system is now dirtier, more unstable than ever, and now costs consumers far more. Does that sound like a great deal? Sounds to me like a monumental mismanagement.
Those of us living in Germany may want to consider installing a wood-burning stove in the weeks ahead as winter quickly approaches.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany protests over a broad range of issues have been heightening.
In Dresden citizens have been turning out by the thousands in “Monday demonstrations” to protest the perceived threat of the Islamification of Europe and the so-called “liar media”, which they no longer trust. Since the Paris attacks by radical Islamic terrorists, the protesters have only become more emboldened.
Citizens are also clearly beginning to feel they are being misled by the “liar media” and politicians regarding wind energy. The glaring difference between what was promised and what is actually being delivered can no longer be ignored. Enough is enough!
Germany’s online SVZ.de writes that the “conflict over wind turbines is escalating” and that “criticism and fears are becoming louder” and that “citizen protest groups are forming at many locations“.
What does it mean? It means that wind and solar power are nothing like they were once cracked up to be. They are poor performers, costly, and are creating a nationwide blight that risks permanently scarring Germany’s once idyllic landscape and natural heritage.
Everything and anything can now be sacrificed at the alter of climate protection. Recently Die Welt published a scathing commentary on the “immensely dangerous power of the eco-cartel“, writing that “totalitarian undercurrents are plainly visible” and that the movement is all about power and money, and less so about environmental protection. Germany’s green movement has been corrupted to the bone.

In the state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania the SVZ.de site writes how an organization called Freier Horizont was established last November and serves as the umbrella for 40 citizens initiatives. “They are protesting against what they see as the uncontrolled expansion of wind energy and speak of horror landscapes.”
Freier Horizont Chairman Norbert Schumacher worries that wind energy will have negative impacts on the region’s coastal tourism. Citizens are concerned that Germany’s cherished Baltic Sea coast will be “blighted” and believe political leaders and wind energy developers are not taking their concerns seriously.
They aren’t, of course. It’s all about money. Even the most self-professed Greens are selling out to the big money of wind energy. For example Die Welt writes of German Green Party honcho Boris Palmer, someone “who grew up protesting the installation of power transmission towers is – no joke – demanding that natural parks and reserves be opened for the 200-meter tall rotating monsters, even if they are located right next World Heritage Sites.”
Greens like Palmer no longer have qualms about that, and so it should not surprise us that they are ready to trample and permanently damage heritage locations – e.g. like the Nazca Lines in Peru. It’s all in the name of the Green Allah: Climate Protection. Green madness has taken over in Germany, but citizens are waking up.

"From climate change to child labour, the responsibility for solving major societal problems is increasingly being shifted to the individual. People feel in order to save the world they have to be “good”. Yet that is bad – because it paralyses change. Global challenges must be tackled by institutions. That’s why the UK’s Committee on Climate Change was absolutely right to criticise the government in the strongest terms today for failing to take more action against the climate crisis.  Personal sacrifice alone cannot be the solution to tackling the climate crisis. There’s no other area in which the individual is held so responsible for what’s going wrong. And it’s true: people drive too much, eat too much meat, and fly too often.  But reaching zero emissions requires very fundamental changes. Individual sacrifice alone will not bring us to zero. It can be achieved only by real structural change; by a new industrial revolution. Looking for solutions to the climate crisis in individual responsibilities and actions risks obstructing this. It suggests that all we have to do is pull ourselves together over the next 30 years and save energy, walk, skip holidays abroad, and simply “do without”. But these demands for individual action paralyse people, thereby preventing the large-scale change we so urgently need. We do not just need the 5-10% of the population willing and able to put time, money and effort into change. We need everyone to turn the tide towards sustainability worldwide. There is hope that lies in the fact that we do not have to wait for each individual on Earth to become a better person and save the planet. All we need is to create a consensus within society that we should not destroy our home and demand that governments make this their first priority. Some people argue that this is a cheap and convenient excuse to shift responsibility from the individual to the politicians. But it is neither cheap nor convenient. Each one of us remains individually responsible: to stay informed, to demand something different, and to keep politicians and institutions in check.  We don’t expect individuals to take the lead when it comes to other social and economic challenges, such as unemployment. There is a decades-long economic consensus that unemployment should be kept as low as possible. But you would not ask an individual who warned that unemployment was too high: “so, what action do you personally take in the fight against unemployment?” Because that question is absurd. Unless you are the CEO of a big company, or the mayor of a city, as an individual you have no significant impact on unemployment. The same is true of the climate crisis. What we need is citizens to make adamant demands of their politicians and institutions for more urgent action. Just as no party that pledged to increase rather than reduce unemployment would ever get elected in the UK or any other country, no political party should be allowed to dodge a clear strategy against climate risks. This is a challenge for politics, not for the individual. In a society where environmentally and socially harmful goods and services are often indistinguishable from environmentally friendly or fair products, it’s naive to think that asking the individual to save the world through consumer choice will be effective. And neither is it always the moral thing to do: is it right to demand from an Indian farmer that he cares about climate protection? What about the struggling single mother in London or Berlin with her three children? If we take civil and human rights seriously, we cannot assign solving global problems to the individual. And the call for greater individual responsibility actually risks becoming detrimental to the cause as it prevents people from realising the scale of political change that needs to happen. Instead of seeing the big picture, people are diverted to the fine print on the refrigerator shelf in the supermarket. There has been a trend towards shifting responsibility for societal success from our political institutions to the individual. But it’s only as a society that we can collectively demand our politicians take the action needed to address the climate crisis. • Anders Levermann is a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"
"Your article (Planting billions of trees ‘best way to save planet’, 5 July) cites Tom Crowther, who led the research, as saying: “Personally, Brazil would be my dream hotspot to get it right – that would be spectacular.” And a dream it will remain until his exciting plan is rooted more firmly in global socioeconomic reality. At the moment, far from replanting cleared land, Brazil is surging ahead with forest devastation on a frightening scale. Just-published official figures show an extraordinary 769 sq km, an area larger than the whole of Middlesex, was felled in June. The destruction of the Amazon forest, which Brazil successfully curbed after 2012, is roaring ahead again. Over 50% more trees were felled in June 2019 than in June 2018.  This is largely because Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is an unabashed ally of agribusiness and is turning a blind eye to illegal deforestation. He reacted angrily to criticisms of Brazil’s environmental policies made by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron at the recent G20 meeting. Earlier this week, he said he had flown over Europe twice and had not seen “even a square kilometre of forest”, adding: “They have no authority to discuss the environmental issue with us.” But Bolsonaro cannot be blamed for all the problems. The Amazon forest is being cleared so that Brazil can produce more beef and soya to send abroad. Much of the trade is handled by multinationals. This will stop only if there is a major shake-up in the world food system. Consumers worldwide must stop eating food that is causing forest devastation. Brazil’s thousands of indigenous and peasant communities have profound knowledge of the forest and would like nothing more than the power to protect it and replant devastated areas. But at the moment they are still being dispossessed. The first step in realising Crowther’s dream is to put an end to their expropriation.Sue BranfordClun, Shropshire • Before we get too excited by this study, ponder the caution by its leader that it will take 50-100 years to have full effect – and reflect that the International Panel on Climate Change “warns that we have only 11 years to halve global emissions to meet their 1.5C target” (Letters, 28 June). Peter GreavesLondon • Tree planting may have “mind-blowing” potential to tackle the climate crisis. However, the climate crisis is just one symptom of our continued destruction of the planet. The climate crisis has barely got going, but we are already in the midst of an extinction crisis that could soon rival that of the Cretaceous, when the dinosaurs became extinct. Today, we are losing species at a mass extinction rate, and at this point it’s nothing to do with climate. Planting billions of trees will accelerate the extinction crisis, since closed canopy forest is not the natural state of most areas of continents. During the ice ages, and the intervening interglacials that dissected them, areas that we regard as natural forest today weren’t closed canopy, but instead were savannah or steppe, habitats that also absorb and store a great deal of carbon. Covering these areas with closed canopy forest will reduce biodiversity and condemn many species to extinction – species that still survive in the remaining fragments of these habitats, or in the farmland that we have replaced them with. Planting billions of trees may be one way of solving the problem, but will create more. Perhaps we can just produce less carbon in the first place. We have the technology, and we know how to make it work.Martin DohrnBristol • Your article reinforces the idea that the only way to get a tree or forest is to plant it. Creating woods in the way promoted by Defra grants and the Woodland Trust results in serried ranks of trees in plastic tubes that are often left long after they should be removed. Planting saplings grown abroad is almost certainly how ash dieback came to Britain. Any piece of land, anywhere in the world below the tree-line, left alone without any human interference or expense, will undergo a natural growth via scrub to a fully mature forest of properly native trees. As it does so, it will be taking lots of CO2 out of the atmosphere. Whether the new forest is planted or natural, when it is mature it no longer has any good effect on CO2 levels: the rotting dead leaves and fallen trees release exactly the same amount of CO2 as the trees take in by photosynthesis. To make a mature forest a contributor to CO2 reduction you need to cut down the mature trees and use the wood for building (or burn it to replace fossil fuels). Then let the felled forest regrow.Dr David CorkeDirector, Organic Countryside CIC • I have been concerned about deforestation since I was a teenager. I specifically recall a national campaign in 1973, bearing the slogan “plant a tree in 73”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) presents a detailed analysis on the IPCC’s recently published final 40-page Synthesis Report released earlier this month.

Image source: IPCC
EIKE, however, concludes that the IPCC report is fraught with error and distortion. Author Klaus-Eckart Puls writes:
Not only does it contain major contradictions, simplifications and even falsehoods with respect to the earlier comprehensive partial reports, it is a stark contraction to almost every measurement and trend in nature. This is being noticed by event the alarmist tending media [3] : ‘Indeed while the previous climate reports [The 3 comprehensive reports of 2013/14] for the most part provided the science and the contradictions, the new Synthesis report suppresses most of the scientific findings.'”

Puls then provides a list contradictions, falsehoods and distortions stemming from the new Synthesis Report, all of which are refuted by measurements and facts which Puls provides:
1. air temperature
2. sea level rise
3. ocean temperature
4. storms
5. polar ice
6. extreme weather
7. crop yields
8. species extinctions
9. man is responsible
Puls summarizes (reiterating some of what he wrote in his introduction:
In the 40-page Summary for Policymakers [1] published in early November, the IPCC in large part contradicts the depictions and data in its own(!) comprehensive reports (several thousand pages) it released at the end of 2013 and early 2014. The summery-statements stand also in crass contradiction to almost every trend-measurement found in nature over the past 150 years.
For example the online SPIEGEL [3] writes: ‘Final IPCC Report: At the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change, Alarmism Comes before Accuracy’ … ‘The document is supposed to rationally inform on the science – instead it suppresses the central contradictions.’ … ‘Indeed while the previous climate reports [The 3 comprehensive reports of 2013/14] for the most part provided the science and the contradictions, the new Synthesis Report suppresses most of the scientific findings’.”
Thanks – that suffices!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski here looks at the new paper “Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought,” PNAS, March 2, 2015 by Kelley et al, which claims the 2007−2010 drought contributed to the war in the region.
A number of major news outlets, such as the New York Times and the AP were quick to uncritically dispense it as gospel truth.
Anthony Watts provides good background here.
Spiegel’s view is much more critical and skeptical of the paper’s findings and overall methodology when compared to the New York Times or AP. The online German magazine writes:
An alarming study has created a commotion worldwide. The authors claim that climate change contributed to the drought and civil war in Syria. However this claim is hardly tenable.”
Models in wide disagreement
Bojanowski writes that the decisive evidence in the paper is based on climate models, which show drier conditions for Syria as the greenhouse effect intensifies. However Bojanowski later points out that the climate system in Syria is highly complex and that even the IPCC questions the capability of models reliably simulating the climate system of Syria and that the models are in wide disagreement:
The region lies on the boundary of three climate regions where the weather patterns are hardly understood, the IPCC report says. Foremost the climate simulation models diverge widely from each other when it comes to precipitation. It thus appears unwarranted to use the results of models as a way of confirming the effect of greenhouse gases, believes [William]Briggs.”
Sparse data
Another problem with the study, Spiegel reports, is that the data used were way too sparse, and quoted climate scientist Tim Brücher of the Max Planck Institute for Meterology: “The data should have been handled more critically.”
“Renders a poor service on behalf of climate science”

Probably seeing the paper more as an embarrassment rather than a contribution to science, even warmist institutes were unable to refrain from critique. Bojanowski quotes Thomas Bernauer, a conflict researcher at ETH in Zürich: “The entire paper is problematic as it renders a poor service on behalf of climate science.”
“Study is problematic at a number of levels”
In total Bojanowski says scientists criticize the paper on five aspects, saying that after the criticism, nothing is really left of the paper. According to Spiegel, University of Hamburg expert Tobias Ide says, “The study is problematic at a number of levels.” Peace scientist Christiane Fröhlich of the same university says the civil war “had more to do with wealthy citizens provoking it“.
“A distraction” from the real causes
Francesca De Châtel, Syria expert at Radboud University in Nijmegen, called the paper “a distraction” from the real causes of the war, and pointed out that drought periods are more the norm for the region. The problems stem foremost from land mismanagement and shoddy agricultural practices. Bojanowski quotes De Châtel: “The role of climate change is not only irrelevant, emphasizing it is even damaging.”
No evidence linking drought to civil war
Also Norwegian doctoral candidate Ole Magnus Theisen states that there is no evidence of a relationship between drought and conflict, Spiegel writes.
Bojanowski adds that “the climate argument allows politicians to blame others outside of the country for the hunger.” The Spiegel journalist sums up the science of tying climate change to war in general:
The main causes of civil wars are political. The future security of Africa does not depend on climate, rather on political and economic development.”
In summary one would not be wrong in concluding that the PNAS was definitely asleep during the review of the paper. Hard to get any shoddier.

"A group of wealthy US philanthropists and investors have donated almost half a million pounds to support the grassroots movement Extinction Rebellion and school strike groups – with the promise of tens of millions more in the months ahead. Trevor Neilson, an investor and philanthropist who has worked with some of the world’s richest families, has teamed up with Rory Kennedy – daughter of Robert Kennedy – and Aileen Getty, whose family wealth comes from the oil industry, to launch the Climate Emergency Fund.  Neilson, who has worked with figures such as Bill Gates and Richard Branson, said the fund was inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protesters in the UK in April. Neilson said the three founders were using their contacts among the global mega-rich to get “a hundred times” more in the weeks and months ahead. “This might be the single best chance we have to stop the greatest emergency we have ever faced,” he told the Guardian. The new fund has the author and environmentalist Bill McKibben, who set up 350.org, and David Wallace Wells, who wrote international best seller Uninhabitable Earth, on its advisory board. The money will initially be used to support school strike and Extinction Rebellion groups in the US, but will also be available to help “seed” similar groups around the world. It offers tiers of funding to support different-sized groups, from teenage activists wanting money for leaflets and megaphones, to funding for salaries and offices for established groups in big cities. It has already committed some of the fund to support Extinction Rebellion groups in New York and Los Angeles. Neilson, who co-founded investment company IX investments, said although he had been a longtime backer of environmental projects, it was only when he was forced to flee his house in California last year during a wildfire that he realised that radical action was needed. “Something about throwing my two-year-old and wife in the car and evacuating from the worst fire in the history of southern California brought the issue into a new type of focus,” he said. He said the new fund would back non-violent legal action.“It will provide resources to grassroots activists who seek to disrupt in a non-violent way [and] to demand that governments declare a climate emergency and put in place policies to address this crisis.” He said that most “of the world’s biggest philanthropists are still in a gradualist mindset”, adding: “We do not have time for gradualism.” “History shows us that change comes from the people. It is grassroots movements throughout history that force governments to act when government is resistant.” A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion welcomed the move, saying: “It’s a signal that we are coming to a tipping point. In the past, philanthropy has often been about personal interest, but now people are realising that we are all in this together and putting their money forward for our collective wellbeing.” "

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Kelley et al study is increasingly looking like a politically bought panic paper, designed to send out a certain message and mislead the public.
What is especially tragic about the whole nonsense is that the paper only serves to shift the focus away from the real causes behind the worsening tragedy in the Syrian region.
A couple of days ago I wrote about a Spiegel piece that shredded the paper and exposed it as very shoddy work of science.
At Twitter the author of the Spiegel piece, Axel Bojanowski, got a reply from another rather high caliber German journalist, Gabor Paal, who confirms that the situation in Syria has much less to do with climate change, and much more to do with lousy land-use and agricultural practices.

.@Axel_Bojanowski ich war 2008 in syrien. Forscher aquirierten Gelder mit Verweis auf ""klimawandel"". Landnutzung war eindeutig größeres Prob
— Gabor Paal (@GaborPaal) March 9, 2015

On March 7 Bojanowski wrote:
Did climate change really spark the Syria War as claimed? The basis for that is flimsy.”
On March 9, Paal responded to Bojanowski:
@Axel_Bojanowski I was in Syria in 2008. Scientists acquired funding with reference to ‘climate change’. Land-use was clearly the bigger problem.”

So what we have here is yet another journalist casting grave doubt on the claims made by Kelley et al.
Paal provided the link to a 2008 radio documentary on Syria he had produced with the focus on the crop failures that the Middle Eastern country had been experiencing and their causes. The radio documentary was featured at SWF South German Broadcasting. Throughout the documentary the emphasis on the reasons for the crop problems in Syria was squarely on land-use and poor agricultural practices, with climate change not playing any real role.
The documentary begins by explaining how Syria is divided into 5 different climate zones. In Zone 5, the largest and most arid, groundwater has been pumped out to such an extent that vegetation can no longer thrive. At the 10-minute mark:
More than half the country belongs to Zone 5, the steppes and desert region. Here it rains less than 200 mm per year. Zone 5 is government property. There are no privets lots. Agriculture would be possible here only with irrigation, but the water table has dropped so much that the steppes have become so barren that the government has forbidden all use. The blame for this is not climate change, but rather the way the land is managed.”
The documentary explains how 75% of all farmers raise sheep to earn a living, and that millions of sheep are living where less than 150 mm of rain falls yearly. Vegetation has no chance. “15 – 20% of the steppes are lost and maybe we cannot recover them.” The documentary adds that there are 15 million sheep in Syria and that the figure is 4 times more than 10 years ago.
“Media fixated on climate”
Another problem the region faced, Paal said, was the threat of the UG 99 fungus that threatened the region’s grain crop.
At the very end of the SWR report Paal stated:
In the public media reporting, agricultural research has not made any progress. The media are fixated on climate and the focus on the ground beneath their feet has been lost. And now in the wake of the food crisis, international agricultural reseach has the chance to benefit once again.”
Today, some 7 years later, Kelley et al tells us that this has not come to pass – tragically. The focus still remains on the bogus problem of climate change and people are suffering more unimaginable misery than ever because of it.
Someone needs to go to jail.

"BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, has branded the UK backlash against the oil company’s arts sponsorship the “oddest approach” in the climate debate. The oil boss spoke out against the mounting opposition to its arts funding after high-profile protests targeted its support for the Royal Shakespeare Company, the British Museum and the National Portrait Awards.  He told a Chatham House event that the recent spate of protests is “very curious” and “just feels odd” when there is “overwhelming feedback” in support of its arts funding. “The rest of the world finds this the oddest approach,” he added. In response Culture Unstrained, a campaign group hoping to end oil sponsorship in the arts, said Dudley’s comments “seem out of touch with reality” given the high-profile and widespread opposition to BP’s sponsorship across the cultural sector in recent weeks. Actor Sir Mark Rylance resigned from the Royal Shakespeare Company last month, saying that BP’s sponsorship deal allowed the company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities” on the environment. A judge and several leading artists also wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards last month calling for an end to its long-standing links to the company. In February, hundreds of people occupied the British Museum to object to its relationship with BP. The museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, has since rejected calls to drop its sponsorship deal with BP, and publicly endorsed the funding. Dudley acknowledged that climate demonstrators’ anger over progress by the energy industry towards a lower carbon future is escalating. “Tensions are running high and we recognise there are real concerns being expressed – about BP, and about the energy sector more broadly,” he said. BP’s London headquarters were brought to a standstill after Greenpeace blockaded the company’s entrance in early May, before climate protesters struck again at the company’s annual general meeting later in the same month. In June Greenpeace activists scaled an oil rig as it was being towed to one of BP’s North Sea projects. “All this might suggest that the demonstrators’ view of the future is worlds apart from BP’s. The frustration from my side is that we agree on much more than people realise. Like our critics, BP believes the world is not on a sustainable path,” he said. “In order to progress we have to talk constructively. Not broadcast our opinions at each other but really talk. That means taking the time to listen, understand each other’s perspective and then work together to find the solutions. And fast,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany readers and myself have become quite dismayed by the Vatican’s new position on the junk climate science-based, anti-humanity movement against fossil fuels.
Interestingly today I read a report in the Catholic Herald here where it is clearly miffed by how Britain’s UKIP party “now commands the support of an estimated one in six Catholics” and is “causing increasing alarm among Church leaders.” My, how could that be!
Well, we all understand that things move glacially slow at the Vatican, and we don’t expect them to see the light any time soon, even though it’s staring at them straight in the face. These things can take centuries.
Catholics reject intolerance and hatred
One reason Catholics are rejecting the positions held by the Church is no better illustrated than by the following article appearing in the The Daily Mail:
I’ve never supported the British National Party or the Ku Klux Klan. I’ve never belonged to the Paedophile Information Exchange, or denied the Holocaust, or made a penny from the banking crash.
But if you read The Guardian newspaper’s website, you might think otherwise. A commentator on it urged my own children to murder me.
He did so because of one of the many stories I’ve written for this newspaper about climate change. I first reported on the subject nearly six years ago: my article was about the ‘climategate’ scandal, where leaked emails…”

…”But ultimately, where are they taking us? Citing climate change is certainly an effective way of making schoolchildren feel fearful and guilty, much as preachers once used to.”
Read more at the Daily Mail.
Leaders will have to learn to face one fact: thanks to the Internet followers are much better informed today and many can see the cliff up ahead which their leaders are blindly leading them to. The Catholic Church is part of that green movement.
Catholics want nothing to do with and are appalled by the hate and bigotry that gets aimed at honest dissenters such as David Rose. And we reject the deception-riddled plot to deny the world of life-giving fossil fuels as well as the mentally ill hysteria of a world coming to an end.
If anything what we need is an encyclical on the necessity of fossil fuels.
It’s truly stunning that the Church can be so tolerant of the bigotry and intolerance on one side of the debate, yet be so quick to condemn honest dissent on the other.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMood change in climate modeling: Trust in the scientific community is disappearing
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In the last few days we wrote two posts on the shocking deficits seen in the current climate models (see here and here). In our last part today we will look at how scientists estimate the modeling situation and look to see if there are new ideas to solve the problems.
In August 2014 a lead author of the 5th IPCC climate report, Richard Betts, publicly commented in a surprising manner. Betts directs the climate impact department of the UK Met Office, and at his website he describes himself as a climate modeling expert. In a comment at Bishop Hill, Betts wrote:
Bish, as always I am slightly bemused over why you think GCMs are so central to climate policy. Everyone* agrees that the greenhouse effect is real, and that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Everyone* agrees that CO2 rise is anthropogenic. Everyone** agrees that we can’t predict the long-term response of the climate to ongoing CO2 rise with great accuracy. It could be large, it could be small. We don’t know. The old-style energy balance models got us this far. We can’t be certain of large changes in future, but can’t rule them out either.”
In a footnote Betts added the 2 comments:
*OK so not quite everyone, but everyone who has thought about it to any reasonable extent
**Apart from a few who think that observations of a decade or three of small forcing can be extrapolated to indicate the response to long-term larger forcing with confidence.”
Betts no longer gives climate models a central role in climate policy. There are still too many unknowns, he admits. Quite obviously even IPCC authors are now getting cold feet and are no longer able to exclude that CO2 may have only a minor impact on climate.
A month earlier in July 2014 in the Wall Street Journal climate modeler Robert Caprara conceded that a variety of freely selectable parameters exist in climate models, which allow the desired result to be “modeled in”. Caprara writes:
My first job was as a consultant to the Environmental Protection Agency. I was hired to build a model to assess the impact of its Construction Grants Program, a nationwide effort in the 1970s and 1980s to upgrade sewer-treatment plants. […] When I presented the results to the EPA official in charge, he said that I should go back and “sharpen my pencil.” I did. I reviewed assumptions, tweaked coefficients and recalibrated data. But when I reran everything the numbers didn’t change much. At our next meeting he told me to run the numbers again. After three iterations I finally blurted out, “What number are you looking for?” He didn’t miss a beat: He told me that he needed to show $2 billion of benefits to get the program renewed. I finally turned enough knobs to get the answer he wanted, and everyone was happy.”
In the climate debate Caprara recommends having an open discussion and listening to the arguments of the other side instead of cursing the other side in an attempt to disqualify them:

So here is my advice: Those who are convinced that humans are drastically changing the climate for the worse and those who aren’t should accept and welcome a vibrant, robust back-and-forth. Let each side make its best case and trust that the truth will emerge. Those who do believe that humans are driving climate change retort that the science is “settled” and those who don’t agree are “deniers” and “flat-earthers.” Even the president mocks anyone who disagrees. But I have been doing this for a long time, and the one thing I have learned is how hard it is to convince people with a computer model.”
Already in a paper from October 2012 a team of scientists led by Clara Deser in Nature Climate Change admitted that the strong natural climate variability that had been underestimated had been poorly accounted for by the climate models and so the models could not fulfill the high expectations of the political decision makers. The paper’s abstract states:
Communication of the role of natural variability in future North American climate
As climate models improve, decision-makers’ expectations for accurate climate predictions are growing. Natural climate variability, however, poses inherent limits to climate predictability and the related goal of adaptation guidance in many places, as illustrated here for North America. Other locations with low natural variability show a more predictable future in which anthropogenic forcing can be more readily identified, even on small scales. We call for a more focused dialogue between scientists, policymakers and the public to improve communication and avoid raising expectations for accurate regional predictions everywhere.”
Also well-known climate scientist Judith Curry has little trust in climate modeling. In October 2013 she complained in her blog about the missing estimations of climate historical studies – to the benefit of climate models. Huge sums had been invested in the models, without a correct result. The falsely claimed consensus by the IPCC catapulted the climate sciences backward at least a decade, said Curry:
My point is that ambitious young climate scientists are inadvertently being steered in the direction of analyzing climate model simulations, and particularly projections of future climate change impacts — lots of funding in this area, in addition to high likelihood of publication in a high impact journal, and a guarantee of media attention. And the true meaning of this research in terms of our actual understanding of nature rests on the adequacy and fitness for purpose of these climate models. And why do these scientists think climate models are fit for these purposes? Why, the IPCC has told them so, with very high confidence. The manufactured consensus of the IPCC has arguably set our true understanding of the climate system back at least a decade, in my judgment. The real hard work of fundamental climate dynamics and development and improvement of paleo proxies is being relatively shunned by climate scientists since the rewards (and certainly the funding) are much lower. The amount of time and funding that has been wasted by using climate models for purposes for which that are unfit, may eventually be judged to be colossal.
A more precise knowledge of paleoclimatology is essential and should have absolute priority ahead of free-style modeling because historical data are important calibration and check data for climate models. When the formulae are not correct, then even the largest super-computers are unable to deliver anything useful.

Also astrophysicist Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has no trust in climate models, as he explained at an event at Sandia National Labs, a research and development facility of the US Department of Energy.
The IPCC should finally open itself up to alternative models. In our “The Neglected Sun” book we presented a semi-quantitive approach where solar and ocean cycles played an important role. The awful accuracy rate of the IPCC models shows that it is time for a change. A serious check of the ideas of IPCC critics has to be conducted. Here models by Nicola Scafetta and Frank Lemke, which reproduce the temperature curve better than the IPCC forecasts, must be given serious attention. When it comes to oceans cycles, scientists have already given in and have even started to insert them into the models, thus making reliability of the climate prognosis dramatically better. An approach is for example DelSole et al. 2013 in a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy last post featured a commentary by renewable energy expert Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, who forcefully conveyed the folly of Germany’s mad rush into renewable energy, and the country’s hysterical obsession with its suicidal fast-track shutdown of its stable base-electric-power generation.
What follows are German electrical power supply charts that clearly illustrate in no uncertain terms Prof. Vahrenholt’s points. To show just how unreliable wind and sun really are, the first chart shows Germany’s power production, broken down according to the respective sources, over the last 3 and half days:

Power generation Germany vs date/time. Source: www.agora-energiewende.de/Graph.
 Dark blue – conventional power (fossil and nuclear)
 Medium blue – wind
 Yellow – solar
 Green – biomass
Note how there has been a virtual blackout by sun and wind since December 3 as Germany’s weather has been dismally gray and windless over the period. Such conditions are not uncommon in Europe and can persist for 2 weeks or more.
Note how there are times when sun and wind combined were less tha 2% of the needed supply. Unfortunately, power utilities simply cannot call Mother Nature up and place orders for power days in advance. They have to just take what Mother Nature sends, whether they want it or not, and German law says they have to pay for it even when they do not feed it in.
Supply havoc for no benefit
What follows next is a chart depicting Germany’s power supply from each energy source over an entire year (sorry about the suboptimal quality of the graphics).

Here we see that especially in the summertime both wind and sun can make a major contribution. But once again their wildly fluctuating supply creates havoc and problems that far outweigh any “benefit” the theoretical, imperceptible 0.02 or so degrees of less warming the planet might see over the next 30 years.
Large-scale exodus of Germany-based industry looms
And when the sun does shine and the wind blows many conventional power plants have to be throttled down to near idle, but can never be shut down because they have to be ready to fire up again as soon as the sun and wind diminish. This means these conventional power plants often run very inefficiently and highly uneconomically. So it’s little wonder E.ON is ditching the loss-making business of forced part-time power plant operation and going to renewable energies where profit is guaranteed by government mandated subsidies.
And with a power supply that is becoming exceedingly unstable and exorbitantly expensive, energy intensive industries are gearing to move operations, and the thousands of jobs they provide, out of Germany and over to foreign locations where electricity is affordable and reliable.
Large-scale storage technology still pie-in-the-sky
And does one see the pump storage (Pumpenspeicher) contribution in the above chart whenever the sun and wind go AWOL?
Of course we don’t. That’s because there is none to speak of in Germany. Yet, this is one of the main solutions that the government energy masterminds propose in order to compensate for windless and sunless periods. It still has not sunk into their heads that this amount of pump storage capacity is a technical impossibility in Germany, even with massive terra-altering. Never mind the economic unfeasibility of the idea.
The question remains: After Germany shuts down its remaining nuclear power and coal-fire plants, what will the country do when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow?
That question has yet to be answered.

"Donald Trump is set to hail his administration’s “environmental leadership” on Monday in a speech in which he is expected to declare the US a world leader on the issue. But since taking office two and a half years ago, the US president has been at the helm of an administration that has pursued numerous cuts in environmental protections and last year saw a rise in greenhouse gases of 3.4% – the biggest rise in emissions since 2010. He has also regularly publicly aired his doubts over the existence of climate change – previously calling it a “hoax”, suggesting that the climate could “change back again” and falsely claiming it was a phenomenon invented by China. A report by the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s school of law published in March said the Trump administration had “set its sights on watering down or outright repealing a half-dozen health and environmental rules critical to the health and welfare of all Americans as well as the planet”.  Here are five of the biggest environmental setbacks under Trump: In June 2017, less than five months after his inauguration, Trump announced his plan to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. He told an audience outside the White House: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”. He claimed the agreement, signed by the US and nearly 200 countries in 2015, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep global heating below 2C, unfairly disadvantaged the US and negatively impacted jobs and factories.  Trump attracted broad criticism in December 2017 when he announced plans to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah. Bears Ears was cut from 1.5m acres to 228,784 acres and Grand Staircase-Escalante almost halved from approximately 2m acres to 1,006,341 acres – marking the biggest elimination of public lands protection in America’s history. In August 2018 officials announced plans to allow more mining on the land and to sell some of it off – despite previously vowing not to. The following month, the administration announced plans to remove key provisions from the Endangered Species Act – prompting conservationists to warn it could put vulnerable plant and animal species in more danger. The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of finalizing plans to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule intended to cut emissions from power plants and encourage them to move towards natural gas and renewable power. The regulations, which were announced in 2015 and had the backing of hundreds of businesses, were billed at the time as the “biggest step that any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fueling climate change”.  The Trump administration plans to remove protections from thousands of America’s streams and millions of acres of wetlands, which is feared will harm wildlife and enable pollution to enter drinking water. Under the proposal, fewer waterways would require permits to pollute – including agricultural runoff and industry waste. Currently, protected waterways provide drinking water to approximately 117 million people. In September 2018, the Trump administration announced its plans to repeal rules that aim to restrict methane leaks on public and tribal lands. The Obama administration tried to cut leaks by forcing oil and gas companies to capture methane (a key gas involved in global heating), update technology and arrange to monitor leaked gas. But the Department of the Interior has branded the rule “flawed” and “unnecessarily burdensome on the private sector”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome days ago I wrote about how German news weekly Der Spiegel had resorted once again to catastrophe-hopping when it recently rolled out its print edition whose front cover featured a burning planet caused by human climate change.
Skeptics in Europe reacted harshly, but at the same time dismiss the doomsday piece as a desperate sensationalism stunt in a bid to stem its hemorrhage of readers.
Alarmist views “wrong, completely naïve”
Some criticism even came from rather hefty figures in the climate scene. For example Swedish professor Lennart Bengtsson, former IPCC climatologist and former head of the German Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
Hat-tip: Hans Labohm
Bengtsson posted a commentary concerning the Spiegel doomsday piece at the Swedish Anthropocene site here. He calls the alarmist views of book author Naomi Klein, which Spiegel cited in its article: “not only wrong, but also hopelessly naïve.”
No basis showing weather has gotten more extreme
Bengtsson, who has gravitated from being an regular alarmist to a non-alarmist luke-warmer over the years, thinks that the growing emission of greenhouse gases is a problem over the long term, but that it is not an urgent problem. He writes there is no scientific basis showing the weather has become more extreme.

The storms are not worse than before, and they will be fewer in a warmer climate as a result of the polar regions warming up.”
No urgency
On sea level Bengtsson writes that it is now rising at about 3 mm per year, but has not accelerated over the past 23 years. It makes no sense to rush and to make “hasty and inaccurate decisions“. He writes: 
The reason for the increased emissions of carbon dioxide is the increasing earth‘s population and the desire of all the poor to live a life that is a little better and more hopeful, and perhaps someday even take a taxi at any time – surely among some of Naomi Klein’s environmental sins.”
Bengtsson calls the belief that a non-capitalist system can solve the earth’s energy and environmental problems “completely naïve” and uninformed, citing past failed experiments in socialism.
If anyone ought to be familiar with the costs needed to solve the problems left behind by communist East Germany, it is Spiegel. The Elbe River was a dead river at the time of the German reunification. Now, thanks to the capitalist system, it has returned to life.”
As an example of a successful approach to lower CO2, emissions, Bengtsson uses the United States: “In fact, one of the few countries that has significantly reduced CO2 emissions are the United States, through its growing gas exploration!” 
Bengtsson adds: 

The only hope to solve the planet’s long-term environmental problems is via the open and free society, not least of all by a socialist dictatorship on a global scale. This at least Spiegel’s editors ought to know.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is Professor Fritz Vahrenholt’s reaction to German power giant E.ON’s decision to split off its fossil fuel and nuclear power generation operations, and Russia’s announcement it has cancelled the construction of South Stream gas supply pipeline to Europe.
=========================
This week two events have occurred and will have serious impacts on the European and German energy market: 1) the withdrawal from conventional power generation by Europe’s and Germany’s largest power company, E.ON, and 2) Russia’s canceling the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline. The public reaction in Germany was quite subdued. That in itself shows how little the German public comprehends the issue of power supply stability.
But this is exactly what these two events are all about.
E.ON accepts that there is no longer any future for coal and nuclear power in Germany, as this is the will of the federal government and the German public. That is indeed suicidal for Germany as a location for business, and E.ON knows it. The forced shutdown of nuclear power plants, without compensation, and the loss-intensive relegation of coal and gas power plants to serve as uneconomical back-up power plants for the most-unstable renewable energies, has left a deep impression on the bottom lines of German power producers.
E.ON will place all its conventional operations into a subsidiary company, which will then be put on the auction block. E.ON’s abandonment is striking proof that a market-oriented commitment in Germany’s energy sector is politically unwelcome. Ultimately it is E.ON’s silent wish that in the end – with political guarantees from the German government – a buyer will take over the risk of producing conventional energy in Germany. If it is not the state-controlled companies in France or Russia, then it will be the German state itself who will take over the supply of energy, and certainly over the coming years – after one of the feared brown-outs. That of course will be because of politics. But the political reaction will claim: The energy supply has to be placed in the hands of the state because the market failed. Perhaps the managers at E.ON saw it coming, and so are now attempting to salvage a part of the capital.
With regards to Russia’s sudden cancellation of the South Stream pipeline project, this is also a question of securing an uninterrupted supply. In the wake of geopolitical tensions Russia is pulling out, surely in part because of the pressure from the falling oil and gas prices which are making the project increasingly uneconomical. Russia is turning to China for a solution.

And also here the German public has been surprisingly subdued. As politics pretty much has blocked the possibility of producing its own shale gas, a major part of the political left is busily attempting to torpedo the planned TTIP trade agreement with the USA, which also would include natural gas. Yet Germany continues on as if it’s business as usual, because the overwhelming majority believes wind and sun will suffice. A look out the window can be enlightening. Just as I am writing this, the PV production in Germany is zero – it’s dark outside – and the wind is hardly blowing…I’d estimate producing a maximum of 5000 MW in total, a tiny fraction of Germany’s total demand. Who is going to supply the other 50,000 MW that will power the German Rail, steel mills, subways, water supply, and my desk lamp and laptop?
One thing is now certain: It’s not going to be E.ON.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m Catholic and this Sunday I’m announcing that I’m disassociating myself from the Vatican and its pope. I urge other skeptic Catholics to consider doing the same. This is not a step I’ve taken lightly.
I’ll be opting out of Germany’s Kirchensteuer (Church Tax) and will not attend any services in the future. With their latest planned encyclical they are indicating that they have shifted back to the Dark Ages of bad-weather witches, superstitions and Medieval indulgences. Worse, they are openly subscribing to nutty end-of-times theories.
This comes on the heels of a recent announcement that Pope Francis intends to issue an encyclical on climate change. I am not renouncing Catholicism Christianity, rather I am solely renouncing my recognition that the Vatican and Pope are the faith’s administrator and moral compass. It’s the last straw in an unending string of corruption, child sexual abuse and scandals that have raged within the Catholic Church in recent times.
False prophecies based on junk models
The Vatican announces that it accepts a science (but it is one that is built on the false prophecies of faulty climate models made by unscrupulous scientists who claim they can now see decades and even hundreds of years into the future) and that bad weather is now due to the sins of man. It’s back to the dark days of Church-sanctioned witchhunts of the sort that once punished, tortured and burned people for brewing bad weather. Stunningly, once again, this is where today’s Catholic Church is heading today.
We can only speculate on why the Vatican has decided to take this extreme, divisive, and hugely misguided step, especially at a time when climate science is hotly debated and more tenuous then ever. It has elected to ignore the long-term data, the role of the sun and oceans, the complete lack of correlation between CO2 and global temperature, and seems to have declared the debate over among Catholics. It has entered a bargain founded on a monumental lie and bought into the silly end-of-world scenario. Such a Church is no longer worthy of being followed.
Vatican aligning with population control ideology
Even more disturbing is that the Vatican has opted to align itself with those who possess ideologies that are openly hostile to and spiteful of humanity. In May 2014 the Vatican held a workshop where the invited delegates included Naomi Oreskes, Arctic sea-ice crackpot Peter Wadhams, and Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Pesearch. Strangely it doesn’t seem to bother the Vatican that Professor Schellnhuber once openly stated that the ideal human population for the planet was less than 1 billion people, implying an excess of more than 6 billion inhabitants. He also once said that the planet would “explode” if the population reached 9 billion.

This kind of environmental stewardship is one that advocates the pre-emptive abortion of future generations – a denial of life for future generations – i.e population control. This is hostile to the human race and it is appalling to any practicing Catholic. Either Pope Francis is stunningly naïve, or just diabolically evil.
And don’t expect the Vatican to backtrack anytime soon and to admit that it may have acted too hastily. Recall that It did not apologize to Galileo until 1992 – some three hundred and fifty years after the great philospher’s death. Galileo’s crime: he dared to challenge the consensus of the time.
Poorest urgently need affordable fossil fuels
I can no longer stomach this giant step back to the witch-hunting Dark Ages the Catholic Church is contemplating. The Vatican appears to have unwittingly elected to abandon the poorest among us, and their urgent need for affordable and reliable energy that only fossil fuels and nuclear power are able to deliver. The move by the Vatican risks putting the lives of tens of millions of the world’s most impoverished at risk. This Pope needs to remember that the road to Hell is often paved with good intentions. Though his intentions may be good, they are in this case based on horribly false prophesies peddled by charlatans who arrogantly refuse to debate.
What’s going to be next? An encyclical on the virtues of veganism – based on junk science nutrition?
Defying a corrupt Vatican is the Catholic thing to do
It’s important to keep in mind that rejecting a corrupt, incompetent or misguided Vatican is in fact the most Catholic thing to do. The collection money you give every week will do a lot more good if you give it directly to the needy. The Vatican or the regional Bishop need not send over a minion priest with the errand of saving my soul. Instead the Vatican should worry about its own.
Little wonder that Pope Benedict XVI resigned. The Vatican appears to be well on the way to becoming a cesspool of corruption and self-deceit. I can no longer bear it. The witch-hunting, end-of-world climate encyclical will be the last straw.

"We rarely devote much attention to what happens in the largest state of the US. No, not Texas – Alaska, which is bigger, geographically, than the next three states combined (Texas, California and Montana). Separated from the mainland by Canada, Alaska is the biggest state yet has fewer inhabitants than the smallest (Rhode Island). This creates enormous challenges for governance, including in higher education. And Alaska governor Mike Dunleavy’s new budget will make these challenges far, far worse. In a shocking example of political overreach, Dunleavy announced 182 line-item vetoes to his state’s 2020 budget last week. He thereby cut the budget proposed by the Alaska legislature by almost $410m in general funds. Almost one-third of the cuts will come from the University of Alaska system, which will see its budget cut by $130m – that’s a staggering 41% reduction of state funding to the university.  In a shocked response, the University of Alaska system’s president, James R Johnsen, said Dunleavy’s veto “will strike an institutional and reputational blow from which we may likely never recover”. Scott Downing, faculty senate leader at the University of Alaska Anchorage, told the Washington Post: “It’s going to be devastating. The effects on programs, on the students, on staff and faculty are just going to be – it’s kind of unthinkable.” Dunleavy has defended his draconian budget cuts as a “policy choice” to increase the Permanent Fund dividend Alaskans receive each year – a major election promise he made during his campaign. While this might be good news for drug dealers – research shows a 14%  increase in substance-abuse incidents the day after the annual payout – there is little evidence that the dividends actually boost the state economy. But the University of Alaska system does. Economists have shown that investing in universities boosts the economy of countries and states. They found direct and indirect effects of higher education spending that led to a significant increase in GDP across time and space. From Ohio to West Virginia, public universities have added billions to the state economies. Alaska is no exception. As my colleague Marshall Shepherd noted, the University of Alaska system provided $714m (directly) and $402m (indirectly) to the statewide economy in 2012 alone. Investing in higher education is also a matter of social justice. The cuts will undoubtedly hit the regional campuses the hardest. These campuses service rural populations, and often ethnic minorities. Alaska Natives constitute the majority of students in some of the regional campuses of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, such as Kuskokwim (70%) and Bristol Bay (62%). Many will be unable to attend university if their regional campus is closed (or certain programs are closed). But the impact goes well beyond regional economics and even the state of Alaska. The budget cuts would be a disaster for US climate research. The University of Alaska System is the primary academic institution for Arctic research in the US and “every climate change researcher, educator, scientist and student in the lower 48 whose work touches the American Arctic” relies on the center’s work, Victoria Herrmann, the president of the Arctic Institute, told Gizmodo. “If the UA [University of Alaska] is defunded at the current rate, Arctic research in every corner of America will suffer.” She added, lest we forget, that “what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic”. Bluntly stated, the idea of an annual payout is to bring people to Alaska and to keep them there. It is unclear whether it achieves that. What we do know is that the University of Alaska system retains many of the most mobile, higher-educated workers that the state economy depends on. Research has found that 68% of two-year graduates and 42% of four-year graduates remain in the state. How many young Alaskans, if forced to leave the state to find (better) higher education elsewhere, will return to Alaska after finishing their degree? Dunleavy’s draconic budget will be devastating for the state of Alaska and will have negative consequences for the rest of the US and the world. It is up to the Alaska legislature to stand up to Dunleavy’s short-term opportunism and veto his budget. Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia This article was amended on July 16 2019 to clarify that state funding of the university was cut by 41%. An earlier version stated that this was the size of the cut to the university’s overall budget, which is incorrect."
"Michael Barrett (Letters, 9 July) calls upon the religions to join with ecologists to take action on climate change as it offers “a compelling cause” to tackle declining memberships. We are already on board. Since Pope Francis’s letter to the world, Laudato Si’, Catholics have been reflecting on how we can work for climate justice. Thousands of our churches now run on renewable energy, while thousands of parishioners have taken to the streets to demand political action. Last month, for instance, nearly 1,500 Cafod supporters joined people from other faith communities as part of a climate and environment lobby of parliament. Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers – those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions.  So, people in faith communities are taking action. But not because it’s a membership drive. It’s because we hear the cry of the Earth and of the poor, who experience the injustice of climate change right now through lost lives and livelihoods. We care for our common home because it’s our moral duty to act.Christine AllenDirector, Catholic Agency for Overseas Development  • The government may be responding to the climate crisis like a “Dad’s Army” (Report, 10 July) but more than 120 local authorities led by all of the main political parties have declared that this really is a climate emergency and that they will go into battle with or without government support. Between us we have multibillion-pound budgets, cross party determination, increasing public support and some legislative powers. We are already building up some impressive examples of what can be done and are pooling our experience and expertise. But we can’t win the campaign our own: we need the government to send reinforcements, bringing legislation and resources to support renewable energy, zero-carbon building, public transport, carbon sequestration, action on biodiversity and much more.Cllr Kevin FreaCo-chair, UK Climate Emergency Network • Your coverage of the Committee on Climate Change’s report, with its stinging criticism of government failure to tackle climate change, does not sufficiently identify how the aviation industry needs to be held to immediate account. Given that parliament and many city councils and local authorities have declared a climate emergency, aviation should no longer be protected from scrutiny. The suggested action by the CCC is for a plan to be published limiting the increase in air traffic to 60%. This target is too generous, and is unattainable if all airports are allowed to expand as currently planned. It certainly does not enable the government to achieve net carbon neutrality. We call for no airport expansion, and for a process to begin to roll back existing flights. This could begin with the introduction of a frequent-flyer levy, banning short-haul flights, and forcing airlines to fly planes full (ie to share passengers and cancel low-density flights). A citizens’ assembly should sort the details of how to reduce air travel.Mark Smalley XR Bristol, John Adams Professor emeritus and chair of Stop Bristol Airport Expansion, Hilary Burn Chair, Parish Councils Airport Association, Stephen Clarke Green councillor, Bristol city council, Tanguy Tomes Environmental consultant, Tarisha Clarke Airport Action, Dr Steve Melia Senior lecturer in transport policy, University of the West of England • That the government’s climate advisers, the committee on climate change, reveal little preparation has taken place to deal with extreme weather isn’t, in itself, a shock. What is shocking is that the government, distracted by the not-so-smooth process of grappling with Brexit, still doesn’t appear to get it. By failing to see the problems with fracking despite all of the evidence, green-lighting climate-damaging infrastructure like more new roads, and blithely approving another runway at Heathrow, it’s clear the government has been resisting the hard and immediate policy work needed to kickstart a massive programme of change. This change will be for the unalloyed good of all of us, as well as make for a healthier environment – even if it possibly dents some multinationals’ balance sheets.Mike ChildsHead of science, Friends of the Earth • In Weatherwatch (9 July), Paul Brown highlighted the risks to nuclear power stations with climate change. As he pointed out, nuclear reactors are not a reliable source of base load power. The increasing number of heatwaves threatens their supply of cooling water, particularly in France, which exports electricity. In the UK, reactors use sea water, but there are dangers ahead there, too, with the risk of flooding from rising sea levels. Add to that the whopping costs and the dangers of terrorist attacks, technical failures, human error and radioactive contamination, and it is difficult to understand why politicians are supporting “new build” nuclear reactors. Why are they not choosing to put money and resource into sustainable energy sources?Rae StreetLittleborough, Lancashire  • The disavowal that leaves us heading for climate catastrophe was well captured on page 8 on 10 July, with your reports about “Dad’s Army” climate crisis preparations and David Attenborough’s warning that pollution will soon be as reviled as slavery sharing the page with an advert for a car with a twin power turbo engine and the exhortation “Don’t have fun.

Many have been watching the gradual development of Andreas Rossi’s “E-Cat,” a device Rossi claimed to produce heat from fusing nickel and hydrogen at commonly used temperatures, as opposed to those in core of a star.
Photo: NASA
The next big event, the release of a paper reporting on a month-long test in March by a group independent from Rossi and his partner, Industrial Heat, happened today. The results are pretty much what I was expecting and essentially completely positive.
In a nutshell, the device produced so much energy that only a nuclear reaction can explain it, reaction products were seen, but no nuclear radiation was detected.
The test ran with an E-Cat cell in three phases:
1) no fuel charge
This was to verify the test setup measurement equipment could accurately measure both the electrical power into the cell and the heat released from the cell by convective heating and black body radiation.
2) approximately 800 W input power for 10 days, this produced some 1600 W excess power.
3) approximately 900 W for the rest of the test, this produced some 2300 W excess power.
This confirms what supporters expected. While the COP (ratio of output power to input power) was lower than expected, the authors make it clear that they deliberately ran the cell at low power to reduce the chance of thermal power.  They point out that the adding a little more than 100 W input power increased output by about 700 W.  That incremental amount is more in line with what was expected.
That’s mostly all that’s important – put power in, get significantly more power out. From what I’ve read, Industrial Heat has not yet used E-Cats to make high pressure steam and then electricity.  That may merely mean they haven’t settled on the mechanical design of the reactor, there’s no point in making a boiler until then.
The most interesting part of the report is the isotopic analysis of the fuel before the test run and the “ash” afterwards. The bottom line is that the reviewers have no idea what is happening during the test run.  They are utterly mystified and reject most of their speculation.
The fuel charge, only one gram, was assayed before the start of the test. The key components were determined to be nickel (Ni), lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), and hydrogen (H).  (Two assay methods found carbon (C) and oxygen (O), but the paper seems to dismiss them citing the tiny granules of powder they used.)  The Ni and H were expected per Rossi’s descriptions in the past.

He also referred to a catalyst, saying it was inexpensive and not an impediment to wide scale deployment. The assay suggests the catalyst is
LiAlH4 which releases monoatomic hydrogen when it is heated, fitting the speculation about the catalyst’s role.
Each element was found to have the naturally ocurring ratios of its isotopes.
There had been speculation that Rossi used nickel enriched with particular isotopes, but apparently not.
The ash after the test run was also assayed. The small samples involved seem to preclude measuring the actual weight of various isotopes, so the paper concentrates on the percentages.  It would have been nice to have accurate weights.
Natural nickel is primarily 58Ni and 60Ni. Those were nearly completely consumed, and the nickel in the ash was nearly all 62Ni.  I had expected Ni + H leading to Cu, but several of the relevant Cu isotopes are radioactive, 62Ni is stable.
Lithium may not be a catalyst at all – natural Li is nearly all 7Li, a surface assay of the ash showed the lithium was nearly all 6Li. I’m no nuclear physicist, I’ll refrain from any speculation.  The authors explore a couple paths, but ultimately throw up their hands and simply say more study is needed.  Hydrogen wasn’t assayed – did it even participate?
All in all, this is a great, maybe historic, result. There has been plenty of evidence that the E-Cat works, but Rossi has always been directly involved.
Now we have an independent team working in their own space and with tools from their universities. They see it work and present multiple lines of evidence confirming it is a nuclear process.
That there is no explanation for the process is annoying, but won’t block commercialization of the E-Cat. The shouting isn’t over, the science has barely begun, but we may be at the start of civilization’s next major energy source.
Interesting times.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday parts of the German mainstream media have begun reporting on the 9th Extreme Weather Conference in Hamburg, which began today and is slated to end on Friday. The direct link to the program-pdf here. Of course the focus of the Congress will be on the claimed “increasing frequency of extreme weather events”.
In all 3000 experts are attending, along with 2500 Hamburg school pupils.
What especially raises eye brows is the fact that the event is sponsored by the Munich Re reinsurer, the biggest in the world. The Munich-Germany-based reinsurer of course stands to profit handsomely from the spreading of extreme weather fear; it makes it it a lot easier to jack up premiums (see “Spiegel Online doubts the catastrophe scenarios of the Munich Re“).
Also very murky is the identity of the organizer of the Congress: Institute for Weather and Climate Communication” (IWK). At their Die kalte Sonne website here, German skeptics Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt looked into who is behind the mysterious IWK? They write:
The result is sobering: Apparently the institute really does not have its own Internet platform. So we took a look at the legal page of wetterspiegel.de. Here indeed the “Institute for Weather and Climate Communication GmbH” is given. Listed as the managing directors are Frank Böttcher and Alexander Hübener. Frank Böttcher? Indeed we’ve written about him as well: “Extreme weather “expert” Frank Böttcher does not not know about the latest literature: Latest research results on global cyclone activity are damaging is climate-alarmist business“. Without climate fear and extreme weather alarm, the number of visitors for the commercialized Extreme Weather Congress would certainly be limited. Thus it’s little wonder that Böttcher, because of promotional reasons, is fervently preaching climatic doomsday to attract visitors into his auditorium.”

Lüning and Vahrenholt also look at a list of persons slated to appear: “Paul Becker of the German Weather Service, a climate alarmist to the bone. Peter Höppe of the Munich Re reinsurer will attend the introductory press conference, thus getting his sponsoring money’s worth.”
No skeptic was invited to the present at the Extreme Weather Congress. For the second year in a row Lüning and Vahrenholt were denied the opportunity to present there.
Vahrenholt and Lüning also ask themselves whether Mojib Latif will be able to muster the courage to disclose some inconvenient things that up to now he only has quietly admitted in the scientific literature. See “Mojib Latif: the proof of an anthropogenic climate contribution is difficult because the natural ocean cycles dominated” and “Mojib Latif in the presentation in USA: CO2 sensitivity was set too high by the IPCC“.
There is a bit of hope: “honest broker” and alarmism-critic Hans von Storch has also been invited, and so maybe he will infuse a little sobriety into the Hamburg climate panic-fest, see “Climate scientist Hans von Storch: Climate models possibly do not take solar activity sufficiently into account” and “Judith Curry prognosticates warming pause until the 2030s: Hans von Storch in such a case demands a vote of no-confidence against CO2“.
Overall, however, in view of the sponsorship by the world’s biggest player in the re-insurance industry, the murkiness surrounding the event’s organizers, and their exclusion of scientists with other views and data, the event has everything to do with serving corporate special interests rather than those of science.

"Kenya has been urged to halt construction of the country’s first ever coal-powered plant near the coastal town of Lamu, until an assessment is made of its environmental and cultural impact, in the latest setback to the $2bn project (£1.6bn). Plans for the 981MW station, backed by a Chinese-led consortium, are in limbo after Kenyan judges revoked the environmental licence at the end of June. They ruled the authorities had failed to carry out a rigorous environmental assessment and to inform local people of potential impacts.  Environmental campaigners – who took Amu Power and the Kenyan National Environment Management Authority to court over the station – hailed the ruling as a victory for grassroots lobbying. They had argued that the adverse effect the plant would have on local fishermen and farmland had not been considered. Unesco’s World Heritage Committee, in a meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan this week, called on Kenya to revise the environmental assessments of the coal plant and to consider the potential impact of pollution on the “fragile” stone buildings of Lamu old town, a 14th-century tourist destination and world heritage site. If Kenya fails to submit a new environmental impact statement by February 2020, Lamu could be added to its list of world heritage sites in danger, the committee said. Activists say the plant could trigger breathing problems for locals and acid rain as well as increase Kenya’s total greenhouse gas emissions by 700%. The plans lie in contrast to Kenya’s existing commitment to fighting the climate emergency, including generating two-thirds of its electricity by renewable sources and reducing its carbon footprint by a third by 2030. The fossil fuel plant was an example of the dilemmas faced by developing countries with rich environmental and cultural resources, activists said at the Unesco meeting. “One of the challenges Africa faces is the pursuit to modernise with large development projects as well as rapid and unplanned urbanisation that destroys rich cultural resources. Lamu is a key example of this,” said Mohammed Athman, a board member of Kenyan environmental organisation Save Lamu.  The US ambassador to Kenya, Kyle McCarter, has been widely criticised by activists for wading into the debate to argue that coal is environmentally sound, that the plant would boost the country’s economy and that a critical analysis of the project by a US thinktank amounted to the work of “highly paid protesters”. “Coal is the cleanest, least costly option,” the Trump-appointed former Republican senator in Illinois wrote on Twitter, ahead of the ruling on the 26 June. He also cited his experience with coal in his home state as evidence that fossil fuel would work well in Kenya. Mithika Mwenda, the executive director of Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, one of many groups opposing the initiative, raised concerns over the ambassador’s “absurd” comments. “What interest does the US have in the coal-fired project?” Mwenda said in a statement. “How will the economy grow if the Kenyan taxpayer is going to be subjected to hugely unsustainable debts, even before we can start producing power?” In sharp contrast to McCarter’s comments, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya told opponents of the plant on 28 June that he supported the will of the Kenyan people on whether or not they want a coal-fired station, according to a Kenyan newspaper.  A US state department official told the Guardian that the US backs an approach that takes into account “all forms of energy”, including renewables, and stressed electricity must be affordable and reliable to attract investment. “American companies and investors are ready to partner with Kenya to help them achieve an affordable and reliable power grid, in all forms of energy, to support the exponential growth expected in Kenya’s prosperous future using whichever source they choose,” the official said. Construction on the plant was due to begin in 2015, but has been subject to many delays, partly due to opposition from environmentalists. The backers of the initiative say it will help address Kenya’s frequent blackouts and secure energy needs by increasing energy output by nearly a third and generating power that would cost half of what consumers currently pay. But last month, a US thinktank said electricity will cost 10 times more than currently planned. Amu Power has said electricity from the plant will cost $0.072 a kW. However, the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in an independent study – the most comprehensive on the station’s cost so far – that the cost projections of the project are “unrealistically low”. It said the project would cost consumers more than $9bn, even if the station never generates any power, and recommended it be cancelled. The station could still be revived if a new environmental assessment addresses the concerns laid out in the June decision. Those defending the plan were given 30 days to appeal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Salzburg Austria ORF site here writes: “Despite climate change, winters in the Salzburg mountains over the past 30 years have not gotten warmer, rather they have gotten colder.”
0.9°C drop since 1984
The ORF site writes that this is based on a study commissioned by the Schmittenhöhe Bahnen. The ORF site adds: “Independent meteorologists confirmed the trend“. The study elaborates further:
The mean temperature over the winter months at Schmittenhöhe has fallen  0.9°C since 1984. That is from minus 3.8 to minus 4,7 percent.”
Obviously the ORF writer was sloppy here and likely meant “degrees Celsius”, and not “percent”.
“Surprising result”
The ORF also writes that the Schmittenhöhe Bahnen – who commissioned the study – reacted by saying it is “a surprising result”. Board Chairman Erich Egger says he is relieved that winters have not gotten warmer and that the future of the ski industry is intact.

However the ORF quotes meteorologist Bernd Niedermoser of the Salzburg Weather Service, who reminds that there has been “a significant warming” over the last 130 years and that it occurs in cycles, and that there will always be “periods where it will be colder for a short time.”
Tell it to the modelers.
More snow thanks to “global warming” 
Meanwhile Austrian site www.nachrichte.at writes that precipitation at the Pyhrn-Priel and Dachstein regions during the winter season has increased – in the form of snow. On the precipitation, it writes:
And because it is transported over to us by cold air masses from the North Sea, it comes down 90% as snow already at 1100 meters elevation.”
Yet, the Austrian alarmists refuse to let go of their climate change horror scenarios, insisting that by 2050 the “skiing fun will end” because of runaway global warming”.  The site sought out the opinion of Jürgen Schmude, Economics Geographer at the University of Munich:

Austria’s ski resorts could lose up to 30 days per year by then, should the average temperature indeed increase by 2°C.

By Ed Caryl
This is my comment on the Vienna Climate Waltz article Pierre just posted. I found the Vienna temperature data from GISS. It is listed under Wien/Hohe War, whatever that is.
My map application drops the pin nearly in the center of downtown from the GISS latitude and longitude numbers (which are notoriously inaccurate). The data file is complete from 1880 to the present, which is unusual. There are only two files in the GISS database, GHCN data before and after GISS homogenization. Here is a plot of those two files.

Figure 1 is a plot of Vienna annual temperature data before and after GISS homogenization, with the difference (the green trace). The difference scale is on the right, all scales in °C.
The homogenization has warmed the past and left the last 10 years unadjusted. This is unusual, as GISS usually cools the past and warms the present with their adjustments. The adjustment is probably for urban heat island effects, though they should be cooling the present and leaving the past alone.

Figure 2 is a plot of the last 16 years with trend lines.
There is a tenth of a degree adjustment for homogenization in the years 1998, 1999, and 2000. These adjustments change the cooling trend by more than 50%.

Curious George requested a 10-year average plot. Here is a centered 9-year average plot on the annual data. (It preserves the time accuracy better.)

Figure 3 is the annual homogenized temperatures with a 9-year centered average.


Figure 4 is a plot of seasonal temperatures (homogenized data).
While all seasons have gotten warmer in the last century, winter has the largest variation, but not much of a trend. I didn’t add the trends to Figure 4, but the numbers are: spring 1.29°/century, summer 1.41°/century, fall 0.73°/century, and winter 1.14°/century.

Figure 5 is a plot of the seasonal trends over the last 16 years.
The cooling in the last 16 years is all from the winters getting colder, at -0.382°C per decade.

"Two of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers are accelerating the drive towards greener vehicles by pledging to replace their existing fleet of vans with all-electric models by 2030. British Gas owner Centrica and SSE have committed to switch to electric cars and vans a decade ahead of the government’s ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles. British Gas will electrify its 12,500 vans, the third largest fleet of vehicles in the UK, to transport its 15,000 engineers across the country to customer homes. SSE said it would switch its 3,500 vehicles, the UK’s seventh biggest fleet of cars, to electric models, and install charging points for its 21,000 employees. The two companies – among the UK’s big six energy providers – will sign up to the pledge, organised by the Climate Group, alongside facilities management firm Mitie, which has signed up to a softer target. Mitie plans to switch 20% of its 3,500-strong car and van fleet to electric by 2020 and will install 800 charging points.  The Climate Group said the latest pledges mean 49 companies have agreed to remove more than 2m petrol and diesel vehicles from the world’s roads by 2030. Helen Clarkson, the pressure group’s chief executive, said: “These companies are sending a clear message that the direction of travel for transport is electric, inspiring their staff and customers to follow. Every major business must do the same.” The group is also calling on companies to double their energy productivity by 2030, by increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy waste. SSE has signed up to the energy efficiency pledge and said it has already reduced the energy use at its data centres by more than a fifth since 2016. Brian McLaren, a director at SSE, said the pledges were part of the company’s ambition to “deliver low carbon infrastructure in a sustainable way”. “Decarbonisation is at the heart of what we do and low-carbon emissions from transport is critical if the UK is to meet its net zero targets,” he said. Mitie has promised to keep replacing its cars and vans with electric options between 2020 to 2030, but said its progress would depend on the availability and affordability of vehicle charging infrastructure. Simon King, Mitie’s fleet director, said the interim 2020 target was still “an important step in the effort to combat climate change”. “It is challenging, but we all need to take responsibility for actions and commit to change,” he said. “We want to ensure our sizeable fleet is as green and sustainable as possible and show other companies that making the switch to electric vehicles is the right thing for their people, the planet and their pockets,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt is indeed stunning. A must-watch. It’s as damaging a performance on behalf of a cause that you will ever see.
EPA chief Gina McCarthy also says she doesn’t even know whose models policy is being based on.

She says that the models diverging from actual observations “on the whole makes no difference to the validity in the robustness of climate science that is telling us that we are facing an absolute challenge that we must address …blah blah blah…”
Sorry, but it makes all the difference in science. McCarthy thus confirms observational data mean nothing and that climate science is a religion at the EPA.
“Whose models? What projections?” she asks – as if she has no idea what’s going on at all. This is as incompetent as you will ever see.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe main media often avoid reporting catastrophes involving bitter cold winter conditions, as it may cause the public to doubt global warming. So it’s little wonder that they have opted not to report on an ongoing massive blizzard pounding the Russian Orient, northern parts of China and extending to northern Japan.
However, the smaller media outlets are picking up where the mainstream media is slacking off.
The French language www.catnet.net reports here on “a very powerful snowstorm” that has hit the Russian Orient and Northern China and pumped very cold Arctic air into the region. It writes:
The storm in particular hit the Khabarovsk and dell’Amnur regions with heavy snowfalls and icy winds in the sector of North-North East that have reached speeds of 120-130 km/hr over the Okhotsk Sea.”
catnet.net writes of widespread power outages and winds of 105 km/hr and 72 cm of snow in the region of Khabarovsk. The region of d’ell’Amnur also saw 50 cm of snow with winds of over 105 km/hr. The catnet.net reports that the city of Komsomolsk has been “completely paralyzed“.
The English-language news.xinhuanet.com writes of an “ongoing blizzard” that continues “pelting the region with snow” and temperatures falling to -17°C.
China’s CCTV News presents a video of the conditions here and reports, “Strong winds with heavy snow reduced visibility in Fuyuan to less than 50 meters, affecting local traffic.”
CCTV News here also reports of a 60-hour blizzard pounding China’s Heilongjiang province and continuing even today: “Outdoor temperatures reached as low as minus 20 degree Celsius and the accumulated snow is up to 90 cm deep, leaving residents struggling to open doors.”

"Climate crisis disasters are happening at the rate of one a week, though most draw little international attention and work is urgently needed to prepare developing countries for the profound impacts, the UN has warned. Catastrophes such as cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique and the drought afflicting India make headlines around the world. But large numbers of “lower impact events” that are causing death, displacement and suffering are occurring much faster than predicted, said Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary-general’s special representative on disaster risk reduction. “This is not about the future, this is about today.”  This means that adapting to the climate crisis could no longer be seen as a long-term problem, but one that needed investment now, she said. “People need to talk more about adaptation and resilience.” Estimates put the cost of climate-related disasters at $520bn a year, while the additional cost of building infrastructure that is resistant to the effects of global heating is only about 3%, or $2.7tn in total over the next 20 years. Mizutori said: “This is not a lot of money [in the context of infrastructure spending], but investors have not been doing enough. Resilience needs to become a commodity that people will pay for.” That would mean normalising the standards for new infrastructure, such as housing, road and rail networks, factories, power and water supply networks, so that they were less vulnerable to the effects of floods, droughts, storms and extreme weather. Until now, most of the focus of work on the climate crisis has been on “mitigation” – jargon for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and not to be confused with mitigating the effects of the climate crisis. The question of adapting to its effects has taken a distant second place, in part because activists and scientists were concerned for years that people would gain a false complacency that we need not cut emissions as we could adapt to the effects instead, and also because while cutting emissions could be clearly measured, the question of adapting or increasing resilience was harder to pin down. Mizutori said the time for such arguments had ran out. “We talk about a climate emergency and a climate crisis, but if we cannot confront this [issue of adapting to the effects] we will not survive,” she told the Guardian. “We need to look at the risks of not investing in resilience.” Many of the lower-impact disasters would be preventable if people had early warnings of severe weather, better infrastructure such as flood defences or access to water in case of drought, and governments had more awareness of which areas were most vulnerable. Nor is this a problem confined to the developing world, she said, as the recent forest fires in the US and Europe’s latest heatwave had shown. Rich countries also face a challenge to adapt their infrastructure and ways of protecting people from disaster. “Nature-based solutions”, such as mangrove swamps, forests and wetlands which could form natural barriers to flooding should be a priority, said Mizutori. A further key problem is how to protect people in informal settlements, or slums, which are more vulnerable than planned cities. The most vulnerable people are the poor, women, children, the elderly, the disabled and displaced, and many of these people live in informal settlements without access to basic amenities. Regulations on building standards must also be updated for the climate crisis and properly enforced, she said. One of the governance issues cited by Mizutori was that while responsibility for the climate crisis and greenhouse gas emissions was usually held in one ministry, such as the economics, environment or energy department, responsibility for infrastructure and people’s protection was held elsewhere in government.  “We need to take a more holistic view of the risks,” she said."

By Ed Caryl
One item on the list of catastrophes that the CAGW climatists claim is that at nearly 400 ppm, the CO2 concentration has never been as high in hundreds of thousands of years. The number quoted is flexible, sometimes 600,000, sometimes 800,000.
It is true that in the ice core figures, CO2 measures from 180 to 200 ppm during the coldest periods and peaks at around 300 ppm during the interglacial periods. But it is well known that the ice core measurement resolution is a few hundred years for recent times and spreads to a few thousand years for the most ancient measurements. Thus the ice core measurements can’t show short periods of high atmospheric CO2.
This was demonstrated in my last article on the brief spike of CO2 in the Younger Dryas period 12,800 years ago from the paper by Steinthorsdottir et al.

Figure 1
Figure 1 above is a plot of CO2 and Greenland temperature during the Younger Dryas. The purple diamond marks the time of the nano-diamond (ND) event as seen in the Greenland ice cores. The horizontal time error bars on the peak CO2 data bring the ND-event within the time  period of the CO2 peak. The stomata index is carbon 14 dated, which has a time error of ±150 years.

Figure 2 is a plot of temperature versus CO2 concentration from the Figure 1 data. The trend line shows that the relationship is negative; a temperature rise of 1°C occurs when CO2 falls by 2.5 ppm during the 2000 year period covered by the stomata proxy data. The R2 value is very low, indicating that this trend is very likely zero. It is apparent that the brief high CO2 concentration did not cause any warming, as it occurred when the temperature was approaching the lowest recorded by the ice core data.

Figure 3 is a plot of the Dome Concordia CO2 measurement over the last 22,000 years. The ND event time is marked by the red dot.
The ice core data can be seen to get smoother as it gets older. Only the stomata data shows the 400+ ppm peak at the ND event. The ice core data cannot show a brief spike in CO2, because at Dome C, the snow (firn) to ice transition takes 100 years or more to close the tiny bubbles that sample the atmosphere.
The ND event was probably caused by a kilometer-size comet that came into the atmosphere over what is now Canada. It likely came in at a shallow angle, like the Chelyabinsk object in February 2013. It is thought to have exploded over the Laurentide ice sheet, with some pieces impacting in what is now Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and others continuing on to impact as far away as the Pacific Ocean. The intense thermal flash ignited all the forests of North America, leaving a soot layer laced with impact-generated particles and raising the CO2 level to more than 400 ppm as seen in southern Sweden in the leaves of the following year.
There is another stomata study, covering eastern Canada. The trees in eastern Canada were burned away, so the stomata data from one location, Pine Ridge Pond, shows a lower peak, and another, Splann Pond, no peak at all. The trees furnishing the leaf stomata needed to re-grow, which took 20 to 40 years or longer, depending on the number of viable seeds in the ground and local conditions. During that time, CO2 was falling back to normal levels.

 Figure 4 is from Mcelwain, J. C., Mayle, F. E. and Beerling, D. J. 2002. Stomatal evidence for a decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the Younger Dryas stadial: a comparison with Antarctic ice core records. J. Quaternary Sci., Vol. 17 pp. 21–29. ISSN 0267-8179.
This data is from Pine Ridge Pond in New Brunswick. The top line is a summer temperature proxy from sub-fossil chironomid remains (Midges). The numbers 1 and 2 marks the peaks of the Bölling and Allerød warm oscillations. The lower traces are the stomata proxies with upper and lower 95% bounds. The number 2 here marks the ND event CO2 peak. The CO2 data point at 1 does not appear in the Figure 1 data from Sweden. The total time for the CO2 level to fall back from 400 ppm to 200 ppm appears to be 100 years or less.
Both Figures 1 and 4 show temperature slowly rising during the Younger Dryas as CO2 concentration is slowly falling.

Figure 1 has a ±150-year error in the carbon 14 age data. The spike in CO2 does not line up with the ND event. In Figure 5, a 150-year correction is applied to line up these dates.

Figure 5 is a plot of the southern Sweden stomata data shifted 150 years to the right to align with the ND event.
Figure 6 below is the corresponding XY plot of Figure 5. In the Swedish data there is no stomata data on the temperature rise out of the YD period between 11,500 and 11,750 years ago. There appears to be no relationship between CO2 and temperature. The trend is very close to zero with extremely low R and R2 values.

There should be a CO2 increase as temperature rises and the oceans begin to out-gas dissolved CO2. We see this increase in the longer Canadian stomata data in Figure 4.

Figure 7 is an XY plot from the Figure 4 data. Here we see that CO2 rises at about 4 to 8 ppm for each degree of summer temperature rise at the Canadian latitudes. There appears to be a small delay of up to 150 years between temperature rise and CO2 rise as CO2 peaks always appear after temperature peaks by about this amount in both stomata data sets.
From these two papers we learn the following:
– A large sudden rise in CO2 decays away in 100 years or less.
– A large sudden rise in CO2 does not cause a rise in temperature.
– A large rise in temperature causes CO2 to rise, not the other way around. All the rises in CO2, including in modern times, came after temperature increases.
– The delay between temperature rise and CO2 rise is somewhere between zero and 150 years.
We can see that delay in modern times. The rise in temperature after the little ice age began in the late 19th century, accelerating after 1910. The rise in CO2 began about the time Keeling started measuring it in 1959, accelerating after that, a delay of about 50 years.
Is the rise in CO2 all due to temperature rise? No. It is a combination of temperature change and increased fossil carbon emissions. Will those emissions cause temperature to rise further? No. The large rise at the ND event caused NO temperature rise in either of the data sets above.

"Australia is responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and could be contributing as much as 17% by 2030 if the pollution from its fossil fuel exports is factored in, research says. Under climate accounting rules that record carbon dioxide released within a country, Australia is responsible for about 1.4% of global emissions. The analysis by science and policy institute Climate Analytics found more than twice that, another 3.6%, are a result of Australia’s coal, oil and gas exports. If all proposed fossil fuel developments went ahead, including Adani’s Carmichael mine, other proposed coal developments in the Galilee Basin and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Western Australia, and other countries adopted policies consistent with the Paris agreement, Australia could be linked to up to 17% of carbon pollution. The Australian Conservation Foundation, which commissioned the research, said this scenario showed Australia was on a path to being one of the worst contributors to a climate emergency. “Australia is now the number one exporter of both coal and gas and we are scheduled to push that off the charts in the next 10 years. We are looking to become an emissions super-power,” the foundation’s Gavan McFadzean said. “We are fortunate to have many of our emissions counted elsewhere but that doesn’t mean we’re not responsible for them.” There is no likelihood greenhouse accounting rules will change to reflect pollution embedded in exports but the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has suggested Australia should get credit for the role he says the booming LNG industry is playing in lowering global emissions by displacing coal in Asia. Canada has made a similar claim and said it should be allowed under the Paris agreement. Taylor has not said if emissions from Australia’s coal exports should also be considered under this approach. Energy analysts say there is little evidence Australian LNG is displacing coal. A report last week by the government’s chief economist found in Japan, Australia’s biggest LNG market, gas was expected to face increasing competition from emissions-free nuclear and renewable energy. The Climate Analytics report says Australia’s support for new fossil fuel developments is at odds with its commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement goals of keeping global heating well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. Scientists say meeting the Paris goals will require fossil fuel emissions to peak soon, then decline rapidly. Average global temperatures are already about 1C hotter than pre-industrial levels. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia provides nearly 30% of coal and more than 20% of gas traded on global markets. Export earnings from the industries topped $117bn last financial year. In the wake of the Coalition’s election victory, both the government and opposition are supporting the opening of the Galilee coal basin in central Queensland, starting with the long-stalled Adani Carmichael mine. Coalition and Labor senators last week voted for a motion to this effect. Six mining proposals in the Galilee have been approved, but none has begun construction. Analysts have questioned whether these projects are viable given the lack of existing infrastructure, the cost of transporting the commodity hundreds of kilometres to an export port and uncertainty about coal’s future as the world moves to cleaner energy sources. While Australia’s emissions have risen each year since 2015, government greenhouse reports emphasise that per capita carbon pollution has fallen to its lowest level in 29 years. Climate Analytics says Australia remains one of the world’s highest emitters under this measure and if exported emissions were included the per head figure would leap from about 20 tonnes to nearly 70 tonnes a year each. Other countries that would have an increased responsibility for global emissions if fossil fuel exports were counted against the nation of origin would include Russia, the US, several countries in the Middle East and Indonesia."
" The UK is “sleepwalking into a crisis of childhood” with youngsters struggling to cope with the pressure to achieve at school, fit in with their peers and cope with wider anxieties over issues such as Brexit, poverty and the climate crisis. A survey of 5,000 children, parents and grandparents by the charity Action for Children found a strong shared perception that modern childhoods were getting worse amid what the charity called unprecedented social pressures.  Two-thirds of parents and grandparents felt childhood was getting worse, and a third of children agreed. All agreed bullying – both online and offline – was the main problem, followed by pressure to fit in socially, which had become more intense as a result of social media. Children from low-income families were significantly more likely than their wealthier counterparts to report worries about a range of issues from bullying to mental health, although children from all backgrounds were vulnerable to these anxieties. Nine out of 10 children – some as young as 11 – said they worried about “adult” issues. Roughly half said they were anxious about poverty and homelessness, terrorism, inequality and the environment, while about four in 10 worried about Brexit, sexism and racism. Julie Bentley, the Action for Children chief executive, said: “The country is sleepwalking into a crisis in childhood and, far from being carefree, our children are buckling under the weight of unprecedented social pressures, global turmoil and a void in government policy which should keep them well and safe. “Our research shows children worry about poverty, homelessness and terrorism, and the vulnerable children we work with every day are facing traumas like domestic abuse or neglect, going hungry or struggling with their mental health, without the support they desperately need.” Bentley called on the government to establish a national childhood strategy and reinvest in council children’s services, whose funding was  cut by a third between 2010 and 2017. “For the past decade the government has been asleep on the job when it comes to investing in our children,” Bentley said. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said: “Although in many ways this is the best time yet to be young, I certainly recognise the pressures and worries young people feel. Growing up has never been easy, but technology and social media can exacerbate the need to fit in and the perception of others’ perfect lives, as well as make it harder to leave being bullied behind at the school gates. “But we are equipping young people for adulthood in a changing world, by identifying mental health problems and providing support in schools, encouraging young people to gain resilience and skills through activities such as sport and music, and teaching young people in school how to navigate the online world safely and constructively.” Children from low income families were strikingly more pessimistic about their childhoods: 39% thought childhood was getting worse, compared to 25% from higher income backgrounds. Poorer children were significantly more likely to worry about not having enough money (44% to 18%). By the same token, the poorest children had greater concerns about their mental health (31% compared to 20% of those from higher income families), and were also more likely to be worried about the mental and physical health of family and friends (34% to 24%). Louise Baroy, 43, a single parent from Newcastle, said she felt her children worried more, and about more things, than she had when she was young. “They ask me things like: ‘Will the world still be here when I’m older?’ or: ‘Are we poor?’ I have to sit down and talk to them to put things in perspective. I say we’ll always be OK, because you have got me. We are poor but so are a lot of people, and it doesn’t matter.” Steve Reed MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Children, commenting on the report, said:  “Tory and Lib Dem cuts to children’s services and help for struggling families have contributed to a national crisis facing our children, with one in three councils warning they no longer have the funding they need to safeguard the most vulnerable.   “No society that loves its children can treat them like this. The Government must learn the lessons of this hard-hitting report and make Britain’s children their priority rather than giveaways for the super-rich.” • This article was amended on 9 July 2019 to add a comment from the Labour party."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe coming age of power cannibalism…Germany on the verge of committing energy suicide
By Fred F. Mueller
German politicians see themselves as the saviors of our climate. In the early 1990s German politicians started the policies that ultimately culminated in the “Energiewende”, which aims to eliminate nuclear power generation and some 76% of the fossil fuel power generation. By 2050 some 80% of power generation should come from “renewable” green sources such as wind, solar, biomass, waste incineration and hydro. Since the volatile sources of wind and solar power will have to contribute the lion’s share, politicians reluctantly concede 20% of the energy coming from reliable fossil power sources.
Germany’s endeavor is indeed breathtaking. A look at Figure 1 shows in detail how massively Germany had once relied upon fossil and nuclear power sources to secure a highly reliable power supply. These sources were controllable and highly reliable. And because Germany’s topology offers only limited possibilities for hydropower, that renewable source is minimal.

Figure 1: In 1990 the German grid was able to count on conventional power sources which were controllable and highly reliable. Renewable hydropower accounted for only 3.6 %
Today, after some two decades of massive green energy policy, the situation has changed dramatically. Wind, solar, biomass and waste incineration plants have been promoted to such an extent that together with hydropower, the share of “green energy” today has reached 25.8 % of the country’s total electric power production. This resulted from Germany’s EEG renewable energy feed-in act which guarantees producers fixed rates for 20 years and forces power companies to buy up all the renewable power produced, regardless of the market conditions. The result has been a massive oversupply which has led to steep price drops on power trading floors, which in turn have pushed fossil fuel utilities to and beyond their profitability limits. Surplus production has been repeatedly dumped onto neighboring markets and resulted in massive disturbances for the respective national power grids. Readers interested in a more detailed description of the policy might have a look at the article of Marita Noon [NOON].
Capacity without control
The problem with the “renewable” power sources of wind and solar is their intrinsic volatility coupled with their poor capacity utilization rates of only 17.4% for wind and 8.3% for solar (average values for Germany).
That poor utilization rate means one has to build up huge overcapacities in order to achieve a certain amount of power production. Worse, the power source fluctuates wildly according to weather conditions. As a consequence, Germany has to maintain a dual power generation infrastructure that comprises a grossly overinflated capacity of “renewable” wind and solar power plants shadowed by a full scale backup set of conventional plants. These conventional power sources must always be on standby, ready to take over when weather conditions aren’t favorable. The production-fluctuation range of the “renewables” wind and solar is incredibly wide and volatile. For example in Germany there is an installed nameplate capacity of nearly 73,000 MW. Yet the minimum power output in Germany in 2014 from both sources was a meager 29 MW (only 0.04% of installed capacity) while the maximum value was 38,000 MW (48%).
The massive buildup in wind and solar power has already resulted in a considerable nominal overcapacity of “renewable” power sources.
The combined rated capacity of all “renewable” power sources already reaches about 87,000 MW, which is the maximum power consumption the grid has been designed to secure. Additionally, a minimum conventional power station capacity of some 28,000 MW has to be constantly connected to the grid in order to secure supply stability. As a result the risk of the grid reaching an oversupply situation if weather conditions are favorable for both wind and solar power plants is growing with every additional “renewable” plant that comes online. Currently 5,000 – 6,000 MW are getting added each year. That situation is aggravated by the fact that there exists no technology to absorb and store any noticeable quantities of oversupply. Neighboring countries are already taking measures to fend off surplus-power-dumping that could destabilize their grids.
Power cannibalism has already started
The result is a grid which at times is so oversupplied with power that something will have to give. Fossil fuel power plants have been throttled to the point where they are no longer profitable and many power companies have started mothballing them, so quickly in fact that Germany had to pass legislation forcing producers to keep their fossil plants on stand-by, and to do so even if they lost money. Even the reliable “classic” renewable power sources – e.g. hydropower – are starting to suffer because most are not supported by government schemes.
As the build-up in renewable capacity continues, even the subsidized “renewable” power sources will sooner rather than later be forced into fierce competition for access to the grid whenever the weather conditions turn favorable. One can speculate that within just a couple of years, the first “renewable” energy sources will slowly be driven out of the market because of oversupply. Eventually the renewable power producers will be forced to cannibalize each other in an increasingly fierce competition for privileged access to the power grid as the unwanted events of over-supply become increasingly more frequent.

Things are set to get much worse
Normally, one would think that a government confronted with such a situation would stop at this point and wait for a technically and commercially viable solution for storing the increasing amounts of produced surplus electric energy – for use during times when weather conditions are less favorable. Unfortunately no such storage solution is currently available at the required scale, and anything being proposed so far is either much too expensive or has efficiency factors that are not worth discussing.
Yet Germany has a unique peculiarity: its leaders sometimes exhibit a stunning inability to recognize when the time has come to abandon a lost cause. So far €500 billion has already been invested in the “Energiewende”, which is clearly emerging as a failure. Yet all political parties continue to throw their full weight behind the policy rather than admitting it is a failure (which would be tantamount to political suicide). Instead, the current government coalition has even decided to shift into an even higher gear on the path to achieving its objective of generating 80% of German electric power from “renewable” sources by 2050. If the situation is practically unmanageable now with 25% renewable energy, it’ll be an uncontrollable disaster when (if) it reaches 80%.
If the government sticks to its targets, the share of the different power sources will probably appear as in Figure 2. Currently just 26% has been achieved so far, and the existing biomass share of some 7% is more or less doomed and thus will also have to be replaced by wind and solar. One can easily see how daunting the task that still lies ahead really is.

Figure 2. The official goal of achieving 80% power supply from “renewable” sources by 2050 requires further massive investments in wind and solar power technologies. Imagine the huge power supply fluctuations one can expect to see from wind and sun. 
Waiting for the grand finale
The real risks that lie ahead for the German power generating infrastructure become more recognizable if one looks at the nameplate capacity buildup that has taken place, e.g. just over the past five years, and compares it to what will additionally be needed by 2050, see Figure 2. Keeping in mind that €500 billion have already been contracted and will have to be paid by the consumer, one gets an idea of the proportions of the task still to be tackled in the coming years.

Figure 3. The installed nameplate power production capacities for wind, solar and biomass as of 2014 has already severely burdened the German consumer with costs of about €500 billion. That will dwarfed by what lies ahead, if politicians don’t change course. Note how 376,000 MW of wind and sun capacity may be installed to ensure meeting the country’s roughly 70,000 MW of demand.
Apart from the sheer dimensions of the costs that lie ahead, the additional cannibalism aspect will grow to enormous proportions. Since an installed wind and solar capacity of some 73,000 MW in 2014 yielded a combined maximum power output of 38,000 MW, the 376,000 MW that are to be installed by 2050 will generate a peak output of 196,000 MW to a grid that might just be able to take up between 40,000 and 90,000 MW. That means, depending on the weather, between 106,000 and 156,000 MW will have to be dumped somewhere else.
In the fight to get power into an often times severely overloaded grid, that’s when cannibalism amongst “renewable” power sources will really become intense. Will wind farmers sabotage solar plantations? Will solar owners sabotage wind turbines? Time will tell, maybe much sooner than we think.

"Indoor levels of carbon dioxide could be clouding our thinking and may even pose a wider danger to human health, researchers say. While air pollutants such as tiny particles and nitrogen oxides have been the subject of much research, there have been far fewer studies looking into the health impact of CO2.  However, the authors of the latest study – which reviews current evidence on the issue – say there is a growing body of research suggesting levels of CO2 that can be found in bedrooms, classrooms and offices might have harmful effects on the body, including affecting cognitive performance. “There is enough evidence to be concerned, not enough to be alarmed. But there is no time to waste,” said Dr Michael Hernke, a co-author of the study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, stressing further research was needed. Writing in the journal Nature Sustainability, Hernke and colleagues report that they considered 18 studies of the levels of CO2 humans are exposed to, as well as its health impacts on both humans and animals. Traditionally, the team say, it had been thought that CO2 levels would need to reach a very high concentration of at least 5,000 parts per million (ppm) before they would affect human health. But a growing body of research suggests CO2 levels as low as 1,000ppm could cause health problems, even if exposure only lasts for a few hours. The team say crowded or poorly ventilated classrooms, office environments and bedrooms have all been found to have levels of CO2 that exceed 1,000ppm, and are spaces that people often remain in for many hours at a time. Air-conditioned trains and planes have also been found to exceed 1,000ppm. “Indoor environments are of much more concern presently and for many people that is where they spend 60-80% of their time,” said Hernke, although projections suggest by 2100 some large cities might reach outdoor CO2 levels of 1,000ppm for parts of the year. The team found a number of studies have looked at the impact of such levels on human cognitive performance and productivity. In one study of 24 employees, cognitive scores were 50% lower when the participants were exposed to 1,400ppm of CO2 compared with 550ppm during a working day.  The team additionally looked at the impact of CO2 levels on animals, finding that a few hours’ exposure to 2,000 ppm was linked to inflammatory responses that could lead to damage to blood vessels. There is also tentative evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to levels between 2,000 and 3,000ppm is linked to effects including stress, kidney calcification and bone demineralisation. The team add that rising outdoor levels of CO2 will mean rising indoor levels – a situation that could be exacerbated by greater use of certain air-conditioning units, people spending more time inside, energy-saving building techniques, and increasing urbanisation. Any health impacts, they add, might be particularly problematic for children or those with health conditions that might exacerbate the effects. And even if the impacts are reversible, said Hernke, it would depend on people being able to access air with low levels of CO2. “The question is what happens over the very long term when you are unable to go outside and, as it were, have that carbon sucked back out of you?” Dr Gary Fuller, an air pollution scientist at King’s College London, said his team had been measuring CO2 levels in London for the past decade. While levels rarely reached 1,000ppm, he said, they often exceeded 750ppm along busy roads. “Unless we decarbonise heating and transport then these peaks will worsen as the global background increases,” he said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany readers will recall the climate bet for charity this site and its readers (the coolists) entered into against the climate alarmists, principally climate loudmouth Dana Nuccitelli and Rob Honeycutt, back in January 2011.
The coolists maintain that the 2011 – 2020 decade will be the same or cooler than the 2001 – 2010 decade. The alarmists of course are absolutely convinced that the current decade will be warmer.
Listening to the media lately, one might think that the coolists are getting trounced. Nothing could be further from the truth. The bet is based on the RSS and UAH satellite data, and they tell us a different story. Nuccitelli and his buddies can cite NOAA, GISS or NCDC all they want, but those datasets are not going to matter come 12/31/2020.
Robin Pittwood of the Kiwithinker has been so kind to tabulate the race so far as it develops. The first four years of the decade are now behind us, and Robin tells the coolists are maintaining a slight lead. Yes, this decade so far is running COOLER than the previous one! Hardly a good development for the Nuccitelli & Co. The dang oceans must have eaten up all the heat.

Chart shows this decade continues to be cooler than the previous one. Source: Robin Pittwood of the Kiwthinker. 
With the current CO2 emissions trajectory running at the IPCC’s worst case scenario, this decade so far theoretically should have been at least a good 0.2°C warmer, and certainly not cooler. Something must have gone terribly wrong for the cocky climate boy-wonder in California.
Robin writes:
We are now 40% through the race … and clearly it is still close with the coolists in the lead by half a nose.

Now back to the hype we’re hearing about the ‘hot’ 2014. Notice that during 2014 (months 37 to 48) the green line just keeps trucking along at the same basic slope as it has for the past few years and much of the previous decade too. There was even a small El Nino in 2014, whose effect is conspicuous by its absence. Maybe the heat that is missing in the observed atmospheric temperature trend is hiding in the ocean?  ;-)”
So we’ve got another 6 years to go and now is a good time to speculate how those might go. Personally I expect 2015 to be a warm one as well, because of the current Tiny Tim El Nino. But then we all know what happens after an El Nino. Right, global temperatures tend to drop due to La Nina that follows.
Also boding ill for Nuccitelli and Co. is the projection that the current solar cycle will soon be winding down and so it is quite possible we will be seeing a cool period around 2018, similar to what we saw back around 2008. Indeed it’s too early to call it for the coolists, but I must say I’m quite comfortable with our current position.
Let’s assume that the coolists do win the bet and thus deliver the major upset. How will the warmists react? Are they going to cry foul? Or are they going to be relieved and a bit happy because the planet is not warming like they thought. That would be the rational reaction.
I doubt very much Dana is sweating about this at all. He’s a master rationalizer and will creatively concoct a way to deny it.
Awhile back at this site William “Winston” Connelly demanded that the terms of the bet be modified. Sorry, it is a bit late for that, and it’s not his bet anyway.
Should the coolists win, the warmists are going to have a lot explaining to do. But they are well prepared, as already there is a huge supply of excuses out there for them to choose from.
And even if the warmists should somehow eke out a victory, it’ll be quite a hollow one because they all claimed it would be min. 0.2° warmer. A few hundredths warmer would also take the air out of the alarmism.
Fun blogging lies ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScreaming bloody murder over nothing? Keep in mind that RSS recently released the satellite measured global temperature for 2014 and found it is not even close to a new record. Three days ago one of Germany’s leading climate science sites Science Skeptical issued the following comment.
============================
Global Temperature Record 2014?
By Michael Krueger
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
A new temperature record for Germany has been announced by the DWD German Weather Service. With 10.3°C the warmest year since 1881 has been measured. Here are the facts.
2014 was the warmest year in Germany since 1881, but the warmest 12-months occurred from July 2006 to June 2007 with a mean of 11.3°C. Therefore the annual mean for 2006/2007 as 1°C over the current annual mean.

Chart depicts Germany’s temperature since 1761. Rose line is the annual mean temperature and the dark red line depicts the 5-year smoothing. 
Moreover since 2000 Germany’s temperature has barely risen – in contradiction to atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

How does the global temperature appear?
There are different datasets available for global tempertaure. I’m selecting the most alarmist, which comes from NASA. The gray shading shows the monthly mean values and the red curve is the smoothed annual mean (over 12 months).

Since 1880 the global temperature has risen about 0.8°C, i.e. not even a full degree. Since 1998 (a powerful El-Nino-year) there’s been practically no rise. What follows is a blow-up for the recent period.

In 2007 and 2010 it was just as warm as in 2014, or even warmer. We’re talking about 1/100 °C, which is deep inside the range of uncertainty. Yet the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 continued their steady rise. Based on these data, spreading climate alarmism is complete hyperbolism.
Very likely in the days ahead NASA will be announcing a global temperature record that in reality never was.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany of us are familiar with climate jihadist/ambassador Leonardo DiCaprio’s über-hypocritical lifestyle of cruising on billionaire mega yachts, private jets and living in huge mansions. Well, it doesn’t end there by any means.
There are times when DiCaprio actually has to slum it, and put up with travel on the road, along with the rest of the world’s lowly mortals.
To help the Hollywood superstar cope with such horrible hardships, a “rolling palace” gets used, this according to Steve Austin of WQYK here. Hat-tip Graeme No.3.
DiCaprio’s monster-size vehicle is reportedly supplied by KING KONG Production Vehicles Inc.
According to the company, it is a 53-foot “celebrity suite” that includes extra capacity air conditioning and heating systems, large hot water heating system, heated floors, fireplace, home theatre, and plasma TV. According to the KING KONG website:
No expense will be spared on the luxurious interior, with only the finest fabrics, fixtures, appliances and floor coverings hand picked by our interior designers.”

These are precisely the sorts of things the rest of the world’s citizens are to shun if there is any chance of rescuing the planet. The following YouTube video unabashedly boasts about all the features the rolling palace sports, such as a $50,000 shower!

The total price tag for the “celebrity suite” is $1.5 million and probably consumes by itself as much energy (diesel fuel) as three American homes. And even if it did use renewable power, the manufacture and transport of all the components to assemble the palace leaves a carbon footprint that is as big as a crater.
What’s really amazing is that DiCaprio expects us to take him and his planet-saving message seriously. It’s all worse than a B-rated comedy.
These people are truly spoiled phonies with a few loose screws.

"Donald Trump is arguing he has made America an environmental leader, despite moving to gut dozens of rules meant to safeguard clean air and water and rescinding every major US effort to stem the climate crisis.  In remarks delivered at the White House on Monday, Trump said protecting America’s “incredible natural splendor” is a “shared obligation that brings us together today”. He claimed the environment has been a top priority since the start of his administration. “We want the cleanest air. We want crystal clean water, and that’s what we’re doing and that’s what we’re working on so hard,” he said. Although he never mentioned climate change, Trump said the US has reduced heat-trapping emissions more than any other nation. That is true, although the US remains the biggest historical emitter, contributing to the crisis. The country also increased its climate pollution last year, and a new analysis finds it is far behind on meeting the climate goals it once promised other countries. The speech could be intended to temper Americans’ concerns that his administration is ignoring the climate crisis. Polls show a majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the issue and Democrats competing for the presidential nomination have been rolling out proposals to cut pollution. The 2020 presidential candidate and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will this week propose the declaration of a climate emergency. The US is the only nation in the world that will not back a global agreement to limit the heat-trapping pollution experts say is already linked with weekly disasters. Trump routinely claims the US has the cleanest air and water in the world, which is not true. One analysis from Yale and Columbia universities ranks the US 27th for overall environmental performance. That analysis does, however, rank the US as No 1 for drinking water. America has seen significant reductions in pollution since the 1970s but critics say the president is undercutting laws that have provided that progress. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that air pollution kills 200,000 Americans each year, more than those who die from auto accidents or gun violence. Joe Goffman, a senior lawyer at the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama, said Trump has been stalling environmental efforts since he signed an early executive order, in March 2017, to unwind Obama policies. “From his very first weeks in office the president has made it a priority to go backwards in terms of air quality and climate protections,” Goffman said. In the last month, Trump’s agencies have rescinded an Obama administration rule to limit the heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other pollutants from coal plants and granted a pollution waiver to allow year-round sales of gasoline with more ethanol. Trump argued that the Obama administration would have let polluting countries off the hook while causing higher gasoline and electricity prices with its climate efforts. “We are doing a very tough job and not everybody knows it,” he said, touting efforts to clean up marine debris and hazardous waste sites and limit childhood lead exposure. Andrew Wheeler, the EPA administrator, claimed the US is making “tremendous” progress under Trump. And the energy secretary, Rick Perry, called the event “the chance to tell a story that often doesn’t get told”, before quickly noting that the US is the top oil producer in the world. Jill Tauber, the vice-president of climate litigation at Earthjustice, told the Guardian: “We are seeing climate progress. We do have important protections in place for clean air and clean water but it is in spite of, not because of, the efforts of his administration.” According to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, 62% of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of the climate crisis. “On the one hand it’s just so beyond the pale and completely absurd that he would have the gall to give a speech touting his environmental record,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice-president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters. “He must be seeing the polls showing that when it comes to the environment in particular, his polls are really in the toilet. Obviously that’s for a very good reason.” Mustafa Ali, the vice-president of the National Wildlife Federation who was the environmental justice liaison under Obama, said: “The president lives in a billionaire bubble and is not dealing with the reality that most communities in our country are dealing with, especially our most vulnerable communities.” He said the electricity rule rollback, as well as weakened rules for pollution from cars and methane from oil and gas drilling, were particularly hurting communities of color. Trump agencies have also instituted changes to the way they consider science and seen declines in enforcement of environmental crimes."
"Robin McKie left the crucial point about population to the very end of his otherwise excellent article (“Eight billion up: we can’t go on like this”, Focus). It is the lifestyle of a small proportion of the population in the developed world that is responsible not only for the burning of fossil fuels causing global heating, but for the massive impact on the environment of agribusiness and our rapacious appetite for any resources Mother Earth can provide. As the US environmentalist Bill McKibben said: “My daughter, four at this writing, has already used more stuff and added more waste to the environment than most of the world’s residents do in a lifetime. In my 37 years I have probably outdone small Indian villages.” Eileen PeckBenfleet, Essex  It was a pleasure to see my father’s farces being recalled by Vanessa Thorpe (“Tour de farce: how the West End rediscovered joy of broad comedy”, News). Farce’s heyday was not from the 60s to the 80s, however. It was successful almost throughout the 20th century. My dad [the actor-manager Brian Rix] had a fairly successful 1950s, for example. In that decade he was in three plays at the Whitehall, totalling more than 4,000 performances. By 1961, the Whitehall farces had broken the record as London’s longest running farce team. Jonathan RixHenfield, West Sussex In this time of political turmoil, with parliament and political parties stuck in infighting, no group has done more to keep the country running than the civil service, and no group has received as little praise. It is they who handled the detail of the Brexit negotiations, despite contradictory and unrealistic demands from parliament. It is civil servants who have made sure we are as prepared as possible for no deal. And while ministers have checked out to focus on internal leadership elections, civil servants have kept the ship of state afloat. As a reward, civil servants have been subjected to sustained attacks from across the political spectrum. We have seen a malicious briefing campaign against individual civil servants involved in Brexit negotiations, attacks on Treasury officials when their forecasts warn of the dangers of no deal and the disgraceful attempt to blame civil servants for the national security leak involving Huawei. Then just a few weeks ago we learned that civil servants will once again receive some of the worst pay awards in the public sector, far below what MPs have received. The culmination has been the disgraceful and unprecedented treatment of Sir Kim Darroch. This episode is extraordinary and shameful, but it is part of a wider culture of abusing civil servants that has been allowed to develop over the last few years. Civil servants cannot respond to these attacks, and must not be a punchbag for politicians from the right or left. They are not part of a secretive deep state; they are deeply committed men and women doing their best to serve their country. If only more politicians would act in the same manner.Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect unionDave Penman, general secretary of FDA union   Over the past four years, we have watched the unchecked spread of vicious antisemitism – anti-Jewish racism – in the Labour party with bewilderment and disgust – all the more so since we respected Labour’s long previous history of fighting racism, and its many brave and decent members. As accusations of antisemitism became too insistent to ignore, the Labour leadership set out to change the narrative from hate to housekeeping. Yes, there were minor issues, the Labour leadership conceded, but those related only to the time it was taking to identify the few actual or seeming antisemites in the party and the occasionally flawed system of dealing with them. Otherwise, all suggestions that racist hate against Jews was becoming endemic to Labour were mendacious, mischievous and malign. Now, after the BBC’s Panorama programme, we can see for ourselves what is and isn’t false. The extent of Labour’s antisemitism, the degree to which it has been protected, sanctioned and propagated by the leadership faction, can brook no further denial; the labyrinthine attempts to deflect attention from the problem and discredit officials supposedly charged with identifying and rooting it out, are now laid bare. There is nowhere left for the Labour leadership to hide. It is clear this is not just about Jeremy Corbyn but the pernicious world view of a faction that has – temporarily, we hope – taken control of Labour. But yet again, rather than seize this moment to face up to the racism at its heart, the Labour leadership remains determined to go on piously protesting its innocence, rejecting the message and blaming the messenger. People prepared to bear witness have been forced to sign gagging orders; those who have dared to speak out have been bullied, defamed, and stigmatised as dishonest and disloyal. What drives them, the leadership insists, is nothing other than political or personal disaffection. We are where we were before. Whistleblowers would be heroes to any other Labour party; to this Labour party they are traitors. Regrettable double standards are therefore operating, where Labour is keen to support whistleblowers elsewhere but not in its own house. In our view, those whistleblowers and Labour members who could no longer stomach what was happening in a party they loved, and were in some cases driven to the point of nervous breakdown by it, have shown a rare moral courage and decency that belongs in a great tradition, and gives us hope. In the meantime, trust between Corbyn’s Labour and most Jews in Britain appears to be fractured beyond repair. The very fact that Labour is, like the BNP before it, being statutorily investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism is not a matter of housekeeping, but a taint of international, historic shame. There are procedures that could take the heat out of this – a fully independent complaints body, for example, over which Corbyn and his inner circle exert no covert influence. Not with the aim of shuffling off blame, but in order, finally, that the party will honestly own up to what can no longer be filed away in a folder. After Panorama, damage limitation should not be the first priority for Labour. Draining the antisemitism that lies like a pool of poison in the party’s soul is. Now, nothing else will do.Howard Jacobson, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Simon Schama, Neil Blair, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Rabbi Julia Neuberger Far from criticising Sally Wainwright for writing Gentleman Jack through “the prism of Halifax and West Yorkshire”, Richard Brooks should praise her and the BBC for offering those of us not living metrosexual lives the chance to see life from different perspectives (Behind the scenes, New Review). A glance through any TV listings will tell him how much is seen “through the prism” of London, not to mention the main news bulletins. He should get out more.Barbara StreetCardiff  Andrew Przybylski and Amy Orben rightly highlight that we don’t fully understand the impact of big tech on our society and that more research is needed (“We’re told that too much screen time hurts our kids. Where’s the evidence?”, Comment). Frontline clinicians, like me, regularly encounter young people who are self-harming, engaging with pro-anorexia content or are being groomed online to devastating effect. Gaming addiction and online gambling are other areas of concern, and we welcome the announcement of new NHS England-funded gambling clinics to support them. Research must not only look at the impact of screen time but should also consider the nuances of what content is being viewed by whom, how technology is being used and how it can affect mental health. We call on a levy to be paid by technology companies to fund this much-needed independent research and to invest in further studies on how technology can also be used to help young people. Przybylski and Orben’s largely retrospective data mainly focuses on the effects of screen time in the general population rather than exploring the harms of online content on more vulnerable users, or detailed analysis of how young people use technology. The death of Molly Russell is a tragic example of a young life needlessly ended after viewing harmful online content linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide. We must continue to bang the drum to ensure vulnerable users like Molly are protected against the risks of online content.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only do the hysterical global warming bedwetters want us to do it with the lights off in unheated room with all our clothes on, now they are poised to request senior citizens to leave their cars in the garage and get around in the rain and snow by foot with their Rollators.
Hat-tip: DirkH
The Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung (HAZ) reports on a regional Hanover study that found senior citizens are responsible for harming the climate because “they like driving their cars“. According to the HAZ, the study was conducted by the GGR expert assessment office based in Hamburg, on behalf of the Hanover regional government.
Seniors putting climate targets in jeopardy
The report finds that many senior citizens in the Hanover region “are driving their cars longer and more frequently than in the past” and as a result “the region’s own climate protection target in the area of transportation is in jeopardy“.
Obviously the enlightened Hanover government officials are afraid that the climate gods will be angered if old people do not start behaving properly.
One has to be concerned, if not frightened, that such ridiculous studies are being commissioned and used by governments to justify policy in the first place. The study was commissioned by Hanover’s regional government.
Apparently they feel it is their business to find out who is driving around too much. And under the guise of “climate protection”, the state now believes it has the authority to intrude into our private bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms, our cars and every aspect of our lives and boss everyone around.
The HAZ writes:

In the city of Hanover there is a positive development among the citizenry in the direction of climate-friendly behavior. However the figures in the surrounding area are stagnating, the GGR claims.”
Despite the “positive development” in Hanover in reaching climate protection targets, mostly through the herding of people into public transportation and bikepaths, the GGR has discovered that seniors living in the surrounding areas outside of Hanover are using their cars far more than they should. The HAZ quotes the GGR report:
Today’s generation of seniors have a driver license more than ever before. In the meantime older ladies are driving with an automobile almost as often as men are.”
God forbid. The increased mobility of grandmothers, the report concludes, means that they are “as a whole producing more emissions even though the cars are more environmentally friendly.”
As policymakers fly to a climate conference for the 20th time, grandma will have to use the Rollator
The report strongly suggests that poor grandmother should use her Rollator more to get around instead of driving her car, or wait 3 hours for the next bus to come by.
The HAZ writes:
In the whole region people are walking less than they did a decade ago. However, a need for action here has not been mentioned up to now.”
Meanwhile, German politicians, NGOs, and activists are all flying (some in first class) and burning tons of jet fuel (at taxpayer expense) all the way to South America – for the 20th climate conference which is aimed at finding ways to protect the climate.

"David Attenborough has highlighted Australia as an “extraordinary” example of a country where people in power remained climate change deniers despite the country facing some of the worst effects of global heating. Appearing before the UK parliament’s business, energy and industrial strategy committee on how to tackle the climate emergency, the celebrated broadcaster and natural historian was asked about claims people were overreacting to the threat of a climate emergency. He replied: “I am sorry that there are people who are in power … notably, of course, [in] the United States but also in Australia [who are climate change deniers], which is extraordinary because Australia is already facing having to deal with some of the most extreme manifestations of climate change. “Both [in] Australia and America, those voices are clearly heard and one hopes that the electorate will actually respond to those.” Asked to recall his most vivid impressions of humans’ impact on the planet, Attenborough said it was returning to the Great Barrier Reef, where he had first dived in the 1950s. “I will never forget diving on the reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms and life that it was stark white. It had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,” he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Attenborough said radical action was needed to tackle the climate emergency – “we cannot be radical enough” – but also called for pragmatism in working out what was possible and how best to convince the public of the need for change. He said he did not think opposing voices should be suppressed. “It’s very, very important that voices of dissent should have a place where they’re heard and the arguments between the two sides can be worked out in public, and compared and analysed in public,” he said. He found reason for optimism among young people who were “already making themselves and their voices very, very clear”. “I’m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don’t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live and what we eat. It’s going to happen.” Attenborough recently presented a primetime BBC documentary, Climate Change – The Facts, which was watched live by almost 3 million people in the UK. It is yet to be shown in Australia."

When it comes to climate change policymaking, the proposed so-called global treaty designed to protect climate (i.e. the global temperature, precipitation amounts, pressures, relative humidities, wind speeds, etc.) now faces a formidable obstacle: a US Congress now in the hands of the GOP Party.

My understanding is the USA needs the consent of the US Senate before it can ratify any international treaty.
Of course President Obama could attempt circumventing Congress to enact a treaty, but that would merely confirm why voters punished his party in the first place: abuse of power.
Why Obama did not pass a climate treaty back in 2009 when he had the chance remains a mystery to me. Worse, in my view, President Obama squandered the chance to work together with the opposition and accept compromise on every issue, which is the way democracies are designed to work. Instead he obstinately stuck to ideological lines and, using Chocago style political tactics, tried to muscle his policy onto the entire country.
Backfired!

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate cycles and their extrapolation into the future
By Dr. Dietrich E. Koelle
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
As the reconstruction of the climate’s development in the past by proxy data shows, there’s a series of temperature cycles that appear to be unknown, or ignored by many climate scientists. Among these are the larger climate cycles of 150 million to 180 million years (see Part 1 and Part 2), but also the shorter and for us the more important following cycles:
1000 years (900-1100)    Suess cycle with +/-  0.65°C
230 years (230-250)        deVries cycle with +/-  0.30°C
65  years (60-65)              Ocean cycles with +/- 0.25°C
In principle these cycles are sinusoidal in behavior as depicted in Figure 1. Bob Tisdale has also shown how the temperature increase of the 65-year cycle from 1975 to 1998 led to the assumption that it is due CO2 emissions because they too happened to be parallel. This has been naively extended all the way to the year 2100 and forms the basis for the climate models and the invention of the so-called “climate catastrophe”.

Figure 1:  Sine wave characteristic of the 60/65-year ocean cycle (Source: Bob Tisdale at WUWT).
In this analysis we will attempt to see how the temperature development could be over the next 700 years, assuming of course that the mentioned climate cycles of the past will continue on into the future. This should not be (mis)understood as a forecast for the future climate. Up to now there is only the IPCC forecast that the global temperature will rise by 2 to 5°C by the year 2100 – based only on the expected CO2 increase. However that theory has failed to work over the last 18 ears because the various natural climate factors and cycles never got considered, or they were not allowed to be considered in the climate models. Included among these factors are the mean cloud cover (albedo) and the resulting effective solar insolation (watts per sqm) at the earth’s surface, or the sea surface, which is decisive for the temperature development.Next Figure 2 below depicts the 1000-year cycle and the 230-year cycle, which have been reconstructed from historical proxy data. They stem from a combination of results from various publications in the field of paleoclimatology over the last years. The diagram of the last 3200 years distinctly shows a 1000-year cycle; the last 2000 years of which are confirmed by historical documents. In fact this cycle goes back all the way to the end of the last ice age, i.e. some 9000 years. The reason for the cycle is still unknown today, yet its existence is undisputed.
The current warm period is no “anthropogenic product”, rather it is the natural result of a repeating 1000-year cycle that goes back far into the past. Today’s warm period does not even reach the temperatures seen in the past warm periods, which at times were 1 to 2°C higher. Moreover it is important to note that during both of the past temperature maxima of 1000 and 2000 years ago, the CO2 values were at 280 ppm while today they are at 400 ppm. This indicates that the earlier warmer periods likely were related to natural solar activity and not to a rise in CO2 because there was no CO2 rise during those warm phases.

Figure 2: Global temperature over the last 3200 years shows a distinct 1000-year cycle along with the 230-year cycle.
Of historical significance is the fact that over the course of human history warm periods were always times of economic and cultural prosperity. The cooler periods always led to serious problems that led to starvation and huge waves of human migration in Europe. Here it becomes undeniably clear that the alarmist claims that “the earth has a fever” made by politicians such as Al Gore are patentedly preposterous. 
The “ideal” 1000-year cycle is varied by the 230-year cycle, which in turn gets varied by the 65-year oceanic cycle, which is depicted in Figure 1. Added to these cycles are the various typically non-cyclical events such as the ENSO, volcanic eruptions, etc. Figure 3 shows the temperature curve for the last 165 years along with the 230-year cycle and the effect of the 65-year ocean cycle. The current temperature values fluctuate by plus/minus 0.2°C due to the effects of ENSO, sunspot activity, volcanic eruptions, etc.

Figure 3:  The 230-year cycle over the last 165 years has been superimposed by a 65-year cycle as well as by other effects like the irregular ENSO events and large volcanic eruptions.
The temperature rise of 0.6°C during the 1975-1998 period, which has triggered all the current climate hysteria, was of the same magnitude as the previous increase that occurred in the 1910 to 1940 period, which in turn had nothing to do with CO2 because back then the concentration in the atmosphere rose by only some 10 ppm (from 297 to 308 ppm). Also the temperature increase of 1.5°C over the last 150 to 250 years is also nothing “out of the ordinary” or “dangerous”, as we are often told in the media. Instead it is only the natural recovery from the Little Ice Age (LIA) that had gripped the planet from 1400 to 1750. The LIA not only led to the Thames River and Baltic Sea freezing over, but resulted in severe hunger in Europe and caused a mass migration to America.
The figures also show that all three climate cycles reached their maximum shortly after the end of the last millennium. With that in mind, we actually should have expected even higher temperatures than those seen in previous warm periods. Here perhaps the fact that the global temperature has seen a negative overall trend since the Holocene Maximum plays a role. That means that the global temperature has fallen by 2°C over the past 8000 years.

Based on historical climate fact, it is possible to extend the trend into the future to form a possible climate scenario. Figure 4 depicts the extrapolation of the 1000-year and 230-year cycle along with the generally expected trend. Added to this are the fluctuations of the 65-year ocean cycles, the impacts of the ENSO-events, sunspot cycles and volcanic eruptions, which result in additional fluctuations of a few tenths of a degree – just as they have in the past.

Figure 4:  Extrapolating the 1000-year and 230-year cycles 700 years into the future.
Figure 4 shows the real global temperature development of the past 1000 years and its theoretical continuation over the next 700 years. This is not a forecast, but rather it is the extended possible course of the over all temperature trend, which over the mid-term in the next 100 years could see a drop of approx. 0.3°C  and a 2°C drop in global temperature in 350 years – which would mean conditions just like those seen in the Little Ice Age from 1450 to 1700. In about 1000 years the 1000-year cycle will again take on its warm phase and temperatures like those of today can be expected.
In the next 50 years there would be no temperature increase, but rather a slight temperature decrease is expected. In the decades before and after the year 2300 a powerful temperature drop could occur because both the 230-year cycle and 100-year cycle would be dropping rapidly together in parallel.

Note from the Die Kalte-Sonne editors: The main point of this post is to provide any analysis of natural cycles and their logical extension into the future. Unaccounted in the projection shown in Figure 4 is the climate impact of CO2, whose role in climate today is hotly disputed. In our book “The Neglected Sun” we presented two CO2 climate sensitivity scenarios: 1.0°C and 1.5 °C warming for a CO2 doubling. Current studies have corrected the original IPCC value of 3°C strongly downwards (see our articles “Studies from 2014 provide hope: warming effect of CO2 is considerably over-estimated. Official correction is imminent“). It will be exciting to watch how research will develop with respect to climate sensitivity over the coming years.

In February the sun was very quiet in activity. The observed sunspot number (SSN) was only 44.8, which is only 53% of the mean value for this month into the solar cycles – calculated from the previous systematic observations of the earlier cycles.

Figure 1: Solar activity of the current Cycle No. 24 in red, the mean value for all previously observed cycles is shown in blue, and the up to now similar Cycle No. 1 in black.
It has now been 75 months since cycle No. 24 began in December, 2008. Overall this cycle has been only 53% of the mean value in activity. About 22 years ago (in November 1992) Solar Cycle No. 22 was also in its 75th month, and back then solar activity was 139% of normal value. The current drop in solar activity is certainly quite impressive. This is clear when one compares all the previous cycles:

Figure 2: Comparison of all solar cycles. The plotted values are the differences of the accumulated monthly values from mean (blue in Figure 1).
The solar polar magnetic fields have become somewhat more pronounced compared to the month earlier (see our Figure 2 “Die Sonne im Januar 2015 und atlantische Prognosen“) and thus the sunspot maximum for the current cycle is definitely history. It’s highly probable that over the next years we will see a slow tapering off in sunspot activity. Weak cycles such as the current one often follow. Thus the next minimum, which is defined by the appearance of the first sunspots in the new cycle 25, may first occur after the year 2020. The magnetic field of its sunspots will then be opposite of what we are currently observing in cycle 24.
The radiative forcing of CMIP5 models cannot be validated?
A recent paper by Marotzke/ Forster (M/F) is in strong discussion here at climateaudit.org with more than 800 comments. Nicolas Lewis pointed out the question: Is the method of M/F for evaluating the trends infected by circularity?
There is not only a discussion about the methods, but also about the main conclusion: “The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.”
Is the natural variability really suppressing our efforts to separate the better models of the CMIP5 ensemble from not so good ones?
Here I present a method to find an approach.
Step 1
I investigated the ability of the 42 “series” runs of “Willis model sheet” (Thanks to Willis Eschenbach for the work to bring 42 anonymous CMIP5 models in “series”!) to replicate the least square linear trends from 1900 to 2014 (annual global data, 2014 is the constant end-date of these running trends). I calculated for each year from 1900 to 1995 the differences between the HadCRUT4 (observed) trends ending in 2014 and the trends of every “series” also ending in 2014. The sum of the squared residuals for 1900 to 1995 the differences between the HadCRUT4 (observed) trends ending in 2014 and the trends of every “series” also ending in 2014.
The sum of the squared residuals for 1900 to 1995 for every “series”:

Figure 3: The sum of the squared residuals for the running trends with constant end in 2014 from 1900,1901 and so on up to 1995 for every “Series” in “Willis sheet”. On the x-axis: the series 1…42.
Step 2
We describe the same procedure described in Step 1, but this time with the trends up to 2004, only 10 years before the end of the trend series:

//-->




Figure 4: The sum of the squared residuals for the running trends with constant end in 2014 from 1900, 1901 and so on up to 1995 for every “series” in the “Willis sheet”. On the x-axis: the series 1…42. The ordinate scale is the same as in Figure 3.
Here one sees that the errors for the trends until 2004 on average are much smaller (Figure 4) than they are for the trends up to 2014 (Figure 3). That is no wonder as the parameters of most models for the time period up to 2005 were “set“. Thus the depiction of the trends of the models up to 2014 are also well in agreement with observations:

Figure 5: The trends of the model mean (Mod. Mean, red) in °C/ year since 1900, 1901 etc. up to 1985 with the constant end-year 2004 compared to observations (black).
Obviously the setting of the model parameters no longer “hold” as the errors up to the year 2014 rise rapidly.
Step 3
We calculate the quotients of the errors for the 2014 trends divided by the errors for the 2004 trends (See Figure 4) for every single series and make a 2-dimensional check:

Figure 6: The single series as plotted points. The coordinates are determined by the trend error der until 2014 (X axis) and the ratio of the error up to 2014/2004 (Y axis). The red rectangle marks the “boundaries”, the “good“ series are inside, the “bad“ are outside.
The borders are represented by the standard deviations of both series.
The y-axis in Figure 6 above is the quotient of failures in trend estimations to 2014 (see Figure 5) divided by the trend estimations to 2004 (see Figure 4) with a standard deviation of 3.08; the x-axis is the accuracy of the series in trend estimation for the running trends with the constant end year 2014 (see Figure 5) with a standard deviation of 0.0038. The big differences of many series (up to a factor of 11) between the trend errors compared of 2004 and the trend errors to 2014 is impressive, isn’t it? The stability of the series with great differences seems to be in question, that’s why they are “bad”.
Step 4
Now comes the most interesting part: From the 42 runs of different series, I selected the “good” ones which are within the borders of the red rectangle in Figure 4 and calculated their average. The same procedure was done with all the “bad” ones.

Figure 7: The selected “good” series (see step 1-3), the series mean of all 42 series, the “bad” ones and the observations for rolling trends with constant end-year 2014 in K per annum.
The “good” (blue) series produce a remarkably better approach to the observations than the model mean (red) and the “bad”( green) show the worst performance.
Up to this point we didn’t know what model was behind what “series” in the “Willis sheet”. Thanks to the help from Willis Eschenbach and Nic Lewis we just learned the assignment and the properties of the models behind the “series”, also their corresponding sensitivity with respect to forcing by GHG. The mean value of the transient climate response (TCR), which is the expression for the calculated greenhouse gas effect, is approximately 1.6 for the “good“ models, the model mean (all models) is 1.8 and the “bad” model mean is 1.96.
As one observes is Figure 7, the selection of the “good” models “improves” the convergence towards the observations. For this a TCR of approximately 1.3 is assumed, compare to our blog post “Wie empfindlich ist unser Klima gegenüber der Erwärmung durch Treibhausgase? (How sensitive is our climate with respect to warming from greenhouse gases)“.
Conclusion
The mean of the models overestimates the radiative forcings in the global temperature to 2014. The objectively better models have a lower mean of TCR. The “bad” models have a higher mean of TCR. Many models are perhaps “over tuned” for the trends to 2005. The result is a dramatic loss in forecasting quality beyond the tuning period. Are Marotzke and Forster wrong? Will we ever hear them admit it? There are reasons for doubt.

Highly Urgent Topic: Presentation “Gender division of labor in climate change” at the University of Bremen on 12 November 2014
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On November 12, 2014 a colloquium by the artec research centre for sustainability is taking place at the University of Bremen at 4 pm. The colloquium focuses on a topic that has long been a pressing issue and has been the source of many sleepless nights:
Value creation and value appreciation: Gender division of labor in climate change
Speaker: Dr. Sybille Bauriedl, Bayreuth Academy of Advanced African Studies”
So what could possibly be behind this title? Is the suspected climate change going to lead men to finally getting off their lazy butts and helping out with the ironing and laundry? Or is the looming heat going to lead men to not being able to help out at all because they’ll be confined to sweating profusely on a hammock? Lots of questions, but no answers.
At the speaker’s website we happen to come across another important presentation from a year ago:

Social construction of climate change. How and what can feminist research contribute to gendered climate policy?”
This is something we have always asked ourselves. Or what about this presentation here by Bauriedl from 2012:
Climate justice and gender justice: women in the climate trap”
Women in the climate trap. The insidious climate catastrophe apparently has had the world of women in its sights. Unfortunately the site does not offer any presentation files, which we would have loved to have a look at.
It is truly interesting to observe where our tax dollars are going. For Ms Bauriedl and her occupation, it would certainly be catastrophic if it ever turned out that everyone had over-estimated climate change for years and if the dreaded catastrophe never materialized.

"Enthusiasts describe nuclear power as an essential tool to combat the climate emergency because, unlike renewables, it is a reliable source of base load power. This is a spurious claim because power stations are uniquely vulnerable to global heating. They need large quantities of cooling water to function, however the increasing number of heatwaves are threatening this supply.  The French energy company EDF is curbing its output from four reactors in Bugey, on the Rhône River near the Swiss border, because the water is too warm and the flow is low. Some reactors in the US are also frequently affected. This matters in both countries because the increasing use of air conditioning means electricity demand is high during summer heatwaves and intermittent nuclear power is not much help. This does not affect nuclear power stations in the UK because they draw their water supplies from the sea, which stays relatively cool. However, it may affect plans to build small reactors on a lake in Trawsfynydd, Wales. And it may also reduce some of the UK’s power supplies during the summer. As heatwaves intensify, the flow of electricity from French reactors through the growing number of cross-Channel interconnector cables cannot be relied on."

"The climate crisis is such an overwhelming problem that many people understandably want to keep it separate from other issues. After all, the task seems daunting enough already. To avoid catastrophic climate disruption, global emissions of greenhouse gases must be slashed by 45% by 2030, requiring unprecedented transformations in energy, agriculture and other key economic sectors, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared last October. But treating the climate crisis as a stand-alone problem is a mistake. Issues of justice – economic justice, racial justice, gender justice and intergenerational justice – lie at the heart of this crisis, and these injustices must be addressed if the fight for a livable future is to succeed. We can’t simply slap solar panels everywhere and call it a day. We have to dismantle the systems of oppression that gave rise to and perpetuate the climate crisis, including colonialism, racism and patriarchy.  Many people trace the origins of today’s climate crisis to the Industrial Revolution, when humans first began to burn large amounts of coal, but the crisis’s true roots extend further back to the onset of colonialism. When European colonizers ventured to Africa, Asia, North and South America, they invariably plundered the local natural resources, damaged habitats, hunted species to extinction and often forced human inhabitants into slavery. Undergirding European colonialism was the assumption that everything on the earth was meant to be extracted, bought and sold – and to make an elite minority very rich. In the eyes of the colonizers, the “new” lands they encountered had no owners – no one had purchased them with a recognizable currency or could prove ownership with property records – so it was free pickings. Along with this attitude came the idea that nothing – not air, not water, not trees, not animals – was sacred or priceless. Colonialism’s mindset of heedless extraction, greed and human exploitation not only planted the seeds of today’s climate crisis, it remains visible in the crisis’s central injustice: although the poor are responsible for only a tiny share of humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions, they generally suffer first and worst from the heatwaves, droughts, storms, rising seas and other effects of those emissions. Most countries in Asia, Africa and South America that endured centuries of colonization remain relatively poor today, and even countries like India and China whose prosperity is increasing emit much less per capita than do the rich countries in North America and Europe. Extreme weather and other climate impacts strike all over the world, but the rich are better positioned to withstand those impacts. The rich have the money to build seawalls, for example, and to operate satellites that warn about an impending hurricane so coastal dwellers can retreat to safety. And when disaster strikes, nonwhite or non-affluent communities are often shortchanged during relief efforts. After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, black homeowners received $8,000 less per family in government resettlement aid than did white homeowners. Which helps explain why, even eight years after the storm, roughly 80% of the mostly black residents of the city’s Lower Ninth ward had not returned. That brings us to the next system of oppression driving today’s climate crisis – racism. Study after study has shown that people of color and those living in poverty are exposed to higher levels of environmental pollution and suffer commensurately greater health problems. More than half of the residents within two miles of toxic waste facilities in the United States are people of color, according to a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council. People of color are nearly twice as likely as white people to live close to an industrial facility, a report by the Center for Effective Government found. People who lived close to industrial facilities and waste sites in the Bronx borough of New York City were 66% more likely to be hospitalized for asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why are the vast majority of fossil fuel production sites located in low income or immigrant or communities of color? Because these people have long been victimized by racism, and their perceived powerlessness makes them easy targets for the corporations that operate those facilities and the governments that permit them. By contrast, wealthy white citizens tend to have the money and power to keep such projects out of their neighborhoods. Take the Dakota Access pipeline, a project designed to transport up to half a million barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois. As ABC News reported, that pipeline was originally set to be built through a majority white community, Bismarck, North Dakota, but when that community rejected it, the pipeline was rerouted through indigenous land. Jesse Jackson, who joined the protests against the rerouting, called it “the ripest case of environmental racism I’ve seen in a long time”. On top of colonialism and racism, the third system of oppression shaping the climate crisis is patriarchy. Simply put, women are more affected by climate disruption than men are. The UN’s Gateway on Gender Equality and Empowerment project has documented that 80% of the people displaced by climate disasters are female. Women’s roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make us more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. In central Africa, where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous women are particularly at risk. As the lake’s shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water. With dry seasons becoming longer, women are forced to work harder to feed and care for their families. In addition, women worldwide are more likely to be living in poverty, so it’s more difficult for them to recover after climate-related and other disasters. This is how systems of oppression intertwine with the climate crisis. People of color, women, poor people, disabled people, queer people, homeless people – pretty much everyone who is already vulnerable is disproportionately at risk from climate disruption. Which is why the climate crisis demands bigger solutions than we initially thought. We need to see the climate crisis not as a stand-alone issue floating separately from everything else, but as the grand culmination of societal injustices that have been building up for centuries. We must speak truth to power, call out these systems of oppression and put social justice at the center of our fight for a livable future. We must pressure elected leaders, corporations, the news media and others in power not only to abandon fossil fuels and other climate-destructive activities but also to address the systems of oppression that gave rise to the climate crisis in the first place. You can take action by joining Zero Hour, a youth-led climate action group that I co-founded. Zero Hour is hosting a summit 12-14 July in Miami where activists will discuss how these systems of oppression intersect with the climate crisis and what we can do about it. This Is Zero Hour: The Youth Climate Summit is open to everyone, but it will highlight the voices of youth who are at the receiving end of these systems and fighting back. Join us! Because the only way to overcome a crisis this big is with a climate action revolution.

"The climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world, and it is the poorest countries that bear the brunt of the crisis. In Somalia, where I am acting country director for the aid agency Islamic Relief, the population is currently experiencing a drought that could threatenthe lives or livelihoods of more than two million people by the end of the summer, according to the UN.  The climate has been wreaking havoc on Somalia’s seasons. Ordinarily there are four: the main rainy season between April and June (gu), the second rainy season between October and December (deyr), and the dry seasons that follow each of them. Two-thirds of the country’s population live in rural areas and are completely dependent on the rains for their crops and livestock. Last year, these people were set back when the deyr season produced less rain than usual. And again this year the gu rains almost failed, eventually arriving in tiny pockets of the country too little, too late. This has led to widespread crop failure, and a decline in livestock production, rapidly pushing communities in the worst-affected areas into food insecurity. In recent years, the frequency and duration of these dry spells has increased. As it does so, the capacity of people to resist these shocks decreases. Every drought depletes their assets: their animals will die, their crops will fail, they will have nothing to sell and next season they won’t have money to buy seeds to plant again. In desperation, pastoralists sell their animals at a giveaway price, leaving them even more vulnerable. Doing so significantly reduces their number of cattle to below the minimum threshold required to continue raising livestock. At this point they begin to flee and become displaced, often in informal camps near urban settlements. I recently saw how extreme weather can throw the delicate lives of the most vulnerable off-kilter. Our staff met Geelo Ahmed Osman, a mother of five from Ainabo district, Somaliland, in an informal camp for internally displaced people (IDPs), where she now lives. She has been entrusted with a great deal of responsibility. Four of her five children are disabled with conditions so severe they cannot move without assistance – and her fifth is completely emaciated with malnourishment. Because her husband had a stroke last year, she is now the breadwinner for the entire household. Two years ago, another drought hit Osman and her family hard. Her household, who were pastoralists, lost all their animals. In the two years since, they have been entirely reliant on handouts from their relatives, and when their relatives could no longer offer to support them, they moved to the outskirts of Ainabo district and joined an informal IDP settlement in the hope that they will get assistance from aid organisations. The current drought has led to more and more people like Geelo Ahmed Osman, displaced from their homes and reliant on support from the international community. About half of the country’s population is in need of emergency assistance. If they don’t receive this, we are very likely to see a full-scale famine before the end of the year. Lack of water does not just have nutritional implications: it spreads disease. If people don’t have water to wash at critical times, they can’t stem the spread of disease, which becomes inevitable in crowded IDP camps. Things such as diarrhoea, if untreated, can be fatal to children. Aid agencies need more funding, and not just for immediate assistance. With the climate crisis increasing these kinds of events in frequency and intensity, we could be in this exact same situation next year, the year after, and on and on. So while the first phase of intervention should be emergency response, we then need to build resilience so people are better prepared for the future and not reliant on handouts from the international community. The sad thing is that around the world emergencies are on the increase: from the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen to devastating natural disasters such as Cyclone Idai in south-east Africa. The climate crisis will only bring more disaster. But at the moment, the attention, funding and support from the international community is not there. It is crucial that, in our turbulent and increasingly unstable world, Somalia is not left behind. • Mustapha Tahir is acting country director for Islamic Relief in Somalia"
"Barely a week after Madrid’s rightwing council began rolling back the city’s low emissions zone, a judge has ruled that the traffic restrictions must be maintained. As of Monday, drivers of non-exempt vehicles will once again be fined €90 if they enter the 1.8 sq mile zone in the centre of the Spanish capital.  The zone, known as Madrid Central, was introduced in November by the city’s then mayor, Manuela Carmena, a leftist. In April nitrogen dioxide levels in the city centre were down by 48% year on year, according to the environmental group Ecologists in Action. Madrid’s new city council, which is led by the conservative People’s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party and backed by the far-right Vox, announced moves to begin rolling back the Madrid Central zone days after taking office in June. Greenpeace, Ecologists in Action and other environmental groups appealed against the decision to abandon the scheme, and a judge in an administrative court ruled in their favour on Monday, saying pollution in Madrid could not be allowed to rise uncontrollably. “The judge’s ruling not only accepts our plea but also suspends the agreement the council reached on June 27 to abandon the scheme,” said Paco Segura, a coordinator of Ecologists in Action. “Madrid Central is now operating just as it was before.” The city council tweeted: “The moratorium on sanctions in Madrid Central decreed by the city council has been temporarily suspended on the order of the court of administration.” The council, led by José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said it would appeal against the decision, claiming the moratorium was perfectly legal. The council has three days in which to present its case. The perimeter of Madrid Central is monitored by 115 cameras. The cameras read the licence plate numbers of cars entering and leaving the zone, as well as those that park in the area. This data is then cross-referenced with data on who is a resident and who has or hasn’t got permission to enter the restricted zone."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCanadian philosophical researcher Shawn Alli has posted a highly critical series titled: The CO2 Climate Change Cult Series.

Philosophy researcher, book author, Shawn Alli thinks global warming science has “cult-like status”. Photo source here.
Though he does not appear to be some famous academic professor, his series does poignantly bring up a number of inconvenient points that have leading climate scientists confounded.
Ideologies underpinning IPCC science
Alli sent me an e-mail asking if I’d look over Chapter 7 and 8, which I did. Today’s post focusses on Chapter 7, which starts off powerfully:
Many objective and impartial scientists believe that they have no ideologies and never work to prove what they want to prove. This is a nonsensical belief. Under the ideologies of racism and eugenics, Western-European scientists in the past intentionally prove what they want to prove. The same concept is true in the present. The ideologies of man-made CO2 climate change are underpinning the science behind the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). One example of this ideological science is the IPCC’s claim of the Himalayan glaciers disappearing in 2035. [1] It’s only because of climate skeptics and deniers that the IPCC retracts their nonsensical claim three years later. [2] But despite the admission of error the Chair of the IPCC Dr. Rajendra Pachauri refuses to apologize. [3] The fact that the public outrage surprises him and damages the IPCC’s credibility, [4] demonstrates that the IPCC is 100% out of touch with the global general public about climate change.
The reason why the error is such a large problem is because of two reasons: science and socio-economic-political implications. The CO2 cult holds the IPCC to the level of god-like status, forever defending their cause. This pushes CO2 cult believers to claim that the IPCC reports are the highest form of climate knowledge on the planet.”
If you don’t believe that leading climate journalists have been taken over by the cult, Alli presents a number of quotes from the Guardian’s George Monbiot, and from the Newsweek staff, who maintain that the science is rigorous like no other, and thus beyond dispute.
Hockey stick: Distortion of reality…”junk environmental ideological science at its best”
Alli also thinks Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart, in its attempt to remove the Medieval Warm Period, was “intentionally manipulating the global general public and distorting reality.” He adds:
But even if you dismiss the hockey stick graph argument and the fraudulent data from climate scientists, you have to face the reality that global warming ends in 1998. After years of voracious denials […] the IPCC finally admits the stall of global temperatures in kind terms in Working Group 1 of their fifth assessment.”
“junk…ideological science at its best”

//-->




On the claim by the IPCC that man caused the warming from 1800 to 1998 and that the recent pause is due to natural variability, Alli calls this selective logic: “junk environmental ideological science at its best.”
Alli then writes how he posed three questions to leading (alarmist) climate scientists, such as Kevin Trenberth, Richard Somerville, Tom Wigley, on whether they are surprised by the recent pause. In general they answer that they are not, and that the models continue to be right for the most part. Alli responds, focusing on Wigley’s response:
Professor Wigley points out that there’s nothing surprising about the temperature lag. I would correct him and claim that there’s nothing surprising about the temperature lag now, due to the passage of time; but in 1998 it would be very surprising.”
Indeed one only needs to look at the course of the 100+ models to see that the pause had never been expected.
Models “all guesswork”…”no way” they can be accurate
Alli also comments on the tweeking of models so that they better match the reality, i.e. “scientists are starting with a result and creating a model that proves it.” Alli gives this practice the deserved grade of “F”.
This is ideological science at its best. And this is what a lot of Western-European science is about, explaining past events through particular ideologies. “
Even more shocking is that Alli feels that the scientists “don’t understand chaos theory at all“, and sums up the models: “…there is absolutely no way that any current climate model can be accurate. It’s all guesswork based on past trends“.
Cult science
So why are scientists and activists so convinced by the science when it is so faulty? Alli thinks it gets down to the human need for a religion and purpose: “The issue of man-made CO2 climate change gives individuals an opportunity to justify their existence fighting a ‘righteous cause’ in the face of corrupt and greedy private interest energy groups.”
In the end, reacting to the fact that only 3 of 31 leading scientists and activists were willing to dismiss the claim that climate change leads to more violence, Alli sees this as evidence of a “cult-like status” in climate science.

"A fleet of 35m electric vehicles could help the UK reach its net-zero carbon target by forming large battery hubs to store renewable energy, according to the country’s energy system operator. National Grid predicts that by 2050 millions of electric cars will use wind and solar power to charge up within minutes to act as battery packs for when the grid needs more energy.  The grid operator’s long-range energy forecasts predict that smart charging systems will use algorithms to help cars balance demand and supply on the grid, while making the most of renewable energy and saving customers money. It found that the plug-in car fleet could hold a fifth of the electricity produced by the UK’s solar panels, which it predicts will quadruple over the same period. This scenario would make the UK’s ambitious target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 achievable because it helps cut carbon from the energy and transport sectors, according to the report. Kayte O’Neill, National Grid’s head of strategy, added that electric vehicles will make the energy system more flexible and help bring down costs for consumers too. The forecast is one of five future scenarios envisaged by National Grid to help policymakers and the energy industry shape the future energy mix. In all scenarios the operator predicts electric vehicles will become the most popular form of transport between 2030 and the early 2040s. It also predicts that many more homes and communities will generate their own electricity through solar panels or micro windpower projects. There are fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles on UK roads, meaning the ambitious plug-in car forecast would require a major acceleration of plans for car charging and a step change in customer behaviour. The report said immediate action is required across the electricity, gas, heat and transport sectors “at a significantly greater scale than assumed in any of our core scenarios” if the UK hopes to meet its net-zero target. National Grid’s report also predicts that a net-zero target will require that homes use at least a third less energy for heating than at present and shift away from using natural gas in boilers and radiators. By 2050 at least 7m hybrid heat pumps, which partly rely on renewable energy, should be installed. The UK’s gas system should also be run on hydrogen, rather than typical methane-rich gas to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The warning comes in the same week that the government’s official climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, criticised ministers for delivering only one of the 25 emissions-cutting policies it had considered vital for 2018."

Based on GISS data
========================================
Even though IPCC climate models and expected climate trends have proven themselves to be completely false and useless, see here and here, parts of the Austrian media and state sector have no qualms using them, and in doing so they are misleading the public.
A recent example is the climate-alarmist Vienna-based Der Standard online daily in a recent piece titled: Climate in Vienna: More heat days, new plants.
The whole premise of the story is based on the climate models being right, which in fact today we know they have been universally wrong.
Palm trees in Vienna in a few decades!
In the article written by Christa Minkin and Julia Schilly, it is claimed that palm trees are to be expected in “a few decades in the Viennese forest – thanks to climate change,” citing ecologist Franz Essl of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Environment.
Minkin and Schilly also warn that Vienna is going to be hot in the future, all exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, citing “a new Austrian expert report on climate change“.
In 1910 there were only two heat days – i.e. temperatures over 30°C. In 2000 already 17 were measured.”
Der Standard also looks very deeply into the climate crystal ball…all the way to the year 2070 to 2100. Minkin and Schilly write:

For the period of 2070 to 2100 researchers anticipate a rise to more than 35 heat days per year on average. At the same time nights in Vienna will cool down less.”
Moreover, foreign plants will begin their invasion and displace domestic ones, the experts warn.
Slight cooling over the last 16 years
So with all the warnings of more unbearable heat days in the future, one might assume that temperatures in Austria must be currently on the rise. I searched the Internet for the temperature data series for Vienna, but unfortunately I wasn’t successful finding it. So I contacted the European Institute for Climate and Energy to see if they might be able to help out. They answered promptly by e-mail (slightly paraphrased):
Unfortunately we do not have the more recent data because the Austrian Weather Service does not make them public, only up to 2003. That’s why it’s not possible to show the last 15 years graphically, and so climatologists in Austria can claim whatever they want.”
Fortunately, EIKE was able to provide the recent data for Graz city center. Here we see despite the urban location there’s been a slight cooling.

Mean annual temperature for Graz city center over the last 16 years.
The trend in Graz matches the overall trend of a slight cooling over central Europe over the last two decades.
So with the IPCC models having performed so horrendously, and in view of the fact there has been no warming trend in Austria for 16 years, it is truly a mystery how anyone could claim that summer heat days will just keep on rising linearly until the end of the century.
When the models are failures, then the future projections based on them are worthless.

"In 1931, a trawler fishing in the North Sea off Norfolk hauled up a lump of peat containing a prehistoric spear or harpoon made from an antler dating back 9,000 years, to the end of the last ice age. This was the first evidence that prehistoric people had lived in a land now submerged under the sea.  Now the Europe’s Lost Frontiers project, using seismic data from oil and gas exploration, has built up a 3D picture of this long-lost landscape, with rivers, lakes, hills and valleys, stretching from present-day eastern England to north-west Europe. In the last ice age this was permafrost tundra like northern Siberia today and Britain was a peninsula of north-west Europe. But as the climate warmed, the land thawed and was colonised by plants, trees and people.This was Doggerland, believed to be densely populated by stone age standards, with thousands of people, some of them living in settlements. These ancient people were probably flexible enough to move on as sea levels rose and flooded coasts and valleys. But Doggerland completely vanished under the sea about 7,500 years ago, and the fate of the people living there remains a mystery. Now the fate of Doggerland serves as a warning of rising sea levels in present times, driven on by man-made climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I published a piece by Fred F. Mueller on Germany’s out-of-control renewable energy transition and how it is in fact transitioning over to a disaster.
What follows below is a graphic that proponents of the offshore wind energy industry don’t want anyone to see. It tells the whole story about how (in)efficient and (un)reliable German offshore wind energy really is (Hat-tip: www.achgut.com):

Chart shows the installed nameplate offshore wind capacity (shaded green) and the actual output (blue shaded area) since 2009. Wind’s poor performance and unreliable, wildly fluctuating supply disappoint and risk sinking Germany’s “Energiewende”. Chart source: R. Schuster.
The above chart was prepared by Rolf Schuster, an industrial engineering designer, who during his free time has started a wind power databank in order to check the rosy claims being made by the wind power lobby. The results are not something any fast-talking salesman would want any potential buyer to see. The power that was input (blue) is a mere fraction of the rated capacity (green).
Schuster writes:
If you divide the power fed in (blue) by the rated capacity (green) you get the percent of the rated capacity that actually gets fed into the grid. The linear trend shows a negative tendency – towards 20 percent of the rated capacity. That means: Despite the massively increased capacity in 2014, hardly more power has ended up getting delivered compared to the start of the year. Only one fifth of the rated capacity actually gets fed in.”
Many proponents used to argue that the wind is always blowing at the North Sea, and so a steady supply was a sure thing. Now we have real results coming in. That “steady” wind is only delivering 20% of the installed rated capacity. A fiasco.

Schuster also says that offshore turbines have serious technical problems as well. Foundations are being washed out from underneath; there’s corrosion, and overloads that lead to turbine shutdowns. The harsh conditions of the North Sea a proving much tougher to handle.
There are also major problems with the high-voltage direct current systems that have yet to be solved, Schuster writes. One entire North Sea wind park has been disconnected from the grid as a result. This, Schuster says, “makes one ask if the installation of a major power transmission line from North Germany to South Germany would be a high risk gamble for the German energy supply“.
Green power goes AWOL again!
Also a look at online energy portal Agora here also tracks renewable energy that gets fed into the German power grid. A look at today’s graphic for the last 31 days tells us that once again wind and solar have gone AWOL, and so conventional fuels such as gas, nuclear and coal have to jump in to bail out.

The above chart shows German energy supply and consumption for the last 31 days. Solar power that was fed into the grid is shown in yellow. Wind power is shown in blue. Cropped from Agora. 
Yesterday, February 4, we saw very little wind power getting fed into the grid, less than a gigawatt from a nameplate capacity of some 55 gigawatts of installed capacity – less than 2%! On February 4 wind and solar together virtually fed in almost nothing into the grid. If it had not been for coal, gas and nuclear, the country would have gone dark.

"London will have a similar climate in three decades’ time to that of Barcelona today, according to research – but if that seems enticing, a warning: the change could be accompanied by severe drought. Madrid will feel like present-day Marrakech by 2050, and Stockholm like Budapest, according to a report on the likely impacts of the climate crisis. Around the world, cities that are currently in temperate or cold zones in the northern hemisphere will resemble cities more than 600 miles (1,000km) closer to the equator, with damaging effects on health and infrastructure. Among other analogues, the study suggests Moscow will resemble Sofia, Seattle will feel like San Francisco and New York will be comparable to Virginia Beach. The researchers have created an interactive map showing hundreds of cities and their 2050 counterparts. Water shortages will affect scores of cities now in temperate climates as a result of the global heating, which is forecast to be by as much as 3.5C in European cities in summer and 4.7C in winter.  Nearly eight in 10 cities will experience dramatic changes, according to the study of 520 major cities published in the journal Plos One. Barcelona was affected by extreme drought just over 10 years ago, endangering many inhabitants and resulting in tens of millions of euros being spent on importing drinking water. It is becoming more likely that London and cities in similar latitudes will experience the same problems in the future, say the researchers. Among the most concerning findings is that the residents of about a fifth of cities globally – including Jakarta, Singapore, Yangon and Kuala Lumpur – will experience conditions currently not seen in any major cities in the world. This unprecedented level of change “blew my mind”, said Tom Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab in Switzerland, which carried out the research. “These are environmental conditions that are not experienced anywhere on the planet at the moment,” he told the Guardian. “That means there will be new political challenges, new infrastructure challenges, that we have not faced before.” Rainfall will be a particular problem for such cities, with extreme flooding becoming more common alongside more frequent and severe droughts. Crowther said: “We are absolutely not prepared for this. Planning for climate change needs to start yesterday. The sooner it starts, the less the impact will be.” Richard Betts, a professor of climate impacts at Exeter University and head of the climate impacts strategic area at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the research, said: “Without the benefit of knowing that the new climate conditions are already liveable somewhere in the world, it is harder to know whether people will be able to adapt and stay in these cities, or whether they will eventually look to move elsewhere.” Concern about the world’s lack of preparedness for the effects of global heating is mounting among experts. Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary general’s special representative on disaster risk reduction, last week told the Guardian that climate crisis disasters were happening at the rate of one a week, but that countries were not investing in making urban infrastructure more resistant. On Wednesday, the UK’s Committee on Climate Change published a report saying the government was completely unprepared for the likely repercussions of the climate crisis. Its chairman, Lord Deben, compared preparations to the efforts of the ramshackle troops of the classic British comedy Dad’s Army. The new research took as its baseline one of the central forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, which some regard as optimistic considering the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions. Any London homeowners relishing the prospect of a Catalan climate might need to think again. Mike Lockwood, a professor of space environment physics at Reading University, who was not part of the research team, said: “Bringing Barcelona’s climate to London sounds like it could be a good thing, if you don’t suffer from asthma or have a heart condition – except London clay shrinks and is brittle if it gets too dry, then swells and expands when very wet. The greater swings in ground moisture expected in a warmer world would cause massive subsidence problems.” One of the purposes of the paper is to illustrate the huge problems the world faces as result of the climate emergency. “History has repeatedly shown that data and facts alone do not inspire humans to change their beliefs or act,” said Jean-François Bastin, the lead author of the paper. “The intangible nature of reporting on climate change fails to adequately convey the urgency. It is hard to envisage how 2C of warming, or changes in average temperature by 2100, might impact on daily life.” Friederike Otto, the deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, cautioned that it should be regarded “as an illustration only, not a prediction”, because of the number of variables involved. “It is a useful way to start thinking outside the box, but it does not show London’s future. It could well be that rainfall in winter changes in London in the opposite way to Barcelona.” Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said policymakers must take note. “What’s great about this report is that it starkly shows what living in cities will be like if the inertia of governments on climate breakdown continues,” he said. “Young people are taking to the streets to stop their futures being wrecked through inaction on the climate crisis, but this analysis demonstrates that anyone under 50 should be equally concerned that urban living could be intolerable by 2050. Governments have no excuse for further inaction.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago I wrote about how Google was researching into changing how it ranks websites during searches, claiming that the aim was to give sites that are loose with the truth a lower ranking and to favor sites deemed to be reputable.
But the possibility of abuse in such a system is worrisome.
So I asked some leading climate figures by e-mail what they thought and have gotten some responses. Here’s what they wrote (some editing):
Prof. Nir Shaviv (astrophysicist)
It is just a research project. The Fox News article says ‘A Google spokesperson told FoxNews.com that the fact-based-rankings are, at this point, just a research project.’
I can’t imagine Google will do anything like that. It is so wrong on so many levels it would be shooting themselves in the leg.”
Lubos Motl (physicist):
I don’t believe that it’s technically possible to design an algorithm that could reasonably accurately assign the truth value to all pages on the Internet (it’s just very hard to evaluate all the billions of statements that are out there – quite often, one really knows the answer) – I would be impressed if they proved me wrong; and I don’t believe that Google will impose filters that would selectively and significantly skew results in a direction that is political.
I don’t believe that Google plans to suppress or eliminate skeptical blogs about the climate from the rankings, and I don’t even think that this follows from any media reports on Fox News or elsewhere, so I view these fears as nut job conspiracy theories.
It’s my belief that they’re doing a good job. Some said that the solution to these censorship fears (which seem unjustifiable to me themselves) is to create a competition to Google, or something like that. Even if some folks in Google have politically extreme, left-wing opinions etc., they’re still primarily a technological company that has done amazing things that even some of the best people in big competing companies such as Microsoft couldn’t have matched (and I am a fan of Microsoft). Of course if Google searches turned out to be unusable due to political censorship or something like that, people like me would try to switch to a competition.
Google is an extremely important company and it is assessing its importance sensibly. Generally I am not going to join the bashing of Google based on conspiracy theories. My cooperation with the company (talking about AdSense) has been good for many years and as an ordinary user, I am impressed how many services Google has done for the users basically for free. Even if they wanted to use their search engine to push politics or the climate debate in some direction, they clearly have the right to do so, but because it would mean to throw away the value of the company which has grown into a rather standard corporation, I don’t believe that it will really take place, regardless of the opinions of some officials at various places.
Dr. Holger Thuss (President of EIKE)

Without a doubt, there are a lot of lies out there. However if Google really thinks a truth formula is the right way to promote ‘truth’, it will backfire on them because there simply is no such thing as absolute truth. Hence I believe this step would be entirely unnecessary. It will not stop promoters of ‘inconvenient truths’ such as climate realists from doing what they are doing, and it would cost Google large parts of its credibility. On the other hand, it would slow down important political and scientific debates. I also don’t see how, in the future, Google will convince organizations to pay for its advertising services if its reputation is damaged and people go away to other search engines. Nobody likes to listen to truther organizations.”
Dr. Benny Peiser (Chairman, GWPF)
I very much doubt that Google will implement the proposal to rank websites according to their “truthfulness.” Such a potentially self-destructive move would make Google look like George Orwell’s ‘Ministry of Truth’ who was responsible to falsify historical events or rewrite predictions. One only has to think about the way Google would deal with Michael Mann’s ‘Hockey Stick’ and the elimination of the Medieval Warm Period from history to realise the potential for abuse and manipulation.”
Dr. Hans H.J. Labohm (Dutch publicist)
Nobody should claim to possess the monopoly on truth. Therefore let people decide for themselves what information they deem trustworthy. And remember: ‘Du choc des opinions jaillit la vérité!’ Consequently Google should drop this initiative and bury it, covering it with a tombstone with the inscription: R.I.P.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning (Die kalte Sonne)
 Who would be the referees in this process, and how impartial could they be?
Dr Sonja A Boehmer Christiansen (Editor, Energy & Environment)
On whether Google would be able to control the Truth:
NO that would take a long time to emerge if ever…many scientific disputes took centuries to be resolved. Truth is likely to establish itself, temporarily, if combined and advertised in combination with solutions, like AGW.
There are short-term truths of course, what people act on in the hope that it is the truth, but then they usually have another motive to back up the truth like greed, personal advantage, getting research funds, pleasing ‘mates’. If they went ahead, they would be taking on a divine role. A warning!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman skeptic site Klimanotizen brings us what I view as very good news on the trend of climate science skepticism in Germany.
Readers need to keep in mind the very harsh environment skeptics face in Germany, where they are targeted and marginalized by powerful forces such as major arms of the government, leading politicians, massively funded alarmist institutes and the mainstream media as dangerous disinformers who should not be listened to, and under no circumstances ever be given a bullhorn.
But fortunately, thanks to Germany’s democratic society, that effort is failing. The latest example Klimanotizen presents is a recent annual meeting of the German Home and Property Owners Association in Hanover last week.
What was different about this annual meeting was that one of the invited speakers was Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of the skeptic book The Neglected Sun – How the Sun Precludes Climate Catastrophe – a best-seller in the German version Die kalte Sonne. The gathering was in large part a climate-skeptical event – all taking place in the Kuppelsaal at the Congress Centrum before an audience of 1200.

1200 listened attentively to Prof. Vahrenholt’s speech on why there’s no man-made climate catastrophe – followed by “sustained and thunderous applause”. Courtesy: Klimanotizen. 
In his opening remarks Chairman Rainer Beckmann pointed out that there was a time when warmer weather was welcome, and cold was dreaded. Moreover most of the last 11,000 years were warmer than today. Warm periods, even those that were warmer than today’s, were always good for human development. Beckmann also poured cold water on the notion of a consensus among the experts. “There are many scientists who would not believe in man-made climate catastrophe.”

Professor Fritz Vahrenholt: “Man-made climate catastrophe no longer the issue”. Courtesy: Klimanotizen.
Next at the podium was Prof. Vahrenholt, one of the founders of Germany’s modern-day environmental movement. Klmanotizen writes:
Prof. Vahrenholt impressively described many developments and facts about Germany’s Energiewende, which to many in the audience were entirely new. For example he described the large economic burdens and the environmentally detrimental impacts of renewable energies and Germany’s image loss abroad. He showed how gradually the talk is going around that the Energiewende is not working out. He then detailed how the sun’s role has been under-estimated by the IPCC. During the time of increasing warming in the 20th century, the sun showed the greatest activity in over 1000 years. But since then its activity has been waning and also global temperatures have not risen in 17 years. The IPCC scientists have no explanation for it. However with the sun and the ocean phenomenon it is easily explained. Therefore a man-made climate catastrophe is no longer the issue.”
How did the German audience react to Vahrenholt’s speech? Klimanotizen were present and they write of a “sustained and thunderous applause“. Hanover’s leading daily the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung (HAZ), also present at the annual meeting, confirms while paraphrasing Vahrenholt:
Sure an energy transformation is necessary in order to be independent of other countries, but we do not need any fear-driven energy policy stemming from falsely interpreted climate data. Vahrenholt received long applause from the visitors of the annual meeting.”
The result is that 1200 people, who likely had inklings of doubt about the allegedly approaching climate catastrophe, were shown data confirming that indeed it’s mostly all bogus. The good thing here is that once someone sees the Truth, they’ll never go back to believing the lie.
How many people have gone back to believing in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy?
Special thanks to Klimanotizen for covering this event and reporting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJosef Kowatsch and Stefan Kämpfe at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) analyze the winter data from Germany’s DWD Weather Service an conclude that winters have been cooling.
The two authors present a lengthy analysis of German winter trends and what factors impact them the most. Today I will focus on the first part of their article, i.e. winter trends in Central Europe – mainly Germany. What follows is an abbreviated summary version.
Because of Western Europe’s proximity to the Atlantic, mild winters are nothing unusual and have occurred many times in the past. Two mild winters in a row occurred from 1909/10 to 1912/13, 1918/19 to 1920/21, 1934/35 to 1936/37, 1947/48 to 1949/50, 1987/88 to 1989/90. The article by Kowatsch and Kämpfe looks at if German winters are really getting warmer and less snowy, as is frequently claimed. They are not.
Now trend in snow coverage
An important indication for the character of a winter in Germany is the number of days with a snow cover on the ground that is at least 1 cm. That can be traced back thanks to the records of the Potsdam station, which goes back to 1893/94. There snow can fall already in October and well into April, and so it makes sense to look at the seasonal snow coverage days, where by the season goes from October 1 to April 30:

Figure 1: The number of snow coverage days – which fluctuates wildly – has been unchanged over the long-term. There’s no indication of reduced snow coverage days for Potsdam. The low snow year 2014/15 in the German lowlands is not included in this chart; yet it will show significantly more snow coverage days than the extremely low snow winter of 1974/75. (Source: PIK).
When one considers only the meteorological winter (DJF), no trend is detectable for snow coverage. However there are periodic fluctuations (Figure 2):

Figure 2: In the 1910s to the 1930s 1910er as well as at the end of the 20th century, there were generally fewer snow coverage days, instead the winters were wetter, milder. (Data source: PIK). 
Over a large regional scale (entire northern hemisphere) reliable data on snow cover are available since 1967. During this almost 50-year period snow coverage fluctuated strongly, yet there is no declining trend:

Figure 3: Since 1967 there has been no reduction in wintertime snow cover days over the northern hemisphere (Source: NOAA).
German winter temperatures – cooling!
Next we will look back at German winters over the past 28 and 18 years, and do so without considering the urban heat island effect despite the ongoing landscape alteration by man: Every day some 108 hectares are being built upon in Germany and thus creating growing heat islands around temperature measurement stations.
Germany’s winter of 2015 is currently pegged by the German DWD Weather Service as being 1.8°C above normal. Thus it’s the second warmer than normal winter in a row. However, the German DWD neglects to tell the public one thing: Over the long-term winter temperatures have dropped. It’s getting colder. See Figure 4. Data come from the German DWD Weather Service in Offenbach.

Figure 4: Winter temperatures have been falling in Germany for almost 30 years. The two recent mild winters have not changed that trend.
Result: Despite the alleged “global warming”, which is supposed to make itself evident especially in the winters, German winters are ignoring the forecasts made by the so-called climate scientists. It’s going to take an impressive series of mild winters just to flatten the trend.
This is proving to be terribly inconvenient for climate scientists who banked on warming. In the meantime cooling phases are being ignored, or data are even being falsified.

With the German winter temperature, the trend downwards would be even steeper if the UHI were properly accounted for. Yet, already some scientists are seizing upon the fact that the last 2 winters have been mild as “proof of warming”.
Next the single winter months (DJF) are examined individually (all data come from the DWD). Here’s December for the last 30 years:

Figure 5a: The trend is slightly downward, mainly owing to the especially cold December of 2010.
If one factored in the UHI, then the trend would be even more pronounced.
What follows is the 28-year trend for January:

Figure 5b: January has gotten markedly cooler over the years.
January also shows no warming in sight. One finds warming only in the climate models, and nowhere else. The next chart depicts the trend for February:

Figure 5c: Here the downward trend is unmistakable.
The February trend tells us one thing: Springtime is not arriving earlier. February 2015 in Germany was just a bit above normal.
Fairy tale models – truth being covered up
Kowatsch and Kämpfe summarize: “Winter in Germany is taking on a course of its own and is ignoring the forecasts made by the IPCC and the PIK. Warming? Where? In any case they are not to be found in German winters.” The two authors ask:

Where is the global warming which we are supposed to be massively combatting in Germany over the last ten years? Foremost the winter months were supposed to especially warm up. We were warned that there would be no more snow in the flatlands and that winter sports would be possible only at high elevations. […] It turns out these were forecasts from the category of Germany fairy tales. However, what’s worse is that this truth is being covered up and hidden from the German public. Not a single one of our charts is being shown by the media.”

No warming in Central England in 30 years
Kowatsch and Kämpfe also show the same is true in Central England; no temperature rise in 30 years:

Figure 6: No increase in 30 years, which is a climate-relevant period.
Tomorrow I will post on the factors that Kowtsch and Kämpfe say drive western European winters: Ocean cycles (and not Arctic sea ice).

"Ireland is ramping up its response to the climate crisis by planting forests – lots of forests. East, west, north, south, the plan is to plant forests, the more the better. With enough trees, goes the hope, Ireland can compensate for many of the cows, vehicles and fossil-burning power plants that make it one of Europe’s worst climate offenders.  From having just 1% forest cover in 1900, Ireland now has 11%, covering 770,000 hectares. It has just committed to planting 8,000 more hectares each year to reach 18% coverage. Research published last week said planting billions of trees across the world was the biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis. But some in Ireland have a problem with the great green vision. They say Ireland is planting the wrong sort of forests – dark, dank abominations that kill wildlife, block sunlight and isolate communities.  “It’s like a wall around you, dead, darkness. It’s suffocating. We’re losing the landscape,” said Edwina Guckian, a member of Save Leitrim, a group that is resisting plantations. “You couldn’t live in the middle of this thing unless you were Grizzly Adams,” said Jim McCaffrey, another member, crouching in a gloomy, tangled copse. “It’s absolute misfortune when you see the plantations coming.” The group, named after county Leitrim in Ireland’s north-west, has delayed some plantations with a blitz of planning objections and hopes to galvanise resistance in other counties. Last month a protester used a digger to block workers from felling trees and planting new ones. The offending species is Sitka spruce, a coniferous evergreen that dominates Ireland’s afforestation programme. Originally from North America, it grows quickly and tall – up to 100 metres – and flourishes in Ireland’s damp, temperate climate. About half of Ireland’s trees are Sitka spruces, many in packed phalanxes that blanket hills and valleys. They supply wood for pulp, plywood, pallets, fencing, garden furniture and building materials, much of it exported to Britain. And they absorb carbon, an increasingly valuable function as Ireland tries to avert fines of hundreds of millions of euros for missing targets on emissions and renewable energy. The government recently unveiled a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. With emissions from agriculture set to rise, not fall, success hinges partly on planting 8,000 hectares of new forest each year, auguring a lot more Sitka spruces. Save Leitrim activists say their county has been a laboratory for such plantations – “a national sacrifice zone” – and that the results are a warning to the rest of the country. “We’re not anti-trees, we’re anti-this,” said Willie Stewart, tramping through a gloomy pine-filled grove near his home in the townland of Drumnadober. “It’s industrial monoculture – a green barrier all around us. It’s horrible.” The activists, who include artists, farmers and business owners, say plantations inflict ecological and social damage and capture less carbon than proponents claim. The companies behind the plantations reject this and say Sitka forests play vital economic and environmental roles. Leitrim is bucolic and sparsely populated – just 32,000 people. Sitka thrives in the waterlogged soil with high clay content. Coillte, a state-owned commercial forestry business, started buying land and planting here in the 1960s. Private companies, encouraged by tax breaks, followed. Farm land vanished as Sitkas multiplied. They now number an estimated 34.5m – more than 1,000 for each inhabitant. The trees mature in about 30 years – exponentially faster than oak – and are then felled, making way for a fresh plantation. “The forest closed in bit by bit,” said McCaffrey, a farmer, who now feels surrounded. The trees eclipse sunlight, exude mist and block wifi and phone networks, inducing isolation, he said. “It’s a death sentence for the townlands.” These non-native trees carpet the soil with acidic needles and smother wildlife, said Natalia Beylis, an artist. “A lot of people find them spooky because they don’t have life in them. They’re silent except on the edges.” When machines chop down swathes of forest, a controversial process known as clear-felling, the landscape is devastated, said Stewart. “It looks like Hiroshima.” Brian Smyth, another member of Save Leitrim who runs a rural development non-profit, questioned the plantations’ climate credentials, saying carbon-soaking bogs were damaged and diesel-emitting machines often felled trees prematurely. “It’s all about money,” he said. Campaigners filed multiple planning objections to delay fellings and fresh plantations, said Smyth. “It clogs the system. We’ve stalled their work.” Forestry companies concede some plantations were too thick and sited too close to homes but that the system is now improved, affording greater space and biodiversity, with at least 15% of trees that are not Sitka spruce. “We’re in a different age now, we do things differently,” said Paul Jordan, a Leitrim-based manager for Coillte, the state-owned company. He cited sparrow hawk nests and badgers as evidence that Sitka forests foster wildlife. “It’s not the dead zone that the protestors would claim it is.” John O’Reilly, the CEO of Green Belt, Ireland’s biggest private forestry company, said Sitka grew three times faster in Ireland than Scandinavia, driving a sustainable sector that generated jobs, created essential building materials and benefited the environment. “The faster it grows, the greater the quantity of carbon it will sequester from the atmosphere.” The government’s target of 8,000 new hectares per year does not identify species but Sitka’s dominance is expected to gradually wane. Last week Coillte announced it would convert nine commercial timber forests in the Dublin mountains to primarily recreational and biodiversity use to create different type of forest that people could enjoy from a “landscape and aesthetic point of view”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s formidable green/climate movement is deeply deflated over the GOP’s grand midterm election success.
Especially the many German greens and socialists are struggling to fathom what happened and are only left to conclude that Americans must be just too stupid to appreciate all that President Obama and the Democrats have done and to understand the climate risks that threaten ahead.
For the reaction of Germany’s formidable climate alarmism movement, a good one is presented by klimaretter.info, an online alarmist site on climate and energy policy run by a motley crew of activist journalists with no scientific background.
“It could not have been any worse”
For the analysis of and reaction to the US midterm election results, klimaretter.info presents an interview with Liane Schalatek, climate and energy expert at the North American Office of the Heinrich Boll Foundation. The title of the interview: “It could not have been any worse“. Klimaretter.info writes in it’s introduction:
The election debacle by the Democrats in the USA is a catastrophe for climate protection. The outlook for a global climate treaty has dropped considerably.”
Well, that is indeed good news for the many and growing number among us who equate climate protection to climate swindle.
In the interview Frau Schalatek thinks it is likely the US Congress will move to cut EPA funding.
$85 million “a drop in the bucket”
On the $85 million spent on the election campaigns by environmental and climate protection organisations, klimaretter.info asks if perhaps that money could not have been better spent. Schalatek responds:

That amount of donations is only a drop in the bucket when you look at how much money flowed into the elections in total: over 3 billion dollars. Foremost from people with an anti-environment agenda. It’s a good thing that the environmental organisations stood up. The political weighting however clearly was against the environmental organisations.”
Don’t you love the smell of the enemy’s money burning? The 85 million probably hurt them more than it helped. Nothing like putting kookiness on display for the whole country to see.
Global climate treaty “to be a lot harder”
klimaretter.info asks if the chances of a binding climate treaty have now fallen. Schalatek:
Yes. It is now going to be a lot harder for Obama to advance ambitious national obligations.”
Schalatek also believes it is going to be a lot tougher for Obama to make commitments to the green climate funds because Congress has a say on the matter. She also believes that a GOP controlled Congress at best would agree only to an “extremely watered down” climate treaty that would have “little legal power and obligation“.
“…could not have come at a worse time”
Klimaretter comments that the election result “thus could not have come at a worse time“, just one year before Paris. And for advancing real climate policy, Schalatek thinks that “it’s a very negative signal” and confirms it indeed could not have come at a worse time.
Thank you, democracy!

"Dutch airline KLM has launched a campaign asking people to fly less. The video and open letter from CEO Pieter Elbers asks: “Do you always have to meet face-to-face?” and “Could you take the train instead?” The campaign aims to encourage travellers and the aviation industry to consider the environmental impact of flying. It describes the “shared responsibility” of travellers and airlines to “fly more responsibly”, and says those in the industry need to “create a sustainable future for aviation”.  The aviation industry accounts for an estimated 2%-3% of the manmade CO2 emissions in the world – a figure that is expected to increase with growing population, trade and wealth. KLM’s message comes at a time when the flight-shaming movement is becoming more influential and there is a rise in holidays by rail. Airline passenger growth is also at its lowest in more than three years, according to a traffic report by European airport trade association Airports Council International Europe(May 2019, at +3.1%). The KLM campaign, which marks the airline’s 100th anniversary, calls on passengers to consider train travel for shorter distances and to replace face-to-face meetings with video calls. It also suggests packing lightly to reduce baggage weight so that planes uses less fuel, and to consider offsetting CO2 emissions. The airline’s carbon-offset programme (CO2zero) uses passenger contributions for reforestation projects, including a new tropical forest in Panama. However, critics have suggested that instead of asking the public to be aware of their actions, KLM, and other airlines, need to be considering solutions that lie with the industry itself. Justin Francis, founder of Responsible Travel, has called carbon-offsetting a “a dangerous distraction” from reducing emissions. “Voluntary initiatives by customers are not enough; the cost of flying must increase … Responsible Travel advocates a Green Flying Duty, with the proceeds ringfenced for research and development into decarbonised aviation,” said Francis. “Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction. At the same time as telling customers to think about flying less, KLM will be telling its investors about its future growth.” The airline acknowledges that the most impactful change would be to use sustainable fuel, which its research suggests would reduce CO2 emissions from each flight by up to 85%. The airline itself is using 57 times more biofuel than in 2011, including for commercial flights, and is working towards developing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which would run on organic waste including cooking oil and residue from other industries in the Netherlands and Benelux region. KLM said its sustainability initiatives have, so far, led to a relative reduction of 17% in CO2-emissions per passenger in 2018, compared with 2011. But Anna Hughes, who runs Flight Free UK, sees much of the “greening” in aviation as problematic. “For aviation to become sustainable, the answer is simply not to fly,” she said. “And the simple fact is that climate change, exacerbated by our reliance on fossil fuels, will make it difficult for our children to inhabit [the] planet. While we welcome measures to make aviation more sustainable, airlines must be transparent about their contribution to the climate crisis.” The climate crisis has led France to announce the introduction of an eco-tax on tickets for all flights leaving the country. The new tax will range from €1.50 for short-haul and up to €18 for long-haul in business class. At a press conference, transport minister Élisabeth Borne, said that €180m is expected to be raised annually from 2020, which will help finance daily transport in France, notably rail. KLM has stated it is against this type of national CO2 aviation tax, because it believes Dutch passengers would travel by car to neighbouring countries, and continue to fly from there. On the company’s website, it says: “A global approach makes more sense. If the tax is implemented, we believe that it should be invested in sustainability of the aviation industry. National taxes will just go into the national coffers and won’t do anything to combat climate change.” The airline also said it would not stop promoting air travel: “We are stepping up … progress towards a sustainable future but we are a company that needs to make a profit to survive and to continue to invest in sustainable solutions. We want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable.” The International Air Transport Association is backing the KLM campaign. Rafael Schvartzman, IATA’s vice-president for Europe, said: “We support it in the sense you do have a choice. In certain cases you could use the alternative.” But, he added: “The UK is an island. If you want to trade globally, you will have to count on aviation.”"
