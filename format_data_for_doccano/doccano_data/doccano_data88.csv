"Angus Taylor has insisted it would be “apocalyptic” for the economy if Labor did not use Kyoto carryover credits towards its emissions reduction targets, while still maintaining they were “relatively small in terms of the overall carbon budget”. Following on from his Sunday interview in which he falsely claimed emissions had gone down, though the government’s own data showed a 0.9% increase, the energy minister accused critics of “cherry-picking” time periods to prove their points, when his own assertions relied on just the last quarter, instead of the whole year.  And in a rare interview Melissa Price agreed with Taylor’s false assertions, telling reporters: “If you have a look on the data over the last quarter, they have gone down.” Reminded that over the last year they had gone up, the environment minister said that wasn’t where her attention was directed. “I am focused on the good news,” she said. Labor is yet to say whether the Kyoto carryover credits of a 367-megatonne abatement would be used in its 45% reduction target. The government has included them in its own smaller target of 26%. Countries which exceeded their Kyoto target are allowed to use that excess towards the later Paris commitment, meaning that past carbon reductions can be counted towards future targets. Speaking to Sky News, the “minister for lowering electricity prices” said it would be irresponsible for Labor not to use the carryover credits. “[Labor’s 45% target] will be economy-wrecking if they do use the carryover,” Taylor said. “It will apocalyptic if they don’t use it. “This is the real question, it remains unanswered, and we remain very proud of Australia’s track record in getting to the Kyoto obligations, whether it is 2010 obligations or 2020, and our progress on Paris for 2030. “I would also say to this, that we have the lowest levels of emissions per capita now for 29 years, and you know, everyone likes, there are lots who like to talk down Australia’s performance in this area – it is very strong. And that is a time when we have had in recent years a very, very strong economy, strong LNG exports and you know, it is an astounding achievement.” At the same time Taylor insisted the carryover credits were “relatively small” in terms of the overall carbon budget. “But it makes a very big difference if Labor chooses not to use it,” he said. Asked how not using the carryover credits could be “apocalyptic” yet at the same time form a small part of the Coalition’s plan, Taylor said it was possible for them to be both. “Because if you look at the independent modelling of Labor getting to 45% using the carryover, you get a cut of wages of $9,000 a year, you get 336,000 jobs loss, so that is devastating. It is a wrecking ball for the economy, but you get to a point where getting any more just becomes apocalyptic. It is too hard.” The Greens MP, Adam Bandt, said it was unclear to him how Labor would meet its 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 without using the carryover credits. “Given Labor has abandoned a carbon price and is now coming up with a sector-by-sector approach to emissions reduction, it is not at all clear how they’ll meet even their low 45% on 2005 target without relying on the dodgy carryover credits,” he said. “They’ve locked in a pro-rata 45% cut in electricity. Not only is this less than business as usual, but it puts the burden on other sectors.” The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, on Monday described the use of carryover credits to meet targets as “technically possible” while criticising the government’s record on emissions reduction. He did not rule out Labor also using the on-paper measure. “This government is relying on a technical loophole to do the heavy lifting because they don’t have other climate change policies,” he said. “What they are doing may be technically possible to do but practically it shouldn’t be used as an excuse for real action on climate change.” Australia’s emissions have continued to rise, carrying on a trend established in 2013 when Abbott government abolished the Gillard government’s price on carbon. Taylor would not say whether it was “more accurate” to admit that total emissions had increased over the last five years, though they were down in the last quarter. “I’ll tell you what is more accurate, is to stop cherry picking time periods for a gotcha question,” he said, adding: “The real question is are we going to reach our international obligations. That is what counts.”"
"MPs debated climate change in the Commons chamber last week for the first time in two years. It was our first opportunity since September 2016 to talk about the biggest and most urgent crisis humanity has ever faced. Just 40 MPs showed up. This absenteeism speaks volumes. Even as we’ve sweated through a record-breaking February, as wildfires tear through our ancient woodlands, as insect and wildlife populations collapse around us, the words “climate change” are scarcely whispered in the corridors of Whitehall. Since 2010, this government has built a bonfire out of the measures designed to cut emissions. Zero carbon homes targets have been scrapped. Onshore wind has been effectively banned. Solar power has been shafted. The Green Investment Bank has been flogged off. Fracking has been forced on communities who have rejected it. Ministers champion the drop in our domestic carbon dioxide emissions – but they neglect to mention the true scale of our impact. Between 1997 and 2015, our total carbon footprint – taking into account everything we import and consume, as well as what we produce – declined by a pitiful 3.8%. On the opposition benches, while many MPs grasp the severity of this situation, their parties’ policies are littered with impossible inconsistencies. We cannot tackle climate change and build new runways, or prop up North Sea oil and gas, or spend billions on new roads. And we cannot tackle climate change with an economy built on the assumption that precious minerals, fresh air, clean water and rare species can magically regenerate themselves in an instant – that somehow the Earth will expand to meet our voracious appetite for new stuff. The world’s top scientists say we need to cut emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. But during that same period, the global economy is set to nearly triple in size. It would be hard enough to decarbonise existing levels of production and consumption in just a few decades. To do it three times over is nigh on impossible. To pursue never-ending economic growth – or even to keep things ticking along as they are – is to gamble with the fate of humanity. We need nothing short of a transformation of the way we live our lives – and the way we measure progress. In the US, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has reinvigorated the idea of a Green New Deal – an initiative I was proud to have co-founded 10 years ago here in the UK. It takes its inspiration from Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s, which used massive investment in jobs and infrastructure to pull the US out of the Great Depression. In 2019, we face an even bigger challenge. To avoid climate catastrophe, we must go beyond what is considered politically possible. A Green New Deal would mobilise resources on a scale unprecedented in peacetime, to tackle the climate emergency and address spiralling inequality. It would involve huge investment in clean energy, warm homes and affordable public transport – delivering a decent, well-paid job to everyone who wants one. It would rebuild once proud communities that have been hollowed out by deindustrialisation and austerity, allowing them to thrive as part of a collective endeavour to protect the planet. And it would protect and restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks like forests, wild places, soils and oceans. To do this, we must be able to leverage whatever finance is necessary to tackle the crisis. This is not a Trumpian border wall emergency – this is a real emergency. Critics might denounce such a plan as fantasy politics – but I ask them, with just 11 years left to halve global climate emissions, what is your alternative? Young people understand what’s needed to secure their futures. Last month, they went on school strike across the country to protest about government inaction on climate change. In our cities and towns, Green councillors have persuaded more than 25 local authorities to declare a climate emergency – and now schools and universities are doing the same. These are some of the most inspirational and hopeful acts I’ve seen in years. And where the people lead, politicians must follow. Parliament must now declare a climate emergency. It must debate climate change regularly. It must develop the laws necessary to implement a Green New Deal and climate-proof every piece of legislation. And the government must ensure climate change is a priority in all departmental and cabinet decision-making. But government and parliament will only act if we tell them to. So talk about climate breakdown – to your friends, your family, your neighbours and your colleagues. Join the school strikes. Join peaceful direct action initiatives like Extinction Rebellion. Write to your MP. Write to your councillors. Write to your banks. This is an emergency. Let’s treat it like one. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"Australia has endured its hottest summer ever, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, breaking the previous record set six years ago. The 2018-19 summer, which produced near 50C days and topped temperature highs across the country, has officially exceeded the previous record set in 2012-13, which was 1.28C above what is considered normal. Climate analysts say it falls into a pattern of human-induced global warming.  January alone had already been confirmed as the hottest month ever recorded in Australia, with a mean temperature across the nation of 30.8C, which was 2.9C above the average for January temperatures (calculated between 1961–1990) of 27.9C. On Thursday, the BoM revealed the whole season was officially the hottest ever recorded. While exact figures are not yet confirmed, the bureau said this summer’s mean temperature was at least 2C above the 27.5C benchmark of what is considered normal, based on 1961-1990. “Summer has been our warmest summer on record in terms of maximum temperatures, in terms of minimum temperatures and in terms of mean temperatures,” said Andrew Watkins, the BoM’s manager of long-range forecasting. The statistics will come as no surprise to Australians who sweltered through back-to-back heatwaves and battled bushfires across the country. In January alone, Adelaide broke its all-time heat record with a 46.6C day, Port Augusta broke its record with 48.9C, and then broke it again with 49.5C a week later. The small New South Wales town of Noona also broke the record for the highest overnight minimum ever recorded, with a night that never dropped below 39.5C. And in Cloncurry in Queensland, residents endured 43 days in a row over 40C, Watkins said. This summer’s extreme temperatures had been predicted since late last year, with the BoM’s climate outlook forecasting a drier, hotter summer due to the El Niño weather event, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and the effect of global warming. The “long-term increasing trend in global air and ocean temperatures” was a factor in the hotter-than-average summer, the report said in October. On Thursday, the BoM also updated its outlook for the coming autumn, saying there were “very high odds” that hot, dry conditions would continue. Watkins warned that while some high rainfall events could occur, it would largely be bad news for drought-stricken farmers. “I wish we had better news than that,” he said. Also on Thursday, Victorian health authorities warned of a late summer heatwave that would bring 40C temperatures on Saturday. The bureau has forecast a heatwave across most of Victoria over the weekend, and Victoria’s chief health officer issued a health alert for parts of the state from Thursday to Saturday. Pregnant women, the elderly, children and people with medical conditions have been warned to take care. Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, also warned there was a high fire risk, peaking at a severe fire danger rating in parts on Saturday."
"A lot of officious adults have been saying that there’s little point in school pupils striking in protest at the lack of action on climate change, as it will have no economic effect. They have a point, and so I would like to put forward a suggestion that may work better. Schoolchildren have no voice at the ballot box or wealth-creating labour to withdraw, but the pounds in their pockets weigh as heavily in the till as anybody else’s. We are at the beginning of Lent, when Christians traditionally deny themselves the good things in life in order to achieve a higher goal: why don’t our children hold a consumer-spending strike for this period? Buy – or have others buy for you – only life’s essentials: no sweets, makeup, computer games, sparkly unicorn poo slime, cinema tickets; buy clothes and books only if compulsory for school; if you usually buy a pasty or a sandwich at lunchtime, sign up for school dinners instead (I know, I know, but it will be a conspicuous sacrifice…).  Combine the financial strike with a conventional one, with lots of banners letting us supposedly responsible grownups know what you are doing and why, and see if the dent you can put in the economy will wipe the smiles off our faces.Rachel Savage (age 51)Sturton by Stow, Lincolnshire • Mark O’Connell, reviewing David Wallace-Wells’ The Uninhabitable Earth (Review, 2 March), underlines our political complacency alongside our denial of the effects of climate change.

For example, Wallace-Wells asserts: “We are now burning 80% more coal than we were just in 2000.” Some evidence could be edited out daily as new evidence became available.Hannah MorrowHaslingfield, Cambridgeshire • The Guardian letters page is marking International Women’s Day by publishing only letters from women – see them all at gu.com/letters and at the following links: Women worldwide must be heard and respected Equality for African women Rape victims can’t trust the justice system Does taking Friday afternoon off school do children any harm?

"Over thousands of years, like humans everywhere, we became used to thinking of the sun, rain and wind as the backdrop to our lives – external entities over which we had no dominion. In the 21st century, this has become a delusion. The unpredictability of weather in the UK, particularly during summers that many wish were drier and sunnier, is associated by many people with what it means to be British. It has big variations – temperatures in the north of Scotland can be up to 20C lower than in southern England – and is characteristically unsettled due to the jet stream.  Its unreliability may have aided those wishing to avoid the truth about global warming. But the evidence of our senses, as well as what meteorologists and other scientists tell us, is becoming overwhelming. While many people are enjoying this week’s record-breaking temperatures – 20.3C in Wales on Monday, and 21.2C in London on Tuesday, the hottest winter days on record – many of the same people are also worried. Extreme or unusual weather in the UK is becoming widely recognised as an indication that the climate is changing, though this realisation has been a long time coming.  That is understandable. Connections between one-off weather events and longer-term patterns must be drawn with caution. Greenhouse gas emissions do not explain everything. But over the past few years, the science of weather attribution has made dramatic advances. Using computer models combined with observational data, meteorologists can now analyse extreme events including floods, droughts and heatwaves to determine the contribution of manmade climate change. Last summer’s UK heatwave, when average temperatures in June, July and August were 2C above pre-industrial levels, was made 30 times more likely by greenhouse gases. Simply facing this reality as a nation would be a big step forward. For too long, and in defiance of evidence, climate deniers such as former chancellor Lord Lawson were offered prominent platforms to air their views without challenge. Partly as a consequence of such mixed messages, public opinion lags behind scientific knowledge. Recent survey data shows that while 93% of British people know climate change is happening, only 36% believe that humans are mainly responsible, while just 25% describe themselves as very worried. It is too soon to say whether this month’s unseasonal warmth, following last year’s extremes of cold and hot, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s warning that we have just 12 years in which to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C will shift minds further in the right direction. International cooperation remains the key to averting a global catastrophe. Next year’s US presidential election will be a crucial moment, with President Trump committed to withdrawing the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter from the Paris climate change agreement. But the UK too has a vital role to play, either within or outside the EU. As our heating planet turns from a threat into an emergency, with emissions still increasing, we must reject passivity in favour of action. Climate change won’t affect the UK as severely as it will poorer countries, or those more vulnerable to desertification or flooding. Our target of 80% reductions in greenhouse gases by 2050 is already more ambitious than many comparable countries. But the government should be far more active in advancing public understanding. It is no longer permissible to pretend that ice-creams in February are a quirk of nature."

"The energy minister has again insisted Australia’s emissions are going down, when the government’s official figures show emissions continue to increase, as the government struggles to sell the latest incarnation of its energy policy. In an interview with the ABC program Insiders, Angus Taylor repeatedly stated emissions had decreased by 1% repeating the line first said by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that Australia would meet its Paris commitments in “a canter”.  “Yes, they’re coming down and the department rightly believes they’re going to continue to go down and the result of this is we will reach, not just our Kyoto targets and still in the Kyoto period, we will reach our Paris targets,” he said. The latest report released by the environment department, looking at emissions between September 2017 and September 2018, showed total emissions in Australia had increased by 0.9%, continuing a pattern of increases over the past five years. The latest greenhouse gas emissions data is out, and YES, another record (and a new graph) pic.twitter.com/LY8JGfvdd0 That rise in emissions was largely due to an increase in liquid natural gas exports, but other sectors, including stationary energy, transport and waste sectors also contributed. Emissions in the electricity sector did continue to decrease, with brown coal supply down by 12.3% while energy generation from renewable sources increased by 14.2% The last substantial fall in Australian emissions occurred after the Gillard government put a price on carbon, which was immediately derided as a “carbon tax” by the Abbott opposition, a claim Tony Abbott’s chief advisor, Peta Credlin later admitted was not true and was just “brutal retail politics” which won Abbott the election. Since then, the Coalition has struggled to settle on an energy policy, with its most serious attempt, the national energy guarantee, leading to the demise of Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership. Under pressure from moderates and the electoral reality the Coalition needs to hold on to its inner city ‘small l Liberal’ seats if it is to have a chance at retaining power, Morrison unveiled a new energy policy late last month, announcing what amounts to a reboot of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy. The emissions reduction fund only amounts to $200m a year. With the election less than three months away, the government has officially signed off on the expansion of the Snowy hydro-project, which began under Turnbull’s leadership, and committed at least $56m to the construction of the Marinus link, the so-called “battery of the nation” project, which would send Tasmania’s renewable power to the mainland. However a feasibility study into the success of the Tasmanian interconnector project made it clear that its benefits would be realised “when approximately 7,000MW of the national electricity market’s present coal-fired generation capacity retires”, which would mean accelerating the removal of coal from the system. “The largest single influencing factor in the economic feasibility and timing of Marinus Link is the trajectory of coal-fired generation retirement in the national electricity market,” the feasibility report concluded. The government has not ruled out underwriting coal-fired generation projects in the future, with resources minister Matt Canavan admitting last week to Sky News the number was “around 10”, after Taylor repeatedly declined to put a figure on it. But to underwrite coal-generation projects, while supporting the Tasmanian ‘battery of the nation’ project, the success of which relies on the removal of coal from the system, would establish a situation where the government was competing with itself, potentially making one project un-viable. In his Sunday interview, Taylor still declined to put a figure on how many coal projects the government was considering underwriting, stating “I’m the energy minister, I am not going to commit to a number here and now”, but he said more competition was good, despite the contradiction in projects. “You put your finger on it – we want more competition,” he said. “We want more competition, not less. And if what we’re doing with Snowy 2.0 and what we’re doing with battery of the nation and what we’re doing with underwriting results in more competition against ourselves, as you put it, that is a great thing because the result of that is lower prices, keeping the lights on and avoiding the situation we had in Victoria in January – 200,000 houses lost their lights. “Portland Aluminium smelter had to go off-line. If the battery of the nation had been up and running when that happened, it wouldn’t have happened. “We got to address this. It is urgent. That’s why we’re doing it a number of ways. It will result in more supply, it will result in more competition as you rightly point out and that will drive down prices.”"
"Australia’s frog species, already threatened by habitat destruction and disease, are being put under extra pressure by shifting rainfall and rising temperatures from climate change. Some of Australia’s leading frog experts are worried that serious impacts could be unfolding out of sight, with one saying climate change could push certain species to extinction before they are documented by science. Many of Australia’s frogs are found nowhere else in the world, but the continent is also at the coalface of climate impacts with extreme heat, droughts and rising temperatures. Frogs are known to be at a high risk from climate change because they are ectotherms, animals with a body temperature regulated by their environment. Global populations of frogs and other amphibians have already been devastated by chytrid fungus, a disease that broke out in the 1980s and 90s. Now climate change could wreak havoc too.  Prof Michael Mahoney, of the University of Newcastle, has spent three decades studying the amphibians. “It’s the cumulative impact,” he says. “Yes there are some frogs that were greatly reduced because of the fungus. If they now face the added insult of climate change impacts, it just makes everything all that harder.” To make matters worse, Australia’s 2016 national plan to reduce the impacts of the fungus speculated that climate change and warmer temperatures could also increase the vulnerability of amphibians to the disease. Mahoney says all frogs have a different “critical thermal maximum”, a temperature above which they die, so they have to find places to hide and stay cool and moist. “The problem then is, how many refuges are there? The effective habitat that’s available is getting smaller and smaller. Can the frogs keep pace with current climate change? We don’t quite know the answer to that.” Mahoney says some Australian frog species live in high elevation rainforests and cool temperate areas with a thermal maximum of 29C. “Anything above that, and they die,” he says. “In the last four to five years, there have been four or five days that have gone above 32C [in those areas].” Climate change will have a slower impact than the fungus outbreak: “It will be a much more steady process of decline. That gives us more time to look at adaptation, but it’s also frightening because people become complacent.” Dr Jodi Rowley, a frog expert and biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, says there are about 240 known frog species in Australia. However, it’s estimated about 20% of all the likely frog species in Australia have not been named and described in scientific journals. She said in south-east Asia “deforestation is happening faster than we can discover species in the forest” and the same problem could be hitting frogs in Australia. “It’s theoretically possible that same thing could happen due to climate change, even in Australia,” Rowley said. “We also don’t know how the fungus will change and interact with climate change. Because frogs are so influenced by temperature and humidity – like the fungus – in warm dry years they huddle together and transmit disease between themselves.” Dr Laura Brannelly, a conservation biologist at the University of Melbourne, studies how frogs cope with climate change and disease. “For frogs in particular, climate change is a real threat because they rely so much on water availability, and water patterns are changing across Australia particularly in regions like the Australian Alps,” she says. For example, the habitat of the endangered alpine tree frog, says Brannelly, has been hit by drought and reductions in snowfall. “If there’s no snowfall, it messes with their breeding cycle. I suspect a lot of declines will be happening [in alpine regions] and climate change is a contributing factor. “One or two consecutive bad years of extreme drought could cause an entire small population to completely disappear, which is a huge worry for species on the brink.” Tabitha Rudin, of the University of Western Australia, is researching the crawling frog that is widespread across the southwest, an area, she says, that has seen a drop of about 19% in winter rainfall since the 1970s, with further declines predicted. “Such drying conditions pose a growing challenge for many amphibians, particularly for terrestrial-breeding species as they deposit their eggs on land rather than water and rely on consistent rainfall whilst embryos are developing.” Crawling frogs are able to live in places with markedly different average annual rainfall, meaning even within the species some might be better adapted to drier climates than others. Rudin is looking to see if a technique known as “assisted gene flow” could be used to help this species, and perhaps many others, by breeding to encourage tolerance for drier conditions. She has already produced hybrid offspring in the laboratory with greater tolerance to drying conditions. “We now have to test whether this positive effect remains over multiple generations,” she says. Rowley says a major problem for frogs is that there is comparatively little data about where they are, and so tracking changes caused by climate change or disease is hard. To tackle this, she co-founded FrogID, a citizen science project that’s trying to track frog locations by getting users to record their calls. “People want to know what’s going on out there with frogs and they notice changes, but the data just isn’t there,” she says. “We get lots of anecdotal stories from people who say they just don’t hear them around any more.”"

"Tony Abbott has changed his mind and now says Australia should stay in the Paris climate agreement. Abbott, who signed up to Paris when he was prime minister but then declared that Australia should pull out during the prime ministership of Malcolm Turnbull, confirmed he had changed his mind again during a debate on Friday morning with the independent challenger Zali Steggall and other federal election candidates in his seat of Warringah. Asked by moderator David Speers if his change of heart was due to the ousting of Turnbull as prime minister, Abbott said it partly was. “I certainly thought that the only way to break the emissions obsession was to pull out of Paris,” he said. “I think that the government has lost its emissions obsession now that Angus Taylor is the energy minister … Circumstances have changed. We have a new prime minister and a new energy minister.” “So when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister we should have pulled out?” Speers asked. Abbott replied: “We had an emissions obsession that needed to be broken and changed. I am now confident that we can meet our Paris targets without significant damage to our economy.” Abbott backed the creation of new coal-fired plants, even saying that the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project, which is owned by the government, should now look into investing in new coal projects. “We do need more baseload power in the system,” he said. “Why not coal-fired power? Coal fire remains the cheapest form of baseload power.” But it isn’t. Today the cheapest form of new dispatchable or base load energy is renewables plus storage. We are now able to have lower emissions and lower prices but we need to plan it using engineering & economics rather than ideology and innumerate idiocy “Because of political risk it’s very difficult for most investors [to invest in coal], but there is no reason why Snowy, as a government entity, couldn’t take a much longer view. Snowy would fund hydro, that stacks up. If we take the long view, then absolutely coal stacks up too.” Steggall, an independent who promised to run a climate-focused campaign, rejected this, and said the claim that coal was the cheapest was incorrect. “Coal is not economical. It still plays a part in our energy mix, and there needs to be a gradual retirement of coal…The reality is that the cheapest form of power is renewable.” “Not 24/7,” Abbott replied. “When the wind blows, but otherwise not.” Steggall: “That’s the most ludicrous argument… There is no question of intermittency. ” .@TonyAbbottMHR: I think we do need more baseload power in the system and why not coal-fired power? It remains the cheapest form of reliable baseload power. I'm all in favour of renewables, provided they're economic.MORE: https://t.co/ykweMevBOK #SkyLiveNow pic.twitter.com/X2O0lWUOiS Turnbull also tweeted his thoughts in real-time during the debate, challenging Abbott. “Today the cheapest form of new dispatchable or base load energy is renewables plus storage,” he wrote. “Snowy Hydro 2.0…delivers the massive storage which does make renewables reliable and this enable our progress to lower emissions and lower energy prices.” Steggall told the audience “it will be a climate election” and said she wanted a 60% reduction of emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels – higher than both Labor and the Coalition. “My platform is that the new generation wants a new era and movement on climate change,” she said. “It will be a climate election. People want movement.” Abbott took 51.6% of the primary vote at the last federal election, but faces a strong challenge from Steggall, who has pitched her campaign as a high-profile local with a heavy emphasis on the environment. Steggall also took aim at Labor’s proposed franking credit policy, which would end the cash refunds for dividend imputation credits given to retirees and those with self-managed superannuation funds who earn below the tax threshold. “I think it is an absolutely appalling proposal by Labor, I think it is extremely divisive,” she said. “You are now saying to [retirees with excess credits] ‘Thanks for paying all your taxes for all those years and by the way, we are now going to stick you in your retirement.’” However in a fiery debate with a lot of interruptions, neither Abbott nor Steggall offered a response when Speers asked the panel if they knew the current generation cost of a new coal-fired plant. Only the Greens candidate, Kristyn Glanville, and the Labor candidate, Dean Harris, offered the figure. Steggall also offered support to the idea that Australia should slow its immigration intake, as Abbott called for a “substantial reduction”. “In my discussions with millennials and younger Australians,” Steggall said, “there is a concern that immigration levels are too high in relation to the level of infrastructure … I wouldn’t go as far as Tony Abbott, but [immigration] needs to be done in an orderly and measured way.” Another independent candidate, Indigenous broadcaster Susan Moylan-Coombs, said Australia should be open to immigration by people who would be forced from their homes due to rising sea levels in the Pacific and Torres Strait. The debate also covered local issues such as the proposed Beaches Link tunnel and kicked off a fierce debate over whether residents would be able to take their surfboards to the beach. Harris said he opposed the project because it “puts more cars on the road” and would worsen congestion. “It won’t help parents get their kids to school in the morning. It won’t help people get to the beach on the weekend,” he said. Abbott replied: “How do you take your surfboard on the bus?” “Well how do you take it through the tunnel?” said Harris. “Of course you can,” Abbott said. Steggall said she supported the tunnel, but wanted it paired with clean public transport. “From the millennial generation and down, they are not interested in car transport. They want electric vehicles on the market. They want clean public transport. The reality is that there needs to be a tunnel that does create that access. “You would be surprised,” Steggall said. “Kids take surfboards on their bikes.” “Not longboards,” Abbott said."
"There was a time on these temperate islands when freak weather thrilled us with its bouts of exceptional heat, wind, rain or snow. Unless you were at sea in a gale, fear was a rare emotion. Even in 1987, when the so-called Great Storm hurtled through southern England and northern France on a night in mid-October, it was possible to be more awed than afraid. Crashing branches and tumbling slates woke people, but when they turned to each other in bed it was to exclaim about the wind’s strength – “Would you just listen to that!” – rather than to see it as a portent of something larger or more terrible. Thirty-odd years later, most of the people who lived through the Great Storm remember it mainly because a BBC weatherman got the forecast wrong. In England, the wind gusted at 120mph that night, and at least 22 people were killed on both sides of the Channel. But unless you were among the bereaved, or had a tall oak fall through the roof, nobody felt anxiety or despair. There was no prevailing gloom.  The writer Jonathan Raban witnessed the scene in Hyde Park, where small crowds had gathered around the gaping craters left by uprooted trees, and buzzsaws made the park “as noisy as a logging camp”. Raban noted a popular reaction. “It’s so sad, people said, trying to quench their smiles – for they didn’t feel sad at all,” he wrote. “They were thrilled by the magnificent destruction of the wind: it was as if the world itself had come tumbling down, and even the shyest, most pacific people in the crowd felt some answering chord of violence in their own natures respond to this tremendous and unlooked-for act of violence in nature itself.” That seemed true to me. As a child, lying late in bed on a Saturday morning, I would imagine that the bedstead had electric-powered wheels and could be driven anywhere in any weather, while I lay snug with a hot-water bottle under a waterproof quilt, steering the bedstead into gales and downpours. Growing up beside the sea, I could repeat this juxtaposition of comfort and danger by nestling on a stormy afternoon in a little hollow above the shore to watch the big, grey waves smash over the rocks as if they had taken against them. From a vantage point that was safe and relatively warm, the weather presented itself as an entertainment. Sometimes, clearly, it was more than that. In 1953, looking out from our living room on a rolling sea, I heard adults speak gravely about how the same storm had sunk the ferry Princess Victoria on its passage to Northern Ireland, with the loss of 133 passengers and crew. And in January 1968 a stronger and even more damaging wind than the Great Storm of 1987 tore west to east across Scotland, leaving 20 people dead and several hundred homeless. Working a late shift on a Glasgow newspaper that night, I thought I saw the glass in the office windows bend inwards before it broke; a scene that might belong to the Book of Revelation (“And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail…”). But as the idea of a punitive God had died long ago, even on a Presbyterian paper such as the Scottish Daily Express, weather was left as a series of random events unconnected to any human activity. Still, tentative connections were being made. By the early 1960s, scientists knew beyond doubt that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were rising; there was, or could be, a “greenhouse effect”. In 1975 the geophysicist Wallace Broecker popularised the phrase “global warming”, at least among the scientific community, when he included it in the title of an academic paper. It was only in 1988, however, that it began to be seen as a pressing global concern – thanks largely to the testimony of the climatologist James Hansen before a US Senate committee, the formation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the work of the writer Bill McKibben, whose book The End of Nature, published in 1989, was an early primer to climate change’s likely effects. The 30 years since have been lived out in a kind of denial: not in terms of international conferences and demonstrations, or the growth in renewable energy and the search for the perfect electric car, but in our apparent belief that nothing fundamental will change. McKibben wrote in Granta magazine in 2003 that people still thought about global warming “in the way they think about ‘violence on television’ or ‘growing trade deficits’, as a marginal concern to them, if a concern at all … hardly anyone has fear in their guts”. For many people, that may still be true: “FABruary: record-breaking sunshine [as] UK has hottest winter day ever”, announced the Sun’s celebratory front page on Tuesday, with any reference to climate change confined to a final paragraph on page five. But that treatment seemed old-fashioned somehow, and discordant with a belated but gathering alarm at the prospect of crop failure, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, forest fires, sea-level rise, soil degradation, mass migration and all the other horsemen in the cavalry of the apocalypse that threatens to sweep through the world before the end of the century. A new American bestseller, The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, lays out the territory with the slogan, “It is worse, much worse, than you think”– though its prophecies are drawn from scientifically respectable projections that are far from worst-case. How can we live with this prospect and not go mad? The website of Extinction Rebellion, which aims to change government attitudes to climate breakdown through nonviolent resistance, carries a film, Heading for Extinction and What to Do About It, which is one of the plainest bits of film-making you will ever see. A female scientist stands in what looks to be her modest kitchen and talks for an hour to a small audience (never in shot) about human civilisation’s probable fate. “Traditionally, you try to be a bit hopeful,” she says at the beginning, “but this is a different kind of talk.” What we need, she says, isn’t hope but courage. We’re heading towards three degrees of warming, and that will be catastrophic, “like boarding a plane that has a one in 20 chance of a crash”. Halfway through her talk, she allows her audience two minutes to grieve for our future losses. Then she invites us to act – to modify the future terror through present acts of peaceful protest. Is it really worth trying? That, she says, is the wrong question. We must act out of “a desire to be a worthy ancestor”. When Raban visited Hyde Park in 1987 to look at the fallen trees, none of that speech was imaginable. We had then, and for some time after, yet to feel fear in our guts. • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"
"No mention is ever made of an already existing political party which ex-members of the Labour party could join instead of creating a new party (Umunna: a false friend to Labour, Letters, 4 March). That is the Green party. As a very senior citizen who, after many years as a member of the Labour party left in despair and recognised that the policies of the Green party ticked most of the boxes – ie, the Green party is anti-Brexit, anti-nuclear, anti-racist and most importantly is campaigning to alert governments and people of the fragile nature of the planet due to the damage we have inflicted on it. My message to disaffected Labour members is: join the Greens and support Caroline Lucas, who has been consistent during all her years as a Green party MP.Anita GrayLondon • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Western Australia’s environmental protection authority has announced tough new measures aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from large projects. The EPA, which works independently and makes recommendations to the WA government about whether new developments should be granted environmental approval, said on Thursday it was setting a “higher bar” for how it would assess the impact of major projects on the climate.  The authority’s chairman Tom Hatton told reporters in WA the move was necessary because Australia was not on track to meet its Paris targets and the current policies of the federal government “are not going to deliver the outcomes as currently applied that are necessary for Australia to meet its international obligations under the Paris agreement”. Under the guidelines developers proposing projects with direct emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum would be required to demonstrate they have taken all “reasonable and practicable design measures”, including use of renewable energy, to reduce or avoid emissions. They will also have to offset all net direct emissions associated with the project. The EPA’s guidelines note that the Australian government’s key climate policy, the emissions reduction fund and its safeguard mechanism, lacks “an effective carbon restraint or rate”. The EPA also expressed concerned about the trajectory of WA’s emissions, which had increased by 27% from 2000 to 2016. “Western Australia has the second highest per capita emissions of all Australian states and territories, with emissions per capita well above those of other developed economies, including resource-based economies such as Canada,” the guidelines state. Environment groups have welcomed the policy as a “balanced approach” that would bring environmental benefits and require polluters to make greater effort to reduce their carbon pollution. The Wilderness Society said it was “a sensible policy for modern times”. “This is a huge step forward for policy,” Kit Sainsbury, the state director for TWS, said. “It’s really going to a limit a lot of projects going forward, particularly LNG (liquefied natural gas) and, potentially, also fracking.” Sainsbury said it was an example of states stepping in, in the absence of effective federal policy to combat climate change. Australia’s emissions continue to increase and the federal government has faced criticism this week for suggesting the opposite, based on one particular measurement of data from a single quarter. Much of the increase has been attributed to rising emissions associated with the LNG industry, particularly WA’s Gorgon LNG plant. The Conservation Council of Western Australia said the new policy would deliver jobs and environmental benefits for the state. “While this policy does not explicitly rule out new fossil fuel developments, it is a big step forward that could make a huge contribution to controlling pollution growth while helping to drive new sustainable industries for WA,” the council’s director Piers Verstegen said. The guidelines could have implications for major developments proposed for WA, including Woodside Energy’s proposed $11bn Scarborough offshore gas project. A spokeswoman for Woodside said tackling climate change “while providing the energy the world needs” was a complex challenge. “The projects that Woodside is proposing in WA will not only underpin jobs, investment and gas supplies – they will also make a significant contribution to emissions reduction by offering countries the opportunity to switch to cleaner burning natural gas,” she said. “To make investments like these, business needs stable, national – preferably international – policy frameworks, such as a global carbon price.” She said the “direct and arbitrary” regulation proposed by the EPA “appears out of step with Australia’s international targets and the associated emissions trajectory, raises further potential for conflict between regulation and jobs, and may perversely penalise investment in cleaner fuels such as natural gas which have a big role to play in global emissions reduction. The spokeswoman said the EPA had not consulted with proponents of projects that might be affected. The WA government said the guidance, released by the EPA as an independent authority, was not a government policy but set the EPA’s expectations when considering greenhouse gas emissions related to a proposal. “The McGowan Government is fully supportive of our job-creating LNG industry and will listen to their views as part of our response to the EPA,” the environment minister, Stephen Dawson, said."
"The turn the debate on asylum seekers has taken in the lead-up to the federal election has led to comparisons with the Tampa crisis and fears we are in the thick of Tampa 2.0. To be sure, fear remains as powerful a currency as it was in 2001. The prime minister’s recent scaremongering language suggests the government will deploy the Tampa playbook which goes along the lines of “How to use race politics to get votes and wedge your opponents”. We are not in the thick of Tampa 2.0 though.  The circumstances of the Tampa crisis have contributed to the world we inhabit now, but that world is not the same as it was in 2001. Many have described the crisis prompted by the MV Tampa as one of the most dramatic events in Australia’s history. Like many dramatic events it seemed to come out of nowhere. In one sense this is true. The Palapa – a dilapidated Indonesian fishing boat packed with 438 mainly Hazara refugees – was rescued by a Norwegian freighter on open waters, but anxiety about boat arrivals had been building for years. Immigration detention centres across Australia, from Port Hedland to Villawood, were full. Unauthorised boat arrivals which had human cargo incorrectly but commonly described as “illegals” made for a charged political issue. 26 August 2001 was a turning point. The MV Tampa rescued asylum seekers north of Christmas Island, an operation Captain Arne Rinnen saw as a standard international rescue at sea. He never imagined that the Australian government would not allow the asylum seekers on board to disembark at Christmas Island. The high-stakes action unfolded quickly. The SAS boarded the ship when it entered Australian waters. The same day, the government presented its border protection legislation to parliament. Meanwhile, there was a frantic rush to establish a detention centre on Nauru, money no object. The public seemed to love this “decisive action”, as the prime minister John Howard called it.  As talkback radio made clear, Howard’s statement that “we are not a soft touch” not only resonated, it united voters behind him in their antipathy towards asylum seekers. Howard had dismissed the United Nations’ criticism of Australia’s mandatory detention policy for years. Voters who weeks before may have been inclined to give their vote to Labor’s Kim Beazley, would not be swayed by international law or human rights advocates either. Journalists were kept busy covering challenges to the Tampa legislation and the internal agonies of Labor. But it was difficult, deliberately so, for them to report in detail on the new border security regime. Media relations were funnelled through defence minister Peter Reith’s office. It controlled the story, ensuring that the refugees on board and later housed on remote islands remained faceless and nameless. Focus shifted to New York and Washington after the September 11 attacks. In one crucial respect, however, the Tampa crisis and the terror attacks were conflated. A narrative took hold that asylum seekers might be terrorists too, seeking to blow up buildings and attack our way of life. We were at war; John Howard’s press conference announcing the November election happened to be held on the same day the United States started bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan. Years later in 2019, refugees continue to be demonised. There are far more displaced people than there were in 2001. Manus Island and Nauru are still in operation. But there is growing disquiet about the policy of indefinite detention, whichpolling reflects. Unlike 2001, we now know the names of some detainees and hear them in their own words through social media. Celebrating Behrouz Boochani receiving a major Australian literary prize or Abdul Aziz Muhamat winning a major human rights award is tinged with shame about their circumstances on the Manus Island prison, as they call it. We know the names of the men who have died too, including Omid Masoumali. Craig Foster wrote in a letter to Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten that raising international support to free Hakeem al-Araibi – something most Australians supported – from jail in Bangkok was difficult because of Australia’s own detention of refugees. Challenges to journalism have been relentless since 2001, and visas to Manus and Nauru nearly impossible to obtain. The Paladin affair makes clear how little transparency there is.  Howard himself has always argued that his government was making a comeback in the polls before Tampa. What is true is that his government was united, unlike Morrison’s government. It wasn’t besieged by a new scandal every other day in the league of Paladin, Helloworld or the Australian Workers’ Union raids inquiry. There were memorable byelections in Ryan and Aston earlier in 2001, but senior members of Howard’s government weren’t resigning in the last days of the parliament, as Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne have done in the past fortnight. Crucially, the source of voters’ deepest fears has shifted. The existential – and actual – threat in 2001 was terrorism. We argued about the Kyoto protocol then, but now climate change is what panics us. Now it is harder to merge the issues of national security with asylum seekers, which may be why the home affairs minister Peter Dutton appears to channel Donald Trump at his most base when he suggests some offshore detainees may be rapists and paedophiles. The inadequacy of the government’s response to the new climate reality is stark. When Australians come to vote in May, memories of the hottest days on record, floods, fire, drought and massive fish kills will hold more sway than Dutton’s accusations about asylum seekers.

"We, the young, are deeply concerned about our future. Humanity is currently causing the sixth mass extinction of species and the global climate system is at the brink of a catastrophic crisis. Its devastating impacts are already felt by millions of people around the globe. Yet we are far from reaching the goals of the Paris agreement. Young people make up more than half of the global population. Our generation grew up with the climate crisis and we will have to deal with it for the rest of our lives. Despite that fact, most of us are not included in the local and global decision-making process. We are the voiceless future of humanity.  We will no longer accept this injustice. We demand justice for all past, current and future victims of the climate crisis, and so we are rising up. Thousands of us have taken to the streets in the past weeks all around the world. Now we will make our voices heard. On 15 March, we will protest on every continent. We finally need to treat the climate crisis as a crisis. It is the biggest threat in human history and we will not accept the world’s decision-makers’ inaction that threatens our entire civilisation. We will not accept a life in fear and devastation. We have the right to live our dreams and hopes. Climate change is already happening. People did die, are dying and will die because of it, but we can and will stop this madness. We, the young, have started to move. We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not. United we will rise until we see climate justice. We demand the world’s decision-makers take responsibility and solve this crisis. You have failed us in the past.

"The record-breaking warmth at the end of February was remarkable, but as cases of extreme temperatures become more common do they have any effect on people’s attitudes to the climate? A fascinating study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal looked at more than 2bn tweets in the US about unusual cold or hot weather, and revealed that people get used to such extremes fairly quickly. As time goes by and unusual weather becomes more frequent, people seem to view the new highs and lows as simply the normal state of the climate, and memories of the weather years ago fade away.  One of the researchers, Frances Moore, of the University of California, Davis, said: “We are experiencing conditions that are historically extreme, but they might not feel particularly unusual if we tend to forget what happened more than about five years ago.” Getting used to unusual weather may not seem like a big deal, but if these extreme cases are seen as fairly normal it may be colouring the public’s perceptions of climate change. And that is worrying at a time when action is urgently needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "
"The students striking from schools around the world to demand action on climate change have issued an uncompromising open letter stating: “We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not.” The letter, published by the Guardian, says: “United we will rise on 15 March and many times after until we see climate justice. We demand the world’s decision makers take responsibility and solve this crisis. You have failed us in the past. [But] the youth of this world has started to move and we will not rest again.” The Youth Strikes for Climate movement is not centrally organised, so keeping track of the fast growing number of strikes is difficult, but many are registering on FridaysForFuture.org. So far, there are almost 500 events listed to take place on 15 March across 51 countries, making it the biggest strike day so far. Students plan to skip school across Western Europe, from the US to Brazil and Chile, and from Australia to Iran, India and Japan. “For people under 18 in most countries, the only democratic right we have is to demonstrate. We don’t have representation,” said Jonas Kampus, a 17 year old student activist, from near Zurich, Switzerland. “To study for a future that will not exist, that does not make sense.” The letter says: “We are the voiceless future of humanity ... We will not accept a life in fear and devastation. We have the right to live our dreams and hopes.” Kampus helped initiate the letter, which was created collectively via a global coordination group numbering about 150 students, including the first youth climate striker, Sweden’s Greta Thunberg. The strikes have attracted some criticism and Kampus said: “We wanted to define for ourselves why we are striking.” Another member of the coordination group, Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, UK, said: “The importance of the letter is it shows this is now an international movement. Taylor said: “The rapid growth of the movement is showing how important it is and how much young people care. It is vital for our future.” Janine O’Keefe, from FridaysForFuture.org, said: “I’ll be very happy with over 100,000 students striking on 15 March. But I think we might reach even beyond 500,000 students.” Thunberg, now 16 years old and who began the strikes with a solo protest beginning last August, is currently on holiday from school. She was one of about 3,000 student demonstrators in Antwerp, Belgium on Thursday, and joined protesters in Hamburg on Friday morning. In recent days, she has sharply rejected criticism of the strikes from educational authorities, telling the Hong Kong Education Bureau: “We fight for our future. It doesn’t help if we have to fight the adults too.” She also told a critical Australian state education education minister his words “belong in a museum”. The strikes have been supported by Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal to fight global warming was signed in 2015. She said: “It’s time to heed the deeply moving voice of youth. The Paris Agreement was a step in the right direction, but it’s timely implementation is key.” Michael Liebreich, a clean energy expert, said: “Anyone who thinks [the strikes] will fizzle out any time soon has forgotten what it is to be young.” In the UK, about Taylor said more than 10,000 students went on strike on 15 February: “I’m anticipating at least double that on 15 March.” The strikes would not end, Taylor said, until “environmental protection is put as politicians’ top priority, over everything else. Young people are cooperating now, but governments are not cooperating anywhere near as much as they should”. She said students were contacting her from new countries every day, including Estonia, Iceland and Uganda in recent days. Kampus, who was invited to meet the Swiss environment minister, Simonetta Sommaruga, on Wednesday, said: “The strikes will stop when there is a clear outline from politicians on how to solve this crisis and a pathway to get there. I could be doing so many other things. But I don’t have time as we have to solve this crisis. My dream is to have a life in peace.”"

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, freshman congresswoman and social media sensation, has taken time out from baiting Donald Trump and establishment members of her own party to raise a profound moral question for us all: in light of the escalating climate emergency, should we still be having children? During a recent Q&A live-streamed on Instagram, apparently shot while she was pottering in her kitchen, the rising star of the Democratic party – and one of the few frontline politicians to get the scale of the environmental emergency – pulled no punches in telling viewers that unless we take urgent, radical action on emissions, there is no hope for the future. “It is basically a scientific consensus that the lives of our children are going to be very difficult, and it does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK to still have children?”  With this one question put to her 2.5 million Instagram followers, Ocasio-Cortez has stumbled into a highly contentious area. Population has long been a controversial factor in the climate change debate; one recent study said the most effective thing individuals can do to address the crisis was to have one less child. However, critics insist we should focus instead on overconsumption, and that putting the onus on individuals to address climate change obscures the systematic nature of the crisis. Crucially, they say, it lets the real culprits – fossil fuel corporations and successive global governments’ inaction – off the hook. And even if you accept the premise that having fewer children will tackle climate change, there is also the thorny question of exactly who should be having fewer kids: an American is responsible for 40 times the emissions produced by a Bangladeshi, but often those who advocate population reduction focus on women in the developing world. Ocasio-Cortez is not encouraging people stop having children. And as the leading advocate of the Green New Deal plan – which aims to radically transform the US economy by 2030 – she is one of the few politicians to be working on a plan that might just offer a way to avoid the worst impacts of this crisis. But perhaps she is raising a more profound issue. Faced with a future of social and political breakdown, flooding, deadly heatwaves and food shortages – and a world full of politicians in various states of denial – why shouldn’t young people question whether bringing children in the world is a good idea? The answer is one we must all grapple with. But it is worth remembering that throughout history – even in the most horrific circumstances – people have continued to have children. It is a profoundly human act. And the thousands of young people who took to the streets to voice their concern around the climate crisis in recent months are a reminder that often – far from being the problem – children embody a profound hope for the future. "
"Some headed for the beach while others took refuge in air-conditioned buildings to escape Australia’s unprecedented weeks-long heatwave this summer. But for ecosystems up and down the country – languishing far from the cities and the social media glare – there was no escape.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology confirmed 2018 was the hottest December since records began in 1910, while January was the hottest month ever recorded. Climate change has altered Australia’s weather patterns. The BoM and CSIRO say the country has warmed by more than 1C since 1910, and temperatures will continue to rise. There have been obvious signs: bushfires, drought and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. But there have also been less headline-grabbing climate change-related tragedies. Based on studies of past extreme heat events, the affect of this summer’s heatwaves on Australia’s flora and fauna would have been severe, fundamental and, in some cases, deadly. “I think in a lot of places it would have been carnage,” says James Cook University ecologist Prof Bill Laurance of the January heatwave. “We have just had records after records being broken. We only tend to notice when things start dropping out of the trees. We know that basically, lots of things are dying.” According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future. So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia? The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected. They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days. The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times. Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year. These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse. Prof Ary Hoffmann, a biologist at the University of Melbourne, has studied the impact of climate change on natural systems for more than two decades. “You are going to get some major ecosystem changes,” he says, “but it’s the interactions that drive things. Our extremes are getting much greater, and so the consequences are going to be greater.” One study found: “Summer heatwaves and winter warm spells will increase in frequency, duration and amplitude across Australia.” Increases in extreme heat conditions and shifting rainfall patterns have already been seen across the continent. One 2018 study, led by Hoffmann, pulled together eight case studies showing how aspects of climate change such as drought, extreme heat and changes to rainfall were working together to devastate ecosystems. Pest outbreaks – themselves likely promoted by climate change – were harming trees already struggling though persistent droughts and heatwaves. Intervals between bushfires were not long enough to allow seeds to germinate and “drastic management interventions” were required to keep alpine ash ecosystems viable. Birds and mammals in the wet tropics were moving up mountains to stay in their preferred temperature ranges. According to Laurance, the damage caused by climate change is mostly out of sight of field biologists, and major problems caused by heatwaves can go undetected for years, if they are found at all. He cites the case of the rare white lemuroid ringtail possum. In 2008, after hearing reports the possums had gone missing, Laurance tried to find one in north Queensland. He and others concluded a heatwave three years earlier had killed many, pushing the species closer to the brink. The possums cannot survive for more than a few hours if temperatures rise above 30C. “Lots of people think heatwaves will be dangerous for things in cooler climates, but probably the tropics and tropical mountains will be where we lose most of our biodiversity,” Laurance says. “We know that in heatwaves animals have a temperature threshold and above that, they start to die. “There are silent crises happening all around us and it might be a few years down the track that we work out the skinks and frogs and plants that have died off.” Heatwaves cause the most damage when they arrive on top of other stressors such as fragmented habitats, drought, disease and fire. Last year scientists published an analysis of a 2011 heatwave in Western Australia. They found it had affected an area larger than Victoria – more than 300,000 sq km – spanning land and ocean. An article published in the journal Scientific Reports said the heatwave caused “tree die-off and coral bleaching” as well as “terrestrial plant mortality, seagrass and kelp loss, population crash of an endangered terrestrial bird species, plummeting breeding success in marine penguins, and outbreaks of terrestrial wood-boring insects”. Co-author Joseph Fontaine, an ecologist at Murdoch University, says: “We are getting more heatwaves and less time in between them. If you are a plant that’s close to your threshold then you’re going to die faster if it’s already hotter than it used to be.” The heatwaves have a knock-on effect, he explains: “Here in the south-west we have these fantastic black cockatoos and they rely on the resources in the trees – the seeds – from eucalypts and banksia cones. If these events affect trees, then the resources are gone and the trees won’t produce food the following year.” Ecologists are concerned by the speed of changes in the climate and how normally adaptable species are failing to keep up. “Given that in Australia the climate is so variable and most of our animals and plants should be adapted to that, we start to ask: why is it that we are seeing so many impacts?” says University of Tasmania climate impact scientist Rebecca Harris. “We keep talking about this as something that’s in the future, but we are seeing impacts now. Heatwaves and bushfires are what people are aware of, but there are many other impacts.” Last year Harris led a study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looking at how Australia’s ecosystems coped with both long-term and sudden extreme climate change events. “A single extreme event can be sufficient to cause irreversible regime shift or an ecosystem ‘tipping point’,” the study said. Among the examples were the pencil pine forests in Tasmania devastated by fire in 2016; a “boom and bust” of extreme rainfall and heat in arid areas coinciding with massive outbreaks of rodents, and then bushfires; and in 2016 mangroves dying en masse along a 1,000km stretch of the Gulf of Carpentaria. “We thought those undisturbed places would be more resilient,” says Harris. “But we showed that just wasn’t the case.”"
"Dear Tony. We need to talk about your flip flopping. It’s just not reasonable to have every single position on an issue and present yourself to voters as a conviction politician. These two conditions are, fundamentally, irreconcilable. Let’s lay this out. When Tony Abbott was prime minister, he took the decision to sign Australia up to the Paris climate treaty. When Malcolm Turnbull took over the Liberal leadership, Turnbull went on to ratify the agreement. In 2015, when Abbott signed Australia up to Paris, he said we were making a “definite commitment” to a 26% reduction in emissions and “with the circumstances that we think will apply ... we can go up to 28%”. When that position became inconvenient, because he was waging war on Turnbull during the vicious internal proxy war over the national energy guarantee, Abbott then declared he didn’t anticipate, as prime minister, “how the aspirational targets we agreed to at Paris would, in different hands, become binding commitments”. In July 2018, Abbott argued Australia needed to pull out of the treaty (that he took the decision to sign up to) because: “I didn’t anticipate how agreeing to emissions that were 26% lower in 2030 than in 2005 would subsequently become a linear progression of roughly equal cuts every year over the next decade”. How Abbott didn’t anticipate this at the time was entirely unclear, given that’s how targets often work, and he was the prime minister who took the decision to adopt the target, presumably with extensive advice from his advisers and officials and the portfolio minister – but let’s not digress. Experience shows there’s not much utility in unpacking Abbott’s essential reasoning on climate change because another position will soon be taken, just as sure as night follows day. And so it was on Friday. Abbott was asked during a candidates’ forum broadcast by Sky News whether he still wanted to get out of Paris. Given the independent Zali Steggall is attempting to blast Abbott out of his seat of Warringah using climate change as the sharp end of her offensive, presumably it has become more difficult for Abbott politically to keep arguing Australia needs to get out of the treaty he signed the country up to. So Tony has shifted again. We don’t need to get out of Paris any more, the former prime minister said on Friday, because circumstances have changed. Well, yes, they have changed. Last July, Abbott was coming after Turnbull, because Turnbull had come after him, and he was coming after any policy that could have led to emissions reduction, because he’d made that deeply strange and corrosive crusade an article of faith with so-called fellow conservatives. The media bobble heads amplified their nonsense because conflict, however manufactured and bone-headed, is the new media currency. Now Steggall is coming after him. That is a change of circumstances. These weren’t, however the changed circumstances referenced by Abbott in Friday’s debate. The changed circumstances were the Coalition had now shaken off its “emissions obsession”. “We had an emissions obsession that needed to be broken,” Abbott reported like the duty doctor. “And it has now changed.” It’s not clear to me whether “emissions obsession” EO™ is a recognised medical condition or psychological disorder, perhaps someone could Google that if they get a minute, but in any case, Abbott noted that the terrible fever had broken. Tony’s pronouncement is somewhat inconvenient to the current prime minister’s efforts to convince progressive, centre-right voters that the Coalition can do something other than wreck on climate change. But never mind that, we were in good hands, Abbott told his interlocutor David Speers, because Angus Taylor was now the energy minister, and presumably is not in the grip of EO™. Good man, Angus. What is unclear though, is how Angus being a good man with EO™ immunity makes the Paris target any less than it was when Abbott signed up to it, recanted, then clambered back on board it again – but this way lies madness. Instead of getting frustrated with a performance that could be fairly categorised perhaps as the last stand of the political opportunist, perhaps we should just look on the bright side and celebrate the backflip on the backflip. Hooray. Friday’s about face from Abbott shows that political pressure does have an impact. But it also shows the member for Warringah blows with the wind on issues that matter; that his views on climate policy are entirely situational – and, seriously, will that prove a compelling pitch when voters put their papers in the ballot box in late May?"
"Emissions in Australia are continuing to rise, with the latest increases driven predominantly by an increase in liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia. Emissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors.  The increased pollution from stationary energy reflects production growth in the mining sector, in steel and aluminium. The increase in LNG production has driven a 7.3% increase in fugitive emissions over the year to September 2018. Transport emissions also increased 2% over the year to September, with an 8.4% increase in diesel consumption, reflecting increased diesel passenger vehicle sales and more freight activity. But emissions in Australia’s electricity sector continued to fall, courtesy of a 12.3% reduction in brown coal supply, and a 14.2% increase in generation from renewable sources. The latest data shows that emissions in Australia’s electricity sector peaked in 2009, and have decreased almost 15% from that time. The energy mix is also changing. Since 2009, coal generation has decreased from 83% of total generation to 75%, while gas has decreased from 9% to 8% and renewable generation, mostly wind and hydro, has increased from 8% to 17% of total generation. Emissions from agriculture also declined over the 12 months, according to the figures – a trend driven by a decreasing beef cattle population, decreases in emissions from agricultural soils and field burning of agricultural residues. There was also a reduction in fertiliser use in the 2017-18 cropping year, which followed more favourable growing conditions in the previous year. Parts of the country are in the grip of a prolonged drought. Confirmation that emissions are continuing to rise comes in the week where the Morrison government is attempting to execute a policy pivot on climate change to try to shore up its small “l” liberal heartland ahead of the coming election. Liberals are under pressure from a number of independent candidates, many of whom are campaigning against the government because of its record of frustrating climate policy action. Scott Morrison has this week revived Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund, rebadged it and given it funding of $2bn over 10 years – although environmental groups and a range of climate experts say that fund has absolutely no prospect of delivering the heavy lifting on emissions reduction required to see Australia meet its Paris target. As part of efforts to appeal to disaffected voters who now consider climate change a vote changing issue, Morrison has also pledged the government’s support for large renewable energy projects. The government has approved the Snowy 2.0 expansion, kicked in $56m for the Marinus link, and has flagged further taxpayer underwriting of the “battery of the nation” proposal. The government has also identified specified various components of an abatement plan which it says is consistent with Australia meeting the 2030 target. To meet the target, the government intends to count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits, which is not practical emissions reduction but an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. It is also factoring in emissions reduction from the Snowy 2.0 expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy for which there are no details; the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from unspecified “technology solutions” and “other sources of abatement” such as projects under development but not yet contracted. Labor attacked the government after the release of the emissions data on Thursday. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said carbon pollution levels had been rising since the election of Tony Abbott as prime minister, “and emissions will continue to rise all the way to 2030”. Butler said the rebadged emissions reduction fund would not counter the trend of rising emissions. “After five years and $2.25bn spent, Tony Abbott’s ineffective emissions reduction fund only saw pollution rise”. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the data confirmed “no matter how much money Scott Morrison throws into dodgy emissions funds, pollution will keep going up until polluters are once more forced to pay for their emissions through a carbon price”. “This latest data shows that while current investment in renewables has had some impact, it’s not enough to counteract increases in emissions across most of the economy, because corporations can pollute without penalty,” Bandt said."
"How far ahead do your thoughts tend to stray? Tomorrow, next week, summer holidays? Perhaps some fleeting thoughts about the years ahead? But what if we stared deeper into the future? Reframing our thinking in this way would go a long way to saving the world, according to the geologist Marcia Bjornerud. In her mind-expanding book Timefulness she introduces us to “thinking like a rock” and seeing how our planet has evolved through deep time. Realising that dinosaurs dominated the planet for 180m years, while humans have been around for a mere 4m, suddenly puts a new spin on our “success”. Meanwhile, observing some of the major swings in Earth’s past climate, and the impact that these had on life, is both reassuring (the Earth looked after itself just fine and life evolved and came out the other side) and concerning (many species became extinct during these big changes).  Bjornerud argues that if more people saw the world through a geological lens, then humans might stand a chance of being as successful as the dinosaurs. Timefulness is a call to arms for all of us to consider how our actions today will affect future generations."

"The Greens have expressed alarm over changes to the emissions safeguard mechanism that will make it less likely that heavy polluters such as mines and smelters will be caught by the scheme – at least in the short term. In the week following an attempted pivot on climate change policy by the Morrison government, the Department of Environment and Energy has published amendments to the safeguard mechanism that take effect immediately.  The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, says the changes outlined in the new departmental edict “were requested by big polluters and they will make it easier for them to pollute more”. “This is like catching someone doing 100km/h in a 60km/h zone, but instead of fining them the government just lifts the speed limit to 110km/h,” Bandt said. The Coalition flagged an intention to overhaul the safeguards mechanism in a review of its climate policies released in December 2017. That review signalled baselines could “increase with production, supporting business growth”. The safeguards mechanism – part of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action scheme, which is at the centre of the recent climate redux by Scott Morrison – sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters. The mechanism is supposed to ensure pollution cuts paid for through the taxpayer-funded emissions reduction fund – rebadged by Morrison last week as the “climate solutions fund” – are not undone by a blowout in emissions in other parts of the economy. The 2017 climate review signalled the mechanism would be loosened to ensure business did not face restraints on growth, with the changes to be implemented in the 2018-19 compliance year, in consultation with industry. The review said the mechanism needed to be “fairer and simpler” and it said changes were required to “address the risk of potential constraints on business growth raised by a number of stakeholders through the review”. The department has now circulated adjustments to the scheme which it says are “in line with the 2017 review of climate change policies”. One of the new proposals allows businesses to update baselines annually “for actual production where facilities use eligible production variables, so they continue to reflect facility circumstances” – which suggests baselines will be able to vary with production. Business sources have told Guardian Australia the proposal circulated by the Morrison government will put businesses in a situation where, in the short term, they are less likely to breach. But some point out the reboot could also be used by an incoming Labor government as the foundation for toughening the scheme if the opposition keeps the architecture as part of a new policy covering heavy emitters. The overhaul could provide the foundation for a cap and trade scheme, or an emissions intensity scheme, by, in essence, tidying up the mechanism before ratcheting down the baselines. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has flagged “some kind of emissions trading scheme” for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year. Guardian Australia reported last March 16 Australian industrial sites had breached the government-imposed greenhouse gas emissions limits, which forced them to buy millions of dollars in carbon credits. Nearly 60 Australian industrial sites have previously been given the green light to increase pollution under the scheme, which is widely regarded as inadequate. Emissions have been rising since the Coalition repealed the carbon price and replaced it with the Direct Action scheme. Bandt said the Greens would explore ways to stop the changes from proceeding once parliament resumes for the budget session, and he declared Labor needed to take a clear stand on the issue. Bandt said Labor, if it wins the election in May, “need to change the rules to reduce pollution, not encourage it.” Tim Baxter from the Australian-German Climate and Energy College and Melbourne Law School said the overhaul meant the safeguard mechanism was now “totally useless”. “As small as the penalties were in the first year of the safeguard mechanism, and they were tiny for companies as large as those covered by the safeguard mechanism, this reform seems to be designed to ensure penalties never happen again,” Baxter said. “By moving to baselines that vary with production, it becomes more and more difficult for facilities to breach their limits”. “The safeguard mechanism moves from being next to useless in providing for a safe climate, to being totally useless”. “Under the previous default rules, while there was nothing compelling emissions to come down, there was at least a limit on their growth. Under the revised rules, there is neither”."
"At first pass, there seems little amiss in the idyll of Florida Bay. A wedge-shaped expanse of water between the Everglades and the Florida Keys, it is a clean, sun-dappled 1,000 sq mile playground for reddening tourists, grizzled fishermen and loud-shirted locals. But the consequences of Florida’s century-long attempt to bend the environment to its will aren’t hard to find. Starved of fresh water from a reworking of its natural plumbing further north and menaced by seas rising due to climate change, the Everglades and its adjoining bay are teetering at the edge of existential crisis.  “The patient is on life support at the moment,” said Steve Davis, senior ecologist at conservation not-for-profit Everglades Foundation, describing what was once a prime fishing area in the western portion of the bay. A severe slump in rainfall in 2015 meant salinity levels rocketed in the bay, with the water becoming twice as salty in the ocean. This led to the die-off of seagrass, crucial for local marine life, leaving the water matted with deceased vegetation. The water here is shallow but still impenetrably murky, with the odd strand of seagrass floating by. Hurricane Irma tore up much of what remained last year, uprooting mangroves that had managed to survive the surging salt. “Notice how turbid and brown the water is,” Davis said, standing up on his skiff and peering into the bay. “This area, just last year smelled like death. It smelled like rotten eggs for almost three months.” Shark Bight, a cove found further north off the Everglades, is a prime birdwatching and fishing paradise turned “mud pit”, Davis said. Eddie Yarborough, a leathery fishing guide who has spent the last 25 years traversing the bay for trout, redfish and snook, likens the water to “chocolate milk”. Yarborough morosely added: “The water used to be so clear you could see the seagrass move back and forth. Now you can’t see the bottom. The dead water sort of moves around the bay and you think ‘I’ve just gotta get out of here.’” Decades of often poisonous politics have pushed the Everglades, one of the largest and perhaps best-known wetlands in the world, down the path of entropy and potential collapse. A sweeping plan to restore the Everglades was passed by Congress in 2000 and promptly stalled. Now less than half of its original size, the Everglades is beset by encroaching development and nutrient pollution and riddled with invasive species, such as the Burmese python, and exotic plants, such as Brazilian pepper and Australian pine. But conservationists have fresh hope in the unlikely corporeal form of Ron DeSantis, the new Republican governor of Florida who roused national attention with a campaign video that vowed his children’s fealty to Donald Trump and a televised debate where his opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum, accused his supporters of racism. Since taking office in January, DeSantis has taken an unTrumpian approach to the environment, outlining a $2.5bn plan over four years to rescue the ailing Everglades. The plan would tackle local water pollution, protect springs and finish raising the Tamiami Trail, a highway that links Miami and Florida’s west coast by cutting across the Everglades, to allow water to flow south to the ecosystem. DeSantis has called for the resignations of the entire South Florida Water Management District board, which controls water policy for the region, and has appointed two members – Ron “Alligator Ron” Bergeron and Chauncey Goss – who both have strong green credentials. Florida has even thrown itself into a legal battle to halt a controversial oil drilling project in the north-eastern reaches of the Everglades. “Our water and natural resources are the foundation of our economy and our way of life in Florida,” DeSantis said. “The protection of water resources is one of the most pressing issues facing our state.” Environmentalists have been cheered by the contrast from the previous governor, Rick Scott, who cut funding for environmental programs. DeSantis isn’t exactly a global warming warrior – he prefers “Teddy Roosevelt conservationist” – but he will at least utter the words “climate change”, unlike Scott, who reportedly banned the term. “It feels like more has happened in the past few months than in the past 25 years,” said Eric Eikenberg, the chief executive of the Everglades Foundation. The problems faced by the Everglades aren’t new or unexplored. Not long after developers started draining the wetlands for agriculture and paved it over for roads and houses, the effects started rippling through the system. By the 1960s, scientists had calculated that while around 2m acre feet (2.5bn cubic metres) of water once flowed in a shallow river of grass from central Florida to the state’s southern tip, the volume of this conveyor belt had been cut in half. The Everglades’ link to its headwater in Lake Okeechobee has been severed, with water diverted via canals for agriculture, particularly sugar. Without the nourishing freshwater, the ecosystem further south has become saltier and prone to disastrous events, such as happened in 2015, when pristine water turns into a muddy slush, causing fish to flee or die. The region is again in mild drought, meaning that rainwater isn’t currently coming to the Everglades’ salvation. “The problem is we’re just not getting enough water,” Davis said. “We only get about a third of the water in the eastern Florida Bay that we received historically. A national park, a world heritage site, an international biosphere reserve, and we’re starving it of fresh water.” One solution, Davis and other advocates believe, is to create a vast reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee that would store water intended for the Everglades. The water would filter south through a system of marshes to deliver millions of gallons of replenishment to the ecosystem. DeSantis backed the plan and recently penned a letter to Trump, alongside Florida senators Scott and Marco Rubio, to ask for funding. There is political expediency in altering the current scenario where the water in Lake Okeechobee is discharged to the west and east, via the Caloosahatchee and the St Lucie rivers respectively, when it fills up and threatens to overflow. Laden with chemicals from nearby agriculture and warmed in temperatures that are climbing as the climate heats up, the water is the perfect spawning ground for toxic blue-green algal blooms. Separate “red tide” algal outbreaks in the ocean ravaged Florida last year, leading to beaches being closed, horrified dog owners who saw their pets poisoned, and hundreds of tons of dead fish and manatees piling up along the Gulf coast. The tourism industry, worth about $67bn annually to Florida, trembled. The breakdown of the natural chain of life was so starkly apparent to Floridians that it became a battleground in the midterm elections. “Voters got hyped up about red tide and said ‘we want the government to act,’” said Rene Price, an expert in the hydrology of the Everglades at Florida International University. “There was a large outcry and it seems like we have got some momentum now.” The Everglades faces the threat of salty inundation on all sides, with the sea level at its edge rising by about 5in since 2001. Price said this accelerating climate trend, driven by the melting of glaciers and expanding sea water, will see the Everglades retreat further north. There will be miles and miles of new Florida Bay. “But we shouldn’t be sitting on our hands,” Price said. “We have the capability to stem the tide by increasing the flow of fresh water. This isn’t the time to give up.” Oliver Milman traveled to the Everglades as a guest of the Everglades Foundation."
"The adder, Britain’s only venomous snake, has for the first time been confirmed as being active in every month of the year. Adders normally hibernate underground from October to March, a strategy designed to enable them to survive a cold winter, but with warmer weather have now been seen throughout the year.  They are declining as a result of increasing habitat loss, persecution, predation, disturbance and inbreeding. A shorter hibernation period and becoming more active in winter is likely to accelerate their demise, as snakes will be much more susceptible to any cold weather that follows a warm spell. Following the record warm temperatures in February, adders have been seen in every calendar month. While the adder is well adapted to cold weather, occurring further north in the world than any other snake species, this is new behaviour and experts warn it is a clear sign of the impact climate change is having on wildlife. Nigel Hand, a trustee of Amphibian and Reptile Groups of the UK and one of the country’s leading adder experts, confirmed the trend.  “I’ve seen adders in every month of the year except December, but have had reliable reports of them being active then in Wales,” he said. “Adders have already been recorded as being seen throughout the year in a national park in the Netherlands, so I have no doubt they are now active throughout the year in Britain as well.” The recent unprecedented temperatures have resulted in adders emerging from hibernation up to a month early. Being active in winter brings them into greater contact with humans and dogs, leading to increased disturbance at their hibernation sites at a time when they are particularly vulnerable because they are sluggish and bask in the open. Adders are protected by law and are shy reptiles that will always try to escape unless cornered or molested. Although they are venomous, no one has died from an adder bite in Britain in more than 40 years and conservationists have in recent years tried to tackle the reptiles’ “image problem”. However, dogs off leads will often attack adders and there have already been reports this year of adders biting dogs in the New Forest. As a result the TV presenter Chris Packham, who lives in the area, has called for dogs to be banned from nature reserves in the People’s Manifesto for Wildlife he launched last year. The adder used to be widespread across Britain but has declined markedly in recent years, particularly in middle England. Research published in the Herpetological Journal has warned that at current rates of decline, the adder could be restricted to just a few sites in the UK within 10-20 years. "
"You may have noticed that Scott Morrison has started talking about climate – he has rebadged and refunded Tony Abbott’s Direct Action emissions reduction fund and Malcolm Turnbull’s Snowy Hydro 2.0. The Coalition’s pivots on climate echo research that centrist voters are starting to draw lines between environmental issues such as climate change, energy, clean air and water, food security and waste with capacity for leadership.  So three months out from an election, independents are emerging to challenge Coalition MPs, taking a bet that centre-right voters want action on these issues that are normally associated with the centre left. If your attention is on the big cities, you may have missed some interesting candidates step out of the shrubbery in rural and regional seats in the past week. Three independents have announced challenges to Barnaby Joyce, Angus Taylor and Sussan Ley at the federal election. While these would-be crossbenchers are not national household names, they are locally connected and will test the ideas, electorate voting cultures and resources of sitting MPs. Political disengagement, climate, water and regional services rate highly on their platforms though each have local nuance which is so important in such seats. Joyce will face a challenge from rural sustainability strategist and small businessman Adam Blakester, who comes from Werris Creek, the same place as the seat’s former independent Tony Windsor. Joyce holds the seat on a margin of 23%, following the 2017 byelection over his dual citizenship. The contest will test Joyce’s standing following the fallout from his affair (not public prior to the byelection), but more particularly, his record as agriculture minister on issues such as live export and water management. Blakester has been organising for four months. Like Cathy McGowan’s “kitchen table conversations”, he says he will consult with locals to construct a policy platform, but climate change and sustainability is already trending in his conversations. But his non-negotiable priority is proper political and public governance: how politicians interact on the floor of parliament, with the media, with each other and flowing from that, an effective anti-corruption commission. “I think there is real discontent across Australia and here in New England – I hear it’s like a school yard but as someone who has done a lot of work with schools, I wouldn’t use children as a metaphor, I wouldn’t use dogs; we need a new metaphor,” Blakester said. “Some of their behaviour makes Taiwan’s parliament look good.” Closer to Sydney, an adventurer, environmentalist and small businessman who was named by Time magazine as one of 25 “worldwide responsibility pioneers” will challenge energy minister Angus Taylor in Hume. Huw Kingston won the Time title after he campaigned successfully to stop the sale of still bottled water in his hometown of Bundanoon. He needs to beat a 1o% margin in Hume which is a tricky seat that stretches from the outskirts of Sydney through the southern highlands and down to farming country near Canberra. Kingston is more overt than Blakester about his pledge to campaign on climate change and specifically a renewable energy target of 60% by 2035 – compared with the Coalition’s abandoned target and Labor’s 50% target by 2030. He wants to see a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin, a national policy to phase out single-use plastics, no new large-scale coalmines including Adani, an increase in the current annual refugee intake from 20,000 to 30,000, closure of Manus Island and Nauru detention centres, a very fast train link between Sydney and Canberra, and better regional health and education services. Malcolm Turnbull’s demise got Kingston thinking about politics at a time when more reports were issued about the state of the climate. It was a “now or never” proposition. “The story getting common for those standing and for the people out in Australia is how disappointed they are with political system over last 10 years, but it was the rolling of Turnbull in August that fired me up,” Kingston said. “I was pissed off as a taxpayer. What other job could you do where you would be allowed to stay and do a job while destabilising inside the workplace? “Politicians have been playing games instead of governing and it is all going on while the world continues to warm up and no one is doing anything about it.” Different again is ex-policeman and Albury mayor Kevin Mack who is challenging Sussan Ley in the 127,000sq km seat of Farrer. Mack is more old-style country politician, reflecting the nature of his seat. He presents as a mix of Labor and Liberal strands. Mack admires Paul Keating’s intellect in driving the agenda of the Hawke government, but says the National’s Doug Anthony was the last major party representative with “a decent regional focus”. Mack says he is focused on the whole seat, the small towns that add ballast and productivity to the larger centres such as Albury and Griffith. Water is a big issue in the electorate, including its quality and the productivity derived from water. But he also names regional services as a concern. “Connectivity, transport, NBN, mobile phone towers are nonexistent in Farrer,” he says. “We have 22% unemployment, which is a significant problem. If you fix water, you fix employment. And investing in mental health from the front end rather than the back end.” Mack has connected with nearby independent candidates, including Helen Haines who is hoping to replace McGowan in Indi, and Ray Kingston, the former Yarriambiack mayor hoping to win the safe seat Mallee after the unexpected retirement of the National Andrew Broad. It is these conversations that are changing things on the ground in rural electorates. That, combined with candidates who are more confident to challenge the notions of what a rural voter is and the policies that voters may support."

"This week’s record winter heat in the UK was so far above normal trends that scientists have been forced to reconsider their statistical models, with one expert calling the temperature jump “incredible”. UK temperature records have tumbled in the past 10 days. Last Thursday, Scotland experienced its highest winter warmth of 18.3C in Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire. On Tuesday, Wales set a new UK high for the season for 20.8 in Porthmadog. This was beaten on Wednesday, when Kew registered 21.2C.  Even taking into account the underlying 1C of global heating from carbon emissions this was a surprise to some scientists. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate researcher at Royal Netherlands Meteorolgical Institute who has conducted a preliminary study of the trend data from Reading and central England, said the probability of this week’s temperatures was close to zero. “This is an incredible jump in record temperatures. If you asked me a few months ago, I would have said it is ridiculous,” he said. “It’s at least a one-in 200-year event, but it could be more because my statistical tools break down because this was so far outside what we are used to in February.” According to the Met Office, the mean maximum temperature in February was at up to 3.5C above the average between 1981 and 2010. This was due to large areas of high pressure over continental Europe that brought warm air from the Canaries and north Africa. Government meteorologists are now studying exactly how much of this unusual heat can be attributed to man-made climate change. Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office, said: “For a lot of people an opportunity to enjoy a nice day but for many others it was shocking to see values above 20C. Clearly having that warm weather record broken is, we think, largely to do with climate change, amplifying those warm events. That was widely recognised by the public.”  Previous Met Office studies show the man-made carbon emissions in the atmosphere made last summer’s heatwave 30 times more likely, and extremes of heat are now being recorded 10 times more often than extremes of cold. The weirding of the weather – which was warmer than Bermuda this week and colder than the Arctic at the same time last year – has prompted mixed reactions. A study of the coverage by CarbonBrief highlights how images of wildfires on Saddleworth Moor and stories about water shortages contrasted with cheery headlines such as “Fabruary” and reports about ice-cream sales. Nick Bridge, the UK’s chief climate envoy, was among many to express frustration with the lack of concern in many reports by the BBC and others: @BBCNews & @bbcfivelive also covered record temperatures, focusing on🍦sales, with no note of concern. Yet here I sit in deepest existential unease knowing what collectively these bonkers (diplomatic term) record-breaking weather events & trends across the world probably mean. https://t.co/e3krYDj39T Yet the first climate debate in parliament for two years was sparsely attended by MPs. The disparity between the growing evidence of crisis and the limp response by politicians and most media is expected to galvanise more direct action of the sort seen in recent months with student strikes and acts of civil disobedience by Extinction Rebellion protesters. “Thanks to the students, who made us act,” said Layla Moran‏, a Liberal Democrat MP who proposed the debate with Caroline Lucas of the Green party, and urged legislators to listen to the child activists. “The message that came to us from the young people, who struck the other day, is that we must now take this as an emergency. We cannot wait another two years to debate this in this place.” Lucas said time was running out but the government was going backwards on climate action. “Since 2010 almost every existing sensible climate measure has been torched: zero carbon homes scrapped, onshore wind effectively banned, solar power shafted, the Green Investment Bank flogged off, and fracking forced on local communities.” Claire Perry, the minister of state for energy and clean growth, accepted that current efforts were insufficient. “We can take pride in the UK’s record in tackling climate change, but we know we have to do more, and we will do more. We must keep leading from the front so we can look the next generation in the eye and say for your future we protected Planet A because there is no Planet B.” But the sparse turnout highlighted the low priority this continues to be for most politicians. Extinction Rebellion has shared images of the largely empty chamber on social networks and echoed Lucas’s call for the government to declare a climate emergency. It plans to support a global school strike on 15 March and to stage a week of disruption starting on 15 April. Other environment groups are also stepping up pressure on the government. “We’re living through a climate emergency, so really our politicians should be debating this every week,” said Mel Evans, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK. “It’s time for us all to demand that our government faces up to reality and calls the crisis what it is, a climate emergency.”"
"As bushfires raged across Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand, and north Queensland faced a massive cleanup after unexpected flooding, a different extreme weather event was silently forming in the Tasman Sea over summer. For the second year in a row, a stubborn high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea was warming the surface of the ocean to above-average temperatures, forming a marine heatwave, wreaking destruction and providing a glimpse of the new ecological order in the marine Anthropocene. Globally marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and prolonged and affecting biodiversity, according to new research published in Nature Climate Change this week.  In the summer of 2017-18, the intense marine heatwave was combined with a land-based heatwave, together covering four million sq km. Scientists  found the extreme weather event caused unprecedented loss of glacial ice in the New Zealand Southern Alps, changes to wine-grape harvests, and major disruption of marine ecosystems including kelp habitat loss, new species invasions and fisheries season changes. This year the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand  reported that sea surface temperatures in the Tasman were again above average. Like coral reefs and tropical rainforests, the ocean suffers the slow torture of climate change peppered with high-intensity hits from extreme weather. Marine heatwaves are generally out of sight and out of mind until one gets so bad it becomes impossible to ignore, says CSIRO research scientist Alistair Hobday. A marine heatwave happens when the ocean temperature is much warmer than usual for the time of year from sunlight heating the surface water or warm water being brought via ocean currents – or both. Climate change is causing marine heatwaves to happen more frequently and with more intensity. There may not be scorched earth or destroyed homes left in its wake, but a marine heatwave impacts our future in different ways – and serves as a warning. “Marine heatwaves provide a window into what our oceans will look like in the future, which is why it’s important to keep track of them,” Hobday says. In 2015, New Zealand experienced its longest and most intense marine heatwave on record. For some it was good news – “It brought down valuable tropical species like kingfish and snapper,” Hobday says. For the aquaculture industry, however, it brought disease outbreaks in oyster farms, disruptions to salmon farming and abalone deaths along the coast. When an extreme marine heatwave lingered over the Shark Bay world heritage area in 2011, seagrass and kelp forests died en masse. Some kelp species became regionally extinct over hundreds of kilometres, says marine ecologist Cayne Layton from the University of Tasmania. “That [kelp loss] was a direct effect of the heat, but also due to herbivorous fish following the warm water and moving in to munch on the kelp.” Like coral, kelp provides habitat structure, shelter and food for an entire ecosystem – without it the ecosystem would cease to exist. But, also like coral, the planet is losing kelp forests to climate change at an alarming rate. Forests of giant kelp, known as Macrocystis pyrifera, used to dominate Tasmania’s coastline. But in recent years, 95% have been lost and largely replaced by common kelp, says Layton. “It’s the equivalent of losing a forest on land and having it replaced by shrubbery,” he says. “It might still have some diversity, but you’ve undoubtedly lost something important.”  Although common kelp might take over in the short term, a marine heatwave or a plague of hungry sea urchins could quickly knock that out too, allowing even hardier turf algae to move in. From the forest to the shrub, now to a lawn – albeit a weedy one. Species that, like kelp, can’t keep pace with the fast rate of anthropogenic warming, can be quickly be written off by an extreme event such as a marine heatwave or tropical cyclone.  Some more physically and physiologically nimble species are set to thrive in a warmer ocean. “[In a warmer ocean] you might expect to see more ‘weedy species’ that can adapt more quickly to change,” says marine ecologist Zoe Doubleday from the University of South Australia. Weedy isn’t a technical classification of plants or animals, but rather a type of lifestyle. Animals and plants considered weedy species typically have short lifespans and a flexible lifestyle that allows them to take advantage of sparse or patchy resources, Doubleday says. “They can change their shape, what they eat and when they mature and reproduce to take advantage of novel conditions created by climate change,” she says. “For example jellyfish, algae and cephalopods – they’re very different types of organisms, but they have some similar characteristics. They’re short-lived, tolerant, adaptable – just like a terrestrial weed that you might see in your garden.” Receding kelp forests are already being replaced by seaweed turfs, bigger numbers of some cephalopods and jellyfish blooms. “We already eat weedy species, and cephalopods are becoming increasingly important in our fisheries, and they might be better than fish in terms of sustainability in the future,” Doubleday says. “Rather than just suppressing the weeds, maybe we could start predicting exactly which species are going to thrive and how we could use them.” So while jellyfish may not be on the menu now, soon there may be few other options."
"At long last the political debate in the world’s richest country is vibrant with proposals that would help the most vulnerable in our society. And what do we hear in response? A growing chorus of naysayers. “Just pipe dreams” – that’s how the Washington Post columnist Robert Samuelson referred to proposals for guaranteed jobs, Medicare for All, universal childcare, and the Green New Deal.  Like many other pundits and politicians, Samuelson says we can’t afford such luxuries. Taxing the rich wouldn’t raise enough money. We’d have no choice but to resort to deficit spending. Funny how some politicians have no qualms about ballooning the deficit with tax cuts for the rich but balk at investing in the long-term health of our people and communities. Just as peculiar: the fact that military spending cuts are virtually never mentioned as an option for freeing up funds for social good instead of war. This year the US military budget is $716bn – and boy is it ripe for slashing. That military budget represents about 53 cents of every discretionary dollar in the federal budget – and it’s one of the biggest reasons that people so often throw up their hands and shake their heads when they think about funding innovative ways to end poverty. They don’t need to throw up their hands, though. The politicians and pundits should just start listening to children. When young organizers from the Sunrise Movement recently challenged Senator Dianne Feinstein to support a Green New Deal, she told them “there’s no money to pay for it”. She probably didn’t expect those eight- and 10- and 11-year-old kids to respond immediately: “Yes, there is, there’s tons of money going to the military.” Feinstein responded condescendingly that the military does “important things” with that money. Our never-ending wars say otherwise. Last year saw the highest number of civilians killed in the Afghanistan war since the UN began keeping track – more than 3,800 people, 930 of them children. About a quarter of them were killed by US and Nato troops and their Afghan government allies – and most of those by US-Nato airstrikes and drone attacks. Thousands more were injured. Committing such mayhem doesn’t come cheap. Last year alone, the war in Afghanistan, in its 17th year, cost about $45bn. And that’s just the immediate cost of fighting the war – it doesn’t include the costs of caring for injured US soldiers, let alone Afghan victims. It doesn’t include training more soldiers to replace the ones occupying Afghanistan now, or the enormous sums spent on the base Pentagon budget. Most importantly, the war in Afghanistan hasn’t made us any safer, and isn’t making life better for the people of Afghanistan. (To take one grim measure, at the start of the war, Afghan babies faced the fourth-highest levels of infant mortality of any children in the world. Today, after almost 18 years of US war, Afghanistan is No 1.) And those soldiers that have come back from the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond? They still aren’t getting the care they need. They still struggle to access Veterans Administration clinics and hospitals, and they’re still killing themselves at rates advocates deem a “national emergency”. According to the VA itself, the Guardian reports, veterans aged 18-34, many of whom served in Iraq and Afghanistan, have “higher rates of suicide than any other age group”. The human toll of these wars is staggering. And the financial costs are breathtaking. Neta Crawford, who co-directs the Cost of Wars Project at Brown University, estimated back in 2017 that total war spending in just Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan was approaching $5tn since 2001. When we’re talking about trillions of dollars – $2tn for Afghanistan and another $3tn or so for Iraq and beyond, Crawford calculates – it means there’s plenty of money to fund things that really do keep our people and our country safe. For just a quarter of that $2tn we’ve spent on a fruitless, brutal war in Afghanistan, the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies calculates we could instead fund more than 103,000 elementary school teachers, 112,000 clean energy jobs, 935,000 Head Start slots, and healthcare for 806,000 veterans and more than 2.3 million adults, and retrofit nearly 5.8m houses for solar electricity. In fact, we could do all of that every year for 10 years. Compared to all this, paying trillions for war isn’t an investment – it’s just a loss. It’s loss at a scale that, if it were reversed, would make a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and all the rest perfectly realistic. Which would make us safer?

"Australia is the only developed country that allows climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants, green finance experts say. Experts say allowing Vales Point coal-fired power station to register with the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund, rebadged this week as a “climate solutions” policy, puts Australia out of step with the World Bank, Europe and the US, which have all rejected using climate financing for coal power retrofits. The World Bank has issued US$13bn in green bonds since 2008 to stimulate spending to combat global warming. China has used green bonds to help build new coal-fired plants to replace older, dirtier stations on the grounds it reduces nitrogen-based emissions causing the country’s oppressive air pollution. But it announced in December it would no longer consider “clean coal” plants – which still emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas – investments in green technology. Sean Kidney, chief executive of the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative, says China’s shift leaves Australia out on its own. “If you were committed to meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the Australian government says it is committed to, this is just lunacy,” Kidney says. “No investors in the western world will accept any green bonds that incentivise anything like coal station retrofits. From an investor’s perspective, coal is a dead duck.” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, says Australia is moving across the trend by considering giving taxpayer support to coal. In addition to the potential support through the climate solutions fund, the government is considering underwriting the cost of building new coal-fired power stations. In the past fortnight, mining giant Glencore has said it will cap coal production in response to pressure from shareholders, while Rio Tinto stressed it was the only large mining company with no fossil fuel investments, having sold its final coal assets to Glencore last year. From an investor’s perspective, coal is a dead duck “At a time when private-sector capital is increasingly looking for low carbon and decarbonisation opportunities, it would seem to be swimming against the tide to put government taxpayer funding into these [coal] activities,” Herd says. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that  limiting global warming to 1.5C – a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement – would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. While global markets increasingly recognise a decline in coal use is inevitable, the shift away from it has been fitful. The Global Carbon Project found global emissions were likely to have hit a new high in 2018, in part due to an increase in coal burning in China. It bucked a global decline in emissions from coal in 2015 and 2016. Though it has been registered, Vales Point coal plant is yet to bid for money from the emissions reduction fund due to a dispute over whether it needs to reduce its carbon intensity to less than the grid average to win a government contract. The plant’s owners say the project would reduce emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant’s emissions over that time. The environment minister, Melissa Price, has backed the interpretation of the Clean Energy Regulator, which says the project does not qualify in its current form. The company disagrees, noting former environment minister Greg Hunt said the fund could be used to “clean up” power plants and that published guidelines explicitly said coal could win backing. The methodology is being reviewed by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee. Even if Vales Point is not successful, critics such as the Australian Conservation Foundation say there is nothing preventing other coal-fired plant owners from applying for a climate subsidy. Major companies are being paid from the fund for other fossil fuel projects: South African miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant the company says it would have built regardless; Rio Tinto has received $2m for a diesel-fired power plant at a bauxite mine. With prime minister Scott Morrison announcing the Coalition would top up the $2.55bn fund with an additional $2bn over a decade, economists and environmentalists have called for emissions from fossil fuels to be dealt with through different policies and for the fund to focus on projects that restore or protect natural habitat. Experts say the scheme will be improved if the government tightens the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was promised to limit emissions from big industry but which has largely allowed major companies to nominate their own pollution. National emissions have increased each year since the emissions reduction fund replaced the abolished carbon price scheme in 2014. Money from the fund is distributed via reverse auction, with land owners and businesses bidding for contracts to reduce emissions cheaply. Analyses have found some projects under the fund have merit but it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere."
"When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published their latest report in October, the message was stark: if the planet wants to avert dangerous climate breakdown, we need to cut emissions in half by 2030, and hit net zero by the middle of the century. It would be difficult to overstate how dramatic this trajectory is. It represents a total and rapid reversal of our present direction as a civilisation. We’ve built up a global energy infrastructure around fossil fuels over 200 years, and now we need to completely transform it in 30.  The only way to accomplish this feat is with coordinated government action on a massive scale. Proponents of the US’s Green New Deal idea have it right: we need to pump public investment into churning out solar panels, wind turbines and batteries at a historically unprecedented rate, reminiscent of the industrial retooling that enabled the allies to win the second world war. But even this won’t be enough, in and of itself. There’s something missing from the Green New Deal strategy – and it could turn out to be a fatal flaw. The problem with the existing plan is that it doesn’t address the paradox of growing energy demand. Over the past few years, scientists have been warning that we may fail to reach our climate goals even with the most aggressive efforts, because global economic growth is driving energy demand up at a pace that’s outstripping our ability to install clean power. Today the world is producing 8bn more megawatt hours of clean energy each year than in 2000. That’s a lot – enough to power all of Russia. But over exactly the same period, economic growth has caused energy demand to increase by a staggering 48bn megawatt hours. In other words, all that new clean energy we’ve rolled out covers only a small fraction of new demand. That’s why emissions keep rising. It’s like shovelling sand into a hole that just keeps getting bigger. This problem is going to eventually cripple us. If we continue growing the global economy at existing rates, it will nearly triple in size by the middle of the century. That’s three times more production and consumption than we’re already doing – which will require nearly three times more energy. It will be difficult enough for us to decarbonise the existing global economy – virtually impossible do it three times over. Our obsession with economic growth is making our task much more difficult than it needs to be. It’s like we’ve chosen to fight this battle facing uphill, with one hand tied behind our back. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost There’s an easier way. The recent IPCC report points out that to have a realistic chance at staying under 1.5C, we need to scale down energy demand. The scenario its proposes – developed by an international team of scientists – calls for high-income nations like Britain and the US to significantly reduce their consumption of material stuff. Right now, rich nations devour 28 tonnes of material per person per year – including everything from fish to forests, plastics to metals. That’s four times more than ecologists say is sustainable. It requires an extraordinary amount of energy to extract, produce and transport all that stuff. By using less of it, we can shrink global energy demand and make it much easier to decarbonise the economy. This isn’t just about convincing individuals to lead simpler lives, although of course we need that. It’s about changing the way our economy operates – liberating ourselves from the irrational imperative to grow material use unnecessarily. How can we do this? One way is to legislate extended warranties on products, so washing machines and refrigerators last for 30 years instead of 10. Another is to ban planned obsolescence, so manufacturers can’t create products that are designed to fail. And we could introduce a “right to repair” so we can get our smartphones and blenders fixed cheaply when they break down rather than having to buy new ones. We could also cut down on waste by banning food from landfill (as South Korea and France are doing). We could tax red meat to promote a shift to less resource-intensive foods, and ban single-use plastics and disposable coffee cups. We could liberate public spaces from advertising (like São Paulo has done) to free us from the psychological pressures of having to buy stuff just to feel good about ourselves. And we can expand access to public goods and develop platforms for sharing things like cars and lawnmowers. All of these measures would dramatically reduce material consumption, without any loss to our wellbeing. But to really make it work, we need to get straight to the heart of the issue: put a cap on annual material use and tighten it year on year, down to 8 tonnes per capita by the middle of the century. This will change incentives across the economy – reorienting people and business toward long-lasting, repairable and recyclable products. By dramatically reducing energy demand, this approach will give us a good shot at accomplishing our climate goals. What’s exciting about this is that it doesn’t just help us avert climate breakdown. It also provides our best hope of reversing other aspects of ecological collapse – from deforestation to soil depletion, from biodiversity loss to insect die-off. Reducing our material impact on the Earth means freeing up more space for other living systems to recover and thrive. We need to do everything we can to transition to clean energy, yes. But we’ll only succeed if we reduce the amount of energy we consume in the first place, rather than continuing to grow it. The science is clear: scaling down material use must be at the core of the Green New Deal – and at the centre of our climate policy. • Jason Hickel is an anthropologist at the London School of Economics"

"The number of heatwaves affecting the planet’s oceans has increased sharply, scientists have revealed, killing swathes of sea-life like “wildfires that take out huge areas of forest”. The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful for humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-warming carbon dioxide the atmosphere, they say.  Global warming is gradually increasing the average temperature of the oceans, but the new research is the first systematic global analysis of ocean heatwaves, when temperatures reach extremes for five days or more. The research found heatwaves are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, with the number of heatwave days tripling in the last couple of years studied. In the longer term, the number of heatwave days jumped by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with the period of 1925 to 1954. As heatwaves have increased, kelp forests, seagrass meadows and coral reefs have been lost. These foundation species are critical to life in the ocean. They provide shelter and food to many others, but have been hit on coasts from California to Australia to Spain. “You have heatwave-induced wildfires that take out huge areas of forest, but this is happening underwater as well,” said Dan Smale at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, UK, who led the research published in Nature Climate Change. “You see the kelp and seagrasses dying in front of you. Within weeks or months they are just gone, along hundreds of kilometres of coastline.” As well as quantifying the increase in heatwaves, the team analysed 116 research papers on eight well-studied marine heatwaves, such as the record-breaking “Ningaloo Niño” that hit Australia in 2011 and the hot “blob” that persisted in the north-east Pacific from 2013 to 2016. “They have adverse impacts on a wide range of organisms, from plankton to invertebrates, to fish, mammals and seabirds,” Smale said. The scientists compared the areas where heatwaves have increased most with those areas harbouring rich biodiversity or species already near their temperature limit and those where additional stresses, such as pollution or overfishing, already occur. This revealed hotspots of harm from the north-east Atlantic to the Caribbean to the western Pacific. “A lot of ocean systems are being battered by multiple stresses,” Smale said. The natural ocean cycle of El Niño is a key factor in pushing up temperatures in some parts of the ocean and the effect of global warming on the phenomenon remains uncertain, but the gradual overall heating of the oceans means heatwaves are worse when they strike. “The starting temperature is much higher, so the absolute temperatures [in a heatwave] are that much higher and more stressful,” said Smale. Some marine wildlife is mobile and could in theory swim to cooler waters, but ocean heatwaves often strike large areas more rapidly than fish move, he said. The researchers said ocean heatwaves can have “major socioeconomic and political ramifications”, such as in the north-west Atlantic in 2012, when lobster stocks were dramatically affected, creating tensions across the US-Canada border. “This [research] makes clear that heatwaves are hitting the ocean all over the world … The ocean, in effect, is spiking a fever,” said Prof Malin Pinsky, at Rutgers University, US, and not part of the team. “These events are likely to become more extreme and more common in the future unless we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Dr Éva Plagányi at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia also likened ocean heatwaves to wildfires. “Frequent big hits can have long-lasting effects,” she said. “This study shows that record-breaking events are becoming the new normal.” The damage global warming is causing to the oceans has also been shown in a series of other scientific papers published in the last week. Ocean warming has cut sustainable fish catches by 15% to 35% in five regions, including the North Sea and the East China Sea, and 4% globally, according to work published by Pinsky and colleagues. “We were stunned to find that fisheries around the world have already responded to ocean warming,” he said. Another study showed that achieving the 2C climate change target set out in the Paris agreement would protect almost 10m tonnes of fish catches each year, worth tens of billions of dollars. Separate work by Plagányi’s team showed that climate change will reverse the recovery of whales in the Southern Ocean by damaging the krill on which they feed. “Models predict concerning declines, and even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue and fin whales, and Atlantic and Indian Ocean fin and humpback whales,” they said. “In the space of one week, scientific publications have underscored that unless we take evasive action, our future oceans will have fewer fish, fewer whales and frequent dramatic shifts in ecological structure will occur, with concerning implications for humans who depend on the ocean,” said Plagányi."
"Nicola Sturgeon’s government needs to show much greater urgency in tackling climate change, a cross-party committee of the Scottish parliament has said. The environment committee said the Scottish government’s goal of cutting emissions by 90% before 2050 failed to address the scale of the challenge. Instead, ministers should aim for a net zero target, where there are no additional emissions that affect the climate, MSPs said.  In a detailed report on the Scottish government’s climate bill, the committee said ministers needed to heed the latest advice from the International Panel on Climate Change, which called for global action to cap emissions at 1.5C. Achieving that target required much more radical and swifter action, the committee said. They said the scale of the changes to the way the economy operated to ensure emissions did not breach a 1.5C increase was “unprecedented in human history”. There needed to be “a greater urgency of action across all parts of government, across the public and private sectors and by individuals, to deliver the transformational change required. “Climate change is an intergenerational justice issue and the committee believes we need to act now to help ensure future generations inherit a world that is sustainable.” Scottish ministers insist their goal of reaching 90% by 2050 is a realistic target but said they could revise those targets after getting updated advice from the UK committee on climate change, an official body set up to advise the UK and devolved governments, due in May. “We want to go further and achieve net-zero emissions for all greenhouse gases as soon as possible,” it said in a statement. “We’ll set a target date as soon as this can be done credibly and responsibly.” The Holyrood committee’s criticisms increase pressure on the Scottish government to set tougher targets. Caroline Rance, a climate campaigner from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said ministers should also set much tougher emission reduction targets for 2030. “Climate change is the most urgent and pressing crisis facing the world and Scotland’s targets for cutting emissions must reflect our commitment to meeting that challenge,” she said. Protesters from the radical activist group Extinction Rebellion have targeted Holyrood twice in the past six weeks. Calling for a net zero target of 2025, they staged a sit-in at Holyrood’s debating chamber in January and tried to mount a protest at first minister’s questions last Thursday, but were stopped by police. The Scottish Greens and environmentalists were highly critical of the Scottish government’s progress on tackling carbon emissions from transport last week after the latest data showed levels of bus use and cycling were falling while car use and flights were increasing. Railway use had also gone up."
"The government has been warned against complacency on climate change action after figures showed a slowdown in the rate of Britain’s carbon emission cuts. Emissions dropped for the sixth year running in 2018, to 361m tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, a level last seen in the late 19th century. But there are signs the country’s recent period of rapid progress is drawing to a close. The estimated 1.5% decline last year was considerably smaller than the 3.2% fall in 2017 and the 8.7% drop in 2014: the biggest in recent years. Labour, which has pitched itself as more radical than the government on climate change action, said the figures showed the need to speed up decarbonisation. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “The government are wrong to be complacent about the UK’s falling emissions when we know that winning slowly on climate change is the same as losing.” UK emissions have been on a long-term trend downwards over the past three decades, and the pace has picked up in recent years. Coal power’s decline over the past decade accounted for three-quarters of CO2 reductions over that period, according to the website Carbon Brief, which estimates emissions from an analysis of government energy data. Simon Evans, the policy editor at the group, said: “The lion’s share of recent CO2 reductions in the UK have been due to falling coal use.” But he said that with coal power now accounting for 5% of electricity generation, the scope for additional emissions cuts was “increasingly limited”. One major coal power station in Yorkshire closed last year, and another in Nottinghamshire is to close in September. The economics of UK coal power have deteriorated in recent years. Ministers have promised to shut the last seven plants by 2025, though market forces mean that landmark could be reached earlier, in 2023. While the power sector has driven most of the UK’s recent emissions cuts, other sectors have either stalled or got worse. The Carbon Brief figures show oil and gas use – primarily used for vehicles, power and heating – have barely changed over the past few years. Transport has become the biggest single polluting sector, overtaking energy. Evans said: “The UK will not be able to meet its legally-binding climate goals in future without progress across all fuels and sectors.” The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s climate advisers, recently said that emissions have begun to increase in some sectors, such as construction. Experts said future emissions cuts would not necessarily be more costly, but would be politically harder. Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London, said: “The next steps involve more coordination of government efforts – the infrastructure and industrial policy dimensions of electric vehicles, coordination of zero carbon homes with housing policy. “I don’t see higher costs, but tougher lobbying and coordination problems which can’t easily be tackled through economic instruments or auctions [as seen in the power sector].” Carbon Brief has a strong track record of closely predicting the official emissions figures, which will be published by the government later in March."
"The UK has experienced its warmest winter day on record, the Met Office has revealed. Temperatures in Kew Gardens, south-west London, reached 21.2C (70.2F), breaking the record for the warmest February day. The Met Office defines winter from the beginning of December to the end of February, so Tuesday’s sunny spell is also a winter record.  The record had already been broken on Monday, when temperatures exceeded 20C during winter for the very first time. This week’s unseasonably warm weather differs dramatically from the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country. The previous winter record had been 19.7C in Greenwich, south-east London, in 1998. “The average temperature for this time of year is 9C in London and 9C in north Wales, so what we’re seeing is 10 degrees above average,” said Martin Bowles, a Met Office meteorologist. Bowles said: “We can’t blame climate change directly because we’re talking about weather, not the climate. But it is a sign of climate change. There’s been a gradual increase of temperatures over the last 30 years so the extreme weather has also been increasing.” Parts of Britain on Tuesday were hotter than Malibu, Athens, Crete and Barcelona. The warm weather is in stark contrast to this time last year, when the “beast from the east” swept across much of the UK, bringing heavy snow showers and lows of -5C. The cold conditions caused travel delays and power cuts in what were the lowest temperatures in the week leading up to 1 March since 1986. Bowles said the warm temperatures were largely because of an area of pressure over the North Sea, which was drawing up warm air from the south. Last year’s cold weather was because of a similar weather pattern, but the high pressure came from Arctic Russia, before moving over Scandinavia. The conditions seen this week come from the tropical Atlantic and parts of north Africa. While temperatures are forecast to reach 19C on Wednesday, the Met Office is expecting to see a change from Thursday onwards, when weather from the Atlantic will bring colder showers. “We’re having a very warm end to winter, but will see a typical beginning to spring,” Bowles said Heavy showers are possible at the end of the week, as temperatures will struggle to get above 11C or 12C."

"As you say, the cement component of concrete generates much CO2 (Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth, 26 February). Roughly 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of cement. Or 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 for a small-sized plant. Cement consumption per capita is between 50kg and 2,000kg per person per year, depending on the phase of development of the country and the availability of alternative building materials. Taking an unholy average, each member of the human population is responsible, through their fondness for a built environment, for roughly 500kg per year of CO2 from cement. What you forgot to point out is that human metabolism contributes roughly 300kg per person per year of CO2 through exhaled breath. Perhaps more in Westminster, the offices of newspapers and the vicinity of sports grounds. The annual US dollar turnover of the worldwide cement industry, by the by, is only 60% of that of Walmart. Suffice to say that the most destructive material on Earth is not concrete. It’s not oil or coal either. The most destructive material on Earth is human flesh. The clue is in the anthropo part of anthropogenic climate change. If you really want to save the planet a radical cull is required, but if you’re too tender for that, worry not. The Verhulst model for population growth suggests that the adjustment will happen of itself.Peter Anderson(Consulting engineer to the cement industry), Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire  • In George Monbiot’s manifesto for climate strikers (Opinion, 20 February), he suggests: “The world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought.” And he proposes the restoration of the “benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive”. Unfortunately, he’s completely missed one of the main issues driving climate change, namely the huge increase in the number of people living on this planet. When he was born in 1963 the world population was 3.2 billion. Today, just 56 years later, it’s around 7.7 billion. It’s precisely the success of our thriving human population that is causing untold damage around the world to the “other species” he mentions. We’re adding around 81 million people a year to the world’s population, and climate change is just one of the consequences of massive population growth. It’s no good just reducing carbon emissions; we also need to have fewer children. This will be the fastest way to save our planet. And politicians, economists and businesspeople must stop talking about “growth” being a good thing. We urgently need to start planning to decrease our population growth and our economies and world travel, and put a halt to flagrant spending on throwaway goods etc. Only then will our (far fewer) grandchildren have a better life.Jonathan CockburnHewelsfield, Gloucestershire • Jonathan Watts does us an important service (Decline in biodiversity ‘threatens food crisis’, 22 February) in bringing to our attention the comprehensive UN report on the state of the world’s biodiversity with respect to our need for food, and the many factors threatening food production. Too often, particular threats to humanity are identified, attracting justified concern and attention, when they themselves have a more fundamental upstream cause. Climate change is driven by climate changers, all 7.7 billion of us, increasing at more than 80 million annually. Each new soul will need additional food, energy, housing, education and health services, and clean water and air in an increasingly polluted world. We have to talk about population. Charities such as Population Matters, for whom Sir David Attenborough and several other scientists are patrons, show how entirely non-coercive and proven ways are available for the reduction and reversal of population growth urgently required.

"Last week, supposedly unprecedented spring wildfires raged across dry, bushy and exposed areas. On Monday, having dealt with serious incidents at Saddleworth Moor and Hundred Acre Wood, teams of specialised firefighters also attended the small piece of Shredded Wheat that lives on top of Andrew Neil’s head. Dozens of grateful weevils were saved from certain death in the breakfast bisc inferno by the firefighters and rehoused in temporary accommodation in the nearby clumps of Andrew Neil’s ear hair, while his nostrils became emergency treatment centres for scorched pests.  Andrew Neil’s head wheat had begun smouldering when he heard that Penny Mordaunt MP had agreed to be filmed for This Week, making the case for Hard Brexit while swimming around a giant floating model of the UK in Liverpool’s Royal Albert Dock. Neil’s morning bisc crown had crumbled during the blaze and so its remains were eaten as a This Week green room snack by Michael Portillo, who lapped up the wheaten fragments with warmed milk from his dish, like a pleased cat. Nonetheless, weather women smiled cheerily on Tuesday as they announced the hottest British February on record. Their happiness perhaps tells you that the so-called “climate change” situation isn’t as serious as the doomsayers and gloom-mongers out there would have us believe. After all, if it really was too hot for the daffodils to survive, wouldn’t they just stay in the ground and wait? Recently, the Times’s Quentin Letts and Julia Hartley-Brewer’s Julia Hartley-Brewer both tweeted, with delight, that they were able to ski across the Swiss border unhindered. This apparently showed that there was no need for a British border in Ireland, because of blah blah blah shit piss wank. It also proved that it can’t be that hot as otherwise there wouldn’t be any snow, which is all made out of coldness, like in Frozen. Some misery-gongers and doom-dongers have even suggested that the late Professor Stephen Hawking’s 2017 warning, that Earth had only 100 more years of habitability, now looks optimistic. But Hawking was a liar, because if the world really was in trouble like how he said it was, then why wouldn’t he of used his mind to invent a invention to mend it? It proved very convenient for the biased Hard Remainiac BBC that this supposed climate emergency emerged last week. It distracts from any positive coverage of their hated Brexit. Indeed, the crisis of democracy in our parliament has barely been talked about since Andrew Neil’s carbohydrate yarmulke combusted on Monday. Instead, all we seemed to hear about all week was the imminence of the climate threat to all life on Earth, the inevitability of major environmental disasters, killing billions, and the need to change immediately to a global zero carbon economy or face mass extinction by the middle of the century. What we should still have been talking about, of course, and at the expense of everything else, for years and years, today and every day, is our membership, or non-membership, of a European trading bloc and how this affects the power bases of the principal political parties in the United Kingdom in the short term. Not the death of all life on Earth. On Monday night, tiny Jeremy Corbyn shifted his two buttocks slightly on his north London fence, the kitten weight of his coddled-egg-nourished frame pivoting slightly towards the possibility of maybe having a second referendum, if Tom Watson and Keir Starmer and the Labour party membership absolutely insist, but not really, obviously. Indeed, the British people’s democratic right to ruin their own country for a generation at least, destroy the livelihoods of their most vulnerable communities and sabotage food and medicine security indefinitely must be respected without question, like an old-fashioned village policeman or a violent Ape-God. Those who tremble at the prospect of shortages of vital supplies just need to think of creative solutions. If each one of the veritable tide of illegal migrants currently swamping British beaches was required to bring with them some plasters and a courgette, we could soon compensate for a ferry service optimistically expected to operate at 8% of the projected required capacity. By Wednesday, the biased Hard Remainiac BBC had begun looping mobile phone footage of Andrew Neil’s burning cereal hair, including shocking film of Michael Portillo rescuing the charred remnants from a filthy bin with his bare hands in order to make himself his milky treat, even as Alan Johnson tried to hold him back. The scheduling of the controversial hair inferno clip seemed designed to shunt Brexit down the newspipe and to distract from the fact that the promise of finally leaving the hated EU seemed to be slipping from the betrayed British public’s grasp. But there is so much more to be said about Brexit. We need to know the exact terms upon which, in the near future, our scorched nation will be exporting the deformed vegetables retched up from its charred soils to other ruined lands; and we need to know the exact levels of violence we are allowed to use to repel economic migrants attempting entry to the UK from soon-to-be-uninhabitable regions of France and Spain. Can a hungry Spaniard be shot or merely punched, as he makes landfall in Dover? What about a Frenchman, desperate for sparkling mineral water and the grapes that will now grow in newly temperate Scotland? Will it be acceptable, under the terms of our future trading arrangements, to force him back from the beach into the sea with a wooden club? Or to poke him with a poisoned spike? Happy about this February summer? It’s like hitting puberty at three years old and getting excited about being able to choose a bra ahead of schedule. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Now the world is burning while Britain fiddles about.

"When I see young people all over the world standing up for what they believe in, for the future of the planet and for themselves, it moves me deeply (School pupils call for radical climate action in UK-wide strike, 15 February). The empowerment of young people, particularly in regard to climate change and civic engagement, is at the heart of the YMCA’s raison d’etre. So while it’s a grave topic, the only consoling factor for me is the clear demonstration of these young people’s passion, courage and tenacity. The greatest hope for a better future lies in this kind of attitude from our youth – when they fully engage in civic issues that affect them and their communities we will start to see real change. I hope the success they have already achieved in gaining the world’s attention will motivate them to stick with these issues and work towards their goals. I feel uplifted because they are realising their power and potential to make a difference. This is how the leaders of tomorrow will be shaped, and they will do better than the leaders of today.  We can’t predict exactly how the future will look if the current lack of action continues, but we know it doesn’t look good. Of course these kids are scared. Of course they’re outraged at those in power who have allowed political self-interest and short-term objectives to blind them. So as the secretary general of the World Alliance of YMCAs, I want to officially congratulate these young people and let them know that the YMCA supports you wholeheartedly. We back your cause and applaud your initiative to take the lead where elected leaders have failed. We join you in calling on decision-makers to take real definitive action on climate change now.Carlos SanveeSecretary general of the World Alliance of YMCAs • “The 20 hottest years on record have all happened within the past 22 years; the five hottest were the last five.” These are the scariest words I have read in the Guardian for a long time, and there have been some strong contenders.

"Despite being barely two years old, the Sunrise Movement has outpaced established environmental groups in the push to radically reshape the political landscape around climate change. Closely allied with new congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youth-led Sunrise Movement has helped set out a sweepingly ambitious plan to address climate change in the form of the Green New Deal. The movement comprises a small core team of young organizers, supported by a larger group of several hundred volunteers. The group’s elevation of the Green New Deal has clearly riled Trump, who has falsely but repeatedly claimed that the plan would result in the banning of cars, air travel and even cows. The Guardian spoke to Sunrise members on how the organization has shaken the political and environmental establishment in the US. Photograph by Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian A few days after Trump won, I just felt super radicalized. I couldn’t believe that climate change was happening and people were pretending as if we weren’t on this downward spiral. So I went to school wearing a sign that said “Climate change is real.” My teacher is a huge environmental activist and she told me about Sunrise. I took the fall semester off from school to volunteer full time with them, working on the midterm elections in Orlando, Florida. We were knocking on a lot of doors, talking to people about the candidates that we endorse because they had either signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge or had climate policy. Fossil fuel money in our politics is the main obstacle to climate policy, in my opinion. There’s only so much that public opinion can do if the politicians are bought out by fossil fuel billionaires and executives. When you look at the polling of public opinion on climate change and the Green New Deal specifically, it’s clear that the public is already with us on this issue, it’s just a matter of turning passive supporters into active supporters. I feel like young people have always played the role of moral clarity and being willing to be idealists about what the world should be like. I see my generation as picking up the baton from young people in the 1960s and in the civil rights movement who engaged in similar efforts. We totally see our struggle as rooted in the past activism of young people. Photograph by Alex Welsh/The Guardian I grew up next to the ocean in the Bay Area. I was so sure I would become a marine biologist up until two years ago. Studying marine animals is my passion. But as I was walking along the beach year after year I realised the animals I was trying to study were disappearing faster than I could study them, which was really scary. I learned about climate change when I was 12, doing a report on the Canadian seal hunt, and I realized it was one of these issues that you can’t note and do nothing. Doing nothing is a death sentence to my generation I had to get political. I’m Jewish, my (extended) family was in the Holocaust. I was brought with the belief that if you become aware of something, you have a responsibility to take action. In 10 or 11 years, when climate change is irreversible, I’m going to be trying to have kids or get married … that definitely changes the way I can talk about this issue. This is literally my future and you doing nothing is a death sentence to my generation. Even with young people, there’s always this tendency to want to compromise, to want to talk to people and come to an agreement. That’s a really hard thing to step away from. What we found in Sunrise is that drawing a line in the sand is something that needs to be done sometimes. We can’t have a compromise on stopping climate change – we either stop it or don’t. You should be a little bit scared if you haven’t endorsed the Green New Deal, because young people aren’t going to vote for you. We aren’t going to be behind you, You can’t claim to be environmentalist if you don’t do this. That’s the line we’re drawing, which is really helpful. Photograph by Gabriel Scarlett/The Guardian I grew up in eastern Kentucky. There, I couldn’t escape the generational poverty caused by the fossil fuel industry. A lot of my friends’ parents were unemployed, there were no coalmining jobs. But we’ve known that the end of coal was coming for awhile. When my mom moved to eastern Kentucky 30-plus years ago, people told her that there were only 30 years left of coal in these mountains. But no one made any preparations. Instead, they just started to deny, and people sunk deeper into poverty. So by the time I was a child, these families had barely enough food to put on their table because they weren’t receiving Black Lung benefits, because they had family members who had died in the mines. I even had friends who were turning to opioids because they were so disenfranchised, discouraged and dismayed that they were going to end up like their parents. People are not climate deniers because they don’t believe in facts, people are climate deniers because they’re so afraid that they cannot confront another thing that is going to put them deeper into poverty. Climate change is something that disproportionately impacts my generation. We’re feeling the burden of it, so it makes sense that I would care the most. But I think it’s really difficult to get politicians and legislators to take our voices seriously, especially because they believe that we do not have any voting power. I think there’s a misconception that we’re advocating for something that’s unattainable, that we are throwing ourselves out there, that we’re becoming extreme, when we’re not. We are advocating for what is necessary to ensure that I have a livable future at all. Photograph by Jared Soares/The Guardian Sometimes it’s hard because people don’t take us seriously. A lot of us who are going to be most heavily impacted by climate change can’t vote. I couldn’t vote until six months ago. We want to be part of the debate which we’ve been excluded from because we don’t have the money to buy in to elect politicians who will back us. When politicians don’t listen and don’t represent us, we have the ability to say, “OK, we’re going to show up at your office.” We’re telling them to go, go, go because we don’t have time to do it any other way I was there that night when Scott Wagner called Rose Strauss “young and naive”. It was so defeating for me. The next day, it was like “Oh my God, it’s happening.” It picked up steam, and then we were so energized and excited. Not everyone’s story will go viral. But the more stories we have, it’s like a moral, emotional, value-driven path forward for our country. My official role is helping to put on a tour for the Green New Deal. We’re taking the Green New Deal to every city and town across America, first in seven or eight flagship stops in places that represent real political leadership or really devastating climate impact or economic inequality. We’re giving anyone who wants to do this the blueprint, and we’re telling them to go, go, go because we don’t have time to do it any other way. Photograph by Tony Luong/The Guardian The first thing that I saw looking out of the airplane window [when I moved to the US] was just how green Boston was. I saw all the trees, the bushes lining the sidewalks. It was a really stark contrast from Tehran. My family and I used to go hiking in the hills behind my Tehran house and once we got to the summit, we just saw this almost gray canvas covering the city. Looking up, we saw the blue sky. It made me realize that it could be different. With a little more government regulation, awareness and action, we could change the way the city looks and feels. The movement really has grown since it’s started out. Just looking back in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came out with the Green New Deal. Sunrise was able to send hundreds of people to Washington DC to support her and advocate for the Green New Deal. Senator Ed Markey has been really helpful and the Massachusetts lead on supporting the Green New Deal. Just a few days ago, Sunrise actually took to his office to thank him and his staffers for their support. The only legislator left on the lower level for Massachusetts is Representative Richard Neal. Currently, Sunrise is at his office, asking him to sign on. It really is too late to have a debate on whether or not climate change is a hoax, especially when we’re already seeing people suffering the consequences; my heart goes out to all those people that have their school torn down or their houses broken because of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. If our leaders aren’t willing to really address the crisis that we’re facing right now, then they need to be replaced. People say that young people are naive or too inexperienced but every time we get something done, we prove that we aren’t that stereotype. We may be young, but we are not naive. We understand the real-life consequences of climate change on our present and future, and we’ve decided to do something about it. • This article was amended on 4 March 2019 to correct a reference to Senator Ed Markey."

"It’s a fantastic time for verbal abuse in American politics. Donald Trump loves a schoolyard nickname, insulting everyone from “Crazy Bernie” Sanders to “Little Marco” Rubio. In turn, the president’s opponents, and sometimes his allies, have called him a moron, a motherfucker and mocked his tiny hands. But is there a way of using name-calling, not just to insult, but to introduce a new political idea. It seemed like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was doing that this week when she used the term “climate delayer” to call out those dragging their feet on climate change. Ocasio-Cortez used the term to describe Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was filmed telling a bunch of children that when it comes to the looming apocalypse, she knows better than they do, because she has spent a long time in the Senate not fixing the problem. While they called for immediate action on the Green New Deal, she argued that change wasn’t going to come anytime soon. After all, when it comes to averting a global catastrophe on an unprecedented scale, endangering hundreds of millions and fundamentally altering the human experience, you don’t want to rush into things. The clip went viral. In the ensuing days, Ocasio-Cortez warned on Instagram and Twitter of the threat of “climate delayers”: people who appear to accept that something needs to be done about climate change, but don’t seem to grasp its urgency. These people, she pointed out, aren’t much better than people who deny climate change exists. Climate delayers aren’t much better than climate deniers.With either one if they get their way, we’re toast. https://t.co/Do0WJRfG56 The term isn’t entirely new. “Global warming delayer” appeared on sites like ThinkProgress more than a decade ago; it appeared in the Guardian at least as far back as 2011. And out of context, it sounds like a badge of honor. A climate denier denies climate change, so a climate delayer … delays it? Like by buying a Prius? But that’s getting into the weeds: we should celebrate the phrase’s emergence in mainstream political debate. Trump’s political success has proven that a label can be as effective as a thousand nuanced arguments. Sure, “Delayin’ Feinstein” might not have quite the same ring as “Lyin’ Ted”, but it’s getting there. And given the scale of the issue, we badly need an arsenal of labels for people standing in the way of climate progress. Labels for people who reject the scientific evidence of climate change have a tortured history. A debate has raged as to whether “climate denier” or “climate skeptic” should be used to describe such people, the latter term aiming to soothe the egos of officials who just aren’t quite sure they can believe basically every scientist. Scientists who consider themselves genuine skeptics – in the sense of seeking “scientific inquiry, critical investigation and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims” – didn’t like the term “skeptics” for people who rejected expertise; they wanted to call them deniers, according to the Associated Press, purveyors of one of journalism’s leading style guides. But those “deniers”, understandably, didn’t like the language’s resemblance to Holocaust denial. So in 2015, the AP put forward another option, “climate doubters”, advising writers to ditch “deniers” and “skeptics” entirely. The Guardian’s own style guide takes a different view: “The OED defines a sceptic as ‘a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions’. Most so-called ‘climate change sceptics’, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny that climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so denier is a more accurate term.” On top of all that, there are “climate contrarians”, who make it their business to fight the scientific consensus – “often with substantial financial support from fossil fuels industry organizations and conservative thinktanks,” as summarized in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And yet none of these labels have managed to target a fundamental obstacle to climate change action: powerful people who profess to understand climate change, yet are curiously immobile on the issue. Perhaps the popularization of “delayer” will finally put the pressure on. When it comes to politically productive name-calling, it’s a lot snappier to dismiss someone as a “climate delayer” than to chastise them as a “person who apparently believes the science but is unwilling to acknowledge the urgency of the situation”. It’s worth noting in all this that the very phrase “climate change” is mired in labelling warfare. As anyone who has seen the movie Vice knows, the Republican pollster Frank Luntz encouraged the George W Bush administration to use the phrase “climate change” rather than “global warming”. Yale researchers recount a secret memo in which he pointed out that a focus group participant felt “climate change ‘sounds like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale’,” whereas “global warming has catastrophic connotations”. Perhaps if we’d all stuck with “global warming” – or even tried “global heating” – concern would have grown faster. Luntz knows messaging: he turned the estate tax into the “death tax” and health reform into a “government takeover” of healthcare. Fortunately in Ocasio-Cortez, it seems the left has a messaging expert of its own. And whether denier or delayer, she points out, “if they get their way, we’re toast”."

"Extreme weather events have been the “main driver” of an olive harvest collapse that could leave Italy dependent on imports from April, a leading climate scientist has warned. A 57% plunge in the country’s olive harvest – the worst in 25 years – sparked protests by thousands of Italian farmers wearing gilet arancioni – orange vests – in Rome earlier this month.  Olive trees across the Mediterranean have been hit by freak events that mirror climate change predictions – erratic rainfalls, early spring frosts, strong winds and summer droughts. Prof Riccardo Valentini, a director of the Euro-Mediterranean Center for climate change, said: “There are clear observational patterns that point to these types of weather extremes as the main drivers of [lower] food productivity.” He added: “Freezing temperatures in the Mediterranean are anomalous for us. In any direction the extremes are important and indeed, they are predicted by climate change scenarios.” Several reports by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) “all point to these climatic extremes as one of the major impacts of climate change”, he said. “We know there will be more extremes and anomalies in the future.” Valentini said that sudden extremes in any direction – warming or cooling, freezing or drying – can harm plant development. “Three or four days of 40C temperatures in summer, or 10 days without rain in spring – even two days of freezing temperatures in spring – are more important than the average for the year,” he said. Average temperatures in the Mediterranean have already risen by 1.4C above pre-industrial levels – compared with a global average of about 1C – and precipitation has fallen by 2.5%. In the past 18 months, Italy has experienced summer droughts, autumn floods and spring ice waves. Olive trees are weakened by these kinds of weather shocks and, even if they recover, are left more vulnerable to outbreaks of the xylella fastidiosa bacterium and olive fly infestations, which have hit farmers in Italy and Greece, Valentini said. Italy’s Coldiretti farmers’ union estimates that the cost of the olive oil collapse this year has already reached €1bn. “The government promised a solution but it has not given any more resources for the olive farmers,” a Coldiretti spokesman said, adding there was “no plan for [addressing] climate change and olive oil production either.” He said: “We have had demonstrations in front of parliament already and we are waiting for government action.” The spokesman added that if it did not materialise, “there could be more protests”. Beyond Italy, the European commission has projected 2018-19 olive harvests to drop by 20% in Portugal and 42% in Greece, although industry sources said final figures there could be significantly worse. Greek farmers were devastated by extreme drought and then heavy rains, which acted as a “trigger event” for olive fly infestations, according to Valentini. Vasilis Pyrgiotis, the chair of the Copa Cogeca farming union’s olives working group, said: “the big issue is not necessarily the quantity but the quality. Most Greek olive oil is considered ‘extra virgin’ but it is not certain, as time goes by, that this will continue.” Olive oil has to meet organoleptic criteria (such as acidity levels) before it can be classed as extra virgin, and these are affected by growing conditions. “The problem this year was because of fly attacks but also the gloeosporium olivarum fungus,” Pyrgiotis said. “This year’s olives are not as good as they used to be. In the longer term, we face the possibility that they may not be considered as extra virgin oil because of analysis issues.” Olive trees follow a pattern known as alternate bearing, with bad years routinely followed by good. This year, the EU expects Europe’s overall olive basket to be saved by a surge from its biggest producer, Spain. A trend there towards super intensive plantations may partly mitigate climate change impacts, according to Valentini – but at a cost to traditional farming and biodiversity. Fast-growing, high-density olive plantations might be more drought-resistant but water resources could also be limited by these plantations, he said. “It will change the rural landscape from older growth olive trees to more intensive plantations,” he added. “People in the south of Italy are beginning to move in that direction. I don’t like it but I understand it is an adaptation.” A Met Office spokesman said that in future, the combined effect of pests, disease and climate change on global agriculture could be “potentially devastating”."
