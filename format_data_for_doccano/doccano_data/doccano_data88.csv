"He declined to drink urine but Barack Obama did make tea from glacier water and munch on a bloody salmon previously chewed by a bear in his wilderness bromance with Bear Grylls. The US president trekked through a remote part of Alaska to promote action on climate change – and show a more human side – in a special episode of the British adventurer’s reality show, Running Wild With Bear Grylls.  The hour-long programme, which aired on NBC on Thursday, showed the duo bonding as they hiked on Exit glacier in the Kenai mountains, bantering over fatherhood and the environment – as well as flatulence and bellybutton fluff. “I’m skinny but tougher than I look,” said Obama, after the former soldier complimented his physical fitness. It was a moment to make Sarah Palin howl. The president drank tea made from catkins and melting glacier water and munched on a ravaged salmon, which Grylls said had been discarded by a bear and still bore “bear breath”. Grylls has persuaded previous celebrity guests to drink their own urine but the commander in chief demurred. “I suppose, in extremis, it’s something that I would do – if the alternative was death,” he said. “It’s not something I’d make a habit of. And I probably wouldn’t do it just for a TV show.” It was the White House’s idea to pair the professorial president with a rugged survivalist as part of a strategy of unorthodox methods and stunts to project his agenda. It was an Obama seldom seen on television: loose, personal, stripped of pomp, just a guy out hiking with another guy. Of course, it was also an illusion. According to Grylls’ dozens of staff, secret service agents and a food taster hovered just off-screen, along with snipers in the hills and a military helicopter overhead. Perhaps to offset any comparisons with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s swaggering wilderness photo-ops, Obama made several references to the invisible chaperones, including when he fumbled using a borrowed smartphone to take a selfie with Grylls. “I’m in what’s called the bubble and secret service makes sure that I’m always out of danger, which I very much appreciate but it can be a little confining,” he said, addressing the camera directly. “So to be with Bear in the woods: it doesn’t get any better than that.” Both men cited the retreating glacier as evidence of the urgency in addressing climate change. “I’ve two daughters, and I don’t want grandkids too soon, but eventually I hope to have some,” said Obama. “And I want to make sure that this is there for them, not just us.” He said action on climate change was vital to his presidency. “I think it will have a more significant impact on the lives of future generations as just about anything. And we’re still a long way from getting it right but it’s something that, working together, I think we can make a difference on.” The show aired at a delicate time for the president, who is riding high on the climate deal agreed in Paris last week but defensive over Republican claims that he is weak on Islamist terrorism. On Friday he is due to visit the relatives of victims of this month’s San Bernardino massacre. Obama played the straight man, noting Grylls’s reputation for extreme cuisine. “Bear’s a mediocre cook, but the fact that we ate something recognisable was encouraging. Now, the fact that he told me this was a leftover fish from a bear, I don’t know if that was necessary. He could have just left that out.” The Briton commended the president on nimbly starting a fire, obviating need to use bellybutton fluff as kindling. He also recommended the catkins tea as a remedy for flatulence. “It’s not a problem I have but maybe you do,” Obama replied. When Grylls warned that bears were especially dangerous when you surprised them “fornicating”, Obama joked that the same could be said for humans. Clearly smitten, Grylls, an evangelical Christian, ended their outing with a riverside prayer calling on God to bless the president’s work. They hugged and went their separate ways. “He said it was one of the best days of his presidency,” Grylls told reporters earlier this week, according to Reuters. “There were times along the route I had to pinch myself and think, ‘actually, this is the president of America’.”"

"“There are always lessons to be learned and I will make sure they are learned,” said David Cameron after severe flooding affected thousands of people across the country. But that was in February 2014, when the prime minister was visiting the submerged Somerset Levels. No systematic review of flood protection ever happened. On Sunday, as terrible floods hit Yorkshire and Lancashire, Cameron said: “Whenever these things happen, you should look at what you spend, what you’ve built … clearly we should look again at whether there’s more we can do.” The people living in the 5m properties that are at risk of flooding can only hope he means it this time. For the thousands currently condemned to months away from their ruined homes it is a case of closing the floodgates after the rivers have overflowed. Cameron cannot say he was not warned: he has ignored red flag after red flag, right from the start of his premiership. In the first year of the coalition, he cut capital spending on flood defences by 27% year-on-year. That was despite the 2008 Pitt Review – a systematic analysis of major floods in 2007 – concluding that much more funding was needed. Funding had risen quickly under the Labour government, only to be slashed by Cameron. The prime minister himself had expressed the risks. “Most people accept that, with climate change, [floods] are likely to be more frequent,” he told parliament in May 2008, following flooding in his Oxfordshire constituency. Flood defence spending never recovered to the level inherited from Labour during the whole coalition parliament, if you exclude – as the National Audit Office deems appropriate – the emergency funding delivered after flooding 2013-14. In January 2012, the government’s own research showed increased flooding is the greatest threat posed by climate change in England. But when heavy flooding hit in the summer of 2012, the Guardian revealed that almost 300 proposed flood defences had not gone ahead as planned following the cuts. A £58m scheme in Leeds – one of the cities hit in the latest round of flooding – was one affected project, which would have saved many times its cost in avoided damages. Richard Lewis, a city councillor, said at the time: “The cuts are the economics of the madhouse.” Adapting to climate change, principally flooding, is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. But in May 2013, the environment secretary at the time, Owen Paterson, cut the number of officials working on the national adaptation programme from 38 to six. Global warming means more extreme weather, with records increasingly likely to be broken, and the wettest winter for 250 years in 2013-14 caused huge floods across the country. The Guardian revealed at that time that flood-stricken communities, including those visited by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, had been left without planned defences following funding cuts. Other undelivered defences include schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Thames Valley also saw flooding, in a region where planned defences had been delayed and downsized. In the midst of these floods, as Cameron promised the review that never happened, the government’s own climate change advisers told ministers there was a £500m hole in their flood defence plans, even to just to keep pace with the rising risk driven by climate change. The shortfall would result in £3bn of damages, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warned. The Met Office then warned in March 2014 that extreme rainfall was becoming more common in the UK. In November 2014, another red flag was raised, in the form of a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO). It found the risk of flooding was indeed rising as a result of government funding cuts. Furthermore, half the nation’s flood defences had been left with “minimal” maintenance, according to the spending watchdog. The NAO also contradicted Cameron’s claim that his government was spending more than ever on flood defences. Funding had fallen by 10% in real terms, said the NAO, when the £270m of one-off emergency funding after the 2013-14 floods was excluded. The NAO noted that this bailout was poor substitute for sustained spending: “Ad hoc emergency spending is less good value than sustained maintenance.” Later in November came the news that local authority flood defence funding would be cut by a third in 2015. “This is dire,” said Paul Cobbing, the chief executive of the National Flood Forum, which represents community flood action groups. “Lead Local Flood Authorities are at the heart of flood risk management. They are already under-resourced and this puts flood risk management backwards at the very point when a step change forwards is needed.” In June 2015, the CCC recommended that the government should “develop a strategy to address the increasing number of homes in areas of high flood risk”. But in October the government replied: “We believe that a strategy to address future residual risk would not be appropriate at this time.” “The CCC made a very clear recommendation in its statutory advice, but the government rejected it,” Daniel Johns, the CCC’s head of adaptation, said on 9 December. Then came the flooding in Cumbria, where the Guardian revealed that a £4m flood defence scheme for the town of Kendal, which was submerged in up to 5ft of water by Storm Desmond, was repeatedly postponed. Scientists estimated that these floods were made 40% more likely by climate change. The current floods in Yorkshire and Lancashire, with the Army mobilised and the emergency Cobra committee assembling, is the most recent red flag. But it too will sink from view under the rising tide of the UK’s increasing flood risk unless Cameron’s new review delivers a comprehensive and fully funded strategy to combat the UK’s most serious threat from global warming."
"1 If temperatures can be held to a rise of 1.5C, catastrophe may be averted  There is now a glimmer of hope for developing countries that climate change will be addressed and that a fossil-free world is achievable. Short- and long-term targets to decarbonise are now enshrined in law, countries have made individual commitments, there is more awareness of the problem, and governments have all agreed to act. Over time, countries have agreed to “peak” their emissions in return for better access to technology. Low-lying islands, delta regions and coastal cities remain highly vulnerable to sea level rises and surges, but if temperatures can be held to a rise of 1.5C, mass migration and catastrophe may be averted for hundreds of millions of people. 2 Targets are set, and governments can be held to account Nearly all developing countries have put forward their “intended nationally determined contributions” – to show what they plan to do over the next 20 years to reduce their emissions. These range from planting tens of millions of trees and developing solar power, to reducing emissions from coal and cutting subsidies for fossil fuels. Many countries, like Morocco and Ethiopia, are highly ambitious. Most are dependent on money being made available from carbon financing via the Green Climate Fund. Importantly, all the plans are public, which allows civil society to hold governments to account more easily and to press for cleaner development. The climate justice movement is now global and the meeting could mark a turning point for the balance of power.  3 Air pollution and the importance of preserving forests are now under the spotlight The Paris talks put climate change and health firmly on the global agenda, with the WHO and other bodies recognising that polluted indoor and outdoor air is now the greatest environmental killer in developing countries and that climate change threatens to add millions of deaths a year from increased rates of disease if it is not addressed. This recognition may help direct aid flows and national priorities. Tropical countries should also benefit financially from protecting their forests. This includes payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) and incentives to replant. 4 Much greater investment in renewable technology is promised All the big development banks, including the World Bank, and the Africa and Asia development banks, have embraced the deal and pledged to greatly increase lending for low-carbon projects over the next 20 years. Far more money should now go into solar, wind and other renewable technologies and research, and less will go into fossil fuel developments and possibly mining. A welter of low-carbon schemes were announced at the meeting, including one that could result in Africa becoming powered primarily by renewables.  5 Vulnerable countries will get $100bn a year to help adapt to climate change From 2020, developed countries, with help from some richer developing countries like China and Singapore, will make available $100bn of “new and additional” money a year for vulnerable countries to help them adapt to climate change. This is nowhere near enough, but the figure will be regularly scaled up. Much of it will come via the Green Climate Fund, which is half-controlled by developing countries. 1 Countries will wriggle out of their commitments Although the Paris agreement is, overall, legally binding, much of the detail is not. Countries will not be forced to do more than they want, nor will there be any redress if they do not achieve their targets. The 70-year history of multilateral UN agreements suggests that countries will avoid their commitments if they can.  2 The agreement buys us time, but will it be enough? Countries have not pledged to cut anywhere near enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change and we are still heading for a 3C warmer world in which developing countries are hit the hardest, first. The Paris agreement possibly buys time, but to hold temperatures to a 1.5C rise will require a transformation in the way that rich countries consume and generate power. To have any hope of this, countries will have to rapidly cut emissions to practically zero by the second half of the century, and the agreement does not force anyone to do more than they feel able to do.  3 Most agreements benefit big business over small landholders  The world’s most vulnerable people may be in more danger than before of being kicked off their land and having their human rights infringed because most agreements favour big corporations rather than small landholders and farmers. The “green economy” proposed by the agreement makes the trading of carbon central to protection and farming, a development that is widely rejected by peasant, smallholder and indigenous peoples’ movements worldwide. Any money generated from carbon markets is also unlikely to reach the poorest people because it will go through governments, which have different priorities. 4 Climate change assistance may be funded by diverting aid Although $100bn a year has been pledged for developing countries, this does not start till 2020, and is inadequate. It will be progressively scaled up but this is nowhere near what will be needed in a warmer world where weather-related disasters are expected to intensify and millions of people may be forced to permanently move because of sea level rises, disruptions to farming and intolerable heatwaves. There is also a real danger that “climate” money will be diverted from existing overseas development assistance, or other aid flows, and could be double-counted. No agreement has been reached on what constitutes “climate money” , how it should be counted, when or to whom it should be delivered, or to what it should be directed.  5 There is no legal responsibility for rich countries to help poorer ones with adapting to climate change The Paris agreement actually weakens the existing responsibility of rich countries to provide finance to poorer countries to help them adapt. Although the Kyoto agreement made it a legal responsibility for rich countries to help poor nations, that responsibility is now voluntary and shared between all countries. Moreover, the money to be made available is not guaranteed from the public purse. Instead, finance will come largely from unpredictable “market mechanisms” such as carbon offsets, with relatively little expected to derive from guaranteed public funds."
"2016 is set to be the warmest year ever recorded, according to a forecast issued by the UK Met Office on Thursday. Climate change and the peaking of the El Niño weather phenomenon are expected to drive the global average temperature next year above the record now certain to be set for 2015, which itself beat a new record set in 2014. The forecast comes just five days after 195 nations agreed a historic deal to fight global warming at a UN summit in Paris by keeping the world’s temperature rise under 2C, with an ambition to restrict the rise to 1.5C. The Met Office forecast indicates the global average temperature in 2016 will be 1.14C above pre-industrial temperatures, showing how challenging it will be to meet the 1.5C goal. The Met Office said there was just a 5% chance the global average temperature in 2016 would be below that in 2015. “The vast majority of the warming is global warming, but the icing on the cake is the big El Niño event,” said Prof Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal prediction at the Met Office. El Niño is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. The current episode is the biggest since 1998 and is peaking now, but the global temperature effects take time to spread around the globe. “We expect the peak warming from El Niño in the 2016 figures,” said Scaife. Rising temperatures driven by global warming combined with natural variability leads to a greater chance of extreme weather events, he said: “When variability adds to the underlying warming, it can give impacts that have never been seen before.”  Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years. The recent floods in the northwest of England are estimated to have been made 40% more likely by climate change. Despite rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, global warming had not paused at all. Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans. Now, according to the Met Office, all the signs are that the period of slower rises in air temperatures is over and the rate of global warming will accelerate fast in coming years. 2014 was the first year the world passed 1C of warming above pre-industrial levels. The temperature trend caused by climate change will continue to be upwards unless carbon emissions begin to fall. However, the Met Office does not expect the run of back-to-back records from 2014-16 to continue indefinitely, as El Niño is expected to wane during 2016.  “But the current situation shows how global warming can combine with smaller, natural fluctuations to push our climate to levels of warmth which are unprecedented in the data records,” said a Met Office statement. “This is yet more evidence that the world is warming fast. We’ll see far more savage storms and floods in places like Cumbria and Chennai if governments do not act to cut carbon pollution,” said Simon Bullock at Friends of the Earth. “The Paris agreement was crystal-clear that urgent measures are needed now, yet David Cameron’s government has reacted by stamping on the solar industry, while championing fracking. This morally bankrupt response is the exact opposite of what is needed.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “Global mean surface temperature continues to rise. This means governments must act strongly and urgently to cut emissions of greenhouse gases if there is to be any chance of keeping future warming to well below 2C, as laid out in the Paris agreement.” He added: “This projection is another fatal blow to claims by climate change ‘sceptics’ that global warming has stopped or stalled.” The Met Office forecast for 2016 predicts a global average temperature of 1.14C above pre-industrial levels, with a 95% likelihood of being between 1.02C and 1.26C. 2015 is expected to be about 1C warmer."

"America has demonstrated a new level of maturity about tackling climate change. Winston Churchill famously said: “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.” Churchill could have been speaking about the progress of negotiating global climate policy – not just the American role but the entire two-decades-long process.  The United States committed its A-team to the just-concluded climate negotiations in Paris. The secretary of state, John Kerry, who deeply understands this challenge, stayed in Paris, rounding up support and ironing out differences. President Obama remained engaged behind the scenes, calling world leaders when necessary. Their presence underscored that addressing climate change is key to our future as human beings. Symbols are important when countries come together to tackle big problems and this was a big one. Asked about spending time on climate negotiations in view of the crises in Syria, the Islamic State and other international pressures, Secretary Kerry drew parallels with the Iran talks: “If you’re not present, bad things can happen. If you’re not there, there can be a sudden shift in the negotiations and you can lose everything if you’re not ready to head it off at the pass.” But it wasn’t just the high-level involvement that helped secure a breakthrough in Paris – it was also a commitment to pragmatism. The agreement hinges on a practical approach to climate change that is far more achievable than agreements past, after a long period of chasing untested economic theories and silver bullets – like the fantasy that emissions trading could be extended across the globe to ferret out the most attractive emission reductions. The core of the agreement is a series of country-by-country commitments; messy commitments, to be sure, in which each country determines its own approach. This is how real progress is made in such monumental tasks, as it was when the countries of the world set out to reduce the threat from weapons of mass destruction. The agreement referenced the need to “build [mutual] trust and confidence” in the context of implementation. This language denotes a realistic appreciation of the difficulty of the challenge ahead and the reality of building a coalition of countries confident that each is adhering to its commitments and committed to the jointly envisioned future. Of course, some parts of this deal are less sturdy. Even with the commitments made in Paris, keeping global warming to no more than 2 degrees celsius above preindustrial levels, will be extraordinarily difficult, in view of the momentum in the system and the reality of committed infrastructure. Whole economies do not turn on a dime when the issue at stake is as fundamental as energy consumption.  Even more important, the 2C target is nothing more than a highly disputed guess about how far human activity can push a complex system before that system reaches irreversible tipping points and points of no return. As David Victor said, our options are more limited “because we have dawdled on climate policy for 25 years”.   Whether or not the agreement incorporates an aspirational rather than a realistic number in seeking to keep warming to no more than 2C, we can still use that number to frame our actions and spur us forward.  This is equally true for those countries, including the United States, which are most responsible for the emissions joyride initiated in the industrial revolution, as for all countries who have put their commitments on the table in Paris. Changing how energy is generated and used is not a matter of flipping a switch. It requires concerted, sustained effort at many levels of human endeavor. The only outcome must be forward progress. Paris is the launching pad. Pragmatism is the only way ahead. This newfound maturity is only a first step in a hugely difficult task, but it is a crucial condition for any progress to be made."
"Congratulations on a notably hard-hitting editorial (28 December). I can only fault it on one point – your contention that Leeds and Manchester carry more weight in Westminster than do Somerset or Cumbria. Not with the Conservatives, they don’t.

"The laws politicians tell us are there to protect our environment can seem as pointless as the cheap Christmas giftwrap covering that bottle of wine you just bought for your least favourite uncle. “Surprise surprise, Uncle Douchebag. It’s a bottle of $4.99 shiraz.” Surprise. It’s still another coalmine. Australia’s environment minister, Greg Hunt, has just approved a major expansion to the country’s Abbot Point coal terminal in Queensland. The terminal’s expansion, proposed by Indian mining company Adani, is a crucial part of the coal industry’s plans for the Galilee Basin – one of the world’s biggest untapped sources of fossil fuel carbon. Even though the approval comes with a string of important and welcome conditions, Australia’s suite of environmental laws continue to ignore probably the world’s greatest environmental threat – climate change caused chiefly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal. When more than 190 countries agreed in Paris earlier this month to keep global warming “well below 2C”, Hunt himself said this was “arguably the most important environmental agreement ever”. Adani wants to develop the Carmichael mine – Australia’s biggest coalmine – in the Galilee Basin.  The 60m tonnes of coal a year from Carmichael will take a route through Abbot Point, weaving and winking its way through the Great Barrier Reef and on to India. Australian government scientists have made it clear that climate change is the greatest threat to the reef’s health and survival. As I detailed in a recent report, the fossil fuel industry as a whole, and Adani in particular, has managed to engineer the kind of access to senior ministers, politicians and civil servants which other groups – such as the renewable energy industry, for example – could only dream of. Rarely does an Australian politician set foot in India without meeting the company’s head, Gautam Adani, who in recent years has hosted private dinners, parties and rides in jets for his high-level Australian friends.  Last week, Adani had little trouble in securing a personal meeting with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Consider too that in Australia and many other jurisdictions, so-called “environmental impact assessments” that form the backbone of applications for major projects are still paid for by the companies seeking approval. Adani and Australian politicians have continued to claim the Carmichael mine will create “10,000 jobs” despite the company itself admitting in court that just 1,464 net jobs would result from the project. Australian government ministers have also gleefully picked up the coal industry’s public relations talking point that coal is an answer to lifting the world’s poorest out of poverty. Some, such as the Australian newspaper’s cartoonist Bill Leak, have even gone as far as to say that “distributing solar panels to the world’s poor” is “racist”, “condescending” and “immoral”. Leak was defending himself against accusations that a cartoon he’d drawn depicting Indian people eating solar panels was racist (this is the bit where we point out that the presumably racist Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, has a goal to have some 100 GW of solar power installed in his country by 2022 and by 2030, to have 40% of his country’s power coming from anything but fossil fuels). Hunt’s approval of Abbot Point comes just days after Queensland’s land court rejected a challenge to the Carmichael mine that was lodged on the basis that the emissions from the burning of the coal would further fuel dangerous climate change. But the court accepted the argument from Adani that the mine’s creation would not impact on levels of global emissions because if Australia didn’t develop the coal, then someone else would. This is known as the “drug dealers defence” when a pusher pleads with a police officer that in supplying their illicit substance, they were merely fulfilling the demand created by the addict. This argument is thin, particularly if you extend the drug dealing analogy. Police do not generally target drug addicts, but rather see the main game as busting the drug producers. All decisions made about fossil fuel projects around the world are now made in a new political world shaped by the Paris agreement. There, almost 150 leaders from countries around the world pledged to do what they could to cut greenhouse gas emissions and help the world’s poorest to fight the impacts of climate change. As Hunt said, the deal was “arguably the most important environmental agreement ever.” Arguably, then, Australia’s environmental laws and approvals processes need a rapid reboot to include the “most important” environmental issue there is.  Or in other words, the environment and the climate don’t want coalmines for Christmas and needs better protection than cheap wrapping paper. "
"Is the season upon us? Is it Christmas almost? I hear Christmas music, and so many nice letters have come to me here at the North Pole requesting fine gifts.  But something’s not right this year: it’s too warm to be Christmas.  It feels no later than middle October – why, I may have to wear a T-shirt and shorts on my sleigh ride this year. I don’t know why ’tis. I don’t watch TV news – it’s not very cheerful – nor do I bother with the day-to-day affairs of the people of Earth aside from my naughty and nice lists and Christmas Eve visits. However, that may have to change.  All mirth aside, my bustling toy workshop has started to sink just a bit on the south-eastern corner: the solid foundation – rock ice, through and through – feels a bit slushy now, if you stick your boot in it. If things go on this way, the whole North Pole – the workshop, my castle, the reindeer and stables – could be swallowed up whole by the deep Arctic Ocean. This won’t do for Christmas. My sleigh is not sea-worthy, and reindeer can’t swim. But it gets even worse if our home turns to water: my elves could get snatched up as polar bear snacks. I’ve never eaten an elf, of course, but, as I understand it, they are quite the nice treat if you’re a big, hungry bear. You see, polar bears (our good North Pole friends for many a year) are just not themselves. Their sea ice is melting; they don’t have enough food. And my elves cannot run very fast – most certainly not like a polar bear can. Polar bears are quite friendly when they have enough seals to eat. On Christmases past, the biggest white bear would join our great party and, being the tallest, would put the star high up on our Christmas tree’s peak.  I’m perplexed why this warm change is happening now. Maybe people are steaming up so much hot chocolate that it’s causing Earth temperatures to rise out of season? Or – this is better – maybe bright Christmas cheer and a heartwarming spirit of giving is welling up big among all the world’s children?  Oh, that must be the reason; what a wonderful thing! You can’t stop the roaring spirit of people, I say. I’ve got proof of my theory right here in my bag: mail from children all over the globe. Tyler wants a Lego set. Ella wants Wii. Sophie says: “Santa, I have one wish for Christmas, that the Agreement in Paris become law ’round the world, so that me and my friends have a future at least.” Ho ho ho! Today’s kids. Such big wishes and dreams. I’ll see if my elves can build her a doll, or a pony that rocks and is painted bright pink. That’s all I can do, and I do what I can. And here is what I wish for you all on this strange and unusual warm Christmastime: that you do what you can. Dream big like your children, and wish big like them too. Then, if all of you act on those big dreams and big wishes, maybe the sea ice won’t melt quite as fast. As for me, I suppose I must get with the times, buy a TV that plays news on the hour, and get a new coat that’s more suited for autumn than the cold winters past."
"The agreement reached at the COP21 Paris climate change talks is certainly a great improvement on anything that has gone before (One paragraph at a time: how the deal was done to save the planet, 14 December). Whether it is enough to save the planet (to be more precise, save the human race from catastrophe; the planet will look after itself) is questionable. Apart from the question of actual implementation of even the agreed measures (themselves expected to achieve only a 2.7C limit) there are many factors not taken into account. Barack Obama says the deal will create “more jobs and economic growth”. But growth, even “green growth”, is precisely the problem. We live on a finite planet with finite resources which we are already exploiting to the limit and beyond. The aim must be to achieve a steady-state economy, with resources fairly shared, but that is incompatible with capitalism’s growth imperative. A glaring omission is the effect of the many armed conflicts currently ongoing, The money allocated to tackling climate change is still dwarfed by that devoted to the means of death and destruction, currently $1.75tn annually. These conflicts themselves contribute to climate change: the US military is the biggest single corporate user of fossil fuels, a large proportion by high-flying jets, where the warming effect is variously estimated as from 1.7 to 4.0 times that at ground level. They inhibit attempts to deal with people’s real problems, the effects of global warming among many others. Mass migration, from a variety of causes including conflict and climate change, is another major problem that is ignored in the Paris agreement. There is still a very long way to go to ensure the future of the human race.Frank JacksonFormer co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign  • The Paris accord has been hailed as a diplomatic triumph because the alternative is too awful to contemplate. Nevertheless the atmosphere does not respond to political craft and strategic compromise, it only responds to the laws of physics which are uncompromising and potentially lethal for most species on Earth, including our own. All of the really tough decisions – such as carbon taxes, country-specific limits and financial penalties – have been shelved, which will allow countries such as India, China and even the UK to carry on burning fossil fuels while paying lip-service to the need to reduce emissions. Instead the goal of 1.5C and even 2C will now rely on unproven and currently non-existent technologies such as nuclear fusion, carbon capture with storage or carbon negative technologies. I pray these will come in time but how many people would get on a flight in the hope that someone can defuse the bomb before it blows up?Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • While the agreement on tackling climate change is welcome, the big test, and the most challenging, will be the implementation. There are substantial business opportunities here, with countries supporting research and development into alternative energy and energy saving being the winners. In order to develop this commercial opportunity and contribute to global emission reduction the UK government needs to reverse some of the decisions taken since it came to power. These include: divesting from renewables: privatising the Green Investment Bank; performing a monumental U-turn on the UK’s £1bn carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition; reducing subsidies for improving energy efficiency; reducing the requirement for developers to build energy-efficient homes; making fracking easy to achieve and windfarms difficult; and continuing to subsidise fossil fuels. The UK could be taking a lead, and developing a substantial commercial advantage, instead of backtracking on everything the coalition achieved. David BecketNewcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire • The Paris climate talks followed a pattern that is familiar in international environmental negotiations. At the start of the conference tough commitments and ambitious targets were proposed, including on forest conservation and the transfer of environmentally clean technology to developing countries. Over the next two weeks many of these were weakened with caveats and, in some cases, quietly abandoned as delegates edged towards a politically acceptable compromise. This is the so-called convoy principle: everyone stays together, but all move at the speed of the slowest. Most disappointing of all is the failure to agree legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments. Without this, the pledge to limit the global temperature rise to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels remains purely aspirational.David HumphreysReader in environmental policy, Open University • The key phrase in Bill McKibben’s piece (Climate deal: the pistol has fired, so why aren’t we running?, 14 December) is “You have to raise the price of carbon steeply and quickly”, or else the necessary switch to renewable energy will not happen. In other words, people have to vote for much higher petrol prices, much higher gas and electricity bills and far more expensive air travel. Or, which would be equally unpopular, we could ration these goods. Clearly, neither of these things are going to happen, so can we please stop fooling ourselves that the human race is capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by enough to prevent runaway climate change. Therefore, we need to urgently start investing in other approaches, such as geoengineering, carbon scrubbing and reforestation. Otherwise, we do face disaster.Richard MountfordHildenborough, Kent • Mitchell Anderson argues that cheap oil is the key to beating climate change (Opinion, theguardian.com, 11 December), but his logic is flawed. In a free market the cheaper fossil fuels are burned first, then more expensive ones. This process does not end until the rising fossil-fuel price crosses the falling renewables price. The total amount of CO2 (and methane) cumulatively emitted depends on this crossover point; a lower oil price pushes it further into the future, increasing total emissions. The most efficient way to bring forward the crossover, at the same time creating robust, distributed economic value, is a revenue-neutral carbon tax.Professor Nick CowernOswaldkirk, North Yorkshire • We congratulate the leaders of our world on agreeing to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C or, hopefully, 1.5C – a clear signal to transform our global economy to decrease emissions. We in the agricultural/scientific sectors have a key role in meeting this transformation by finding sustainable solutions to feeding the ever growing population, particularly in the dry tropics of Asia and Africa. For example, new drought-tolerant varieties of chickpea planted by Ethiopian farmers will lift 0.7 million people out of poverty and have a positive environmental impact. In addition to climate change, these two continents are already facing the additional, but associated, problems of gender inequality, poverty, political instability etc. We need to redouble our efforts to leverage demand-driven innovation, partnerships and policies that ensure the poor can adapt to climate variability. The hard work starts now.Dr David Bergvinson, Professor Chandra Madramootoo and Dr Nigel PooleInternational Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (Icrisat) • Last week it was announced in the journal Nature Climate Change that world carbon emissions fell by 0.6%. This fall was attributed to the decline in Chinese manufacturing. The world’s politicians pontificate about how to tackle the causes and remedy this problem which is blamed on the industrialised nations. But surely the answer is obvious: let’s buy fewer Chinese goods. Apart from continuing this downward trend in emission reductions it would make China a much healthier place to live and it would also boost our manufacturing, jobs and economy immeasurably. Simple. These goods may cost a bit more, but compared with the 10% extra we have added to our fuel bills and are forced to pay to meet EU emission targets plus the reduction in benefit payments as our unemployed obtain jobs, this could be a win-win policy. However, there is a problem called the EU, which would do everything in its power to prevent this.Gary FedtschyschakClayton, Staffordshire • What power, what kinetic energy we have seen in the rivers of Cumbria these last weeks!

"The prime minister is right. He concluded his speech at the start of the Paris climate change summit by saying: “Instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.” Friends of the Earth could not agree more. So why is it that almost everything Cameron’s government has done on climate and energy since being elected in May has moved us in the wrong direction, towards pitiful excuse-making when we come to look our children in the eye, let alone our grandchildren?  The Paris agreement falls far short of the soaring rhetoric from world leaders less than two weeks ago. An ambition to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C is a positive step forwards, but there is no real plan to make this a reality. As it stands, the agreement leaves millions of people across the world under threat from climate-related floods, droughts and super-storms. If you judge Paris by what’s required by science, or justice, it’s hard not to find it wanting. But this is still a historic moment. For 195 countries to agree on anything is remarkable. For them to agree to profoundly transform their economies in just a few decades is astonishing. This summit clearly shows that fossil fuels have had their day and that the future is clean energy. If you judge Paris by politics, it looks a lot better because in Paris the politics changed. Enough has now been done by enough people in enough places to demonstrate that a climate safe and climate just world is possible. And the staggering fall in the cost of renewables provided much-needed confidence to many negotiating teams, whether from fossil fuel-dependent rich nations, or poorer countries in which local pollution is becoming politically unsustainable. What matters now is not so much the detail of the text but the spirit of determination with which we carry this momentum forward. And make no mistake, all eyes will be on the UK in the days, weeks and years ahead. Britain gave birth to the fossil fuel era; we are a nation of inventors; we have a finance sector that knows how to make things affordable; and we have some of the best renewable resources in the world. We were also the first country in the world to introduce legislation to tackle climate change, something that has since been copied in 99 countries and, surely, will now be copied in many more. That’s why it is so tragic that the UK has lost much of its reputation for climate leadership over the past seven months, as George Osborne has ordered the dismantling of climate and energy policies developed over many years and with cross-party consensus. In the run-up to Paris, newspapers around the world ran stories asking why the UK seems to be moving backwards on climate change. And just a few days ago at the Paris talks, a negotiator from another EU member state said to me: “We cannot believe what’s happening in Britain. We now see David Cameron as greenwasher- in-chief.” Everyone knows Osborne’s behind the moves to take us back to the fossil-fuelled 1970s, but it’s David Cameron who’s the apologist. So what must Cameron do? First, he must write to the European commission president and all his EU counterparts and ask them to make good on their promises of moving to a higher level of European emission cuts if an agreement was reached. It has been. Move it on up, prime minister. Second, he must write to the committee on climate change – his government’s advisers on climate action – and ask them to design all future budgets around the 1.5C target. Failure to do so would be a travesty of the spirit of Paris. Third, the terrible damage that his government has done to the climate economy in the UK must be repaired. As soon as this week, his energy and climate change secretary is going to decide the future of UK solar power. Current government plans would see the industry brought to its knees. They must think again. Beyond that, George Osborne must end his ideological love affair with fracking; scaling up of shale gas in the mid-2020s is completely incompatible with Paris. And as for new runways; forget it. No ifs, no buts, as someone once said. It is not too late. But starting with its decision on support for solar power, nothing less than a 180-degree turnaround is needed to get the UK’s approach to tackling climate change back on track. Putting the grand rhetoric of the past two weeks into practice – and looking our children in the eye – starts now. From now on every decision has to be the right one."
"December is set to be Britain’s mildest since records began in 1910, according to the Met Office. And not just a bit warmer – the December average for England has been 9.5C, which is more than 5C above the long-term average, and 2C higher than the previous record, in 1934. Wales and Northern Ireland are also likely to set new records while Scotland may fall just short. For some parts of the UK – Cumbria, Lancashire and Wales – it will have been the rainiest December on record, but people who live there do not need to be told that. The two sets of statistics are connected, if only because the capacity of the air to hold moisture rises with each degree of temperature.  It follows that in a warmer world, there is more rainfall. Whether and when it falls is a matter of climate, topography and atmospheric caprice. Some parts of Britain have experienced rainfall levels much lower than the average for December. Some got much more than they bargained for. Government hydrologists once calculated that on average 280tn litres of rain falls on Britain each year. That works out at 1m gallons, or a couple of Olympic-sized swimming pools per person, on average. The problem in parts of northern England has been the sheer accumulation of water. If the rain falls on soil that is already soaked, then it will run across the surface, downhill and towards the rivers. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day, 210.6mm (more than 8in) of rain fell on Capel Curig in Gwynedd, north Wales. Shap in Cumbria, north-west England, recorded only 86.4mm (3.4in) in the same 48 hours, but during the whole of December, 773mm had fallen on Shap: more than 30in, and at least three times the long-term average for the month. Just an inch of rain on one square mile of soil or hillside adds up to 15m gallons of water. Multiply that threefold, or eightfold, tip it onto soil that is already saturated and can hold no more, or spill it onto sealed roads and paved gardens, and some of that water is likely to start flowing past your front door, and then into the house. It has always happened, but the message of the latest UN disaster statistics is that it is happening more often, and causing more damage. Between 2005 and 2014, UN statisticians counted an average of 335 weather-related disasters per year around the world. This was a 14% increase on the period from 1995 to 2004, and very nearly twice the number recorded between 1985 and 1994. The greatest rise was in the numbers of storms and floods, and flooding alone accounted for 47% of all weather-related disasters. A separate set of researchers looked at the bigger picture of a warmer, wetter world and calculated that between 1980 and 2013, floods had claimed more than 220,000 lives. They also calculated that the direct economic losses that could be pinned on river flooding exceeded $1trn (£670bn). They then looked at what might happen if nations did nothing about flood risk and predicted that by the end of the century, absolute damage from floods could increase worldwide by a factor of 20.  So all the evidence points in one direction: in a warming world, those regions already well-watered are likely to see more precipitation, while the drylands – regions in which rainfall and evaporation are more or less in balance – will tend to get drier. This is not good news for anybody.  Climate scientists have been pointing out for nearly three decades that in a warmer world, there is likely to be a greater frequency of extreme events. This Christmas time seems to underscore their warnings: storms and tornadoes devastated towns in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There were freak snowfalls in Mexico and devastating floods in Paraguay that so far have forced 170,000 from their homes. Climate scientists have also been unwilling to link any one extreme event with the predictions of climate change: increasingly, some are now prepared to concede that a warmer world is compounding the probability of any flood, windstorm and heat wave.  “I have always felt there is coincidence and there is coincidence,” said Phil Rothwell, who until two years ago was head of flood policy for the Environment Agency. “But lots and lots of coincidences end up being the reality of life, which is where we are at the moment. It is always very interesting hearing the Met Office trying not to say that one event is climate change, by whatever circumlocution they can use. But if it walks like a duck, it is a duck. What we appear to be on the receiving end of at the moment is something which is absolutely as you expect climate change to appear.” The prime minister had said that the government needed to look again at the way it perceived risk. “I rarely agree with David Cameron, but I think he is right,” Rothwell said. Predictions of flood risk have been traditionally based on climate history. That may have to change. “History can predict where you might be going in the future – if it is predictable. But when things become unpredictable and when your baseline is no longer accurate, it’s not playing fair and history is not telling you what the future may be like, then it is much more difficult to predict how rivers will behave in certain circumstances and how much rain you will get,” Rothwell said. “Then what we get is what we have seen over the past few years.” • This article was amended on 30 December 2015 to reflect the fact that extreme weather events in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma included storms, not just tornadoes."
"After the signing of a historic climate pact in Paris, we might now hope that the merchants of doubt – who for two decades have denied the science and dismissed the threat – are officially irrelevant. But not so fast. There is also a new, strange form of denial that has appeared on the landscape of late, one that says that renewable sources can’t meet our energy needs.   Oddly, some of these voices include climate scientists, who insist that we must now turn to wholesale expansion of nuclear power. Just this past week, as negotiators were closing in on the Paris agreement, four climate scientists held an off-site session insisting that the only way we can solve the coupled climate/energy problem is with a massive and immediate expansion of nuclear power. More than that, they are blaming environmentalists, suggesting that the opposition to nuclear power stands between all of us and a two-degree world.  That would have troubling consequences for climate change if it were true, but it is not. Numerous high quality studies, including one recently published by Mark Jacobson of Stanford University, show that this isn’t so. We can transition to a decarbonized economy without expanded nuclear power, by focusing on wind, water and solar, coupled with grid integration, energy efficiency and demand management. In fact, our best studies show that we can do it faster, and more cheaply. The reason is simple: experience shows that nuclear power is slow to build, expensive to run and carries the spectre of catastrophic risk. It requires technical expertise and organization that is lacking in many parts of the developing world (and in some part of the developed world as well). As one of my scientific colleagues once put it, nuclear power is an extraordinarily elaborate and expensive way to boil water.  The only country in the world that has ever produced the lion’s share of its electricity from nuclear is France, and they’ve done it in a fully nationalized industry – a model that is unlikely to be transferable to the US, particularly in our current political climate. Even in the US, where nuclear power is generated in the private sector, it has been hugely subsidized by the federal government, which invested billions in its development in order to prove that the destructive power unleashed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki could be put to good use. The government also indemnified the industry from accidents, and took on the task of waste disposal – a task it has yet to complete.  We also have to pay attention to the problem of continued fossil fuel development. Climate activists have focused attention on divestment as a means to remind the world that continued investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure is inconsistent with the decarbonized economy that we need.  And here, there are some interesting facts that most people don’t know. In a recent study that I did with my colleague Richard Heede, we examined the potential impact of using the proven reserves of fossil fuels in the world. We discovered a surprising fact: if all the reserves in the hands of investor-owned companies were to be burned, we would not exceed the 2C (3.6F) target. What puts the world at risk are the reserves in the hands of nation-states – which are mostly coal – and the continued exploration for more oil and gas by private companies like Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, BP and Shell. Most of the coal reserves are in developing nations such as China, which increasingly recognizes the very serious damage that coal use entails and is looking for alternatives modes of development. So this leaves us with the investor-owned companies seeking new reserves, and it means that we must find a way to convince – or prevent – these companies from continued exploration. So far no one has proposed a plan to do that, and we probably won’t get very far if the alternatives to fossil fuel – such as renewable energy – are disparaged by a new generation of myths. If we want to see real solutions implemented, we need to be on the lookout for this new form of denial. There have been important signs of late of cracks in the Republican rejection of climate science, as some party leaders have signaled their willingness to consider carbon pricing. Still, as new forms of denialism continue to emerge, it is hard to imagine federal implementation of a climate plan any time soon, much less the sort of ambitious plan that would help keep the world below the 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) level of warming, per the Paris agreement. When President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, many critics of the decision (and even some supporters) said it was merely symbolic. Symbols matter – so even if it were, that would not necessarily be bad. But rejecting XL was a crucial step in the direction of rejecting new commitments to fossil fuel infrastructure. The key to decarbonizing our economy is to build a new energy system that does not rely on carbon-based fuels. Scientific studies show that that can be done, it can be done soon and it does not require nuclear power. "
"More than three-quarters of Britain’s 59 butterfly species have declined over the last 40 years, with particularly dramatic declines for once common farmland species such as the Essex Skipper and small heath, according to the most authoritative annual survey of population trends. But although common species continue to vanish from our countryside, the decline of some rarer species appears to have been arrested by last ditch conservation efforts.   “This is the final warning bell,” said Chris Packham, Butterfly Conservation vice-president, calling for urgent research to identify the causes for the disappearance of butterflies from ordinary farmland. “If butterflies are going down like this, what’s happening to our grasshoppers, our beetles, our solitary bees? If butterflies are in trouble, rest assured everything else is.” While 76% of species are declining, prospects for a handful of the most endangered butterflies in Britain have at least brightened over the past decade, according to the study by Butterfly Conservation and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, with rare species responding to intensive conservation efforts. During the last 10 years, the population of the threatened Duke of Burgundy has increased by 67% and the pearl-bordered fritillary has experienced a 45% rise in abundance as meadows and woodlands are specifically managed to help these species. Numbers of the UK’s most endangered butterfly, the high brown fritillary, are finally increasing at some of its remaining sites in Exmoor and south Wales, showing the success of targeted conservation efforts there.  But The State of the UK’s Butterflies 2015 report cautions that such revivals still leave these vulnerable species far scarcer than they once were – the high brown fritillary has suffered a 96% decline in occurrence (meaning the sites at which it is present) since 1976, reflecting its disappearance from most of Britain. Other endangered butterflies, including the wood white (down 88% in abundance), white admiral (down 59% in abundance) and marsh fritillary have continued a relentless long-term decline.  The report reveals that the causes of the decline in rare “habitat specialist” butterflies, who are only found in specific places such as chalk grassland, are well understood, and usually linked to the destruction of flower-rich grassland or neglect of traditionally coppiced woodland.  But the reasons for the disappearance of once-common species from the wider countryside are less well understood by scientists. The wall – an orange and brown species that often basks on walls and stones – has declined in abundance by 87% since 1976 and by 77% in its occurrence. So it is now seen in both much lower numbers and in many fewer locations. Climate change and pesticides may be playing a more damaging role in their declines than previously thought.  Packham said it was imperative that scientists are funded to find out what is causing the loss of Britain’s insects.  “It points to the fact that there’s something significant that we’re missing,” he said. “I think personally it’s the over-use of a broad spectrum of insecticides and then neonicotinoids thrown into the mix since the 1990s. This is an urgent, clarion call to academics to get into gear and find out what is causing these declines.”  Common butterflies are generally faring better in Scotland than in England, mirroring trends reported in other species groups, such as moths. Scientists believe that climate change may be having a more beneficial impact in the north than in the south.  Climate change is helping some species move northwards but increases in occurrence (or distribution) don’t necessarily translate into higher numbers: the silver-washed fritillary has flown into the Midlands and East Anglia in the last decade, with a 55% increase in occurrence, but its abundance has only increased by 6%. The purple emperor has declined in abundance but increased in occurrence by 135% – reflecting enthusiasts’ increased skill in spotting this elusive butterfly in previously unknown locations.  Climate change is providing some excitement for the thousands of volunteers who spot butterflies for Butterfly Conservation’s recording schemes, providing a uniquely detailed set of scientific records stretching back to 1976.  More migratory butterflies are reaching Britain, with the clouded yellow, red admiral and painted lady all increasing dramatically in abundance since the 1970s. In the last few years, rarer migrants traditionally only found in hotter climes, including the long-tailed blue, and European swallowtail, have also arrived in southern England."

HEH The problem of the climate change is not a country-specific problem, this is a worldwide problem.   MR We had the Uttarakhand floods two-and-a-half years back where over 5,000 people lost their lives; we had unprecedented floods in Jammu in Kashmir, which hit the capital city of Srinagar. We had the earthquake in Nepal where over 10,000 people lost their lives.   DW When I was growing up, we had a beach that is no longer swimmable because all the trees have fallen into the ocean, have been eaten up by the ocean.  CW I live in Beijing so I literally experience smogs on a regular basis. It’s really bad, horrible, you get really worried about your own health, about your children’s health, everything like that, so there’s a sense of urgency overall in the society.   JC The west actually has the bigger responsibility because the west is the larger polluter, is the larger emitter and is the most economically powerful bloc in the world.  ST I think our hope is the globe shall be united and act together.  JV My name is John Vidal, and I’m the environment editor for the Guardian. I’m here at COP 21 in Paris, and in this edition of the Global development podcast we’ll outline how the agreement could affect developing countries. Let’s put into context how far things have come since the last major COP, which was in 2009 in Copenhagen. Ed Miliband, you were the British environment secretary of state in Copenhagen. what are your experiences of climate change, your personal experiences?   EM Well, I think we know so much more now than we did then about the fact that climate change is already here and happening, one degree of warming, clear linkages to extreme weather events that have happened, so I think compared to six years ago, when I was doing this as the climate change secretary, I think the imperative is even stronger than it was then.   JV And now we’re in Paris for COP 21. So what has changed?   EM The political will seems to be stronger, I think in particular China and America. I would say that what President Obama’s done in his second term and the focus of the Chinese has turned things quite significantly.   AS I think the questions are not being tackled directly, so I think it’s cloudy like the weather.  EA There’s just a lot going on, there’s a lot at stake, things are moving but not at the level that they should be moving at.   MR2 Mary Robinson, I’m the special envoy to the secretary general on climate change and I also have my foundation on climate justice. The mood has changed a little bit and there’s a bit more of a sense that, yes, we can get an agreement and that it will be as ambitious as possible. And that’s a little bit different from the middle of last week, so I’m more hopeful but there’s still a lot of work to do.   JV There is a sense that any agreement will always contain an inherent inequity between developed and developing countries. Meena Raman is from the Third World Network, an international NGO HQ’d in Malaysia. Now she’s been to many of these COPs, so I spoke to her in Paris.  MR3 We know that the contributions that parties have put on the table at the moment don’t do that job fast enough. However, developing countries are making their effort and I think unlike Kyoto everybody is on board towards that process. But I think in order for it to be fair and just to the developing world, one of the most important concerns that they have raised is that it must recognise the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.   JV Meena, that means that richer countries should really act further and faster than developing countries. Are we seeing this principle being dismantled here in Paris?  MR3 Exactly. Now that seems to be the agenda of the rich, developed world.   JV Small island states like Grenada in the Caribbean can not only get dwarfed in the negotiations but are also some of the nations right on the front line, suffering the most.   DW My name is Dessima Williams and I come from Grenada, I’m an avid advocate for justice.   JV And here in Paris you’re a delegate on your country’s delegation.  DW That’s correct, and I’m also here in support of the work of Oxfam International. The way of life as we knew it, which was relatively stable and known, is no longer the case. Our agriculture, our tourism is at risk because 65% – 63%-65% – of all our physical infrastructure and, most of all, commercial activities are on the coast and that’s getting inundated with the sea. Our airport is at risk, it will go underwater if we have a metre rise.   JV Do you think people here in Paris, especially from the rich countries, do you think they actually understand what is at stake?  DW Over a hundred countries do, and that’s why we’ve asked for a maximum of 1.5C as a tolerable global average temperature so that we do not put ourselves at further risk. I think the more powerful countries, that larger physical mass, may not quite understand the immediacy of the threat and the impact of climate change to small islands, to coastal countries. And we have been fighting to get that message across for many years. I think it’s beginning to sink in a bit but the policymakers, some of them, still feel that there is time and space to manoeuvre because they have big economies, big land mass. Many countries in Africa, across Africa, the Pacific, the Caribbean, we have small economies that cannot continuously finance the destruction caused by climate change, neither do we have large land mass where people can in fact escape the ravages of the sea and the rains and so on. So I think we have an uphill battle to meet in the commons of justice.   JV In Ethiopia they are also experiencing the effects of climate change.  ST I’m Shiferaw Teklemariam, a minister in the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change in Ethiopia. In some parts of the nation we are already experiencing flooding, drought, the El Niño is causing a number of challenges, so the united globe has to act commonly on the problem, of course differentiated in the way we respond. So here justice, equity and also addressing your own genuine share towards climate change is what we are requiring.  JV The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, was in Paris to attend COP, and also lead a meeting with activist Naomi Klein. So we asked him how he saw this inequity manifested.  JC In the ability to represent, the ability to prepare, the ability to put forward technical arguments, because the west clearly has far greater resources than poorer countries in the world.  JV The question is, should developing countries like Britain be setting stronger targets? Jeremy Corbyn.  JC Much stronger targets, and we should abide by those targets and we should use all our influence here to get the strongest possible legally binding target and ensure that it is adhered to and carried out, and that the US in particular ratifies that target back in the Senate. So there has to be a proper climate change fund and $100bn being suggested is a good start, but I think we’re going to have to go further than that in order to deal with the levels of inequality.   JV So what kind of agreement do most developing countries really need?  HEH I am the minister of environment in Morocco and my name is Hakima El Haite. We are a developing country and we need help, we need transfer of technology, we need enhancement of capacity in some issues and some technologies. We need funds.  JV What happens if the agreement is a weak agreement and not much gets sorted out? Is this very serious for Africa and for Morocco?   HEH No, it’s serious for the world, sir, this is what all the industrial countries should understand, because if they want, and if we want around the world, to establish the balance of CO2 in the globe, the only chance is to let Africa and the G77 to develop in a different way. We are already suffering, you know, and we are already trying to adapt with our knowhow, limited knowhow.  JV So how could developing countries address this gap?  HEH I think that as Morocco we are a very nice model to the other countries, we have learned from our own experience that money is bringing in money, so if we have small public money we can attract investment and we can attract private sector partners, and this is very important to develop all the projects around the world, in Africa and elsewhere.   EA Now, my hometown is still drying its feet as more poison bleeds overhead. They say it is sacrifice so we can live in comfort but what shelter can we find in disease? I’m Eunice Andrada, I’m a poet from the Philippines. I’m from a team of poets for the Global Call for Climate Action as part of their project called Spoken Word for the World.   JV Most COPs feel pretty democratic and there are civil society groups from all over the world, and they make a lot of noise and they are lobbying their delegates at every point, this one feels slightly different, partly because of the atrocity in Paris and the security here is very, very high. Indigenous people have come from all over the globe – Africa, Latin America, even Europe. They came hoping for just one line to be in the final agreement; it has, however, been taken out.   AS Alberto Saldamando, I’m with the Indigenous Environmental Network, who are devoting all of their energies to the creation of carbon markets and carbon offsets. And the object of the offsets are indigenous lands and territories – the forests, the lands – and we’re trying to protect them, or at least get something into the operative language that talks about respecting the observance of the rights of indigenous peoples.  The Green Climate Fund, they funded a so-called risk programme in Peru which raises reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation of forests, and the idea is to increase the capacity of the forest to absorb carbon. Where they expect it to be absorbed are indigenous lands and indigenous forests, and there the market is going to say, “We own the trees, we own the carbon in the trees so you can’t touch them.” So, eventually, it’s going to affect their food security, we won’t be able to fell trees or clear fields. In fact, I talked to one guy who said that in his country, where he lives, they can’t even fish, they’re prohibited from fishing. So what are people supposed to do?   JV We know now that indigenous rights will not be in this agreement; nevertheless, the Green Climate Fund was one of the great hopes for these talks. That will be the repository that will be a UN, effectively a bank, where all the money which is raised by the rich countries, the $100bn, will be put for different projects and then developing countries will apply to do projects for them. Now, it’s a battleground in itself because the rich countries want control of the money, they say it’s their money, they should control how it’s spent – and the developing countries say no, this is ours by right and we should decide how the money is spent. So it’s a huge battleground and it’s yet to be worked out. Issues like indigenous rights really just get relegated or dismissed completely but the one thing which is very much alive is renewable energy.   CW My name is Changhua Wu, I’m the Greater China director of the Climate Group. The Climate Group has the international NGO headquarters in London, so I run the Greater China operations working in China. China, like many other parts of the world, has actually started to experience more and more extreme weathers and on a personal basis, of course, I live in Beijing and 2007 when there was huge flooding there were lives actually sacrificed in that process.   I think China definitely has been advocating the energy efficiency, alternative energy development, and if you follow the Chinese president, Xi Jinping’s travel schedule this year you will find that he himself has already become the champion, the voice, the messenger of global sustainable development. Of course, there is China’s sustainable development there as well, and of course in November in Beijing at the Apec summit, you started to see President Xi Jinping and President Obama coming together, making joint announcements demonstrating the leadership and calling everyone to come on board and towards a low carbon future, that part has been unfolding in China, which is very exciting.   JV Tata is one of the world’s biggest companies and in India; it’s gone very heavily into wind and to solar power.  MR I’m Mukund Rajan, I work with the Tata Group. I’m a member of the group executive council with responsibility for our sustainability activities. We’re seeing the speed of natural calamities coming thick and fast, at a pace we’ve never seen before, and in each of these occasions we’ve tried to mount our rescue efforts, but we are now getting stretched ourselves.   JV And meanwhile, there’s enormous air pollution in Indian cities, growth spurting ahead, desperate for more energy.   MR Absolutely. I think a lot of people don’t realise that in India, given the size of our population, actually a very large number of people even today don’t have access to the electricity grid, over 300 million people by some estimates. And their energy needs, just to get to basic sustenance, is going to itself require a significant amount of investment, which is why we need to talk about what will be the path through which they access that electricity without making the same mistakes we’ve had to make in the past.  JV But Tata, as I understand it, has got large interests in solar energy and also in wind energy. How will these be affected by this agreement, hopefully, which is made?  MR The Indian prime minister’s actually recently announced a very major ambition, we are trying to navigate the international solar alliance of countries between the tropic of cancer, the tropic of capricorn, and his announcement suggests that India will now have an ambition to create at least a hundred gigawatts of solar power.  JV That’s compared to what now?  MR Minimal; it’s less than 10,000 megawatts in India at the moment.   JV So this would be an immense achievement?  MR This will be a gigantic leap forward, it’ll probably make India the world’s largest solar market.   JV As far as solar goes, one of the most ambitious African countries is Morocco. It’s just launched the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant. Hakima El Haite again.  HEH Morocco used to import and to be dependent on 97% of its energy from abroad, and it was very heavy on the budget of the state – and Morocco used to subsidise and to fund fossil fuels. Today, we have decided many years ago, ten years ago, to have this energy policy to produce clean energy with ambitions even to export this clean energy and, I’m really, as a Moroccan, very proud.   DW So the work really escalates after we finish Paris, and that’s why Paris is so important because it gives us very strong and high ambitious parameters to go home and implement.   JV Of the 196 countries who are here, 189 have already put in what they call intended nationally determined contributions, or INDCs. Now they’ve lodged these with the UN and each one is their country’s ambition, if the money’s available, what they will do. And, if you total them all up, what you see is there’s not enough to keep us under a two degree limit, which is what everybody wants, it’ll be something like 2.7 so there’s a long, long way to go, but it’s a very, very good start.   DW The review of the global temperature goal has not been concluded, and I know a lot of developing countries will keep it on the table to show that the science is directing us to 1.5C. So the review is ongoing, the INDCs have to be acted upon, they have to be realised, we will agree here on a common metric and a common measure but in the case of the developing countries they have to have the technology and the capacity building to actually turn them into reality.   JV This will be seen as a historic COP, one way or the other. It’s the result of 20 years of debate, it’s the culmination of a huge effort by the international community. But people say it’s really just the beginning and it’s what happens next that is key to the whole thing, whether it was worth it or not. Now we won’t know for many years because a lot of this stuff won’t kick in for five years at the very, very least but it will absolutely define our development paths, everybody’s, over the next 20, 30 years.   EM The COP is not, in the end, the be all and end all, it’s what happens afterwards, because Copenhagen was very, very problematic in many respects, but it’s actually the work that’s gone on since that has if you like, turned things round and Paris is going to be more successful, I hope, but we’re going to need a lot more work in the days and weeks and months and years ahead.  JV What is really noticeable is that everybody wants change, everybody can see here that we can’t go on in the same way.   HEH I’m an optimist. Why? Because people are moving. Cities around the world are moving, the private sector is moving, NGOs are moving, territories are moving.  JV This conference gives a little bit of a chance for that change to happen and that’s why people are optimistic, because they feel that it has been well overdue and countries have really got to start thinking in a very different way about how they all develop.  JC We’ve then got to hold the governments that have agreed to it to those agreements, but above all to build for the next one and I think that the climate change march is a good sign that people are waking up to it. We don’t have to be afraid of the future, we have to be optimistic about it and be involved in it.   All of our programmes are available on the Guardian’s website.

"In a new global warming pact, countries set out milestones over the next five years in a bid to bridge the gap between national targets and what science recommends. Climate offers from 187 out of 195 countries fail to cap warming to the upper limit of 2C this century. Instead the planet is set to heat up at least 2.7C, according to the UN.  That’s why a “global stocktake” of pledges to reduce greenhouse emissions or “intended nationally determined contributions” is slated for 2018. And by 2020, the pact encourages – but does not require – countries to submit updated plans. But instead of allowing the years to pass by, a group of researchers involved in drafting countries’ pledges is calling for action today. In a manifesto released by Institute for European Energy and Climate Policy on Monday, they write: “There is nothing to stop each and every country to revise its existing (I)NDC during the Paris Agreement adoption process of the agreement.” A suitable time to do this is 21 April 2017, the day the official signature book closes at UNHQ in New York, The Hague-based body says. The agreement will take effect in 2020, provided 55 countries accounting for 55% of global emissions ratify it. “Let’s ensure that the political momentum built up in Paris – involving 150 head of states and prime ministers – do not fade away,” it reads. “As we have seen INDC formulation processes and content formulation from the inside, we know that there is a lot of room for realistic and feasible improvements towards higher ambition.” The EU has ruled out any increased ambition in its 2030 pledge until the next Commission is appointed in 2020. Analysts say it is unlikely top emitters the US, China or India will revise their INDCs before 2020. Argentina and Canada however are due to review their pledges, following recent changes of government."

"Governments will need to move faster and find more money to meet “ambitious” targets of cutting pollution in Great Barrier Reef waters, a Queensland government taskforce has found.  An interim report released on Monday by a water science taskforce called for more urgency – and the injection of corporate and philanthropic funding – to improve reef water quality as a bulwark against its greatest long-term threat, climate change. The taskforce, led by Queensland’s chief scientist, Dr Geoff Garrett, found the investment needed to cut nitrogen runoff by 80% and total sediment runoff by 50% in reef waters was likely to go “well beyond funds allocated by both [federal and state] governments”. The report found current investment in monitoring, modelling and reporting was “not enough to adequately measure” water quality across the 2,300km long reef. This handicapped a “vital” element of the reef’s 2050 conservation plan, which helped Australia avoid an embarrassing “in danger” listing of the natural wonder by Unesco in June. The state auditor general in June released a report casting doubt on claims of progress in water quality because of “significant uncertainty” around modelling amid a lack of monitoring sites. The taskforce recommended better “leverage” of government funding to attract “corporate and philanthropic funds through public private partnerships”. Queensland is spending an extra $90m over the next four years on top of its $35m a year on reef water quality, while the commonwealth has set up a $140m reef trust. The taskforce said regulation was needed around “pollution load limits” and urban and industrial developments in reef catchments should be restricted to “ensure no net increase in water pollution”.  It called for more financial incentives for landholders to cut runoff, including loans, tax breaks for farm amalgamations and “voluntary retirement of marginal land from production”. Garrett said there was “no one silver bullet” for meeting the pollution targets. “Despite significant investment and goodwill from the government and all partners, accelerated uptake of improved land management practices is needed,” he said. “We need to take stronger action and we need to do it now. “A healthy reef that is resilient to the future impacts of climate change needs clean water. To have clean water, we need to greatly reduce the amount of fertiliser, sediment and chemicals coming from all sources – farms, urban development and industry.” The Queensland minister for the environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Steven Miles, said he was “delighted” to accept the report, which was an “important milestone” in developing the state government’s investment priorities and meeting “our ambitious water quality targets”. “Last week I was in Paris as part of the United Nations COP21 climate summit where we saw clearly that the world is finally accepting that the need for action is now urgent,” Miles said. Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters has criticised premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for saying the state would “always be reliant on coal”. Palaszczuk told the ABC that while her government would “look at” lifting its renewable energy target through its focus on wind and solar farms, “coal is a backbone of our economy”. Waters said this was “ludicrous”. “Try telling that to the thousands of workers who have been sacked by the coal industry recently without a transition plan being provided by the big parties,” she said.  Waters accused Palaszczuk of a “go-slow” on the state renewable energy target of 50% by 2030, saying the government had “gone quiet” since promising action during its election campaign and putting off any announcements until next year. “The Labor government is proving just as bad as Campbell Newman’s when it comes to pushing ahead with new coalmines and they’re failing to keep their promises to support renewable energy,” Waters said.  “The coal industry is in structural decline and we need a transition plan to provide jobs in 21st century industries, like clean energy, which doesn’t ruin tourism and agriculture jobs as the coal industry does.”"
"George Monbiot’s demonisation of meat eating (Your festive meal could be worse than a long-haul flight, 23 December) is oversimplified and misleading. Factory farming is wasteful and horrific but other forms of livestock-rearing such as pastured grazing provide a highly nutritious source of food using land that is often unsuitable for horticulture. Pound for pound, pastured meat proteins are more diverse than those of cereals and are similar in terms of water use and carbon emissions. Livestock has an essential role in farming practices like permaculture, which may offer the only viable alternative for sustainable food production, utilising stubble and fertilising fields left to fallow. Pastured animals can improve soil health and repair damage done to it by incessant tilling, provided they are stocked at an appropriate level. Fatty meat provides almost three times the calories per kilogramme as cereals and contains almost every nutrient essential to the human body. Three billion people eat meat-free diets, and 4 billion suffer malnutrition. This does not make a case for going vegetarian. Without doubt, the rich world needs to eat less meat, but the developing world also deserves to have a share of it. Steppe and other grassland converted to cereals supported huge populations of wild, methane-emitting herbivores, and is essentially neutral at sustainable levels (ie not artificially supported with feed). Similarly, termites emit twice the methane as livestock, but there is no great push for termite eradication. It is the intensity of meat production supported by oil energy that is the problem. Hence, the carbon costs of factory farming systems ultimately derive from the fossil fuels used to grow feed and artificially support the lives of these poor animals, and it must be stopped, if only for the sheer cruelty of the animals’ treatment.Chris BrauschKatikati, New Zealand  • As an omnivore who reuses our leftovers and grows quite a lot of fruit and vegetables, I am getting increasingly exasperated by George Monbiot’s selective quotation of low-grade literature about meat production. Meat production accounts for about a seventh of current greenhouse emissions, which could be reduced with simple mitigation measures. Anaerobic digesters have been around since the 1970s – developed to help poor farmers cook in their huts without choking on wood smoke, reducing deforestation in the process. Had the EU not succumbed to vested interests, this technology could have transformed meat production. How about some seasonal cheer next year by campaigning to reduce food waste by banning ever more confusing and complex interlinked supermarket offers, so that good meat does not end up being binned?David NowellFellow of the Geological Society, New Barnet, Hertfordshire • Farmers here in Britain, and indeed around the world, already know they are on the frontline of climate change. “All aspects of food security are at risk,” according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It’s no wonder then that farmers representing different farming systems and sizes were at the Paris climate conference, all united by the message that farming is important and that the new COP21 agreement needed to acknowledge this. Real action is being taken by farmers to tackle climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from UK agriculture have reduced by about 20% since 1990 and farmers are committed to continuing to play their part through the Greenhouse Gas Action Plan, helping the UK to meet its Climate Change Act target. It is not possible in a short letter to convey the breadth of work that the NFU’s members are undertaking to address George Monbiot’s concerns. But I hope that he can be inspired, like I am, by the farmers I meet – the majority of whom are trying every day to do the best job they can, but often have their efforts go unnoticed or unrewarded.Dr Ceris JonesNFU climate change adviser • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"We have always been baffled by the weather and have often used strange arguments to explain its unexpected behaviour. More than 2,000 years ago, one hapless Roman citizen was so worried that unusual gales and storms might be due to the impiety of the nation that he asked the gods for guidance via a carved lead tablet which he left at a local oracle. Today we have a better idea of the factors that influence our weather, though we still struggle to make sense of the reams of data – wind, pressure, sunshine, temperature, moisture levels, and other factors – that we now know influence the daily regimes of rain and sun that we experience.  Most of these factors are short-term phenomena; others are longer-term influences. The former determine our weather, while the latter affect our climate. And that is the essential difference between weather and climate. It is all a matter of time. Weather is determined by conditions of the atmosphere over a short period and climate is determined by the way the atmosphere behaves over relatively long periods of time. Weather can change quickly; climate alters very slowly. However, the rules are changing. We have begun to alter the makeup of our atmosphere by pumping out greenhouse gases from our factories, cars and power stations and this, in turn, is changing our climate, causing air and sea temperatures to rise inexorably. This is global warming, a phenomenon now accepted as reality by the vast majority of the world’s meteorologists and climate experts. Indeed, it was their warnings that led to the recent Paris accord on climate change which is intended to channel a route for nations to agree cuts in fossil fuel use and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists know changes lie ahead but find that predicting exactly how our weather will change as long-term climate alters it is complex and vexing. Yes, it is very likely that there will be more intense hurricanes and storms in a warming world but determining whether an individual event – however damaging – is the result of climate change or not is almost impossible given the plethora of other short-term factors that could also influence the triggering of such a storm. Determining how climate change is progressing is also difficult because long-term data sets are required to build up an accurate assessment. These can take three decades to assemble. Hence the reluctance of scientists to give cast-iron assurances about exactly how much our climate is altering. As the years pass, however, the more certain they get."

"This is humanity’s great paradox: we are the only animal capable of sustained empathy and altruism towards unrelated beings – and we are the only animal that murders so many of its own kind, and lays waste to the planet it inhabits. While our violence towards each other has diminished with astonishing speed, as Steven Pinker documents, our violence towards the living planet appears to be intensifying. The megafauna that once dominated most parts of the world is now confined to small and shrinking pockets, from which it is disappearing at great speed. At the current rate of poaching, rhinos and elephants could vanish from almost every corner of Africa by the time a child born today leaves school. Lions once lived almost everywhere: across Europe, Asia, the Americas and throughout Africa. In the 1940s there were some 450,000 remaining in Africa. Now there are 20,000, and the population is forecast to halve over the next 20 years. In just one fire season, much of the Indonesian rainforest has been fragmented and incinerated. The marine ecosystem is collapsing in front of our eyes, food webs unravelling through overfishing and pollution. Soil, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, is being lost so fast that the world has, on average, just another 60 years of crop production. The climatic space in which human civilisation flourished is slamming shut. Could it be that the two trends are related? Might the remarkable decline in the violence human beings inflict on each other have been obtained by violating the living world? Have we, by seizing and liquidating natural wealth, bought ourselves a temporary respite from resource conflict? There is a more optimistic way of understanding the human paradox. With the possible exception of the naked mole rat, which is a eusocial mammal (it has a family structure similar to that of bees and ants), no vertebrate species is as sociable as we are. Mole rats subordinate their individual interests only to those with whom they share genetic material. But we are capable of subordinating ours even to those of total strangers: sending money to charities, taking in refugees, volunteering as human shields. We use our social tendencies to normalise such remarkable behaviour. But the same ability to unite, to put ourselves in second place, can also be used to normalise our darkest tendencies: greed, violence, destruction, subordination to the demands of psychopaths. Most people align themselves with the status quo, whether it be democracy, monarchy, Stalinism, Nazism, care for the living planet or a carnival of ruin. In other words, the problem is not that we are inherently inclined towards destruction, waste and killing, any more than we are inherently inclined towards angelic feats of kindness and love. Our social brain is capable of normalising either tendency. It is not human nature we need to change, but the norms and institutions that play upon it. In other words, the task is not, as some imagine, impossible, but merely difficult. Through the transformations that Pinker documents, we appear to have undergone what the novelist Michel Houellebecq calls a metaphysical mutation in our relations with each other: the precipitous decline in violence that has occurred, against all predictions, in less than a century. Now we have to do the same for our relationship with the living world. Yes, there’s a long way to go. We seem to be better at persuading ourselves we have changed than we are at changing. The climate agreement in Paris was widely greeted as a breakthrough. It is nothing of the kind. Shorn of targets, timetables and binding instruments, it is a highly effective programme for salving the collective conscience of the delegates, and little more. As the website climateparis.org explains, even if every pledge nations brought to the talks were honoured (and already governments such as the UK’s are breaking theirs), by 2030 the world will be producing more greenhouse gases than it does today. At that point we will have 14 years to reduce global emissions to zero, to stand a fair chance of preventing more than two degrees of global warming. If the Paris agreement’s “aspirational” aim of no more than 1.5 degrees is to be achieved, other estimates suggest, carbon emissions must fall off a cliff soon after 2020. The festival of self-satisfaction with which the talks ended was a “mission accomplished” moment, a grave case of premature congratulation. Such failures reflect a general conviction that more effective action is impossible. It’s too difficult, too expensive to prevent the slow collapse of the biosphere; easier just to live with it – or die with it. But while the global support for renewable energy – $121bn a year – is widely decried as an outrageous drain upon the public purse, the $452bn with which the G20 nations support fossil fuels is, apparently, eminently affordable. It’s out of the question to keep fossil fuels in the ground but not, according to some commentators, to move cities in response to climate change or, as one columnist infamously proposed, to allow the tropics to be reduced to “wastelands with few folk living in them”. The toxic stream of disinformation about climate change pumped out by companies such as Exxon mingles with a deep current of anti-intellectualism. But it is not our destiny to be swept away by this nonsense, any more than it is our destiny to resist it. This is a choice we take both alone and together. We have a remarkable capacity to make and to unmake social norms, as the great rejection of violence since the second world war attests. There are plenty of examples –among both indigenous people and industrial economies – of collective agreements not to maximise the exploitation of resources. Such restraint is as much a human tendency as greed and profligacy. If we can stop killing each other so rapidly, we can just as easily and just as quickly stop killing the other beings that inhabit our planet. Human peace and prosperity do not depend on ecological violence. Indeed, it could be argued that they depend on its cessation. • A fully linked version of this article can be found at Monbiot.com • This article was amended on 16 December 2015. An earlier version referred to the UN Food and Agriculture Association, rather than Organization. Also, the spelling of Steven Pinker’s first name was corrected (from “Stephen”). "
"The EU has admitted it has not yet looked into the polices needed to hold global warming to 1.5C, as agreed at the landmark Paris agreement, and will instead ask a UN climate science panel for advice involving “negative emissions” technology. The bloc’s negotiators had gone to Paris with a mandate for a 2C target but were forced to accommodate more ambitious demands from “the most exposed countries”, the bloc’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, said. Several small island states could be swallowed by rising seas if the planet warms by 2C, scientists believe.  “For sure, 1.5C is a trajectory of full decarbonisation and will require accelerated strategies and pathways,” Cañete told a Brussels press conference. “About negative emissions, the IPCC [UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] will say when and how.” Because the emissions cuts pledged in Paris chart a journey to a world warmed between 2.7-3C, the only way many climate scientists can envisage saving smaller island states is with “negative emissions” technology that sucks carbon out of the air, in the second part of this century.  Negative emissions can refer to geoengineering but usually means the mass deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies which bury CO2 in underground fissures. These would be fixed to power plants powered by “carbon neutral” bioenergy, which removes carbon from the air as it grows. More carbon would be saved than re-released into the atmosphere, the theory goes, so creating net zero emissions. But the idea has proved controversial, with Kevin Anderson, the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change branding negative emissions “highly speculative” over the weekend. “In the absence of negative emissions, staying below the 2C commitment demands levels of reductions in emissions far beyond anything discussed during the Paris negotiations,” Anderson said. Cañete said that Europe would not raise its pledge for a 40% emissions cut by 2030, before a five-yearly review process flagged in the Paris agreement begins. The EU hopes this process will start ratcheting up green commitments in 2023, although the bloc is counting on an IPCC snapshot of warming trends five years before that. “In 2018, there will be a stock take,” Cañete said. “Then in 2020 we can come along with more ambition. It will be for the next commission to lead this process.” “We will need additional legislation if we have more commitment, that is for sure,” the Spanish commissioner added. But developing world countries will note his reminder that when the EU set out its climate pledge, “we said that if we go further, we will be using international carbon credits.” For the moment, Cañete will be focused on new legislation to oversee the bloc’s promises on CO2 reductions and clean energy progress, themselves a touchy subject with EU states such as Poland. Cañete also fired a warning shot to the International Council on Civil Aviation (Icao) where Europe was “concerned at the slow pace of negotiations” on measures to cut airlines’ emissions. Without action in 2016, the EU would have to take a decision on reimposing carbon fees on international airlines, Cañete added. These were frozen in 2012 to allow diplomats more time to agree on alternative market-based measures. The EU’s most senior climate official declared himself more sanguine about the durability of the global climate compact in the US. “Even under a Republican administration, if India, China, Brazil stay on board, the US will not be able to stay outside the Paris agreement,” he said."
"Los países en desarrollo no deben ser tratados como un solo bloque en las discusiones sobre el cambio climático en París, ya que sus intereses son a menudo marcadamente divergentes , manifestó el expresidente de México. Felipe Calderón fue el representante de México en las discusiones sobre el clima celebradas en Cancún en 2010, que formalizaron algunos compromisos llevados a cabo el año anterior en la caótica cumbre de Copenhague. Actualmente es el presidente de una comisión global sobre la Nueva Economía del Clima.  En una entrevista con The Guardian, advirtió que las diferencias entre los países en desarrollo pueden ser tan grandes como las que hay entre los mismos y el mundo desarrollado.” El África subsahariana no es lo mismo que China”, dijo. “El G77 [que incluye la mayoría de las grandes economías en desarrollo] no es lo mismo que la Alianza de Pequeños Estados Insulares [que pueden ser los grandes perdedores, con riesgo de desaparición ante el aumento del nivel del mar]. Los países árabes [ricos en petróleo] tienen diferentes intereses”. El ritmo creciente de las economías en desarrollo exige el uso de más combustibles fósiles para crecer, y los países ricos en petróleo aspiran a tener vía libre para explotar sus recursos, siendo los países más pobres, que poseen una infraestructura mínima para hacer frente al cambio climático, los que más tienen que perder. Pero en las discusiones auspiciadas por la ONU, los países en desarrollo son frecuentemente tratados como un solo bloque, al menos en un primer momento. La advertencia de Calderón fue reiterada en privado por varios negociadores de los países desarrollados durante sobre las conversaciones. “Este es el punto en el que se empiezan a ver las diferencias - el G77 no está unido, sus integrantes no tienen los mismos intereses”, afirmó uno de ellos. Otro manifestó: “Estamos teniendo reuniones con estos países individualmente, y no todos van en la misma línea.” Las diferencias entre países en desarrollo son significativas a la hora de llegar a un acuerdo. Todd Stern, el enviado especial de Estados Unidos para el cambio climático, declaró a los periodistas que se estaba fraguando una “ ambiciosa coalición” entre el mundo desarrollado y los países en desarrollo. Stern tomó prestada la frase del ministro británico Greg Barker, quien asistió a una ronda anterior de negociaciones en 2011 en Durban, en la que fue definido el calendario para llegar a un acuerdo en París. En esa conferencia, la UE logró reunir una amplia pero frágil coalición entre los países menos adelantados del mundo, muchas economías emergentes y las naciones ricas. Al final de las sesiones maratónicas de negociación en Durban, para establecer la meta de un acuerdo global que fuera firmado en el año 2015 - génesis de las conversaciones actuales - todos los países, excepto China y la India, se mostraron a favor. Estos dos también dieron su acuerdo más de 36 horas después del plazo fijado como fecha límite de las negociaciones. Se trató de algo notable, puesto que en las conversaciones anteriores China y la India habían liderado coaliciones de países en desarrollo, pero en Durban terminaron aislados respecto a sus aliados tradicionales. Los anfitriones franceses esperan que estas discusiones muestren más unidad antes del viernes, cuando están programadas para terminar. Miguel Arias Cañete, comisionado climático de la UE, declaró que los EE.UU. estaban jugando su parte, manteniendo reuniones bilaterales con diversos países, entre ellos China. Calderón elogió a los anfitriones franceses del encuentro por la gestión del proceso de negociación. “Han llevado a cabo una gran diplomacia, en difíciles circunstancias”, dijo. “Han tomado en cuenta todos los puntos de vista, de todas las partes. Espero que tengan éxito.” Pero dijo que probablemente algunos países en desarrollo causen dificultades. Sugirió que Bolivia, que ayudó a bloquear un acuerdo formal en Copenhague en 2009, era uno de ellos. “La ideología derrota a las ideas en el caso de los bolivianos. Hablé con ellos antes de la COP. Fue una reunión muy decepcionante. Bolivia se oponía de lleno.” Los negociadores argumentan que Bolivia suele comenzar cada reunión con una larga perorata sobre la Madre Tierra. Algunos lo encuentran frustrante - “todos estamos aquí porque queremos salvar el planeta, pero tenemos muchas más cosas que hacer” - pero uno de ellos declaró a The Guardian: “Hay que escucharles y entender de dónde vienen, y después encontrar una base común.” Calderón tenía un un mensaje importante para los anfitriones franceses. En las reuniones sobre el clima de la ONU se requiere un consenso antes de que se apruebe toda resolución o acuerdo. Pero durante la preparación de la cumbre de Cancún, en 2010, Calderón consultó a expertos en derecho internacional y concluyó que “el consenso no significa unanimidad”. En Copenhague, los países desarrollados y los países en desarrollo acordaron conjuntamente por primera vez limitar las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en el marco de la ONU. Pero debido a las tácticas de bloqueo llevadas a cabo por un pequeño número de países - entre ellos Bolivia, Venezuela y Nicaragua - esas metas y la declaración hechaspor los líderes mundiales no pudieron ser incorporadas formalmente al proceso de la ONU. Calderón, quien logró formalizar aquellos los compromisos en Cancún, dijo que el derecho internacional permite a los anfitriones franceses “declarar” el momento en el que se llegue al consenso, incluso si algunos países se oponen.“Se necesitaba mucha disciplina y paciencia, [llegar a un acuerdo de la COP]”, afirmó. “Existen factores culturales que hay que entender. Esto no es un problema ambiental. Es una cuestión de diplomacia.”"

"Large fruit-eating monkeys and birds in tropical forests have been revealed as surprising climate change champions, whose loss to over-hunting is driving up carbon emissions. This is because their seed-spreading plays a vital role in the survival of huge, hard-wooded trees. Tropical forests store 40% of all the carbon on the Earth’s surface and the slashing of trees causes about 15% of the greenhouse gases that drive global warming.   Long-lived, thick and hard-wooded trees are especially good carbon stores, but they have large seeds that can only be dispersed via defecation by large animals. These big creatures have suffered huge losses from subsistence hunters, meaning hardwood trees are being replaced with softwood trees, which have smaller seeds but store less carbon. “In much of the tropics these [large] animals are pretty much gone, outside of protected areas and sometimes even inside protected areas,” said Prof Carlos Peres, at the University of East Anglia, UK, one of the international team behind the new study. “[Hardwood trees] require these big beasts to disperse their seeds. This is what is being lost.” “Policies to reduce carbon emissions from tropical countries have primarily focused on deforestation,” Peres said. “But our research shows that a decline in large animal populations poses a serious risk for the maintenance of tropical forest carbon storage.” The new research was led by scientists at São Paulo State University in Brazil and published in Science Advances. It focused on the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil, where 95% of all trees rely on animals to disperse seeds, and analysed the interactions between 800 animal species and 2,000 tree species.  It found losses of large animals like woolly spider monkeys, tapirs and toucans leads to the loss of hardwood trees. These are replace by softwood trees, whose smaller seeds (less than 12mm long) are spread by small fruit-eating marsupials, bats and birds which are not the target of hunters. The scientists estimated that 10-15% of the carbon stored in the original mixed forest is lost. Peres said the same effects were likely to apply to other tropical forests, including the Amazon. “This is a fairly universal process,” he said. “It is happening across the tropics, in Africa, southeast Asia, everywhere there are these species-rich forests.” The scientists concluded: “Our result highlights the fragility of carbon storage service in tropical forests under the current global change conditions. Halting the ongoing, fast-paced [animal loss in] tropical forests will not only save large charismatic animals and the plants they disperse but also have effects on climate change, carbon markets, and reforestation.” In November, the first comprehensive estimate of threatened species in the Amazon rainforest found that more than half of the myriad species could be heading for extinction. Among the species expected to suffer significant falls in numbers are the Brazil nut, and wild cacao and açai trees, all important food sources."
"Is it not time to think beyond the use of sandbags (Troops called into Cumbria, 26 December) and consider flood-defence systems that have worked elsewhere and have stood the test of time? We cannot just keep building higher banks and walls to keep each river within its existing narrow watercourse; the trend of increasing levels of flooding will go over the top or find a way round the side. We have the centuries-old Ouse and Nene Washes, plus a network of Fenland drains designed by Dutch engineers. Shouldn’t we ask them again for the benefit of their experience in the design of drainage systems by each river’s catchment area? Los Angeles, being an ancient delta, has concrete flash-flood drains that work well; even on film sets. Each area’s remedy requires significant central government funding for the purchase of land and the relocation of communities from extreme locations. It’s too much to accept being flooded out three times in a month.

"What do we do when our political leaders treat profound moral crises as if they are nothing extraordinary? Nothing to see here, move along? What if a supposedly ho-hum phenomenon is actually an existential threat to our species? How do we wrench the script away from those in power and sound the alarm?  In the final months of his editorship, Alan Rusbridger publically struggled with this question in a memorable essay that kicked off the Guardian’s special coverage of the climate crisis. “Changes to the Earth’s climate rarely make it to the top of the news list,” he wrote. “The changes may be happening too fast for human comfort, but they happen too slowly for the newsmakers – and, to be fair, for most readers … There may be untold catastrophes, famines, floods, droughts, wars, migrations and sufferings just around the corner. But that is futurology, not news, so it is not going to force itself on any front page anytime soon.” At the end of the hottest year on record – one marked by serial disasters, as well as armed conflicts exacerbated by drought – it’s getting tough to view climate change as futurology. Yet Rusbridger’s central point holds: this is a complex, slow-motion crisis. And with politicians loth to put it front and centre, how can the warming of our world compete with the many other pressing issues that scream daily for our attention? Rusbridger’s solution was simple: don’t wait for politicians to treat climate as a crisis. Instead, just do it. Most extraordinary about the Guardian’s coverage has been its strong focus on fossil fuel divestment, based on research showing that oil, gas and coal companies have several times more carbon in their proven reserves than is compatible with keeping warming below 2C – something our governments have pledged to do [in last week’s Paris climate deal, a new goal of just 1.5C was set]. Just a few years ago, the fact that fossil fuel companies were frantically searching out more carbon despite the fact that the climate system is destabilising was treated as an utterly normal part of the market system. Nothing remarkable. Not a story. But then a relatively small group of activists drew the line and said “no”. They redefined the frenetic quest for more carbon as immoral behaviour, perpetuated by, as author and activist Bill McKibben put it, “a rogue industry”. And they said it must be stopped. When the Guardian launched its #Keepitintheground series, things started changing very quickly. Suddenly all kinds of people came out of the woodwork to say that they, too, supported divestment – from Prince Charles to Ed Davey, then minister for energy and climate change. Even a former chairman of Shell declared divestment a “rational approach”. All of this speaks to the fact that politicians aren’t the only ones with the power to declare an emergency. Large and organised social movements have that power too. So, too, do major news organisations. Looking back at many of the significant stories of 2015, this phenomenon emerges as a defining theme: some ephemeral line is crossed and suddenly an activity that had been regarded as unremarkable is vociferously rejected as intolerable. And when that happens, the Guardian is the news organisation most reliably on the side of the people who are sounding the alarm. Telling the most compelling stories, digging up the most damning facts, and publishing the most heart-stopping photography. Though it began in 2013, this bottom-up declaration of a national emergency is what the Black Lives Matter movement has been doing in US streets without pause. Many analysts have wondered what sparked this uprising, since the number of police killings in the US appears not to have risen significantly in recent years. Nothing has really changed, they insist, so what’s all the marching about? But that misses the point entirely: what has changed, thanks to the rise of the movement, is the idea that “normal” levels of state violence are normal at all. Police violence has been redefined, in the streets, as both a scandal and an emergency. “For the last couple of years, the brutal banality of daily life for some people in this country has become visible and undeniable to those who have no immediate connection to it,” the Guardian’s Gary Younge wrote in July. “But nothing new has happened. There has been no spike in police brutality. What’s new is that people are looking.” To help expose this “brutal banality”, this year the Guardian launched The Counted, a detailed, crowdsourced database tracking US police killings. It amounts to “the most thorough public accounting for deadly use of force” in the country. (By December, this year’s harrowing tally was more than 1,000.) And it once again shows the power of rigorous journalism combining with an engaged – and awake – population. Previously, hard journalism was mostly about exposing lies and scandals that were being kept hidden. Today, a lot of the job of journalism – and activism – involves redefining what is happening right out in the open as scandalous, because it is. For instance, just because everybody thinks their emails are being monitored doesn’t mean it must always be so. Just because our borders are increasingly fortressed to refugees in dire need, doesn’t mean this has to be our future. And just because living standards have steadily eroded under the banner of “austerity” doesn’t mean that they can’t rise once again. We can still say “no” – and a great many of us are. From the “refugees welcome” demonstrations across Europe, to the surges of anti-austerity sentiment in Greece and Spain, to the hundreds of “kayaktivists” who tried to stop Shell’s Arctic drilling rigs from making it to icy waters. Again and again, regular people are drawing a line and saying “no” to what had very recently been treated as perfectly reasonable by experts and pundits. Journalism plays a critical role in this process of asserting that just because something reprehensible has become commonplace we do not relinquish our power – indeed our basic responsibility – to declare it unacceptable. Too often, media outlets abdicate this power, choosing instead to go with the flow. Or, worse, they actively use their enormous power and platform to champion the interests of the already powerful. The Guardian isn’t perfect, but it is different. In the face of the most urgent crises we face as a human family, it consistently displays the courage to declare normalised abuses – of people, privacy and planet – to be wholly unacceptable. And in so doing, it helps so many of us to feel less alone, and to find our full voices as well. That’s why we so badly need the Guardian. On our bedside, yes. But on our screens and on the news stands most of all. Extracted from The Bedside Guardian 2015, a collection of the year’s best Guardian journalism, edited by Malik Meer.

"Perhaps, as never before, we look to the future to deal with the problems of the present. We anticipate future successes, then price them into the challenges of today. Take the recent Paris climate summit, a commitment to reducing global warning to “well below 2C”. As Richard Martin writes in the MIT Technology Review, this figure relies on emerging technologies that are barely proven. Indeed, “barring a major technological advance that is not currently foreseeable, those targets are unreachable”. Even so, we have already anticipated them in cheering the 2C figure. We have placed our faith in something called progress, in the untestable belief that things will always get better.  We do the same with economics. Here progress is called growth. Governments borrow money in the anticipation that the future pie will have grown enough to pay back what has been borrowed, with leftovers. It is not quite true, as David Attenborough has said, that only “madmen and economists” believe in infinite growth. When it comes to the future, capitalism and technology are bosom pals, both assuming that the passage of time, despite the occasional bump, inevitably points us in the direction of continual advance. But what if economic growth is the source of our worsening environmental problem? What if all this ever-increasing activity is precisely what leads us to burn more fuel, thus further polluting the planet. Oh, let’s not worry too much, the purveyors of progress assure us, the future will sort it out. That’s about as reassuring as putting all our trash in the Tardis and emptying it out over our great-grandchildren. Back in 1980, the biologist Barry Commoner ran for president against Ronald Reagan. Next to Reagan’s folksy Christian/capitalist optimism, Commoner didn’t stand a chance. A leftwing humanist, he was one of the first to warn about the environmental dangers of our belief in progress. His celebrated four laws of ecology encapsulated the belief that we live on a finite, limited planet: 1 Everything is connected to everything else; 2 Everything must go somewhere; 3 Nature knows best; 4 There is no such thing as a free lunch. Looking at the technological assumptions behind the Paris agreement from the perspective of these laws, it’s clear there is a problem. For if everything is connected, then a technological intervention in one area may have unintended consequences somewhere else. And if everything must go somewhere, then capturing carbon and pumping it into the ground (or wherever) is just kicking the can down the road. “Nature knows best” is not some romantic fancy – it asserts that the balance of nature has been forged by millions of years of evolution, nature’s own R&D department – and that we tinker with this balance at our peril. But it’s that free lunch that lures us in. And that’s what progress and growth provide – an alibi for excess. Indeed, they turn excess into a virtue, redescribing our overblown appetites as the engine of greater future prosperity. Growth is the philosopher’s stone that offers to turn all things into gold. But, like all belief in magic – ie the belief in a free lunch – it points to a fall. That’s a bit rich, coming from a religious man, I hear the sceptics shout. To which I’d reply that if we think the temptation to believe in magic is something that died with popular religion, then it’s scepticism that has died. Indeed, the belief in progress uncritically assumes one of the basic features of a Christian worldview – that time’s arrow always points towards some future paradise. Hegel’s dialectic did much the same. “Things can only get better,” sang the pop group D:Ream, with that arch progress-monger Prof Brian Cox on keyboards. In the end, this very contemporary faith can’t be disproved by the present. We’ll just have to see how things turn out. As some Christians say, there will be an eschatological verification – or not. As for now, progress is the modern myth that keeps the show on the road and justifies our inflated lifestyles. One more wafer thin mint, anyone? @giles_fraser"

"Tout est dit dans le titre de ce documentaire sur la nature – tout sur ce que les données scientifiques récoltées en Antarctique racontent sur ce qui se passe là-haut dans le ciel ou dans l’air qui nous entoure. C’est l’histoire d’un pionnier de la climatologie, le scientifique Claude Lorius, 83 ans aujourd’hui, dont la longue passion pour l’Antarctique a commencé lorsque, à 23 ans, il s’est enrôlé dans une mission scientifique vers cette région reculée. Lorius a pu prélever dans la glace des échantillons de plus en plus profonds, qui contenaient des traces fossiles de la température de l’air il y a des centaines ou des milliers d’années : les preuves indiquent sans l’ombre d’un doute une augmentation au cours du siècle dernier, et Lorius a réalisé que les émissions de CO2 produites par les hommes étaient en train de réchauffer l’atmosphère.  Il a vécu suffisamment longtemps pour voir ces idées acceptées par tous comme un fait accepté (le film montre un enregistrement remarquable d’un discours de l’ancien Premier ministre britannique Margaret Thatcher aux Nations Unies en 1989 dans lequel elle déclarait que le changement climatique induit par l’homme existait – elle plaidait en faveur de l’énergie nucléaire), bien que contesté par d’agressifs dissidents. Il y a dans ce documentaire quelque chose de personnel et qui va au-delà de l’argumentation. Il est doux et réfléchi, un hymne à sa propre jeunesse et à son idéalisme qui ont été conservés dans la glace."

"There’s an old French saying, “Send a donkey to Paris and it won’t come back any smarter.” It sounds good, but I’m betting it’s wrong, and that the big Paris conference has saved the world from heat death. Too late to save it for me, perhaps, but I’d like to believe that my granddaughter now faces no greater threat to her future than passing out from excitement when opening Christmas presents. As Christmas loomed, I was worn out from giving and taking hints about presents. The book I most wanted was The Silent Deep, concerning the Royal Navy submarine service. It was hard to hint about. You can’t say, “Speaking of submarines, yesterday I saw one in the river. I wish I knew more about submarines.” So I hinted more subtly, dragging the talk around to submarines even when the subject was climate change. When the ocean rose, I suggested, there would be more room for submarines. The hint worked.  Among our family there was not much Christmas conversation about climate change anyway. Any talk on the topic seemed better left to those who draw a salary from talking about it on a permanent basis. Though each big conference seems to establish little beyond the necessity for another big conference, I am impressed by the amount of taxpayers’ money that the developed countries go on handing over to the UN. At that rate, the matter has to be serious. With the fate of the world at stake, one is confident that the money will be spent wisely. Prudent delegates, aware that their frequent-flyer carbon footprint is already questionable, take care not to be thought of as living it up. But sometimes the excitement is too much. During her no doubt vital stay in Paris, Kelly O’Shanassy, CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation, hit the champagne. As every new flute released its bubbles of CO2, she was so thrilled, she took a picture and sent it to her friends. These sparkling Facebook posts, alas, have since been deleted. The credibility of her Foundation (“We work across society to influence urgent, transformative action to deliver lasting change”) trembled for a moment, but soon recovered. The climate change matter is too grave to be injured by mockery, as was proved in Paris when Robert Mugabe spoke of justice for all mankind. When something as bizarre as that happens, you have to believe a cause is good, or die laughing. Yet my foolish doubts aren’t quite assuaged, even though I’m guiltily aware of knowing far too little about the computational intricacies of modelling a non-linear system. “Everything should be made as simple as possible,” Einstein said, “but not simpler.”"
"Temperatures in Melbourne are expected to reach 41C on Saturday as firefighters in Victoria and South Australia prepare for a weekend of severe to extreme fire conditions. Temperatures in Adelaide and Mildura, in northwestern Victoria, were set to reach 42C on Friday, and Melbourne, which was headed for a maximum of 37C, had reached 33.2C by 10am.  “I guess the take-home message is hot,” Chris Godfred, a senior forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne, told Guardian Australia.  Saturday night will be particularly unpleasant in Melbourne, with a minimum overnight temperature of 28C.  “The temperature will not really drop much below 30C for any significant period,” Godfred said. The Andrews government launched an extreme-heat strategy on Thursday, warning that more Victorians died of extreme heat and heat stress than any other natural disaster. The persistently warm weather has also brought dangerous fire conditions. Forecasters in SA and Victoria warn these will worsen on Saturday as gusty winds come into play.  A severe fire danger rating was issued for the eastern parts of SA, from the Flinders Ranges down to the Murray region on Friday, and for southwestern and central Victoria including the Wimmera, Melbourne region, and the areas surrounding Ballarat and Bendigo. The Victorian Country Fire Authority has forecast severe fire conditions for most of the state on Saturday, with extreme fire conditions predicted in the southwest – an upgrade from Thursday’s forecast. A total fire ban has been declared across the state as winds are expected to gust up to 80km an hour. “We have had a baking period across Victoria where the fuels are now as dry as they can be in most parts of the state,” Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley told reporters on Friday. In NSW, a large fire at Williamtown was threatening the outskirts of Newcastle airport on Friday afternoon. Bushfire sends large column of black smoke into sky near Newcastle Airport: https://t.co/PIJidnlQJO #9News pic.twitter.com/sdzBV3zIqY The nearby RAAF base at Williamtown was evacuated, reports said. RAAF base evacuated say locals. #Newcastle. @ Newcastle Airport https://t.co/yC5aLXGANz Firefighters battling a bushfire near the NSW-ACT border were also preparing for severe conditions forecast for the weekend. The blaze at Mount Clear, about 80km south of Canberra, has been burning since Wednesday night and covers 36 hectares. A dozen helicopters and planes, including a C130 Hercules with a 14,000-litre water capacity, as well as 35 firefighters, were trying to extinguish the fire on Friday afternoon. The agency warned severe conditions were forecast for Sunday and could cause the fire to spread to areas of NSW between Michelago and Bredbo. Adelaide, which was declared the hottest city in the world by the United Nations in 2014, is forecast to reach 43C on Saturday, capping a four-day run of 40C-plus temperatures. “I think by the end of this run we would have had four days in a row above 40, which we have not experienced in December before,” the SA duty forecaster Simon Timcke said. “And we will have had six days above 40 in December in total, which we have not had before.” Adelaide Zoo has pulled out the sprinklers and wading pools to help animals cope with the heat. The zoo’s three orangutans have been given garden hoses to play with and the sea lions are snacking on fish ice blocks. The average daily temperature in Adelaide this month has been 31.1C, above the long-term average of 27.2C. But Timcke said he expected that gap to narrow before Christmas. The global average temperature for November, released by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was 0.97C warmer than the long-term average between 1901and 2000 , making it the warmest November on record. In a statement released on Friday, the Climate Council said November was the eighth month to set a new record for global average temperatures in 2015, meaning it was “now virtually certain that 2015 will surpass 2014 as the hottest year globally on record”. “The escalating risks associated with a rapidly warming climate underscore the urgency with which we must act,” the Climate Council’s professor Lesley Hughes said. “The agreement in Paris has given us a framework for how to tackle climate change and now we must get on with the job quickly.” with AAP"

"Island nations have been among the first to recognize that our ocean is in trouble. Fish populations are diminishing, while sea levels are rising. We are rapidly approaching a point of no return. Now, our Pacific island nation, Palau, has enacted landmark legislation closing off 80% of its marine zone to create a vast ocean sanctuary. By safeguarding an area larger than California (about 193,000 square miles), we’ve set aside more of our nation’s waters for full protection than any other country in the world.  For an island nation surrounded by waters still plentiful with fish, this may seem like a bold move. Yet the people of Palau overwhelmingly supported the creation of this ocean refuge. Mindful of how other islands have suffered from the effects of overfishing, Palauans recognized that we needed to go big in order to protect our livelihoods. We want to make sure our ocean, which is often in the path of poachers, remains full of fish to feed our families for generations to come. Science shows that fully protected marine areas can help ameliorate the impacts of a changing climate. These marine reserves increase population sizes and reproduction rates of exploited species. Fully protected areas have shown significantly more biomass than unprotected areas, a benefit that can spill over into other parts of the ocean. By safeguarding areas from further degradation, marine reserves facilitate habitat recovery. That’s why we are one of several island communities, working with The Pew Charitable Trusts’ Global Ocean Legacy campaign, that have acted this year to establish fully protected marine reserves. In October, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet announced her commitment to work with the indigenous Rapa Nui community of Easter Island to create a marine park around the island, following a proposal by the islanders earlier this year to counteract the dramatic declines in their fish stocks. In March, the UK government announced its intent to establish the world’s largest marine reserve around the Pitcairn Islands, following through on a plan submitted by the small island community that lives there. Together with other commitments – such as the September announcement by New Zealand’s prime minister John Key about his government’s intent to create a 239,000-square-mile sanctuary in the Kermadecs – this has been a historic year for the ocean. In fact, 62% of the total ocean area pledged for high protections has been declared just since September of last year, when Barack Obama expanded the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument originally established in 2009 by President George W Bush. But there is still much more to be done. Even with these large commitments, less than 2% of the ocean is highly protected – a far cry from the 30% that, according to marine scientists attending the 2014 World Parks Congress in Sydney, would need protection in order to have a meaningful impact on the health of the ocean. We will not restore the health of our planet without repairing the well-being of the ocean. Our climate is partly driven by our ocean, and marine reserves are one of many important tools that can be used to build the ocean’s resilience against the impacts of climate change. “The past is responsible for today and today is responsible for what tomorrow will be,” my father told me after one particularly productive day fishing more than 40 years ago. Full of a young boy’s pride over all the fish I’d caught, I eagerly awaited his praise. Instead, he offered a reproach and an important life lesson: if we are not careful stewards of our ocean, there will be little of it left to depend on."

"Hillary Clinton has said she is “very sceptical” of the need to drill for oil or gas off the United States’ eastern seaboard, despite the Obama administration putting forward proposals that would open up vast tracts of the ocean for fossil fuel extraction. Clinton’s doubts follow her public opposition to the Keystone oil pipeline, which Obama halted, and Shell’s oil exploration in the Arctic, which the president allowed only for Shell to then scrap its drilling plans.  “I am very sceptical about the need or desire for us to pursue offshore drilling off the coast of South Carolina, and frankly off the coast of other southeast states,” Clinton told South Carolina radio station WGCV-AM. The frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination said the drilling poses risks to the environment and conflicts with the need for renewable energy sources. The department of interior has put out a draft plan that would allow five-year leases for drilling from 2017 in areas off the coast of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. The proposed leases, which cover 104m acres, would mark the first time the US has allowed drilling in the region. The department of interior said the plan, which will be open for public comment early next year, is part of Obama’s “all-of-the-above energy strategy to continue to expand safe and responsible domestic energy production”. Mayors of several coastal towns and environmental groups have spoken out against the proposed drilling, arguing it will harm marine life (such as whales), perpetuate climate change and damage tourism and fishing in coastal communities. The oil and gas industries have claimed new drilling will generate new jobs and investment for the southeast states. Despite her remarks over drilling, Clinton has been challenged by environmental groups over donations from fossil fuel companies. Questioned over the issue by climate activist group 350.org, Clinton said she will “take a look” at claims her campaign has received money from a former ExxonMobil executive and a former lobbyist of TransCanada. “Individuals who might have some connection to whatever industry, I’m not going to do a litmus test on them,” she said. “I don’t think that there’s a lot who support me, but the companies don’t, because they know I’m going to be very adamant about moving us towards clean renewable energy and I think that’s the way it should be. They should know where we’re going and how I’m going to try and get you there.”  The recent Paris climate talks produced an agreement where the US, and more than 190 other countries, vowed to peak fossil fuel use as quickly as possible and phase out its use by the second half of the century. Both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley, Clinton’s challengers for the Democratic nomination, have said they would block any offshore drilling. The Republican candidates are broadly in favour of drilling, although Texas senator Ted Cruz has proposed that coastal states should be able to determine whether they want offshore development. Khalid Pitts, political director of conservation group the Sierra Club, said: “Now that the entire world agreed in Paris on an expiration date for fossil fuels, there are even more reasons to be sceptical of why we’d want to risk a catastrophic oil spill for the sake of dirty energy that’s on its way out.  “With so little to gain and so much to lose for our coasts, public health and climate, we’re much better off just keeping these dirty fuels in the ground.”"
"Two years ago, the south of England experienced its wettest period for almost 250 years as tidal surges battered East Anglia, threatening the country’s most productive farmland. Flimsy silt and clay flood defences, at least 50 years old and fast deteriorating, proved no match for the forces of nature. Although damaging sea water seeped into some of the nation’s finest acres, disaster was avoided – just. “But we were inches away from something terrible,” said a senior director of Norfolk county council as he viewed what seemed a pending catastrophe. We had been warned. Monitoring the effectiveness of the Environment Agency – the body responsible for managing flood risk from main rivers and the sea – the National Audit Office (NAO) recalled a year ago that these extreme conditions tested the country’s resilience to adverse weather and its consequences. Coastal flooding exacerbated by climate change, it noted, is one of the highest-priority risks on the UK’s national risk register of civil emergencies. As an island that once prided itself as a model of farming efficiency, Britain – particularly England – is vulnerable. Some of our best land in Norfolk, Suffolk and Lincolnshire lies at or below sea level. Much of it was drained by Dutch engineers through the centuries, with a final stretch near Kings Lynn – a six-mile water channel – only completed in 1950. Yet successive governments have been in denial about the impact of climate change, rising sea levels, and increasingly volatile weather patterns on these productive acres, literally the bread, cereal and veg bowl of Britain. Ministers cannot plead ignorance. Four years before the NAO report, around the time of the 2010 general election, a lengthy study from the Government Office for Science, Foresight Land Use Futures, warned that 57% of our best (grade 1) land and 13% of grade 2 occupied flood plains. Not for nothing did it describe these golden acres as “an important asset in terms of national food security”. Today we produce 62% of our own food, down since our 1984 peak of 78%. Alarmed by government complacency, the National Farmers’ Union calculated earlier this year that the country has the potential to reach 85% self-sufficiency, with higher productivity, more investment in research and development and, of course, greater emphasis on flood defences to withstand future tidal surges and rising sea levels. Do nothing, says the NFU, and domestic food production will assuredly fall below 50%. It is, after all, only 62 years since a high spring tide, driven by a severe storm, engulfed the east coast of England as water rose to six metres above normal sea level, overwhelming part of East Anglia. More than 300 people lost their lives. The Foresight report should have been a wake-up call, with its warning that either governments provide high levels of flood protection to resist rising coastal threats, or they abandon large tracts to the sea; presciently, it even cautioned of the threat from storm surges back in 2010. But what happened? One senior member of a lead expert group behind the report told me they had been “leant on” by the then coalition government to water down some of their recommendations. They were seen as too controversial and expensive. One inescapable conclusion emerged from interviews I undertook in 2014-15 for my book Whose Land is Our Land with farmers, landowners and council leaders charged with co-ordinating flood defences: the indifference of a government seemingly in denial, wedded to a complex cost-benefit analysis that ostensibly puts the defence of property (one in six homes were at risk of flooding in England, even before the current deluge in the north) ahead of farmland protection. What we have lacked is an informed debate on the pressures facing our land – increasing demand for food, energy, water and housing – when we should be adapting to and mitigating the impact of climate change. But that means planning ahead, prioritising resources and, yes, borrowing as a nation to invest in and safeguard our future – unlikely at a time when the very concept of planning, still less long-term investment, has become a pejorative term. As things stand, as Amyas Morse, head of the NAO observed a year ago, the Environment Agency will face difficult decisions “about whether to continue maintaining [flood defence assets] in some areas or let them lapse”."
"A former student of mine, Luke Hacker formed an organization called Simply Love, which works in Haiti to support educational and agricultural growth in the country. Through this group, I was introduced to an agricultural expert who relayed this personal story about environmental impacts on the island.  The story below is from Zacharie Bien-Aime, Agronomist, Local Technique Agent for the United Nations.  Since I was a child, I was taught that there are two rainy seasons. One extends from April to June and the other from October to November. As Haitian agriculture is dependent on rain for irrigation, farmers begin with soil preparation during the month of February to be ready to plant when the first rainfall begins in April. For some time, I have observed changes in Haiti’s climate. Extreme weather conditions alternate between severe drought in the dry season and high rainfall during the wet season. In northwest Haiti where I work, we have just undergone four months of consecutive drought. Peasant plantations have lost most of their harvest because the crops cannot survive without rainfall. The rivers and natural water sources are dry resulting in a food crisis in the local communities.  For more than a month we have observed the presence of seaweed along the coast and experts claim that this is the consequence of climate change. The presence of this seaweed has serious repercussions for the fishing and tourist economy of these regions and also can present concerns to the health of the local population. All of this is the consequence of environmental degradation. The Haitian people don’t have access to other affordable energy resources so businesses and families use primarily charcoal. This has led to severe deforestation across the entire country. According to the records available in the archives of the Ministry of Environment, the vegetation coverage in Haiti is less than a 1.5% as of 2015. In the agricultural sector of Haiti, climate change has caused a yield reduction of our principal crops of rice and maize. Also acceleration of soil erosion under heavy rain has led to a decrease in the fertility and productivity of the soil. Regarding water resources, climate change has increased the risk of flooding and prolonged drought. Longer periods of droughts cause an increase in food insecurity and many other conflicts where consistent use of water is needed. Given these obvious impacts to agricultural resources and natural water resources, it is important to make the issue of climate change a national priority to be included in the political agenda of policy makers and NGOs in Haiti. Climate change is no longer a myth; it is a reality that we will have to deal with for many decades. Coming on the heels of the agreement in Paris, stories like this reinforce the need to be committed to taking action on climate change. We cannot stop the climate from changing but we have the capacity to slow down those changes and to make them far more manageable than they otherwise would be. Climate change affects us all, from the wealthiest nations to those that struggle most with subsistence economies. But we all benefit when we can take collective action. "
"American leadership in the world “is not just a matter of us bombing somebody”, Barack Obama insisted on Friday as he reeled off a year of achievements from a global climate deal to the Iran nuclear pact. During an end-of-year press conference at the White House, the president also claimed steady progress in the war against Islamic State and expressed optimism about working with Congress to reform the criminal justice system, but declined to rule out the idea of going it alone to close the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay.  Perhaps with an eye on the judgment of history, he set out a vision for America’s role in the world very different from the country that invaded Iraq in a hugely divisive war under President George W Bush. “As I look back on this year, one thing I see is that so much of our steady, persistent work over the years is paying off for the American people in big, tangible ways,” Obama said. Domestically he cited a record streak of job growth, healthcare prices growing at their lowest level in five decades under the Affordable Care Act, legalisation of gay marriage in all 50 states and a rewrite of the No Child Left Behind law to invest in early childhood education. A clean energy industry boom, he continued, culminated in the recent Paris agreement on climate change that was “only possible because of American leadership”. Obama also listed the Iran nuclear deal, moves to normalise relations with Cuba, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and success in virtually wiping out the Ebola virus in west Africa. “At each juncture what we’ve said is that American strength, and American exceptionalism, is not just a matter of us bombing somebody,” he told reporters in the west wing.  “More often, it’s a matter of us convening, setting the agenda, pointing other nations in a direction that’s good for everybody and good for US interests, engaging in painstaking diplomacy, leading by example. “And sometimes the results don’t come overnight, they don’t come the following day, but they come, and this year what you really saw was that steady, persistent leadership on many initiatives that I began when I first came into office.” Looking ahead to his final year, as a presidential election to find his successor looms ever larger, Obama promised he would not be a lame-duck president but push all the way to maximise his remaining year in office.  “I said at the beginning of this year that interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter and we are only halfway through. In 2016, I’m going to leave it all out on the field. Wherever there’s an opportunity, I’m going to take it.” It is an agenda that includes keeping his longstanding promise to shut down the detention camp at Guantánamo Bay, which he regards as a powerful “magnet” for jihadi recruitment that helps perpetuate the myth of a war between America and Islam, as well as being a waste of taxpayer millions. The number of detainees should fall below a hundred early next year, he said. Obama would present a plan to Congress and not assume, as is widely predicted, that it will be rebuffed. But nor did he deny that he might explore the legality of bypassing Congress if that is what it takes. “We will wait until Congress has definitively said no to a well thought-out plan with numbers attached to it before we say anything definitive about my executive authority here.” Earlier on Friday, Congress passed a major bipartisan budget package that staved off a potential government shutdown and extended tax cuts for both families and businesses. The White House has indicated that Obama will sign it. The president noted optimistically that by averting a funding crisis for the next nine months, Congress had cleared a path for cooperation with him next year, following years of bitter deadlock. “Congress and I have a long runway to get some things done for the American people,” he said. “There has been sincere, serious negotiations and efforts by Democrats and Republicans to create a criminal justice system that is more fair, more even-handed, more proportionate and is smarter about how we reduce crime.” His remarks about criminal justice came as he commuted the sentences of 95 people serving long jail terms, mostly for drugs offences. He pointed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact as another area ripe for cooperation. Obama said he had called new House speaker Paul Ryan to thank him for “orderly negotiations”, describing the Republican as professional and straightforward: “Kudos to him.” Later on Friday, Obama was to depart for San Bernardino, California, where he planned to meet with families of the 14 victims of the recent mass shooting. He then will fly to Hawaii, where he will spend two weeks on vacation with his wife and daughters in what has become a family Christmas tradition. Amid widespread fears about terrorism and extremists, Obama took a swipe against a reporter questioning his strategy for defeating Isis in Iraq and Syria. “There’s only so much bombing you can do,” he said. “We’re going to defeat Isil and we’re going to do so by systematically squeezing them, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing, taking out their leadership, taking out their forces, taking out their infrastructure. We’re seeing steady progress in many of these areas, so they’re going to be on the run.” He also affirmed his longstanding position that Syrian president Bashar Assad must leave power for Syria to resolve its civil war, even though his administration has recently said it could accept an unspecified transition period during which Assad stayed. Obama plans to return to the White House in early January to begin a final year in office that will be increasingly overshadowed by the 2016 presidential campaign.  His final State of the Union address on 12 January will be his last great set-piece moment to lay out his remaining must-dos and attempt to frame the achievements since taking office in 2008. Another attempt to force through gun controls seems likely to be among his top priorities.  Republican frontrunner Donald Trump did not figure in the press conference but Obama predicted: “I think I will have a Democratic successor. And I will campaign very hard to make that happen.”  He finished by wishing journalists merry Christmas and heading off to a White House film screening for invited families and children who lost loved ones in war. “OK everybody, I gotta get to Star Wars,” he smiled.  Moments later, White House spokesman Josh Earnest arrived in the briefing room accompanied by R2D2 and a couple of Storm Troopers – the most unlikely projection of American power witnessed in the west wing in 2015."

"It’s been a busy few months for big global discussions on social and environmental issues. From the launch of the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs); to a new vision from the EU for a circular economy; negotiations in Paris for the COP21 climate agreement; to a European refugee crisis triggered in part by climatic impacts in the Middle East. But as much as we may welcome the sustained attention to sustainability challenges paid by global leaders, companies and NGOs must not forget that many of the solutions we need to create a more sustainable world reside at a very local level. We may participate in a hyper-connected digital world but our lives are still grounded in locality.  The places we live, work, learn, play and relax in are for most people still defined in terms of a few square miles. Our interests and wanderings may be informed by the entire world, but at the end of the day most people return to a place called home. Indeed in a world that can seem overwhelmingly busy, complex and sometimes frightening that sense of home becomes more important than ever. More than 35 million customers tell us that they want a better future. They want governments and businesses to take a lead and do the heavy lifting. They are willing to participate in creating this better future, particularly for their children, but they largely want to make a difference in places and with people that are relevant to them: in their neighbourhood, their school, their sports club, with their friends, neighbours, colleagues or fellow sports fans.  For global businesses like ours, these are the communities that surround our shops, our factories and our offices; the communities where our customers and employees live. We must link our global voice with our local presence. We saw this trend start a few years ago and responded to it. Today every M&S store has a direct relationship with its local community. Every store supports a local charity of the year, from cleaning local beaches and canals to offering work placements for unemployed folk who live nearby. The response from our customers and employees to this has been fantastic. They feel empowered and engaged, which in turn motivates them to deliver great outcomes for the community. We see higher employee motivation and customer trust. To deliver this we work with a new digital platform called Neighbourly, which enables our stores to identify micro community groups local to them that would benefit from support. Neighbourly in turn lets us share stories with our customers in these communities. Each of our stores is now using Neighbourly to connect with local food charities so they can donate unsold food at the end of the day to prevent it becoming waste.  At the UN climate talks in Paris in December we helped launch an initiative that is helping millennials call on their own university and sports teams to commit to use clean energy. This works with the grain of people’s lives, creating clusters of shared interest and proximity.  Why are these initiatives working so well for a company that has stores worldwide and is committed to working on big issues, including climate change, overfishing, human rights and animal welfare? Local feels more sustainable for consumers: food grown in a region local to you, carrier bag charges that help fund the town’s best-known charity, green walls outside your store attracting wildlife, employees volunteering in your community and sponsorship of the local sports team. It is where your customers see the difference your business makes and it simply feels real and tangible for your employees. Smart data is already allowing promotions, rewards, partnerships and opportunities to be tailored to individual customers. And as businesses get smarter with this data, sustainability professionals have the opportunity to reach individuals by donating to their favourite charity, improving their favourite products and helping them take action where it matters most to them.  It’s no longer good enough to lead in sustainability on a global platform. You have to get it right on a macro and micro level – at UN climate talks and on the high street. Those that do will be rewarded with brand loyalty, a huge advantage in a world where trust and loyalty is increasingly difficult to win and retain. There is one last compelling need to build customer engagement through local action. As the Earth’s resources become more finite we must start to shift to business models that are circular, low carbon and enhance wellbeing. These sustainable business models will need a deeper, richer connection with customers and this will only come from a local, personal connection with them and their lives."
"Switzerland has experienced its warmest December since the country that founded winter tourism began keeping records 150 years ago.  Clear skies and dry ground have seen the Alpine nation end the year 3.4C above the long-term historical average for December, a climatologist for the federal office of meteorology and climatology (MeteoSwiss) said on Monday.   “There’s no doubt about it,” Stephan Bader said. “It’s the warmest December in our recorded measurements dating back to 1864 – clearly. And it’s especially pronounced at higher altitudes.”  The dry warmth and slopes bereft of snow have hurt resort owners and ski lift operators, who are already contending with Switzerland’s strong currency discouraging foreign visitors.  MeteoSwiss earlier this month said it expected 2015 to break the annual record for the third time in just a handful of years.  Globally, this year will be the warmest on record and 2016 could be even warmer due to the El Niño weather pattern, the World Meteorological Organization said last month. It warned that inaction on climate change could see global average temperatures rise by 6C or more. It came as climate scientists in France said that this year’s El Niño was the strongest ever measured, surpassing the one in 1997-98, both in terms of ocean surface temperature – up by more than 3C (5.4F) - and the surface area affected. “It is probably the most powerful in the last 100 years,” said Jerome Lecou, a climate expert at the French weather service Meteo France, noting that accurate measurements have only existed since the mid-20th century. As was true in 1998, this year’s super El Nino will have contributed to making 2015 the warmest on record, worldwide. But the reverse may also be true, with climate change boosting the power of cyclical El Nino events. “If you add the background global warming to natural weather phenomena, there’s a tendency to break records left and right,” Le Treut told AFP. "
"In the final meeting of the Paris talks on climate change on Saturday night, the debating chamber was full and the atmosphere tense. Ministers from 196 countries sat behind their country nameplates, aides flocking them, with observers packed into the overflowing hall.   John Kerry, the US secretary of state, talked animatedly with his officials, while China’s foreign minister Xie Zhenhua wore a troubled look. They had been waiting in this hall for nearly two hours. The French hosts had trooped in to take their seats on the stage, ready to applaud on schedule at 5.30pm – but it was now after 7pm, and the platform was deserted.  After two weeks of fraught negotiations, was something going badly wrong? Then at 7.16pm, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, returned abruptly to the stage, flanked by high-ranking UN officials. The last-minute compromises had been resolved, he said. And suddenly they were all on their feet. Fabius brought down the green-topped gavel, a symbol of UN talks, and announced that a Paris agreement had been signed. The delegates were clapping, cheering and whistling wildly, embracing and weeping. Even the normally reserved economist Lord Stern was whooping. Outside the hall, a “Mexican wave” of standing ovations rippled across the conference centre as news reached participants gathered around screens outside for the translation into their own language. The 50,000 people who attended the summit had been waiting for this moment, through marathon negotiating sessions and sleepless nights.  The contrast with the last global attempt to resolve climate change, at Copenhagen in 2009, which collapsed into chaos and recriminations, could not have been greater. In a city recently hit by terrorist attacks that left 130 dead and scores more critically injured, collective will had prevailed. Paris produced an agreement hailed as “historic, durable and ambitious”. Developed and developing countries alike are required to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels, of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. Countries affected by climate-related disasters will gain urgent aid. Like any international compromise, it is not perfect: the caps on emissions are still too loose, likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C above pre-industrial levels, breaching the 2C threshold that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the effects – droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises – are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Poor countries are also concerned that the money provided to them will not be nearly enough to protect them. Not all of the agreement is legally binding, so future governments of the signatory countries could yet renege on their commitments. These flaws may shadow the future of climate change action, but on Saturday night they took second place. As the news spread through the world, the reaction from civil society groups, governments and businesses, was overwhelmingly positive.  Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International, summed up the mood: “It sometimes seems that the countries of the UN can unite on nothing, but nearly 200 countries have come together and agreed a deal. Today, the human race has joined in a common cause. The Paris agreement is only one step on a long road and there are parts of it that frustrate, that disappoint me, but it is progress. The deal alone won’t dig us out of the hole that we’re in, but it makes the sides less steep.” Even as delegates celebrated at the conference’s end, there was a palpable sense of relief from the exhausted French hosts. At many points in this fortnight of marathon negotiating sessions, it looked as if a deal might be beyond reach. That it ended in success was a tribute in part to their diligence and efficiency and the efforts of the UN. “France has brought openness and experience in diplomacy, and mutual respect to these talks,” said Stern, one of the world’s leading climate economists. “They have taken great care to make everyone listened to, that they were consulted. There was a great sense of openness, of professional diplomacy, and skill.” Saturday night was the culmination not only of a fortnight of talks, but of more than 23 years of international attempts under the UN to forge collective action on this global problem. Since 1992, all of the world’s governments had been pledging to take measures that would avoid dangerous warming. Those efforts were marked by discord and failure, the refusal of the biggest emitters to take part, ineffective agreements and ignored treaties. For these reasons, the Paris talks were widely seen as make-or-break for the UN process. If they failed, collective global efforts would be at an end and the world would be left without a just and robust means of tackling climate change.  The threat was catastrophic and the stakes could scarcely be higher. Without urgent action, warming was predicted to reach unprecedented levels, of as much as 5C above current temperatures – a level that would see large swathes of the globe rendered virtually uninhabitable. What is more, infrastructure built today – coal-fired power plants, transport networks, buildings – that entail high carbon emissions will still be operating decades into the future, giving the world a narrow window in which to change the direction of our economies. “This was the last chance,” said Miguel Arias Canete, Europe’s climate chief. “And we took it.” The terrorist attacks on Paris raised questions about whether the talks would go ahead at all but François Hollande, the French president, insisted that they must and, in a show of unity, more than 150 heads of state landed in the French capital for the opening day. Barack Obama hailed the conference as “an act of defiance” in the face of terrorism. Immediately after the attacks, the first concern was for security. A planned march through central Paris by protesters was cancelled, though a version of it did go ahead as the talks opened and was marred by clashes with police and a small number of protesters, and arrests. Security for the conference was stepped up, with police and army patrolling the immediate area and transport routes nearby shut down for two days. This was the biggest ever gathering of world leaders, whose presence was needed to empower their negotiators to move out of positions entrenched for more than 20 years. When they arrived, a series of key meetings were held, with Obama seeing Xi Jinping of China, Narendra Modi of India and representatives from the least developed countries. Hollande concentrated on forging links with the developing world. Angela Merkel, in a private meeting with Vladimir Putin, secured his pledge that Russia would not stand in the way of a deal. Behind the conference centre gates, French delegates were marshalling their diplomatic forces. They had carefully arranged the conference centre so that their part of the compound – behind barriers staffed by UN guards and secret service officers, unlike the rest of the delegations which were open to access – was directly above the UN’s offices.  Fabius, from his office, could be with Christiana Figueres, the UN climate change chief, for a face-to-face chat within seconds. His fellow minister, Ségolène Royal, was just along the corridor, flanked with the offices of ambassadors and high-ranking officials. Within the buzzing control room, screens relayed pictures of what was happening in each of the conference rooms scattered around the compound and 24 hour news from French and international channels. About 60 French officials were there. In preparation for the all-night sessions that began almost immediately the conference started, a room with 20 cubicled beds was waiting for exhausted officials to refresh themselves with a few snatched moments of sleep. Procedurally, the French took great care. They instituted a series of talks known as “confessionals”. These were intended as confidential places where delegates could, in the words of one French official, “speak from the heart” to listening French diplomats, with no holds barred and an assurance of privacy. There were also the absurdly named “informal informals”, in which a small group of delegates from various countries were charged with tackling a small piece of disputed text often as little as a paragraph at a time. Their task was to try to remove the infamous “square brackets” denoting areas of disagreement on the text and they met in small huddles around the conference centre, squatting on the floor in corridors or standing around a smart phone. After these measures were still not producing enough progress, Fabius turned to “indabas” – by Zulu tradition, these are groups of elders convened to try to discuss disputes in communities. They were first tried out at the Durban climate talks in South Africa, in 2011, and under France’s plan they consisted of groups of up to 80 delegates at a time gathered to thrash out the remaining disagreements. While the French could draft in experienced diplomats on every side, some of the smallest countries had difficulty in keeping up with the meetings – many happened in parallel and they did not have the personnel to attend them all.  One way of getting around that was the formation of a “coalition of high ambition”, which was announced with three days to Friday’s deadline. Forged by small island states – a key figure was Tony de Brum of the Marshall Islands – and the EU, it was joined by many of the least developed countries, adding up to more than 100 nations. They could then negotiate together, with an agreed common interest. Before the end, this coalition had been joined by the US, Canada and Australia. It was hailed by Europe’s climate and energy commissioner Miguel Cañete as a key factor in the end agreement. And yet with three days of the conference to go, it looked as if all of these efforts might yet come to nothing. On the second Wednesday of the talks, the French produced a second iteration of the core text, reducing the number of brackets from more than 300 to fewer than 40. They were hopeful that this could be almost the end – and it needed to be in order to have the legal “scrubbers” and linguistic experts assess the text and ensure it was in line with international law and accurate in all languages. But it soon became apparent that things were not going to plan. As countries examined the draft agreement, ministers started raising concerns. On Wednesday afternoon, leading delegations trooped one by one into Fabius’ personal office: Edna Molewa of South Africa, Xie Zhenhua of China, John Kerry of the US, Julie Bishop of Australia.  For South Africa, issues over “loss and damage” emerged – for developed countries, this meant the question of whether developing countries should be entitled to special aid in the event of climate-related disasters; for the developing, it meant compensation and liability, which the US would never agree to. For China, a key sticking point was differentiation – the concept that developing countries have less responsibility for climate change. For the US, some parts of the deal could not be legally binding in order to pass Congress. Fabius sought to allay their concerns and find a compromise. At 8pm, he convened a new plenary session, at which all countries were able to speak. It carried on through the night. At this point, it was clear that further efforts were needed. There followed a rapid round of telephone diplomacy. Obama spoke personally to the Chinese leader. Hollande picked up the phone to as many of his counterparts across the world as he could manage. Finally, after two more days of fraught negotiation, a consensus emerged. None of the major countries wanted to be seen as wrecking a deal that had come so close. All could agree that they wanted an agreement and all made compromises. The EU backed down on having the intended emissions cuts, agreed at a national level, to be legally binding; the US accepted language on “loss and damage”; China and India agreed that an aspiration of holding warming to 1.5C could be included. For the diplomats involved, the efforts were exhausting. The talks took a personal toll. In the months before the conference, Laurence Tubiana, appointed as special ambassador on climate change, played a key role in liaising with developing and developed countries. Then disaster struck. A week before the COP was scheduled to begin, she suffered a sudden sharp pain. It was acute appendicitis, necessitating emergency surgery. Within days, however, she had resumed her key role. When the deal was signed, she was on the podium, receiving hugs from Ban Ki-moon, Figueres, Fabius and Hollande, a recognition of the sacrifices she had made. All of these efforts came to a head in the final crucial days. On Saturday morning, a new draft text was prepared. Fabius assembled the delegates and told them to have lunch while they waited for it to be translated. That afternoon, they examined the text and nearly all agreed that, with minor reservations, they could accept it. The final meeting was scheduled for 5.30pm. As for the last-minute hitch that kept delegates waiting in the hall for two hours? A matter of minor aspects of wording, including the translation of a few terms and the placement of a comma. It was rectified, apologies given, and the jubilation could begin. It is easy to forget what an extraordinary event these UN talks were. The UNFCCC is one of the last remaining forums in the world where every country, however small, is represented on the same basis and has equal say with the biggest economies. Most modern diplomacy carries on in small, self-selected groups dominated by richer countries – the G7, the G20, the OECD, Opec – but all 196 states have a seat and a say at the UNFCCC. Agreement can only be accepted by consensus. If this makes for an unwieldy and frustrating process, it is also a fair one. The poorest countries of the world, so often left out of international consideration, are those which have done least to create climate change, but will suffer the most from it. Only at the UN are they heard."

"The government has decided to cut subsidies to householders installing rooftop solar panels by 65% just days after agreeing to move swiftly to a low-carbon energy future at the climate change conference in Paris. An impact assessment study by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) admits the move could wipe out up to 18,700 of the industry’s 32,000 jobs.   A second subsidy scheme known as the renewables obligation has also been cut for small-scale and large projects angering both the solar industry and environmentalists, who dismissed the moves as “huge and misguided”. The government argues it needs to protect wider energy bills from the rising impact of renewable energy subsidies and that this justifies paying rooftop solar installers 4.39p per kilowatt hour from February instead of the existing 12.47p. The new figure means Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, has rowed back from an original proposal to slash subsidies by 87% to 1.63p after a storm of criticism. “My priority is to ensure energy bills for hardworking families and businesses are kept as low as possible whilst ensuring there is a sensible level of support for low carbon technologies that represent value for money,” she said. “We have to get the balance right and I am clear that subsidies should be temporary, not part of a permanent business model. When the cost of technologies come down, so should the consumer-funded support.” The government said there would be a £100m cap on spending by 2019. The shadow energy and climate secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the solar cuts were misguided, especially after ministers had just forked out £175m to diesel farm developers. “These short-sighted cuts will place big limits on our solar industry and lead to thousands of job losses. These cuts stand in stark contrast to the generous handouts ministers recently announced to dirty diesel generators. At a time when energy bills are a big concern it makes no sense to limit one of the cheapest forms of clean energy.” Friends of the Earth said it was disappointing that less than a week after the UK government agreed a deal in Paris to keep global temperature rises to well below 2 degrees, the government had shown its true colours – “and they’re certainly not green”. Alasdair Cameron, FoE’s renewable energy campaigner, said: “These huge, misguided cuts to UK solar are a massive blow for jobs and the economy, and further undermine the government’s already tarnished credibility on tackling climate change.” The Solar Trade Association had warned that more than 6,000 jobs have been lost, with solar installers such as the Mark Group closing down ahead of likely cuts. Greenpeace said the government was moving in the wrong direction. “Bowing to pressure from the public and businesses, the government has swapped a blunt axe for a sharp scalpel, but it’s still cutting in the wrong place,” said Barbara Stoll.  “In just one month, one nuclear plant at Hinkley would swallow up four years’ worth of subsidies for the whole solar sector. Why are ministers signing a blank cheque for expensive, outdated nuclear power while pinching pennies for an energy source on the cusp of a massive investment boom? This makes no economic sense and will only put up bills in the long run.  “With costs falling, demand rising, and post-Paris momentum growing, the UK solar sector will see off the government’s attacks. The question is how many more jobs, investments, and business opportunities are we wasting because of George Osborne’s incoherent policies. “If the government is as committed as it claims to be to the Paris climate deal, then solar is one of the cheapest and safest ways for the UK to deliver on it.” Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said he was particularly concerned the government was cutting the “grandfathering” commitment from the renewables Obligation, which ensures that any subsidy levels are protected for the lifetime of a project.  “Closing the renewables obligation for solar is not in the interests of billpayers when solar is soon to become the cheapest low-carbon energy source. Following the Paris agreement, this needs rethinking. “Removing the grandfathering guarantee makes no sense for solar – it’s the thin end of the wedge. If you invest £1m of capital into a solar project today, in 20 years’ time you have still invested £1m – it is a sunk cost. You cannot have the level of support changing over the lifetime of a project as investors won’t take the risk.”"
"One of the biggest transformative signals that 195 governments sent to energy markets via the Paris agreement at the weekend was a goal for the global warming ceiling to be set well below 2C, and as low as 1.5C if possible. The scientific advice given to governments explains why. At 2C, coastal plains and island nations are submerged, food and clean water supplies shrivel, and social cohesion comes under threat as a consequence.  Scientific advisers also spell out carbon budgets for governments in stark terms these days. 2C of global warming – long the ceiling governments have talked of aiming at, in a quarter-century of negotiations without a comprehensive agreement until now – involves a “bubble” of unburnable carbon that amounts to 60-80% of fossil fuel reserves, depending on the risk tolerance assumed. Having any chance of 1.5C means the world can only burn a fraction of existing fossil fuel reserves. The coal, oil and gas that would have been burned under past plans must be replaced by the zero net carbon emissions regime that the Paris agreement targets within just a few decades. The world might have to be 100% renewable-powered as soon as 2030. All this might sound like green dreaming until one considers that Apple intends to be mass-producing solar-charged electric vehicles less than five years from now, each of them a micropower plant, doubtless communicating with each other to trade energy in ways most current energy incumbency executives do not have the cultural bandwidth to imagine. Or that in Paris 1,000 cities committed to becoming 100% renewable-powered. Or that many huge corporations have pledged to become carbon neutral or 100% renewable-powered across their global operations: Unilever by 2030, and Ikea as early as 2020. There are many other such examples of energy transition emerging, at speed, in my book chronicling all this drama: The Winning of the Carbon War. This momentum by non-state actors has done much to create the space for state actors to perform as well as they did in Paris. Encouraging as all this is, some state actors currently have policies diametrically opposed to the Paris agreement. The UK is at or near the top of this list. Virtually every sector of green energy is nursing wounds – all deep, some potentially fatal – as a result of chancellor George Osborne’s post-election preference for incumbency technologies. Thousands of solar jobs have been lost due to recent ambush cuts in subsidy. Electric vehicles are now taxed at the same level as Porsches. The Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change talk of the strictures of austerity, and deploy a blizzard of obfuscatory detail in trying to defend their actions. But I am told by unimpeachable sources in Whitehall and Westminster what is really going on. Osborne and his acolytes are conducting a scorched earth assault on the green energy sector in order to clear space for investment in oil, gas and nuclear. In so doing they are exhibiting an Orwellian inability to be embarrassed by the size of the subsidies they intend to throw at their preferred incumbents, or the incongruence with the Paris agreement to which they are party. Each and every shale oil or gas fracking site will receive remarkable largesse from the public purse if Osborne gets his way. The intended Hinkley Point nuclear plant will be the most expensive power plant in the world, so costly that workers from its intended operator EDF have pleaded with their bosses not to build it, for fear it will bankrupt the company. Even before the UK begins attempts to exploit shale in earnest, government fossil fuel subsidies greatly exceed renewables subsidies. The UK is the only G7 country where fossil fuel subsidies are growing. Had Ben Elton invented all this when he was writing environmental comedy thrillers in the 1990s, we would have laughed and told him to come up with something more realistic. But that was then. As things stand, this government is making real life stranger than fiction. The perfidity of the course they are on would be hilarious if it was not so serious. One head of state or government after another talked of existential threats from climate change in Paris. The governor of the Bank of England spoke of a threat to global capital markets. The message from the man responsible for the stability of the financial system in the UK couldn’t have been clearer. Those who invest in further expansion of coal, oil and gas – knowing what there is to know – are wilfully threatening the stability of the global economy. The corollary of “less than 2C” is clear. No new coal mines. No new oil fields. No new fracking, either for oil or gas. There is only room for one great global race as the fossil fuel era runs down – to copy Apple and Ikea."
"Homo sapiens has become so dominant a force shaping the properties of the biosphere that scientists now refer to the past two centuries as the Anthropocene Epoch – the age of the human. This role comes with a huge responsibility; one that, it seems, we have lived up to in the climate deal recently agreed in Paris. We are an infant species, evolving perhaps 150,000 years ago in Africa. For most of our short existence, we were nomadic hunter-gatherers, carrying our possessions while in search of food and anything useful. Compared to the vast herds of mammals in parts of the world, human numbers were small, our technology simple and our ecological impact readily absorbed by the biosphere.  Very suddenly, in evolutionary terms, we’ve exploded into a major global force, altering the air, water, soil and species diversity on a geological scale. We are the most numerous mammal on Earth, empowered by technological innovation, demanding ever more consumer items to satisfy our “wants” instead of our “needs”, driven by corporate hunger for constantly increasing profit in a globalized economy. Climate change caused by human generation of greenhouse gases is just one of the degradations of our most fundamental needs caused by our shortsighted actions. Pollution of water, soil and air, destruction of habitat, species extinction and ocean degradation are a few of the others. When living organisms appeared on Earth perhaps four billion years ago, the properties of the planet were very different. Life actually modified them – plants removed carbon while creating an oxygen-rich atmosphere; life created soil from inert dust, clay and sand (that’s why Matt Damon in the film The Martian had to add poop to grow potatoes on the sterile planet); life helped weather rocks and mountains and life explored ever more and different elements of the globe as species evolved. But all this involved numerous species and vast amounts of time. Our access to clean air, water, soil and photosynthesis is a gift from the web of living things around the planet. When we understand that all humans share these fundamental realities and that we all have a responsibility to ensure their availability for everyone, then everything is possible. Take the atmosphere, for example. It is critical to the survival and wellbeing of all life on the planet and belongs to no one. Air can’t be shoehorned into priorities created by humanity’s economic and political demands. Maintaining the natural chemistry of the air must be the highest priority of all societies because we are the only species that knows that, and we alone can deliberately change our behavior and actions accordingly. Deprived of air for three minutes, we die. Forced to breathe polluted air, we sicken. Lacking water for four to six days, we die. Drinking contaminated water, we sicken. We can survive without food for four to six weeks but eventually succumb. Every bit of energy in our bodies that allows us to move, grow and reproduce is sunlight captured by photosynthesis. Our most fundamental needs for survival and wellbeing must be protected above all else, otherwise we will constantly elevate our parochial interests above the protection of our life-support systems. In Paris, humanity has demonstrated that the “age of the human” won’t necessarily lead to an age of destruction. There is hope – as long as we remember that our dominance on Earth comes with great responsibility."
"Grants to subsidise the purchase of electric and other low-emission cars are to be extended by at least two years, to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy greener vehicles. The plug-in car grant, which gives buyers up to £4,500 towards the cleanest new cars, will now run until March 2018, the Department for Transport announced on Thursday.   The extension, which will bring the total funding to £400m, will boost the UK’s rapidly growing electric vehicle market and make some contribution towards improving air quality.  The announcement came as the government faced criticism from environmental groups for the pace of its plan for compliance with EU legal limits for NOx emissions, which are mainly caused by road transport. The grant, introduced in 2011 and due to expire in early 2016, has already seen about 50,000 low emission vehicles – mainly electric but also hybrid and hydrogen powered – sold at a substantial discount to consumers, and the extension should treble the numbers of such cars on Britain’s roads. The revised grant scheme will focus inducements on zero-emissions vehicles and no longer subsidise the most expensive hybrids.  Manufacturers welcomed the news. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Manufacturers are offering increasing numbers of these vehicles – but a consistently applied incentive regime is still needed over the coming years to help consumers adopt these ground-breaking technologies.  “The changes to the regime will need effective management and SMMT looks forward to working with government to ensure the planning needs of manufacturers and consumers – both fleet and private – are met.” Jim Wright, managing director of Nissan GB, which has invested £420m in developing its best-selling electric car, the Leaf, said: “This announcement, together with ongoing infrastructure developments, should see the growth and wider deployment of this technology continue.” A further £500 grant will be available from March for owners of ultra-low emission vehicles who install a dedicated charge point at their home, covering roughly half the average cost. The transport minister, Andrew Jones, said: “We are determined to keep Britain at the forefront of the technology, increasing our support for plug-in vehicles to £600m over the next five years to cut emissions, create jobs and support our cutting-edge industries.” Vehicles with a zero-emission range of more than 70 miles, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, will get a full £4,500 grant, but hybrids costing under £60,000 will receive £2,500. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “It’s good news that they’ve extended the grant but it’s not nearly enough. There is no proper road map to get us to where we need to be in terms of ultra-low emission vehicles.” "

"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2014-15, a report released with obscure timing by the Australian government has shown.  The December 2015 quarterly update of carbon emissions, which covers the period to the end of June 2015, was released with no fanfare on Christmas Eve. The quarterly update forms part of Australia’s international reporting of its emissions It shows that Australia’s emissions increased by 0.8% last financial year compared with the previous one, and 1.3% when land use and deforestation were taken into account. Australia generated 549.3 mega-tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2014-15. The Australian government promised at the Paris climate talks to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030 and will likely come under pressure to do more after the world agreed to work to keep the global temperature rise to 2C. The report points to increases in electricity, stationary energy (excluding electricity), transport, fugitive emissions, and industrial processes and product use. However it says there was a steep decline – 3.8% – in emissions from agriculture.  Emissions from electricity generation rose 3% in 2014-15, despite demand from consumers remaining flat in 2014-15. Power generation from black coal increased by 1.4%, and brown coal generation increased by 9.7%.  Electricity from wind and other renewables (excluding small-scale solar) increased 12.2% on the previous 12 months, but hydroelectric generation fell by 30.3%. Electricity generation was the largest source of emissions, accounting for 34% in 2014-15. Prof Will Steffen from the Climate Council told Fairfax Media the December figures showed Australia needed to urgently wean itself off coal to meet its global commitments. “If we’re putting more into the atmosphere than the year before, than we’re heading in the wrong direction,” he said. “We’ve got to drop emissions fast. We’ve got to get out of fossil fuels very quickly, coal first – there can no new coalmines anywhere in the world.”"

"The Arctic experienced record air temperatures and a new low in peak ice extent during 2015, with scientists warning that climate change is having “profound effects” on the entire marine ecosystem and the indigenous communities that rely upon it. The latest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) report card on the state of the Arctic revealed the annual average air temperature was 1.3C (2.3F) above the long-term average – the highest since modern records began in 1900. In some parts of the icy region, the temperature exceeded 3C (5.4F) above the average, taken from 1981 to 2010.  This record heat has been accompanied by diminishing ice. The Arctic Ocean reached its peak ice cover on 25 February – a full 15 days earlier than the long-term average and the lowest extent recorded since records began in 1979. The minimum ice cover, which occurred on 11 September, was the fourth smallest in area on record. More than 50% of Greenland’s huge ice sheet experienced melting in 2015, with 22 of the 45 widest and fastest-flowing glaciers shrinking in comparison to their 2014 extent.  Not only is the ice winnowing away, it is becoming younger – Noaa’s analysis of satellite data shows that 70% of the ice pack in March was composed of first-year ice, with just 3% of the ice older than four years. This means the amount of new, thinner ice has doubled since the 1980s and is more vulnerable to melting. The report card – compiled by 72 scientists from 11 countries – noted sharp variations in conditions in the northern part of the Arctic compared to its southern portion. The melting season was 30-40 days longer than the long-term average in the north but slightly below average in the south, suggesting that changes to the jet stream, causing colder air to whip across the southern part of the Arctic, are having an impact. Noaa said warming in the Arctic is occurring at twice the rate of anywhere else in the world – a 2.9C (5.2F) average increase over the past century – and that it is certain climate change, driven by the release of greenhouse gases, is the cause. “There is a close association between air temperature and the amount of sea ice we see, so if we reduce the temperature globally it looks like it will stabilize the Arctic,” said Dr James Overland, oceanographer at Noaa. “The next generation may see an ice-free summer but hopefully their decedents will see more ice layering later on in the century.” Overland said if the world hits the 2C (3.6F) warming limit agreed by nations in the recent Paris climate talks, the Arctic will experience a 4C (7.2F) to 5C (9F) increase in temperature by 2050. The Chukchi Sea, by Alaska, is warming the fastest of any of the Arctic waters while the overall minimum ice extent has slumped by 13.4% a decade, on average.  The changes in the Arctic are also causing “major challenges” for the indigenous communities in the region, according to Rick Spinrad, Noaa’s chief scientist. Warmer-water fish such as cod are moving north, displacing Arctic species, while an increase in sunlight reaching the upper layers of the ocean triggered widespread blooms of algae in the Bering Sea, between Alaska and Russia, in 2015. This altered environment is causing severe problems for walruses, with unprecedented “haul outs” of the animals occurring in 2015. The large marine mammals traditionally use sea ice for mating and nurturing young but in recent years have been forced to congregate on land in north-west Alaska. This behaviour has led to stampedes that have killed calves and hampered walruses’ ability to find food. “Females now have to make 110-mile (177km) treks for food. We just haven’t seen haul outs in these numbers before,” said Kit Kovacs, biodiversity research program leader at the Norwegian Polar Institute. “I don’t think there is much uncertainty here. We have a dramatic situation in the north Pacific with walruses.”"
"India still plans to double coal output by 2020 and rely on the resource for decades afterwards, a senior official said on Monday, days after rich and poor countries agreed in Paris to curb carbon emissions that cause global warming. India, the world’s third-largest carbon emitter, is dependent on coal for about two-thirds of its energy needs and has pledged to mine more of the fuel to power its resource-hungry economy while also promising to increase clean energy generation. “The environment is non-negotiable and we are extremely careful about it,” Anil Swarup, the top bureaucrat in the coal ministry, told Reuters. “(But) our dependence on coal will continue. There are no other alternatives available.”  While India has plans to add 30 times more solar-powered generation capacity by 2022, there were limitations to clean energy and coal would remain the most efficient energy source for decades, he said.  Minister for power, coal and renewable energy, Piyush Goyal, said India’s contribution to global greenhouse gases emissions was just 2.5% with 17% of the world’s population, while developed countries contributed a fifth of emissions with just 5% of the world’s population.  While contributing to growth of renewable energy, energy conservation & efficiency, we'll make sure our development process not get hampered Even though many international lenders are turning their backs on financing new coal projects in favour of gas and renewable energy, India should have few difficulties in financing dozens more new mines.  State-owned producer Coal India, for example, has enough internal cash resources to drive more production, Swarup said. At the global climate summit in Paris, nations forged a landmark agreement on Saturday to set the course for an historic transformation of the world’s fossil fuel-driven economy within decades, including eliminating net man-made greenhouse gas emissions.  Environmentalists worry that despite India’s commitment to renewable energy, its rising use of coal at a time when many Western nations are rejecting the dirty fossil fuel will hamper the world’s fight against climate change.  India, which is targeting to more than double coal output to 1.5bn tonnes this decade, says coal provides the cheapest energy for rapid industrialisation that would lift millions out of poverty. "
"Ask the average person to name a living fossil, the chances are they will think of the coelacanth, or perhaps horseshoe crabs. However, plant examples of living fossils are all around us, surviving from long before the rise of today’s dominant plants. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, are the basis of our food chain and include grasses and broad-leaved trees. But seed plants such as conifers and cycads, and even ancient spore producers such as ferns and clubmosses, continue to earn a living in environments where they are not squeezed out by highly efficient, flowering newcomers. One of the most well-known plant survivors is Ginkgo biloba – the only living species of its group, which is first recognised in the fossil record nearly 300 million years ago. By any given definition of “living fossil” – and there are many – Gingko biloba fits the bill. It is a long-lived, deciduous tree with distinctive fan-shaped leaves. Its common name is the maidenhair tree, and the etymology of this name doesn’t get discussed much. This is surprising given that, along with the maidenhair fern, which has similarly shaped leaves, they are the only species I know of that are named after a pubic triangle. Ginkgo biloba is everywhere in the modern world, if you know where to look. It is highly tolerant of pollution, and so it is a favourite with city planners. It is also hugely significant in Japanese culture. Indeed, the renowned botanist Sir Peter Crane has written an entire book in praise of the Ginkgo which intertwines its cultural and scientific history. Extracts from Ginkgo leaves are also popular as a dietary supplement, taken to treat dementia and other disorders. Hundreds of species of the genus Ginkgo are recognised from leaf fossils throughout the Mesozoic era, but quantifying its true diversity in the past is difficult. This comes down to a fundamental problem with studying fossil plants: you rarely find all of the organs of a plant preserved together. Reproductive structures such as cones and flowers are often key to identifying a plant, but in most cases they are simply not present. For most specimens of Ginkgo-like fossils, we only have leaves. A glance in any autumn gutter will show you that most of the time, leaves readily decompose. However, in the right conditions, the waxy outer layer of a leaf, known as the cuticle, can be preserved in exquisite detail and bears the details of the epidermal cells it once coated. If we look at the preserved cuticle using a microscope, we can see an ancient leaf on a cellular scale. Some of the most beautiful examples can be found in the Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire coast, where leaves called Ginkgoites huttoni can be found in sandstone slabs laid down in floodplains 170 million years ago. There’s even evidence for insect mimicry of Ginkgo leaves in the Jurassic. This is all fascinating and aesthetically pleasing – but (as we are increasingly asked by research funders) what good does studying these fossils do? These ancient survivors are actually very useful. Because preserved cuticles show us the leaf epidermal cells, we can see the arrangement and density of stomata. Stomata are the tiny pores in leaves that allow gaseous exchange. Plants also lose water vapour through these pores, and have sophisticated systems which dynamically control their opening and closing. Studying stomata in fossil cuticles can tell us a great deal about the atmosphere in the past, and how the atmosphere changes over geological time. In order to say sensible things about what fossil stomata tell us, we need some way of calibrating this data with a living equivalent. And sure enough, Ginkgo biloba has been grown in experimental conditions such as increased levels of carbon dioxide, and the leaves compared to fossils from geological periods thought to have different atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Stomatal densities go down as carbon dioxide concentrations go up. Experimental work on Ginkgo and other living fossils such as Metasequoia glyptostroboides (dawn redwood) and Wollemia nobilis (the inaccurately named Wollemi pine) has built up a large body of evidence for species-specific responses to carbon dioxide concentrations. Newer models of carbon dioxide concentration over the last half a billion years use a universal equation for leaf gas exchange for fossil leaves, and forego the need for a modern equivalent for each species. This doesn’t mean that living fossils such as Ginkgo are now redundant in this work, but rather we need to study a wider range of living fossils to make sure such models are accurate across more types of plant. This will only become more important as anthropogenic climate change pushes our atmosphere into uncharted territory (for humans, anyway).

"Leaders from around the world have hailed the agreement struck in Paris on climate change, but some analysts and environmentalists are less sure about its impact. Bloomberg New Energy Finance, an independent analysis group, delivered a downbeat appraisal of the outcome, saying it was not the breakthrough many had claimed.  Richard Chatterton, head of climate policy at the group, which provides analysis used by investors, said: “The deal reached in Paris is weak, containing no concrete increase in the level of ambition to address climate change, and simply urges countries to do more over time.” He said the most notable outcome was the mechanism for five-yearly reviews of carbon targets, and agreement on the principle that countries should provide transparent accounts of how they reach those goals. But even these were “accompanied by language that could allow countries to maintain the status quo for years to come”. He also criticised the target of achieving net-zero emissions. “An emissions reduction goal, for a peak year in global emissions or for language on decarbonisation or emissions neutrality have all failed to make it into the final agreement,” he said. “What countries have settled for is an ambiguous aim,” to balance emissions with carbon sinks. But he said it was unclear what this would mean in terms of real emissions reductions. “This agreement will disappoint many observers who were hoping for a step change in global ambition [on climate change]. It is no surprise, however, that the reality falls far short of such expectations,” Chatterton concluded. Other observers were also wary. Oxfam called the deal “a mixed bag”, arguing that governments had failed to put humanity’s interests above “narrowly defined and short-term interests”, and that the lack of a pathway to keep temperature rises below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels left that goal unclear and vulnerable people in danger. Craig Bennett, UK chief of Friends of the Earth, was cautious. While he acknowledged “the spirit of Paris” in bringing countries together was positive and could be built upon, he said in key aspects it was inadequate. “We have got to understand the limits of Paris,” he said. “It is certainly not sufficient [as an agreement]. If you judge it by the science, it’s clearly not strong enough. It’s also clearly not strong enough for poor countries.” But investors should take it as a signal, he added. “Does this give investors confidence? Probably, yes. It’s all very woolly [in language and aims] but the direction of travel is clear – to low-carbon.” Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for ActionAid, said the poor had been excluded: “What we needed out of Paris was a deal that put the poorest people first. What we have been presented with doesn’t go far enough to improve the fragile existence of millions around the world.” Bill McKibben, activist and co-founder of 350.org, said the deal was in danger of dragging out the transition away from fossil fuels for far too long to maintain global temperatures at a safe level, leaving open the possibility that “endless climate damage will be done”.  He urged activists to target the fossil fuels industries to prevent that. His views were echoed by David Turnbull, campaigns director of Oil Change International, who described the agreement as “a lowest common denominator of global politics, not the aspirations of the global community”. There was also concern from special interest groups. Clodagh Byrne, adviser at HelpAge International, warned that older people were left out, despite the fact that they are more vulnerable to the effects of high temperatures, being more likely to die in heatwaves than younger adults, and at greater risk of death in the event of extreme weather, such as floods or storms, as they were less able to escape. “Given the disproportionate impact that climate change is already having on older people, it is alarming that no specific consideration has been given to them in the text, even within the list of those whose rights should be specifically taken into account,” she said."

"I interviewed the American climate activist and writer Bill McKibben five years ago. I liked the essays he wrote in the New York Review of Books, and persuaded an editor that his books about environmental science and politics merited a profile. I had been a candidate for the Green party in local elections in London earlier that year, and with hindsight I think I was wondering, what next? McKibben knew far more about green issues than I did (his first book about climate change, The End of Nature, came out in 1989). So I asked him: if a person is really worried about global warming, what should they do? I may also have mentioned lightbulbs. As in: should this worried person change all the lightbulbs in their home to energy-saving ones first, or give up flying? I left the question out of the published article, though I admitted feeling inspired by McKibben in a paragraph that now makes me cringe. I’ll come back to that cringe, but what he said, very clearly, is that a mass movement of people is the only way to beat “the raw power of the fossil fuel industry”.  I believed him then. I still do, and the Guardian agrees: Keep it in the ground, the campaign launched this year by outgoing editor Alan Rusbridger and continued by Katharine Viner, is all about trying to mobilise our readership against coal, oil and gas – and in favour of renewable energy. But just how mobilised, or politically active, should one aim to be? I feel chastened writing this, even a bit low, because the truth is that although I understand catastrophic climate change to be a certainty, I haven’t been doing a great deal. I went on last month’s climate march in London, and discussed going to Paris for a weekend of street protests during the UN summit. I’ve written some more interviews with environmentalists, such as New Zealand actor and activist Lucy Lawless, aka Xena the Warrior Princess, because I thought they deserved the attention. I marvelled at the heroism of the Arctic 30, imprisoned after they attempted to board an oil rig in 2013, and donated to Greenpeace. But I’m not an environment reporter and I write about other things as well. Meanwhile, in my own time (of which I have more than many people because I don’t work full time), I helped a Green party councillor get elected in 2014, which was brilliant, not least because the result was so close that every hour’s canvassing felt worth it. But since then, much of the time when I’m not working or with my family has been taken up by the non-party-political community council I helped set up in my area. I said I would come back to that cringe – I’ll call it the climate cringe. The truth is it’s impossible not to cringe from the coming disasters – by which I mean floods, droughts and heatwaves, melting ice caps, sea-level rises that will drown parts of our world and turns millions of people into refugees. This will happen. It is happening. But the embarrassment I feel when I reread myself vowing to be greener is something else. You pious twit, says a voice in my head. This is another form of climate cringe – the cringe that inhibits us even from trying, and shames us for efforts that are bound to be inadequate and riddled with contradictions (call yourself an environmentalist, and you drive a car/eat meat/have four children!). The problem is that we are all – in the rich west – addicted to carbon and, like all addicts, we are ambivalent about anyone else giving up. Hydrocarbons (coal, oil, gas) formed from rotting vegetation and laid down over millions of years, have made us richer than our cave-dwelling ancestors could have imagined. Now carbon dioxide pollution threatens to cause irreparable harm, and may kill many of us off – the poorest people, who haven’t even benefited from the hydrocarbon boom. Such planetary-level injustice is hard to comprehend. But in our own daily lives, our addiction gives us so much pleasure (cheap flights! fast cars! plastic toys!) that we can’t bear to imagine life without it – and when others try to cut down, we are torn between support and irritation. If I were 25, or didn’t have young children, I hope I’d be up for some direct action. At 44, I’m looking forward to next year’s London elections. Our city needs a green mayor. To anyone else – anyone, that is, who feels they are in a position to do anything – what can I say? It’s helpful to shrink your carbon footprint, but political engagement (which means pressure groups and local initiatives as well as Westminster) matters more. Read up, decide: do you believe the science or not? Then panic, but don’t cringe or despair. We have too much to lose, and still some time."
"Could the fate of the world hang on a single word? Could the whole Paris climate agreement have been scuppered at the very last minute? History will record a diplomatic triumph but it may skate over events that took place in the dying moments when all countries believed they had a deal. Here’s what happened at the fortnight-long climate negotiations in Paris. Following a third all-night negotiating session, all countries on Saturday morning had been forced to compromise their positions by the French presidency.   The US, China and India, as the three biggest polluters, had all accepted an ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels ; the US and Europe had accepted some responsibility for damage done by climate change; developing countries had agreed to a dilution of the original climate convention, and had given way on financing, liability and the dates when there would have to be revisions. But when, at 1.30pm local time, the French presidency presented its final “take it or leave it” Paris agreement text , adoption of the text should have been a formality. It soon became clear that something had gone very wrong in the text. Rumours swirled, and it was later confirmed by US secretary of state, John Kerry, that the US had objected to Article 4.4 on page 21 of the 31-page final agreement. US government lawyers had found, it was said to their horror, that they had unwittingly approved a vital word which could make the difference between rich countries being legally obliged to cut emissions rather than just having to try to: “shall” rather than “should”. Here is global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright on the significance of the two words:  This article requires developed countries to undertake economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets but developing countries to only “continue to enhance” their mitigation efforts. In the draft that was presented for adoption there were two critical words - “shall” and “should”. The expression “shall” applied to the developed countries’ obligation and the word “should” applied to the developing countries’ obligation. There was a crisis.  According to some, it had always been intended that both rich and poor countries should have the same obligation, namely “should”, not “shall”. This was of huge importance to the US especially which, it said, would have had difficulty signing up to any legally binding obligation to implement its reduction target. But others claimed that the US was objecting unfairly at the last possible moment to the developing countries’ most important “red line” .  The whole summit, indeed, had turned on the argument that rich countries, which had admitted causing climate change, should take the lead cutting emissions. The principle was enshrined in the overarching, legally binding UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and developing countries had throughout the summit insisted it be reflected in every part of the Paris text. It was their red line.  What we do know is that the US delegation then approached the French presidency, claiming a mistake had been made.  It seems that the presidency advised them to object from the floor of the plenary if they wanted a change in the wording, but warned that this would re-open the whole meeting to other countries’ objections and possibly take two or more days to resolve, if at all. The US immediately understood that if it did so, it would not only be blamed for holding up the meeting , but indeed for jeopardising the whole agreement because many other countries would then object to bits of the agreement that they did not like. The G77 and other developing countries were then consulted about the dilemma, and told the presidency that this was a red line that they could not cross either because it diluted the whole UN climate convention. [In a nutshell, they said “shall should not become should. Should shall become should, all should think again”.] At the very last minute, the French came up with a diplomatic solution. It was agreed that there had been a “typographical error” which was put down to an anonymous sleep-deprived negotiating team transferring lines from one draft text to another. The embarrassed French presidency, it seems, agreed that the amendment change of “shall” to “should” could be dealt with as a “technical error”. Todd Stern: It's a ""very interesting mystery"" why 'should' changed to 'shall'. ""It doesn't happen on auto-correct"" Neither the French presidency, the US government, or UN would comment this week. America’s top climate negotiator, Todd Stern, described it as “very interesting mystery.” But some observers have seen it as the US managing to avoid taking action on climate and getting its own way over the heads of the poor. Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, the DR of Congo’s lead envoy, told ClimateHome, a news site which closely follows the UN negotiation: “It’s a typo we will refer to many times because frankly speaking, nobody’s buying that.” Professor Gurdial Singh Nijar, the Malaysian spokesman for the Like Minded Developing Countries (Lmdc) group, which includes India, China and Indonesia, told leading southern NGO Third World Network that he was present throughout the crisis and saw what happened after the final text was shown to them by the French.  We [the LMDC] found the text a little convoluted, but we felt we could consider it. We agreed with it and so did the Group of 77 and China. We felt there was balance and our red lines were somewhat preserved. Then when we went to the hall, we were shocked to find that the US was objecting to Article 4.4. They came up with this incredulous thing that it was a mistake.  The EU approached us and said that there is a problem and asked us if we could change the ‘shall’ to ‘should’. When we asked them why, they responded that the Americans had told them that if the word ‘shall’ was introduced, the Congress would not pass it. We said that we have done so many things to get the US on board and they were diluting everything. In this case they were diluting something which was our super-red line.  Just before 7.30pm, the shall/should fiasco was passed off as undetected error in the text, and the meeting moved to adopt the Paris agreement. “I see the room, I see the reaction is positive, I hear no objection. The Paris climate accord is adopted,” declared the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, adding: “It’s a small gavel but I think it can do a great job.” Was it a stitch-up? America’s great escape? Or a genuine error? Either way, the world had a historic, universal climate change deal. "
"“I have seen first hand what can happen if pollution is not controlled,” says Aniruddha Sharma. The Indian entrepreneur was born in Bhopal, where his parents’ wedding took place three days before the catastrophic chemical leak in 1984 that killed thousands and injured many more. All of Sharma’s extended family were in the city for the wedding celebration, he says: “Everybody was affected.” Sharma says the experience is the source of his drive to tackle another great environmental crisis: climate change. Sharma’s company, Carbon Clean Solutions, is backed by £3.4m UK government funding, has a laboratory at Imperial College London and aims to make capturing carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels affordable. The company’s technology – a special chemical – is currently being evaluated at the world’s biggest carbon capture test site in Norway and by companies in Europe, India and the US. Making carbon capture and storage (CCS) work is seen as vital by both the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UK’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. Halting global warming without CCS will be twice as costly, they say. But the UK’s Conservative government recently cancelled its £1bn CCS demonstration competition, despite an election manifesto pledge backing it and shortly before a global agreement on climate change was agreed in Paris.  On Wednesday, Angus MacNeil, the chair of the energy and climate change select committee of MPs criticised the decision as a false economy, calling it “penny wise, pound foolish”. Shadow energy minister, Barry Gardiner, described it as “environmental and economic insanity”. David Cameron, who often previously cited the £1bn CCS plan as evidence of his government’s green credentials, explained the U-turn to MPs on Wednesday. “In government you have to make tough choices. You have to make decisions about technology that works and technology that is not working [and] we made the right choice.” Plenty of people disagree, however. Leading figures, including former Environment Agency chair Lord Chris Smith, said this week the government’s new dash for gas and in particular its fast-tracking of fracking makes little sense without CCS to capture and bury emissions. “You will have to apply CCS to gas plants to have a hope in hell of having a decarbonised electricity supply by 2040,” says Prof Colin Snape, a CCS expert at the University of Nottingham. He told the Guardian: “Without CCS making a significant contribution, it is going to make hitting any kind of climate change target very hard.” Sharma agrees: “It will be very challenging, especially for industry, to survive without CCS.” He laments the government’s ditching of the £1bn CCS competition: “From the macro point of view, it was not very good news for our company. When something like this happens, investor confidence is shaken.” But Sharma remains confident CCS is needed and that his company’s technology will prove Cameron wrong by delivering affordable CCS quickly. “It is now without question, following the Paris climate change agreement, that CCS is going to be necessary,” he says. “The UK government’s decision to cancel the £1bn competition will not stop the development of CCS. Our technology can stand on its own feet with proper customer funding.” Carbon dioxide has been scrubbed from natural gas streams for decades using amines, but these are corrosive, polluting and use a lot of energy. An alternative is to use salts, but these are slow to react. Sharma’s company is in the process of patenting its chemical, which combines advantages of both and he says will cut costs to as little as £30 per tonne of CO2 captured. In September, the company raised another £3.4m from UK investors, led by Eldon Capital Management. “The technology significantly improves the economics of CO2 capture,” says Jan Petzel of Eldon Capital. Prof Snape also says the company’s approach is promising. “It probably represents the best you can do with first generation technology,” he says. “But you will need to see it working at realistic scale to convince everyone.” Second generation CCS technologies include membranes and solids currently being investigated in laboratories. Sharma anticipates signing the company’s first commercial deal in the UK in 2016. In contrast, energy secretary Amber Rudd told MPs on Wednesday: “CCS will be necessary in the long-term to deliver on a really low carbon future. That could be in the 2050s, 2060s, 2070s. Now for the UK, it was not the right time to commit to £1bn.”"
"Barack Obama will defend the Paris climate change agreement and forge ahead on his environmental agenda until his final days in the White House, according to analysts. And there is very little Obama’s opponents in Congress can do to stop him – unless they win the elections and install a Republican in the White House in 2017. Republicans’ initial attempts to derail the Paris agreement fell flat, with Congress failing to deliver on threats to cut off climate aid to developing countries or block the deal. But Obama still has a fight on his hands – from lawsuits and new resolutions intended to undermine the Paris agreement – during an election year which could give an unusual degree of attention to climate change.  After an epic year in 2015, with the Paris climate agreement in December and the final release of rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants in August, Obama is expected to keep pushing his climate agenda in 2016, racing to roll out new regulations on the oil and gas industry before leaving office. “My sense is that when it comes to the climate issue, broadly, the president will look for every opportunity to advance his agenda,” said David Sandalow, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, and a former Obama Administration official. “He has been relentless on this issue and with results.” Before the Paris summit, Republicans in Congress vowed repeatedly to overturn Obama’s plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants, moving two resolutions to strike down the rules. As 150 leaders converged on Paris for the start of the global warming negotiations, congressional Republicans threatened repeatedly to undo the agreement in Congress, and to block climate aid Obama had pledged to developing countries. The US earlier this year committed $3bn to help developing countries cut carbon emissions and move to cleaner fuels. The Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz told the Senate science committee there was no evidence climate change was occurring. But by 18 December, when Obama left for his vacation in Hawaii, Republicans had failed to make good on any of their threats. The president used his veto to block the resolutions against his clean power plant rules, and the budget deal passed by Congress included a first tranche of $500m Obama had promised for the Green Climate Fund. The budget deal also extended tax credits for the solar and wind industries – which were seen as a significant boost for the renewable energy sector. That leaves the Republicans with diminishing options to try to block Obama’s climate plan – unless, of course, they take the White House. “Any country can withdraw from an international agreement,” Sandalow said. “That would hurt the US image and interests around the world. We saw 150 heads of state go to Paris and not a single one of them contested the science on climate change,” he went on. “The global consensus on the need to address this issue is very strong.” But it is not shared by current Republican leaders. In 2016, one key preoccupation for the White House will be defending the Environmental Protection Agency rules cutting power plant carbon emissions from lawsuits brought by 27 states, industries and other groups. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit will decide in early 2016 whether to halt the rules, while the lawsuits go ahead. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress say they will seek to block the US from committing to a climate fund for developing countries in 2017 – a key underpinning of the Paris agreement.   Administration officials said Obama would look to use his executive powers as president once again to cut US climate pollution in line with US commitments under the Paris agreement. The agreement for the first time commits all countries to curb climate pollution, with a goal of limiting temperature rise to well below 2C and achieving net-zero emissions by the second half of the century. Under the deal, Obama promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. But the US needs to undertake further cuts if it is to have any chance of meeting that target.  The White House adviser Brian Deese suggested officials were exploring new rules to plug methane leaks at oil and gas refineries and ageing natural gas pipelines. Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, and 80 times more powerful a warming agent in the short term. Deese told a seminar hosted by the New Republic that officials were looking at expanding rules cutting methane from frack sites. “If we want to get to that goal, we have to do more on the policy side,” Deese said. The administration is expected to expand energy efficiency rules. There is also a strong push from billionaire activist Tom Steyer and others to get candidates talking about climate change on the campaign trail. “This will be the first election where climate change is one of the top two or three issues. I believe that is very possible,” said Paul Bledsoe, a consultant who served in Bill Clinton’s administration. “It is up to Hillary Clinton, if she is the nominee, to make it an issue, particularly in key states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire. There are a couple of states where climate change could become a significant issue.”  The idea, according to campaigners, is to keep climate change on the public stage, and so avoid a repeat of the situation that doomed the last international climate change agreement: the 1997 Kyoto protocol. George W Bush formally withdrew from the Kyoto protocol, undermining the treaty. Obama administration officials believe they are on firmer ground with the Paris agreement. Unlike Kyoto, the Paris deal requires all countries to cut climate pollution – and not just industrialised countries – removing one of the main objections of Republicans. In the last three years, Obama has also worked hard to reach agreements with China, India, Brazil and Mexico to cut their emissions. Obama invested enormous political capital in the agreement, telephoning the leaders of China, India, France, Brazil and other countries in the final hours to seal the deal. The White House is expected to continue pursuing climate initiatives with rising economies. Obama is also counting on business leaders, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg who have pledged to invest billions to promote green energy.  Those efforts are unlikely to deter Republicans in Congress. So far, however, Republicans have been unable to deliver on their threats to defeat Obama’s climate plan or derail the Paris climate talks.  By his year-end news conference, Obama was confident his climate agenda would survive once he leaves the White House. “Do I think there’s going to be a lot of noise and campaigning next year about how we’re going stop Paris in its tracks?” he asked. “There will probably be a lot of noise like that. Do I actually think that two years from now, three years from now, even Republican members of Congress, are going to look at it and say that’s a smart thing to do? I don’t think they will.” "

"Farmer Pieter Kruger stands smiling on a large weir built on a river in the Baviaanskloof area that provides water to South Africa’s fifth largest city. Tall and lean, he looks out over a gathering pool, delighted at the first time it has filled up enough to have the water roll over his shoes.  “The actual restoration work happens here on this farm, but the benefits also flow to the users downstream, so in the long run everyone is going to benefit from this.”   Land degradation and desertification is now affecting 168 countries around the world, according to the UN, but many here believe there is hope. Living Lands, an international not-for-profit organisation, started working here in 2008 to bring together the users and beneficiaries of this water catchment; government, communities and farmers like Kruger. Together they have already planted more than 3.7 million trees to try to stop land degradation and restore the degraded water catchment system.  One of the things that makes the project remarkable is funding from South Africa’s biggest agricultural insurer Santam. Rather than just assessing risk and charging premiums to match it, they are actively trying to reduce risk. “This is a business imperative for us, the likelihood of our sustainability is highly dependent on this,” said Ray-Ann Sedres, head of integrated sustainability at Santam. She feels that projects such as this are crucial for the company to survive in a warming world. All this is good news for the 1.4 million people in nearby Port Elizabeth who have been suffering under water restrictions off and on since 2007.  The city has doubled in size since 1997, while increasing water delivery to under-serviced areas. Combined with climate change these activities have brewed a perfect storm.  In the 20th century farmers here were subsidised to run as many sheep as they could and cut water channels into the land to aid runoff. These practices wiped out the subtropical thicket, a forest which retained water during periods of low rainfall. Compounding that, South African scientists say the changing climate now causes rain to fall in more isolated storms, which in turn cause even more runoff.  This “double whammy” is typical of degraded lands around the world, according to conservation group IUCN, which recently highlighted the restoration project as a successful way to regenerate landscapes.  The approach developed relationships between everyone who has a stake in the water, the land and the jobs that depend upon it, and in turn started restoring the landscape, planting trees, creating weirs and funding it through public and private finance gathered from users.  Sedres accepts that Santam’s expertise doesn’t lie in planting trees. “The strength of our business does not lie in land rehabilitation, it lies in the fact that we understand risk.”  According to Sedres, this risk analysis is being used by municipalities and other partners to help with disaster planning and the communal effort to halt land degradation. Santam is also helping drive partnerships with local and national government in order to address climate change issues and put disaster mitigation strategies in place before they happen.  “Santam knows that if we don’t make sure that there is water downstream where business sits, then business stops and business continuity claims arise,” she said.  Support is flowing not only from the South African government but from green economy investors and large international supporters, such as Commonland, who partnered with Living Lands to bring international impact investors, big business in Port Elizabeth and the insurance industry to the table.  Pieter Kruger believes that his farm lost a total of 1,000 cubic metres of topsoil per hectare until restoration began. The new weir, together with reforestation, helps slow the runoff that swept over his land.   “It’s so lovely, you know, to see the water.” He smiles broadly as he looks out over the pool. “This is just the beginning of the whole restoration process, but we have turned things around here for the better.” • Allianceearth.org paid for Barbee’s transport and accommodation."
"The port town of Lyttelton in New Zealand is best known for its beautiful landscapes and as a major trade gateway to the South Island. What visitors to the town might not know is that this is also the home of New Zealand’s first time bank, which has helped the local community through some very tough times. Time banking is a form of complementary currency that uses time rather than money as the medium of exchange. Every hour of service given earns a time bank member one credit and all hours earned are valued equally, meaning one hour of babysitting, for example, earns the same as one hour of legal help or gardening. Lyttelton’s time bank was started in 2005 by Margaret Jefferies, who learned about time banking the year before at Bard College, New York, when she was seeking out a complementary currency to build social capacity in her home town. Over the following years, participants built up a local marketplace of members’ skills and abilities, creating a publicly available community skills inventory. In September 2010, this inventory became invaluable when the first in a series of huge earthquakes hit the city of Christchurch and nearby Lyttelton. Residential, retail and hospitality properties were devastated, and roads, retaining walls, power, waterlines, hotels, hospitals and nature reserves were badly damaged.  In response, the time bank and its then-400 or so members (today that number is closer to 800) led a widespread effort that tapped into their local skills marketplace. By that point the time bank had already logged over 30,000 traded hours in total and an average of 400 hours were being traded each month. The latter more than doubled in the weeks following the earthquake. Thanks to its extensive knowledge of the community, its pre-existing infrastructure and its action-oriented web of connections, Lyttelton time bank became a significant route through which essential information and valuable resources for the town could flow. This ranged from notifications about amenities such as water availability and the opening times for supermarkets and chemists, to offers of home visits, food, accommodation and emotional support. Just as important was the role that the time bank played when the acute crises ended – when emergency personnel left the community and it was left to face the long-term challenge of rebuilding.  The time bank provided crucial support for the Lyttelton community, such as helping with home repairs or finding rental accommodation when houses were deemed uninhabitable. It also became adept at fostering partnerships with other community organisations such as Volcano Radio, the town’s local radio station, and Lyttelton health centre to harness resources to complete these initiatives. According to writer, academic and TimeBanks USA board member Chris Gray, “exchanging skills and knowledge fosters relationships of trust and reciprocity.” As well as time banks strengthening communities’ ability to act in times of need, Lyttelton’s has helped further the town’s culture of caring where people spontaneously stepped forward to take care of their fellow community members and the community at large. The economy of the future will increasingly have to deal with ageing populations and rising sea levels, tsunamis, storms, fires and natural disasters. To address these challenges, communities will need to mobilise their people and resources to respond collectively to challenges that affect the community at large. Likewise, the public sector will need to nurture an organic infrastructure that can mobilise entire neighbourhoods, organise streams of disconnected volunteers and generate feedback loops to inform investments by government and the private sector. Our concept of public infrastructure will have to undergo transformation to establish these networks, sustain connectivity, expand trust and harness information systems.  How to accomplish that? Around the world, time banks may already be pointing the way. The driving engine of time banking is a kind of pay-it-forward reciprocity that sustains a shared sense of community commitment and community capacity. Time banks do not spring up overnight. They take time to grow. But they do provide a special kind of infrastructure, one that can inventory, activate and enhance community assets, and generate new social networks."

"The US military and armed forces of countries around the world will no longer be automatically exempted from emissions-cutting obligations under the UN Paris climate deal, the Guardian has learned. Although the US never ratified the Kyoto protocol, it won an opt-out from having to fully report or act on its armed forces’ greenhouse gas emissions, which was then double-locked by a House national defence authorisation bill in 1999.  Under the Paris agreement, countries would not be obliged to cut their military emissions but, equally, there would be no automatic exemption for them either. US officials privately say that the deal adopted on Saturday has no provisions covering military compliance one way or another, leaving decisions up to nation states as to which national sectors should make emissions cuts before 2030. “If we’re going to win on climate we have to make sure we are counting carbon completely, not exempting different things like military emissions because it is politically inconvenient to count them,” Stephen Kretzmann, Oil Change International’s director told the Guardian. “The atmosphere certainly counts the carbon from the military, therefore we must as well.” The US military is widely thought to be the world’s biggest institutional consumer of crude oil, but its emissions reporting exemptions mean it is hard to be sure. According to Department of Defence figures, the US army emitted more than 70m tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year in 2014. But the figure omits facilities including hundreds of military bases overseas, as well as equipment and vehicles. Activities including intelligence work, law enforcement, emergency response, tactical fleets and areas classified as national security interests are also exempted from reporting obligations. The US military requested the original Kyoto exemption on national security grounds. While the Obama administration is not looking to the military for emissions cuts before 2030, US republicans argue that future presidents, such as the socialist candidate Bernie Sanders for the Democrats, could. “Lets face it, vast swathes of our military are big carbon emitters – tanks, Jeeps, humvees, jet planes – and of course much of our navy is not nuclear-powered, so [the Paris agreement] could be used as a trojan horse,” said Steven Groves, a senior research fellow at the US thinktank the Heritage Foundation. He added: “This might be a good opportunity for people concerned with national security to go to congress and get some type of legislative exemption in the same way as was done during the Kyoto time period.” One of the first advocates of the House double-lock on the Kyoto exemption was Dick Cheney, according to a book called ‘The greening of the US military’ by Terry Lee Anderson, a senior fellow at Stanford University. Cheney argued that the Kyoto clause would not cover US unilateral actions in a letter, which was also signed by other former security officials. The Iraq war was responsible for 141m tonnes of carbon releases in its first four years, according to an Oil Change International report. On an annual basis, this was more than the emissions from 139 countries in this period, or about the same as putting an extra 25m cars on to US roads for a year. The paper found that projected US spending on the Iraq war could cover all global investments in renewable energy needed to halt global warming trends in the period to 2030"

"Maritime historians, climate scientists and ordinary citizens are coming together on a project to study the logbooks of 19th-century whaling ships to better understand modern-day climate change and Arctic weather patterns. The crew of whaling ships kept meticulous daily logbooks of weather conditions during their often years-long voyages searching the globe for whales, valued for their light-giving oil, said Michael Dyer, a senior maritime historian at the New Bedford whaling museum in Massachusetts, which is supplying much of the data.  Some logs include information about life on board, such as sailors falling overboard, or being disciplined for stealing or other transgressions, and of course, notations whenever whales are spotted. More important for this project, they include precise longitude and latitude measurements, weather conditions, the presence of icebergs and the edge of the ice shelf. “If they’re cruising in the Bering strait and there’s ice, there will be a notation in the logbook that ice fields are present,” Dyer said. The project, called Old Weather: Whaling, is led by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The whaling museum is transcribing and digitising its own logbooks, as well as original data sources from the Nantucket Historical Association, Martha’s Vineyard museum, Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, and the New Bedford free public library. The digitised logbooks are being posted online so ordinary “citizen-scientists” can help researchers sift through the vast amounts of information. The museum has about 2,600 whaling logbooks dating from 1756 to 1965, but the project so far includes just about 300 logbooks related to whaling trips to the Arctic from the mid-1800s to the first decade of the 20th century. One entry from the San Francisco-based whaler Beluga during a two-year voyage to the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas from 1897 to 1899 is typical of the information in the logs. “Lat. 61.19. Long. 175.42. Fast to the ice till 6 A.M. then made sail and worked to the N.E. at 8:45 A.M. Commenced steaming. Steamed till 1 P.M. then struck open water. Carrying topsail and fore and aft sails. Steering from N.N.W. to N.E. as the ice allowed. Wind light and variable first part. Latter part strong E.S.E. winds thick and snowing. Ther. 30. Bar. 29.60.” On a most basic level, the information from an old whaling logbook can be compared with current conditions; for example, is there sea ice today in the places where whalers saw sea ice 150 years ago? But the project is much more than that, said Kevin Wood, a climate scientist with NOAA’s Joint Institute for the Study of the Ocean and Atmosphere at the University of Washington and a lead researcher on the project. By recovering as much weather data as possible, the information could help create sophisticated computer models of past climate and help predict future conditions. He called it a “virtual time-traveling weather satellite”. “We can build an enormously detailed reconstruction of the conditions at the time ... and we can we can understand how the climate has been changing over a longer period of time,” Wood said. The project launched in December is an offshoot of Old Weather, an ongoing partnership between NOAA and Zooniverse, the citizen science web portal that is looking at logbooks of other vessels, including merchant and naval ships. Sifting through the documents is where the public comes in. There is just too much data for a small group of scientists to pore over. High-resolution images of historical documents, extracted data and related research products are available online, sad Michael Lapides, the museum’s director of digital initiatives. Already, the logbooks of more than 20 whalers are online. The project is expected to take about a year, Lapides said."
"I agree with John Gummer that the government should use the Housing Act to prevent further developments in at-risk areas.

"The 21st UN climate summit (COP21) found a happy ending on December 12, when delegates from 195 countries adopted a set of decisions and the so-called “Paris Agreement”. As usual in diplomatic negotiations, the final document contains very vague language on many crucial aspects. But this kind of ‘constructive ambiguity’ often is the only way to get a deal done. The actual meaning of many paragraphs will develop over time, not so much as a result of the most sophisticated interpretations but as outcome of ongoing power struggles. In the words of Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann: “He who has the bigger stick has the better chance of imposing his definitions of reality”. Nevertheless, the game of framing the COP21 outcome started even before the final draft of the agreement had been published, targeting the most contentious and thus intangible paragraphs, like the new long-term mitigation goal or the five-year review-mechanism. What has been largely overlooked though, are the elements that contain the most precise language: quantified temperature targets.   The much reported Article 2(1) of the Paris Agreement states that it aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change Even here, some parts are rather vague (e.g., what exactly does “well below” mean?), and we’re surely going to see serious framing efforts in this regard. But there’s almost no questioning of the parties’ intention to hold the temperature increase to below 2 or even 1.5°C. Surely it’s the articulated will of 195 governments? Well, think again.  We might be falling victim to the cultural norm of consistency in policymaking. This norm can be found in any field of policy, but its effects are particularly problematic in public domains with a deliberately transformative agenda, like energy and climate policy.  Almost nobody seems to grasp the political rationalities behind setting long-term climate policy targets. In the broader climate discourse everybody assumes consistency between talk, decisions and actions. Accordingly, a decision on a certain target is presented and perceived as an act of deliberate ‘choice’ between different desired end-states, to be accompanied by assessments of proper instruments and followed by deployment of appropriate measures. In the end, it might not work out as planned, but this would simply be considered as an ‘implementation failure’. We might even be able to learn from it. The problem with international climate policy is, though, that it’s constantly not working as planned, since policymakers view decisions as independent organizational products, not necessarily connected to action. The 2°C target had already been adopted at COP16 in Cancún 2010, but action has been insufficient ever since, contrary to climate economists’ modeling. Ironically, scientific advisers are already relaxing the requirements for meeting the 2°C limit and started moving goalposts to keep the target alive. Unfortunately, there’s not much learning to see in the climate policy community. The usual answer to failure is “more of the same”. The legally binding Paris Agreement brought about a new goal (on long-term mitigation) and an even more ambitious temperature target (1.5°C). Adoption of both will lead to a new circle of studies, maybe even a IPCC special report, that answer policymakers’ most favorable question: are UN climate targets still feasible? Researchers’ answers will be positive in general, but based on ever more heroic assumptions, particularly on vast amounts of negative emissions compensating for initial overshoot of the original carbon budgets, betting on unproven technologies. But policymakers are mostly interested in the main message and largely ignoring the fine print, with obvious results. Current ‘intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDC) will only lead to a slowdown of emissions growth, there’s no global peaking in sight, the review mechanism will be largely insufficient to bring the world onto a 2°C pathway, let alone 1.5°C. But most probably, policymakers will ask for more studies later. If limiting temperature increase to below 2°C is already called a ‘fantasy’, and if the original carbon budget for 1.5°C might be consumed as early as 2020, why decide to put these targets in a legally binding UN treaty? Quite obviously, these decisions are not about choice between certain sets of appropriate actions. With Nils Brunsson we can detect other possible functions of ambitious climate target decisions: (1) creating legitimacy for policymakers or the negotiation process; (2) claiming responsibility for saving the planet; (3) mobilizing short-term action within the negotiation process.  Whichever function has been dominant in Paris, they all share one common feature: to be fulfilled, actual target implementation is not necessary. What is indispensable though, is adhering to the cultural norm of consistency. And that’s why any major decision in climate policy will lead to a multitude of implementation studies. But since there is no comprehensive rationality in policymaking, scientists cannot expect appropriate action, even if they produce vast assessments that deliver many options to meet a given target.  Inconsistency in policymaking stems from the simple fact that political organizations have to secure external support, but are confronted with inconsistent demands by different stakeholders. The most practical way to deal with this challenge is to address some stakeholder groups by talk, some by decisions, and some by actions. This inevitably leads to inconsistency. Unfortunately, in climate policy most governments choose a more progressive stance while talking and deciding, but a more modest one when acting. The easiest way for them to deal with impending inconsistency is ‘hypocrisy’ by, for example, talking and making decisions about the far-away future, where the need for immediate action is relatively limited. Unsurprisingly, climate policy has been much more about intentions than results. So far, setting ambitious long-term global climate targets has not been a prerequisite but a substitute for appropriate action. But if consistency can’t be assumed, then concepts like ‘evidence-based policymaking’ become shallow. Where does this leave scientific policy advisers? There is no easy answer. But it might be a good starting point for advisers to get a much better idea how governments and politicians are dealing with new knowledge, and why they constantly ask for more although they’ve ignored most of it in the past. If climate policy advisers really want to help to make the world a better place, then they will have to deal with the political world as it is, not with simplified representations in models or textbooks.

"As a follow-up to a recent article I posted on renewable energy, this article discusses the economics of wind in both the developed and developing worlds compared to other renewable energy sources. At the recent climate conference in Paris, 70 countries highlighted wind as a major component for their emissions-reduction schemes.  I spoke with Giles Dickson who is CEO of the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA). I asked him economic questions related to the wind industry and I also asked him to look into his crystal ball and describe the future of wind. Mr. Dickson is in a great position to answer these questions because his organization includes 600 members who represent wind industry manufacturers, operators, and companies comprising the full wind-energy supply chain.   First, I asked why companies were investing in wind. His response was clear: wind is competitive economically. He told me about the SolutionWind campaign which is a platform that gives industry leaders like Unilever, BNP, Aveda, IKEA, LEGO, Google, Microsoft, SAP, and others the chance to tell their customers and the general public why they have chosen wind. SolutionWind includes interviews with these leaders (and case studies soon to be published) wherein the case is made that using wind energy adds value to these companies.  Companies want to reduce their emissions and they want access to reliable, inexpensive power. Companies want to know how to achieve these two goals in a way that is quick and efficient. For many of them, wind is the answer. It’s inexpensive and emissions-free (aside from initial manufacturing and installation and service) and it gives the companies control over their energy supply.  Globally, the average cost of wind is $83 per megawatt-hour. This is the levelized cost of electrical delivery. How does it compare to other energy sources? Well the averages for coal and gas are $84 and $98, respectively. In the USA, gas is slightly cheaper than wind but this is the only large economy where that is the case. As a comparison, solar photovoltaic energy averages $122 globally for each MW-hour. There are some additional system integration costs and market balancing costs that vary geographically. The cost of balancing out the variable wind power is usually paid by the wind-power producers. And of course there are the costs of reinforcing the grid, such as building transmission lines to wind farms.  Put together all these additional costs might typically amount to 30% of the total costs. However, they are reduced with a properly functioning electrical market, which balances out variable power from power sources over a large geographical region.  In Europe, for instance, while electricity is traded across borders, there is no single market. That makes the system less efficient. It’s important to include large regions in a single market because a quiet day in Spain may be balanced by wind gusts in Germany. And the same is true for solar. Cloudy days in one region are often balanced by sun in others. One of the things Mr. Dickson was most excited about was the continued decrease in cost and increase in capacity. The economics of wind are going to continue to get better and installation will accelerate, particularly in the developing world. Since my research is on small-scale off-grid wind power, I asked him about that too. He told me that small-scale wind is not a big presence in Europe; the vast majority of their wind is grid-connected farms. There are small-scale installations that communities have established for their own local power however micro-generation in Europe is much more likely to be solar rather than wind.  In the developing world, it is a different story. Small-scale off-grid systems are seen as a quick way to extend power to people who do not have access to the grid. According to Mr. Dickson, if your goal is to get people access to quick electricity, off-grid systems have real merit. However if your goal is to provide a basis for long-term energy supply and industrial development, then large-scale systems will be required. The renewable energy sector also supplies many high-paid and high-skilled jobs. In Europe, for instance, the coal industry employs 240,000 workers whereas the wind industry exceeds that at 262,000. So, people can see careers in this industry and young engineers and scientists are passionate about working in the field. I see this with my own students in the USA. Aside from continued cost decreases and increased market, what else is EWEA looking forward to? Well everyone is watching the Chinese emission trading scheme. That goes into effect in two years. No one knows what the price will be for carbon in that market, but it will be the largest carbon market in the world. If the balance between supply and demand is not correct, then the price on carbon will be too low (as the case with Europe where there is an excess of emissions certificates).  I also learned that other regions, like Quebec and California have linked their carbon markets so that you can buy certificates in one market and sell them in another. This linkage has increased liquidity and efficiency of the systems.  So, it isn’t only improvements to technology that will continue the downward trend of renewable energy costs, it’s thinking in new ways about creating and maintaining markets and by recognizing that polluting energy sources have long gotten a free path that will finally make renewables global champions on cost. That’s what has me and other scientists and engineers so excited."
"The head of Europe’s coal lobby has said that his industry will be “hated and vilified in the same way that slave-traders were once hated and vilified” as a result of the Paris climate deal, in an extraordinary diatribe sent to his members and press outlets. Last weekend, the world’s governments agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a momentous pact aiming at holding global warming to 2C.   While oil and gas associations professed themselves happy with a Paris agreement they believe gives a fillip to natural gas prospects, the coal industry fears it will be squashed by a clean energy juggernaut. In his letter, Brian Ricketts, Euracoal’s secretary-general, lashed out at what he called “mob rule” by a cabal of world governments and protesters at the Paris climate summit which posed a threat to democracy itself. “The world is being sold a lie, yet most people seem to accept the lie, even if they do not believe it,” Ricketts warned. “The UN has successfully brainwashed most of the world’s population such that scientific evidence, rational analysis, enlightened thinking and common sense no longer matter.”  “You might be relieved that the agreement is weak,” he went on. “Don’t be. The words and legal basis no longer matter. Fossil fuels are [being] portrayed by the UN as public enemy number one. We are witnessing a power bid by people who see the democratic process as part of the problem and have worked out ways to bypass it.” Ricketts is an affable and respected figure on the Brussels lobby scene, and campaigners suggested that stress and industry desperation may have played a part in his outburst. In the aftermath of the Paris agreement, shares in coal firms plunged rapidly. Peabody, the world’s largest coal firm, saw stock values drop 12.6%, while Consol Energy holdings was down by 3.3%. Renewable energy companies rose modestly on the markets, with the MAC global solar energy index up 4.5%. A Monday morning investor note from Barclays said that “investor momentum around portfolio decarbonisation will likely continue to build.” But the US Oil & Gas Index also increased its value in the first day of trading after COP21, finishing 0.2% higher, due to expectations of more fuel switching from coal to gas, a less carbon-intensive fossil fuel. “An optimist sees in every difficulty an opportunity,” said Patrick Pouyanné, the CEO of French oil giant Total SA. “I’m definitely an optimist; I have to be.” Beate Raabe, the secretary-general of Eurogas, a trade association which represents BP, Shell and Total in Brussels, hailed the Paris deal as “a major step in the right direction” and called for new market-based mechanisms to help leverage investment in the industry. European trades unions, however, raised concerns about the equity of the agreement in a letter sent to the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, seen by the Guardian.  “The absence of unambiguous support from the EU negotiators towards proposals, for instance from Canada, to retain references to just transition and decent work in the operational part of the agreement has been extremely disappointing,” said Luca Visentini, the general secretary of the European Trades Union Confederation."
"It could be the mildest 22 December since records began, with forecasters saying the unsettled weather sweeping across Britain could last until Christmas Eve. The uncharacteristically mild temperature on this year’s winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, means the Greater London area is the most likely to beat the record winter warmth of 16.1C set at Hoylake, Merseyside, in 1910.   Forecasters MeteoGroup recorded temperatures of 14.3C (58F) at Heathrow and 15C at London City airport before 8am on Tuesday morning.  A MeteoGroup spokeswoman said: “We’ve not got a great deal of rising of temperatures to do to match the record and I think we could see that matched today.” A Met Office forecaster said: “It’s going to be a bit of a push to break it, but it’s a bit finely balanced. We will see a few bright spells towards the south-east and if any brightness develops at the right point, there’s a chance we could get to 16C at least.” The Met Office forecaster added: “Generally speaking there’s been quite a bit of cloud, but if the sun peeps through the clouds in early afternoon, it could just push the temperature up to 16C or something like that.” Rain in the south-east will clear away at first on Tuesday evening, with a cooler night following for all. Clear periods will however be broken up by scattered heavy showers and gusty winds. Wednesday will see cool and windy weather, with much of the UK largely dry with sunny periods. Today is the start of #Winter in the astronomical calendar and is marked by the #WinterSolstice pic.twitter.com/tV3BVdC79p The outlook however is less sunny for the north, with a wet and windy start to be followed by showers moving in from the north-west. There are warnings for rain on Tuesday in south-west Scotland, north-west England and west Wales.  Though rain will hit some areas, Scotland too could see higher-than-average temperatures. Aberdeen could hit 12 or 13C on Tuesday morning and then drop off, with the afternoon temperature across Scotland more likely to be around 8 or 9C.  The Met Office forecaster said: “The two main features of the weather are the rain today and then on Wednesday night there’s quite a deep area of low pressure passing by to the north-west of Scotland, which could give some very strong winds on Wednesday night coming into Christmas Eve morning.”  If there is to be a white christmas it is likeliest over the highest ground in Scotland. The forecaster said: “It could just be cooling off across the hills of Scotland at times, giving a bit of snow, but it will be the highest ground in Scotland, so if there’s a white Christmas anywhere it will just be the mountains of Scotland. No sign of any significant cold weather for some time yet.” Rain and gales are to clear on Christmas Eve, according to the Met Office, leaving a colder night and a bright start to Christmas Day for some. But rain and strong winds will arrive again, continuing through to Boxing Day."

"The UK is going into reverse on renewable energy while pressing the accelerator on fracking, according to former Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith. The final report of a shale gas taskforce led by Lord Smith concludes that the UK should be pursuing both fracking and green energy. It finds shale gas could be safely and usefully produced in the UK, providing strict environmental protections are in place. But it warns that the government’s recent cancellation of a £1bn competition to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology – which could trap climate-warming CO2 from gas-burning – has damaged the viability of a large shale gas industry. On Saturday, the world’s nations agreed a UN climate change deal in Paris to limit global warming to below 2C. The UK government won praise for its role in delivering the deal, but it has been heavily criticised for a string of domestic policies that attack renewable energy and energy efficiency. “The government are not being even-handed at the the moment,” Smith told the Guardian. “They appear to be going into reverse on a lot of renewables, whilst at the same time pressing the accelerator on shale gas. They need to moving along on both fronts, not just one.”  Ministers have moved to block onshore windfarms, while fast-tracking fracking, and are expected to announce this week whether planned 90% cuts to solar subsidies are going ahead.  It was a “severe disappointment” that ministers cancelled the CCS project just before the Paris summit, said Smith, a former Labour cabinet minister. CCS is seen as vital if fossil fuels are to remain in use in coming decades. “A serious development of CCS is in our opinion essential for the medium term viability of any significant shale gas industry,” says the report.  The UK is not on target to meet its binding targets for cutting emissions and renewable energy. “We need to prepare much more actively than we are,” said Smith. “It becomes very difficult to envisage gas-fired power stations after say 2030-35 without CCS, whilst meeting climate change targets.”  On Monday, a formerly staunch supporter of fracking, Prof Paul Younger at Glasgow University, said the CCS cancellation had “fatally undermined” the case for fracking. Energy secretary Amber Rudd, when asked at the Paris climate talks if cancelling CCS was a mistake, said: “I don’t think it was a mistake, no. There are some CCS plants that are going forward at the moment. They are still expensive. For the UK we were having a tight spending commitment so it was the right thing to do there [cancelling it].” The £900,000 year-long assessment by the shale gas taskforce was funded by the fracking industry, including Centrica, Cuadrilla and Total, but was produced independently. It concluded shale gas could play a part in the UK meeting its climate change targets by replacing coal and could create thousands of jobs. The report said exploratory drilling should go ahead “as soon as possible”, as it is currently almost impossible to estimate the potential scale of the industry or what the gas would cost.  The taskforce concluded that the risk to public health from strictly regulated fracking was no greater than from existing oil and gas operations or heavy industrial plants such as steel or cement works. “There has been understandable concern – and even fear – as a result of the lax standards [in the past in the US],” the report said.  “However, this highlights issues with regulation and enforcement from which lessons must be learned, not issues with [fracking] itself.” Smith said it would take longer than 20-25 years to replace the gas that heats 80% of UK homes with other technologies, meaning gas had a role to play and he said domestically-produced gas was more secure than imports. “It is simply not feasible to create a renewables industry that can meet all our energy needs in the short term,” says the report. However the report also said a safe fracking industry would need a single regulator, rather than the current split of responsibilities across the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), Environment Agency and Health and Safety Executive. The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering made the same recommendation in 2012, but it has not been acted on. The most important regulation needed, said Smith, was “green completion”, which ensures that methane – a potent greenhouse gas – does not escape from drilling wells. It is voluntary in the UK, but is now legally required in the US. “If they can do it there, we can do it here,” said Smith.  Directly involving local communities in monitoring fracking and minimising heavy traffic and noise was also essential, the report said, as was spelling out local financial payments. “Operators must give details if they expect public support,” said the report. “The Paris climate deal signalled the end of the era of fossil fuels and if the UK government is serious it must end its fixation with fracking,” said Rose Dickinson, from Friends of the Earth. “The government should start by announcing it won’t overturn the democratic decision of Lancashire council to reject fracking.” “Whatever planet the UK fracking lobby inhabits, it can’t be the same one where world leaders just reached a historic deal that puts fossil fuels on the wrong side of history,” said Hannah Martin, an energy campaigner at Greenpeace UK.  The taskforce report was welcomed by the shale gas trade body, UK Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG).  “We have already seen a significant shift to imported gas [and] shale gas will provide a means of enhancing the UK’s energy security,” said Ken Cronin, chief executive of UKOOG. “The industry is committed to working with communities and enabling them to share in the economic benefits. We now need to get on and find out how much shale gas we have beneath our feet.” A Decc spokesman said of the taskforce report: “This report confirms what we have been saying for some time – that with the right standards in place fracking can take place safely. With more than 50 years of drilling experience in the UK and one of the best records in the world for economic development while protecting our environment and people, we should press on and get exploration moving.”"

"The wild weather that is forecast to batter the north and west of the UK on Wednesday with heavy rain and gale-force winds, including parts of northern England already hit by the Boxing Day floods, has been christened Storm Frank by the Met Office. The storm is the sixth to be named since the system of labelling storms expected to have significant impact was introduced in September  Up to 80mm of rain is predicted to fall on high ground, and potentially in excess of 120mm in exposed areas, with large swaths of the UK seeing up to 40mm. The Met Office issued yellow warnings for rain on Wednesday for north-west England, north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amber warnings are in place for parts of central and southern Scotland. Another amber rain warning has been issued for parts of Cumbria, which experienced severe flooding in early December.  Met Office forecaster Sophie Yeomans said the amber warning was in place for Cumbria not necessarily because it would experience the heaviest rainfall, but because of the way its rivers respond. Cities including York, where the river Ouse peaked on Monday; Leeds, where some main roads were under water; and Manchester – all affected on Boxing Day – are expected to see heavy rain, as is the Calder Valley, where several Pennine towns, including Hebden Bridge, Todmorden and Mytholmroyd, experienced severe flooding.  “We can’t say exactly where the heaviest rain is going to fall at the moment,” said Yeomans. Storm Frank is building up in the Atlantic, with the front to push in on Tuesday night into Wednesday. The centre of the low pressure system is expected to pass just north of the UK, but it will carry behind it a slow-moving front that will trail across the country bringing torrential rain. The rain will be accompanied by strong winds with possible inland gales, the Met Office said. Western parts of Wales, the north-west of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland will all be affected. In its updated warning for Cumbria, the Met Office said “large rainfall accumulations are likely across parts of Cumbria” with up to 140mm or more in the most exposed spots on high ground. Elsewhere in the region, rainfall accumulations of up to 90mm “are possible quite widely”. “Rainfall amounts and impact will not be as great as across Cumbria in early December, but some impacts are likely due to flooding. Please be prepared for possible disruption”, the Met Office said. “Some medium-level disruption due to flooding from either rivers or surface water is now thought likely.” Some exposed locations in south-west Scotland could receive 100-150mm of accumulated rainfall on Wednesday, the Met Office said.  A yellow warning for wind on Wednesday was also issued for Scotland, northern Ireland, Wales, north-west England and south-west England."
