"The British countryside will be “nursed back to health” by the National Trust under a new £1bn, 10-year plan, which takes the charity far beyond its conventional image of country houses and tearooms. Decades of poor land management, intensive farming and the loss of habitat have sent wildlife numbers tumbling, with 60% of species declining in the UK over the last 50 years.  Under plans unveiled on Monday, the National Trust has pledged to try to reverse this decline, through its own actions and working with partners. It is one of the biggest land managers in the UK, numbering hundreds of tenant farmers among its estates, as well as woodland, beauty spots, coastline, rivers and historic properties. It now plans to develop new ways of managing land on a large scale, which it said would benefit farmers, the economy and the environment. These could include providing more habitats for birds, animals and insects to improve their numbers, and measures to protect fragile soils that are under threat from erosion. Helen Ghosh, director general of the trust, said: “The protection of our natural environment and historic places over the last 100 years has been core to the work of the trust but it has never been just about looking after our own places. The natural environment is in poor health. We can’t keep taking it for granted.” Many of the changes the trust wants to make would need 30 years or more to take effect, she said. “This is a long-term commitment, for the benefit of generations to come.” Climate change had become the biggest threat to the National Trust’s properties, the charity said, and as well as protecting and repairing buildings to cope with that, the trust would continue its programme of energy efficiency and renewable energy, with a pledge to cut energy use by a fifth by the decade’s end.  By then, half of its remaining energy use will be from renewable sources, such as solar power. In the past, the charity’s commitment to renewables has come under question from some quarters, because of the opposition to wind turbines of the previous chairman, Simon Jenkins. Ghosh promised that the next decade for Europe’s biggest conservation charity would see it work more with other charities, government, businesses and local communities to “improve the quality of the land and attract wildlife back to the fields, woods and river banks”. Another part of the plan is to help protect public green spaces used by local communities that are under threat from budget cuts. Tim Parker, chairman of the 120-year-old trust, said: “The National Trust has always responded to the challenges of the time. I believe our founders would be proud of our ambitions and the part we plan to play.” The trust has more than 4.2 million members and there are about 20 million visitors to its sites each year. About £300m will be spent in the next 10 years on clearing the backlog of repairs to its properties, most of which will be open 364 days a year. The charity said it would make major changes at its most visited historic houses that would “transform how we tell the story” of their heritage, which is likely to include more ways for people to use and experience life in the houses rather than simply pass through them on roped-off walkways."
"As the world keeps warming, it is expected that both the speed of winds and the amount of rainfall associated with tropical cyclones will increase. And as sea levels rise, storm surges and other coastal flooding will only get worse. For Vanuatu and other Pacific Island nations, cyclone Pam has been the worst-case scenario: in Port Vila, Vanuatu’s capital, 90% of the housing has been badly damaged; kids have nowhere to go to school, and the town’s hospital was left with no power. In the country’s outer islands, where most people live, about a quarter of a million people had little or no protection from the cyclone’s 160mph winds. And if people cannot get clean water and at least temporary toilets very soon, a “second emergency” could follow from water-borne diseases. That is why the world’s focus must be on meeting these urgent needs before any more lives are lost.  At Oxfam, we are already providing trucks of drinking water to people living in the evacuation centres. We are also distributing kits around the capital that include items designed to maintain high levels of hygiene. We have been carrying out assessments on some of the outlying islands and are working with local organisations to support food supplies amid fears that stocks will run out in two weeks.  No other city in the world is as exposed to disasters as Port Vila – an unenviable distinction recently recorded by the Natural Hazards Risk Atlas. What makes this all the more tragic is that Vanuatu was doing all the right things to prepare for disasters. Its people, government and all the local organisations with which Oxfam works knew only too well how vulnerable Vanuatu was to typhoons, earthquakes and tsunamis. These efforts were not wasted – setting up cyclone evacuation shelters in advance, for example, saved lives – but they could never have equipped this small country for something as big as cyclone Pam.  Last year, I saw in the Philippines that nothing could have prepared the people there for the power of typhoon Haiyan. Even the US struggled to cope with superstorm Sandy, which struck New York, New Jersey and other states in 2012.  So who or what is to blame? According to Vanuatu’s president, Baldwin Lonsdale, climate change has contributed to “the level of sea rise … the cyclone season, the warm, the rain, all this is affected”.  Whether we will see a greater number of cyclones as a result of climate change is uncertain, but scientists say one thing is clear: those that we do see are likely to be stronger and more destructive.  This is the threat that the people of Vanuatu and millions of people in coastal or low-lying areas will increasingly face. Millions more in other parts of the world will encounter drought, increased flooding and other hazards. In a 2013 report, the Met Office and Overseas Development Institute said “climate change and exposure to ‘natural’ disasters threaten to derail international efforts to eradicate poverty by 2030”. According to the same study, by 2030 “up to 325 million extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard-prone countries” in the world.  The world’s poorest people are being hit harder and harder by disasters. It was so poignant that, as cyclone Pam was tearing across Vanuatu, the world’s governments were gathering in Sendai, Japan, to plot a supposedly bold course to reduce the risk of future disasters.  Back in 2005, in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the international community agreed a 10-year plan – the Hyogo Framework – to make the world safer from natural hazards like typhoons.  But a decade on, all the measures to reduce the risk of disasters are being overwhelmed by the rising tide of calamities the world faces. What was needed was a step change in response. That’s why I’ve been arguing for a new framework with ambitious, measurable targets to reduce the risks for vulnerable people, a target that really ensures local authorities and NGOs have the funding, technical capacity and decision-making power to make meaningful changes where they are most desperately needed. But rather than that, the world’s governments have agreed only minimal improvements on the Hyogo Framework.  The Sendai Framework will have its value, but it would have had far more worth if it had gone further, and if wealthy countries had offered far more financial and technical support to the countries struggling to recover from disasters. Back in 2009, developed countries promised to mobilise $100bn a year by 2020 to help developing countries adapt to climate change and reduce their emissions. The UK’s record on contributing its fair share of that has been good. But global progress is slow, and uncertainty of finance for this purpose looms large over countries like Vanuatu.  Cyclone Pam reminds us again that so much more than money is needed. We must recognise that poorer countries like Vanuatu – with the least responsibility for climate change – are already suffering the devastating consequences of inaction. Like every richer country, the UK must act on this stark fact more than ever before. Whoever finds themselves in government after 7 May must lead the way in tackling climate change at home and abroad: in the former, by committing to phase out coal emissions from the British economy by the early 2020s; in the latter, by standing strong on the need for new concrete commitments on climate finance at the UN conference on climate in Paris this December.  My heart goes out to those whose lives have been devastated in the Pacific. But in my head I know the challenge of climate-driven poverty, inequality and disasters is likely to get dramatically worse. "

"The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions plunged by 8.4% last year, as household energy consumption slumped, the use of coal for electricity generation fell, and policies on climate change took effect, according to government statistics released on Thursday. Carbon dioxide output fell by almost a tenth, as renewable energy generation rose to a new record high, accounting for nearly a fifth of electricity. It was the biggest fall in emissions since 1990. Over the last five years, following a sharp fall in 2009, emissions appeared to have reached a plateau, with slight rises in some years owing to increasing coal use. The price of coal has dropped on world markets, as shale gas has sapped demand in the US, leaving a glut. Green campaigners welcomed the fall, but they warned that more must be done to reach targets. In part, the slump in carbon output was down to record average high temperatures across the UK in 2014, which drove down demand for heating and led to a big drop in household energy consumption – even though bills rose over the year. The emissions fall was a boost to Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, ahead of a difficult general election for the Lib Dems. The party has traditionally relied on its green credentials with voters, but this has been a harder sell when in coalition. Davey said: “2014 was truly record-breaking year for low carbon generation. Our plan to decarbonise the economy while it grows is working – we’ve reduced our emissions by 8%, increased the amount of electricity we’re getting from renewables and seen the economy grow at the same time. It is crucial we continue to build a low carbon energy sector based on home grown sources, as it is crucial to improving our energy security, as well as stimulating economic growth and reducing emissions.” The fall will also strengthen the UK’s position at the Paris climate talks this December, where world governments are expected to agree to greenhouse gas targets to take effect beyond 2020, when current pledges expire. By 31 March, all countries are expected to submit their proposals on how far they will cut emissions, in the case of developed countries, and on proposed curbs to their emissions growth, in the case of poorer nations. Some may miss the deadline, but the EU, the US and China have already made public their pledges. These pledges will then be considered to decide how fair they are and how far they take the world to the cuts in greenhouse gases needed to prevent global warming from exceeding 2C, regarded as the threshold of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.  Emma Pinchbeck of WWF said: “Falling carbon emissions from the energy sector is welcome news and shows that action on carbon emissions gets results. While this drop is positive, we must remember that more ambitious carbon emissions reductions are required across different sectors to meet our climate change commitments.” Green groups pointed to the rise in renewable energy generation, which hit 19% last year, as a key factor in the emissions fall. However, the future of onshore wind – the biggest and cheapest generator of large-scale renewable power – is in doubt as an incoming Conservative government would end subsidies for the technology and might bring in tougher regulations on the building of new wind farms. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: “This is further evidence, if it was needed, that efforts to cut carbon and boost our economy can go hand in hand. Since a reduction in coal use was a crucial factor in bringing down carbon dioxide emissions, these figures give us a taste of what could be achieved if our political leaders got serious about phasing out the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and gave proper backing to clean energy.” "
"A new paper published in Climatic Change estimates that when we account for the pollution costs associated with our energy sources, gasoline costs an extra $3.80 per gallon, diesel an additional $4.80 per gallon, coal a further 24 cents per kilowatt-hour, and natural gas another 11 cents per kilowatt-hour that we don’t see in our fuel or energy bills.  The study was done by Drew Shindell, formerly of Nasa, now professor of climate sciences at Duke University, and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Panel to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Shindell recently published research noting that aerosols and ozone have a bigger effect on the climate in the northern hemisphere, where humans produce more of those pollutants. That research led Shindell to question current estimates of the true costs of our energy sources. Much research has gone into estimating the social cost of carbon, which attempts to account for the additional costs from burning fossil fuels via the climate damages their carbon pollution causes. However, this research doesn’t account for the costs associated with other air pollutants released during fossil fuel combustion. For example, depending on how much more we value a dollar today than in the future (a factor known as ‘discount rate’), Shindell estimates carbon pollution costs us $32 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted in climate damages, and another $45 in additional climate-health impacts like malnutrition that aren’t normally accounted for. But Shindell also estimates that carbon emissions are relatively cheap compared to other fossil fuel air pollutants. For example, sulfur dioxide costs $42,000 per ton, and nitrous oxides $67,000 per ton! However, less of these other pollutants are released into the atmosphere during modern fossil fuel combustion. For an average American car (26 miles per gallon), Shindell estimates that the air pollution emissions altogether cost us $1700 in damages per year. In comparison, emissions from energy to power an electric Nissan Leaf would cost us $840 even if purely powered by coal, and $290 if fueled by electricity supplied entirely from natural gas. These costs would become negligible if the electricity came from renewable or nuclear power. Electric vehicles (EVs) are clearly the winners in this cost comparison. Hence environmental damages are reduced substantially even if an EV is powered from coal-fired electricity, although they are much lower for other electricity sources The key conclusion from Shindell’s study is that fossil fuels only seem cheap because their market prices don’t reflect their true costs. In reality they are remarkably expensive for society, but taxpayers pick up most of those costs via climate damages and other health effects. Those who argue that we need to continue relying on fossil fuels – like former popular science writer Matt Ridley – just aren’t accounting for the costs of pollution. These air pollution costs are effectively a massive subsidy, and Shindell likely underestimated their size. When I asked Shindell if he had accounted for recent research by Moore & Diaz showing that climate change slows economic growth, he said, I saw the Moore and Diaz paper, which was quite interesting, but after my paper had already been accepted so it didn’t make it in there. Indeed if growth is slowed by climate change as in their study, the associated social costs could be much larger ... But in general, this is only one of several possible reasons that my values are likely conservative as I’ve left out many things that I didn’t know how to put a price on. That includes the influence of pollution on cognitive function decline, on IQ, and on mental health, the influence of energy on freshwater resources, on national security (e.g. military spending related to oil/gas supplies), the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the effects of ocean acidification, etc. This research shows that we need to transition away from fossil fuels not just to mitigate the risks associated with climate change, but to reduce the economic and health impacts of air pollution in general. Fortunately there was some good news this week suggesting that we may be on our way to making this transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported, global emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy sector stalled in 2014, marking the first time in 40 years in which there was a halt or reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gas that was not tied to an economic downturn ... In the 40 years in which the IEA has been collecting data on carbon dioxide emissions, there have only been three times in which emissions have stood still or fallen compared to the previous year, and all were associated with global economic weakness: the early 1980’s; 1992 and 2009. In 2014, however, the global economy expanded by 3%. When we examine the data, 2014 indeed stands out. With 3% GDP growth, it’s the first year on record that energy-related CO2 emissions didn’t increase and GDP nevertheless grew by more than 2%. The IEA reports that the stagnation in carbon pollution stemmed from a transition away from fossil fuels rather than a drop in energy use due to poor economic conditions, as had been the case in previous years where CO2 emissions didn’t grow. The IEA attributes the halt in emissions growth to changing patterns of energy consumption in China and OECD countries. In China, 2014 saw greater generation of electricity from renewable sources, such as hydropower, solar and wind, and less burning of coal. In OECD economies, recent efforts to promote more sustainable growth – including greater energy efficiency and more renewable energy – are producing the desired effect of decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. It’s important not to over-interpret a single data point, but it’s a promising sign that carbon pollution emissions didn’t grow in 2014 while the global economy did. This is the sort of “decoupling” of GDP and CO2 that needs to happen for a successful transition away from fossil fuels. Signs that we may have reached peak coal production are also encouraging. As Shindell’s research shows, it’s an important transition for us to make in order to preserve a livable climate and a healthy economy."
"Members of the Rockefeller family tried to get ExxonMobil to acknowledge the dangers of climate change a decade ago – but failed in their efforts to reform the oil giant. In letters, lunch meetings, and shareholder resolutions, the descendants of John D Rockefeller, founder of the oil empire that eventually became Exxon, sought repeatedly to persuade the company to abandon climate denial and begin shifting their business towards clean energy. “We were really begging the company to look harder at what they were doing. They were still into climate denial and funding deniers and really against any positive steps,” said Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, a co-director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University, who helped lead the reform effort. The outreach effort, led mainly by Rockefeller’s great grandchildren, began with a lunch meeting in 2004 with Exxon’s then head of investor relations.  “This was the family trying to get into a friendly conversation with ExxonMobil, feeling we have a strong historical connection with that company,” said Goodwin. “We wanted to start talking with the company about their view of the future and how they could be a constructive player as well as part of the problem.” The company was blindsided. David Henry, then head of investor relations, was “stunned” at the family’s concern about climate change, according to Goodwin’s recollection of events. “The head of investor relations was really surprised to find we didn’t love Exxon as it was but thought changes might be a good idea,” she said. Over the next few years, Goodwin and about a dozen other Rockefellers launched three separate shareholder resolutions pressing Exxon to recognise climate change and invest in renewable energy. The cousins also sought an independent chairman, believing it would make the company more responsive. At the time the oil company was the main funder of dozens of front groups and researchers rubbishing any link between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change – or denying climate change was occurring at all. Among the recipients was Willie Soon, the Harvard-Smithsonian researcher who received more than $1m (£0.7m) from industry, according to documents obtained by Greenpeace through freedom of information filings. In a report released on the eve of their 2008 annual general meeting, the oil company pledged to stop funding groups that promote climate denial.  However, the company continued funding Soon for three more years. The documents show that Exxon gave Soon an additional $76,106 from 2008 to 2010, despite claiming to have stopped. The shareholder resolutions were easily defeated. The US environmentalist Bill McKibben says the failure of the family’s efforts is telling and signals the limits of shareholder engagement with some fossil fuel companies. “It makes a very clear point that engaging with fossil fuel companies to somehow get them to change their ways is unlikely to work if the family of the founder can’t get Exxon to shift.” The Rockefeller heirs also tried private and public pressure. Nearly 100 direct descendants also signed a letter expressing concern as investors and begging the company to stop funding climate deniers, Goodwin said. In 2006, another cousin, Senator Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, and Senator Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican, wrote a letter to the incoming Exxon chief executive Rex Tillerson, urging the company to stop funding climate deniers. “ExxonMobil’s longstanding support of a small cadre of global climate change sceptics, and those sceptics’ access to and influence on government policymakers, have made it increasingly difficult for the United States to demonstrate the moral clarity it needs across all facets of its diplomacy,” the letter said. “It is our hope that under your leadership, ExxonMobil would end its dangerous support of the ‘deniers’.” Most of the Rockefellers’ personal fortunes are held in trusts set up in the 1930s. The family retains only a tiny fraction of shares in Exxon. But the stand taken by the Rockefellers – at a time when Exxon was under attack from campaign groups for its support of climate denial – rankled company executives who had expected family members to be allies, Goodwin said. “They were shocked to find this family that had a strong link with them, and that they expect to find a great friend and admirer ... had such a negative view.” But even with the weight of that historical connection Exxon was still not persuaded to change. “I was pretty discouraged. Exxon has an extremely strong culture of believing that they are right and know what they are doing and really don’t need to listen to anybody else,” Goodwin went on. “It was clear that we didn’t have an ability to make more of a dent in that.” When the Guardian asked for a comment on the Rockefellers’ attempts to engage with the company it issued this statement. “ExxonMobil will not respond to Guardian inquiries because of its lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers.” Ken Cohen, ExxonMobil’s vice president for public and government affairs has previously been dismissive of the concept of fossil fuel divestment, saying that it is “out of step with reality”. “There are no scalable alternative fuels or technologies available today capable of taking the place of fossil fuels and offering society what those energy sources provide,” he wrote in a blog in October."
"Low-carbon fuels – think biofuel, hydrogen and electricity – currently comprise a mere 3% of today’s fuel mix. That needs to increase to 35% by 2050 if irreversible climate change is to be avoided, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The business-led sustainability group BSR, a global nonprofit that counts oil giants Shell, Chevron and ENI among its more than 250 members, is trying to map how such a transition could occur. In January, the organization released its recommendations for transitioning to low-carbon, sustainable fuels in order to prevent global warming from climbing past the critical 2C mark.  With energy companies sitting on 1,688bn barrels of oil reserves from the Arctic ice caps and Canada’s tar sands, it won’t be easy to push a transition forward. But the BSR-managed Future of Fuels coalition believes it’s doable, assuming organizations take the right steps at the right time. So, what’s the plan? Medium and heavy-duty vehicles make up just one in every 14 vehicles on the road, yet they account for more than 25% of road transportation fuel, according to the National Petroleum Institute’s figures in the BSR report. Extend that to commercial vehicles of all kinds and the proportion jumps to 43%. This number isn’t shrinking: a study commissioned by Exxon predicts that commercial vehicle demand will increase by 70% between now and 2040. The conclusion: change won’t happen without fleet operators and other major corporate fuel buyers getting onboard.  Fleet operators aren’t deaf to such numbers, says Ryan Schuchard, associate director for BSR’s climate change program. Nor are they clear what to do about them. “Fleet operators are all over the place,” says Schuchard, who blames the mess on competing messages from scientists, activists and fuel providers. “Ultimately, we need a stronger and clearer voice from the users of these fuels that [sustainability] matters.” Despite huge advances in alternative fuels over recent years, commercial viability is still a long way off. Full commercialisation won’t just happen – it requires massive investment, both in technology and infrastructure (think national networks of electric vehicle charging points, hydrogen filling stations and so on). Governments will have to pay up, but so too will the private sector – aided, most likely, by subsidies or other policy incentives.  There are many knowledge gaps in the world of low-carbon fuels. Scientists, for example, are getting close to calculating the carbon intensity of different fuel types. But finding consensus (or even data) on the water, social or economic footprints of low-carbon fuels is hard. Those studies that have been done mostly exist in isolation. Alongside the need for hard science is the need for agreement around basic scientific parameters, Schuchard says. “There are so many different ways to think about the impacts of fuel. Direct or cumulative, probable or actual, objective or situational, chronic or acute: it’s all a bit of a hodgepodge at present. The real challenge is to put these together into a unified framework.”  Proponents of various low-carbon fuels have plenty to say about why their fuel of choice is cheaper, betterand cleaner. Objective, performance-based data is what’s missing. “We need to flip from companies thinking about the type of fuel they use to the performance criteria of the fuel,” Schuchard says.  BSR hopes its proposed “fuel tool” will provide this. The tool, which is backed by Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS and PepsiCo, will aim to provide uniform lifecycle assessment information for all low-carbon fuels. It will start with carbon intensity, before expanding into other sustainability issues. A first iteration should be ready by the end of this year.  Don’t go betting on winners, BSR pleads. The last century might have been a one-horse petro-powered race, but the future is polyfuel. The rationale for a more diversified fuel mix is twofold. First, there’s the so-called “locked in” problem: what if you throw all your eggs into the liquefied natural gas basket, only to watch an as-yet-unknown wonder fuel spring up? Second, there are unintended consequences to consider. None of the current crop of low-carbon fuels is without question marks. For natural gas, it’s methane leaks in production. For biofuels, it’s land use. For electric, it’s dirty power stations. These need to be ironed out before even thinking about which option might possibly win out. As BSR’s report makes clear, low-carbon fuel will only become a meaningful reality if systemic changes take place soon. The level of atmospheric carbon has already surpassed 400 parts per million. Exceed 450 parts per million and we’re fried. Policymakers, scientists and businesses all have a role to play in preventing that.  Furthermore, overhauling today’s fossil-fuel dependency is not a short-term game. But none of this should stop companies from acting now. Schuchard: “There are uncertainties, but not enough for us to delay.” As a recent BSR report clarifies, there are practical steps corporate fleet operators and truck operators can take. Establishing a fuel-sustainability policy is a starter. Accelerating low-carbon solutions through collaboration is another.  As for the laggards and naysayers?

"If you were one of the 10 million air travellers shaking your fist at the departures board in April 2010, you will appreciate the fact that – even in this tectonically peaceful realm – we ignore volcanic threats at our peril. Despite being nothing to write home about in terms of size, the eruption from Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano brought air travel chaos to the UK and mainland Europe when its ash cloud grounded an astonishing 107,000 flights in the biggest air traffic shutdown since the second world war. The eight days of mayhem brought airline CEOs to the point of apoplexy and, once the ash had settled, the air travel business was left with a €1.3bn bill. The threat posed by Icelandic eruptions has since been recognised and added, retrospectively, to the UK’s National Risk Register, in the hope that next time we will be better prepared. But what about volcanic explosions further afield? These, it appears, are still regarded as posing no threat to our country, and so can be safely ignored. But turn the clock back 200 years and there is at least one event that suggests we ought to think twice. In April 1815, the biggest known eruption of the historical period blew apart the Tambora volcano, on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, 12,000km from the UK. What happened next testifies to the enormous reach of the biggest volcanic blasts. The Tambora volcano had shown no signs of life for 1,000 years; a single eruption in the previous five millennia provided the only indication that magma was still churning far beneath. It is very likely that the residents of the island considered the volcano extinct, and possible even that they did not know the impressive 4,300m (14,107ft) mountain – at the time, probably the highest in the East Indies – was a volcano at all. This all changed, however, with the rumblings and earthquakes of 1812, a full three years before the climactic blast. Over time, the seismic shocks were superseded by steam blasts and small ash explosions, engendering increasing trepidation on the island and signalling that something bigger might be imminent. It was. On 5 April 1815, a titanic explosion hurled a cloud of ash to a height of more than 30km. Violent, but short-lived, the blast lasted just two hours, after which the volcano returned to a state of brooding menace. According to the lieutenant governor, Thomas Stamford (later Sir Stamford) Bingley Raffles, to whom volcanologists are indebted for his accounts of the eruption, the detonation was so loud that it was mistaken across Java for cannon fire, causing consternation among the British troops, which had ousted the Dutch and French forces just a few years earlier. But the blast was small beer in comparison with what followed. After five days of relative calm, the climactic phase of the eruption began with a colossal explosion that launched a towering column of ash to the edge of space. For four or five days, utter blackness reigned across the island as the hurricane blasts of hot ash and scalding gas – known as pyroclastic flows – scoured the flanks of the volcano of everything and everyone, and drifts of ash metres thick entombed what few signs of life remained. When the explosions ceased and the darkness finally lifted, the view revealed was a vision of Tolkien’s Mordor; a grey landscape within which nothing lived or moved. The top 500m of the volcano was gone, blasted into smithereens, and replaced by a 6km-wide maw from which steam spiralled skywards. Communities on the flanks of the volcano had vanished, along with the lives of around 12,000 men, women and children. These, perhaps, were the lucky ones, as a further 60,000 survivors of the eruption succumbed slowly and agonisingly to famine or disease. But the consequences were not confined to this Indonesian backwater. The explosion was heard 2,600km away in Sumatra, while giant rafts of floating pumice – some kilometres in length – clogged shipping routes for years. The 50 cubic kilometres or so of ash ejected over the course of the eruption returned to earth in the following days and weeks, leaving a thick covering as far away as Borneo, 500km to the north. In addition to the ash, an estimated 200 million tonnes of microscopic sulphur particles pumped into the stratosphere, spread outwards from Sumbawa to form a giant aerosol veil that enclosed the planet and acted as a block to incoming sunlight. The consequences for the developed societies of the northern hemisphere were dire. A dry, sulphurous, fog draped itself across the landscape of eastern North America, causing temperatures to plunge and bringing unprecedented summer cold. In New York State, snow fell in June, while the bitter cold and killing frosts wiped out crops and halved the length of the growing season across much of the region. On the other side of the Atlantic, Europe saw summer temperatures down by 2C compared to the average for the decade; the unseasonal cold accompanied by incessant rains and – into the following winter – by unusually powerful storms. Analysis of climate records reveals that 1816, the so-called “year without a summer”, was the second coldest in the northern hemisphere of the past six centuries. The alleged cultural implications of this “volcano weather” for Europe are somewhat whimsical. The brilliant, gas-charged, sunsets have been declared by some to have provided the inspiration for some of JMW Turner’s more flamboyant skies. In a similar vein, the damp and gloom of the 1816 summer has been charged with setting the scene for both Lord Byron’s grim vision Darkness, and Mary Shelley’s gothic novel Frankenstein. For the less well-to-do of Europe, however, the Tambora eruption brought nothing less than hunger, disease and death. Widespread harvest failure resulted in the most serious famine for more than a hundred years, doubling the price of grain and spawning bread riots and widespreadcivil unrest. Such was the degree of breakdown of food supply that economic historian John Post has called the episode “the last, great subsistence crisis in the western world”. Malnourished and weakened, the starving succumbed rapidly to disease, with typhus in particular rife. Many tens of thousands are thought to have died across the continent, including more than 40,000 in Ireland alone. How would we fare if faced with a Tambora-sized eruption today? Is it even something we could feasibly prepare for? Received wisdom has it that globalisation would make it easier to cope. Should the European harvest fail, so the thinking goes, we can always buy our food from elsewhere. The very interconnectedness of world markets may, however, make things worse – the collapse of food production across Europe, parts of North America and perhaps elsewhere, could result in global shortages which in turn would drive a dramatic rise in the cost of food commodities. At the same time, the intense worldwide competition for food supplies, scarce as a consequence of the harvest failures, could drastically reduce the range of products available in the UK, interfere with supply and distribution, and bring about a collapse of the supermarkets’ ultra-sensitive, time-critical, stock-control systems, leaving their shelves increasingly depleted. While the less well-off could be priced out of purchasing even staple foodstuffs, panic buying by those who can afford it could quickly empty the stores. On top of this, harvest disruption in response to volcano weather might extend far beyond Europe, and might – in ensuing decades – be exacerbated by the consequence of rampant climate change. In spite of our modern farming methods and distribution systems, the ramifications could be far more severe than we expect. It is also worth considering that while the Tambora blast was approximately 1,000 times bigger than the 2010 Icelandic eruption, it was a minor hiccup in comparison with the greatest volcanic explosions of history. The Toba eruption that excavated the world’s largest volcanic crater in Sumatra, around 74,000 years ago, for example, injected hundreds of times more sulphur gases into the stratosphere than Tambora. The severe “volcanic winter” that followed probably lasted for several years and saw a third or more of the Earth covered with snow and ice and the wholesale dieback of vegetation. So, if a Tambora-scale scenario would be bad news, far worse could be lying in wait. While we can’t stop the next Tambora, nor handle its potential impacts on the climate and the harvest, we can ensure that contingency plans are in place to keep everyone adequately fed until the sulphur veil dissipates and temperatures return to normal. In the UK at present, contingency food supplies probably amount to little more than a few weeks’ worth. Some serious policy changes are needed if a future volcanic blast is not to bring about another subsistence crisis. Hazarding a guess about when and where the next Tambora will explode is far from an exact science. Eruptions on such a scale seem to happen, on average, a few times every millennium and one estimate holds that there is a 1 in 10 chance of a comparable event in the next 50 years. The Earth does not, however, operate to a timetable so such an eruption is equally likely to occur in any single year. There is even a chance that climate change may have a hand to play. Looking back at previous episodes of dramatic climate warming provides us with plenty of robust evidence for a vigorous volcanic response, most notably as our world heated up rapidly at the end of the last Ice Age. The reaction is most pronounced at ice-covered volcanoes, where melting reduces the weight acting on the volcanoes beneath, facilitating eruptions and even promoting the production of more magma. Coastal volcanoes may also be brought to eruption as the increased load of water, due to climbing sea levels, bends the crust around the margins of the oceans, squeezing magma upwards like toothpaste out of a tube. No volcano erupts without warning signs, caused by rising magma triggering earthquake swarms and inflating the ground surface. The problem is that out of our world’s 1,300 or more active and potentially active volcanoes, we monitor only a few hundred. The Tambora eruption reinforces the unofficial volcanological axiom: the longer the wait, the bigger the bang. That rule of thumb is borne out by the fact that fully half of the biggest eruptions since 1800 originated at volcanoes that had previously been dormant throughout history. What we should be keeping a special watch on then, in order to prepare ourselves for the next arrival of Vulcan’s shock troops, are those seemingly innocuous volcanoes that have kept their heads down for centuries or even millennia. While there are too many candidates to keep a serious eye on, the numbers can be narrowed down by focusing on those that have been recently “restless”; perhaps best regarded as the volcanologists’ term for “bubbling under”. Beyond that, though, it’s anyone’s guess. Bill McGuire is professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at UCL.

"The ice around the edge of Antarctica is melting faster than previously thought, potentially unlocking metres of sea-level rise in the long-term, researchers have warned. A team of US scientists looked at 18 years’ worth of satellite data and found the floating ice shelves that skirt the continent are losing 310km3 of ice every year. One shelf lost 18% of its thickness during the period. The loss of ice shelves does not contribute much directly to sea level rise. But they act like a cork in a bottle at the point where glaciers meet the sea – jamming the flow of ice from the massive ice sheets of east and west Antarctica. Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, said the rates of ice loss were unsustainable and could cause a major collapse. This is already occurring at the massive Pine Island glacier, where ice loss has doubled in speed over the last 20 years as its blocking ice shelf has melted. “This is a real concern, because such high rates of thinning cannot be sustained for much longer, and because in the places where Antarctic ice shelves have already collapsed this has triggered rapid increases in the rate of ice loss from glaciers above ground, causing global sea levels to rise,” he said.  The new research, published in the journal Science on Thursday, discovered for the first time that ice shelf melt is accelerating.  Dr Paul Holland, a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said the loss of the shelves would speed the complete collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet, which would eventually cause up to 3.5m of sea level rise. But he said it was highly unlikely this would occur this century. He said the “worst case scenario” for 2100 was that ice sheets would contribute an additional 70cm to the sea level rise caused by the warming of the ocean. The UN’s climate science body has not previously included the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland in its predictions for future sea level rise because scientists are not certain how fast they will slide into the ocean.  Holland said: “What humanity needs to know is what’s the sea level rise in 2100 and the biggest source of uncertainty in that is what’s going to happen to the ice sheets.” Over the past decade the loss of ice shelf volume in Antarctica increased from 25km3 to 310km3 every year.  It is unclear whether the loss of ice is directly related to man-made climate change or a cyclical change in ocean currents. But the extra sea level rise from ice sheets will exacerbate the rise caused by the expansion of oceans as the world warms.  Professor David Vaughan, director of science at BAS, said the findings would help scientists to make more accurate predictions about future sea level rise. “The rate of ice loss, especially when considered in terms of the percentage of ice lost in the last two decades, is dramatic. This research is a significant step towards improving our ability to predict the future of the Antarctic ice sheet and its contribution to global sea level rise.” The western coast ice shelves contributed the majority of the ice loss. The rate of loss increased by 70% in the last decade. Two shelves in this region could completely disappear within a century. Conversely, there were some areas in east Antarctica where the shelves stayed stable or grew slightly. Vaughan said the regional variations were predicted by previous studies. Holland said it was important not to confuse floating ice shelves, which can be up to 2km thick, with the much thinner sea ice. The one metre thick layer of sea ice around Antarctica has been expanding in recent decades, which some scientists think is because of increasing polar winds, which push the ice further out. NB: The article was changed at 9:35pm on March 26 to say that sea ice was one metre thick, rather than one mile."
"Student activists have occupied a historic hall at Swarthmore College, the alma mater of the United Nations climate chief, demanding the university cut its ties to fossil fuels.  The sit-in at the liberal arts college in Pennsylvania launches a new wave of protests by campus divestment campaigners across the US that will culminate in an old-style teach-in at Harvard on 13 April.   Some 37 students and six alumni entered the finance and investment office of the university at about 9am on Thursday.  “We are in,” said Stephen O’Hanlon, a political science student. He said the students planned to stay until university administrators agree to return to negotiations on a divestment plan. “At this point we have no plans to leave,” he said. Swarthmore, founded by Quakers, helped launch the campus divestment movement, now active at hundreds of universities across North America, Europe and Australia.  Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, graduated in 1979. The UN agency she heads, which is charged with guiding international negotiations towards a global deal on climate change, supports divestment.  “It sends a signal to companies, especially coal companies, that the age of ‘burn what you like, when you like’ cannot continue,” a spokesman said. Nearly two-thirds of Swarthmore’s 1,500 students signed a petition last December calling on the university to exit coal, oil and gas holdings. The Swarthmore Mountain Justice campaign is calling for an immediate freeze on new fossil fuel investments, followed by a staged withdrawal over five years. It urges the university to invest 1% of the endowment in renewable energy.  Nearly 100 faculty and about 1,000 alumni also support the divestment campaign, making this one of the biggest campaigns in Swarthmore’s history, the activists said. “We think the conflict between Swarthmore’s Quaker values and the destruction produced by the fossil fuel industry is untenable,” said Sara Blazevic, who is graduating this year in comparative literature. “There is a choice before the board to stand on the right side of history and to stand with our generation.” Campaigners and university administrators have held more than 30 meetings on divestment over the last four years. But those talks stalled in February after the university hosted a two-day discussion on climate change. The university said its opposition to divestment remains unchanged. “In 2013, following a two-year period of study and analysis the college chose not to divest from fossil fuels within its investment portfolio and this decision has remained unchanged since that time,” Gregory Brown, vice-president for finance and administration.  The university at the time dismissed divestment as a symbolic gesture, and warned divestment would slice $10m (£6.7m) to $15m off the income generated from Swarthmore’s $1.6bn endowment, much of which goes for scholarships.  The students reject the argument, citing the recent drop in oil prices and the uncertainties over the long-term of investing in fossil fuels.  “The investment committee denies the existence of the carbon bubble and false claims that no active managers can pursue a fossil-free investment strategy effectively. We know this is wrong,” said Guido Girgenti, a political science student due to graduate this year. “The carbon bubble poses a serious financial threat to our endowment.”"

"When Oslo sells the coal investments in its pension portfolio next month, it will set a historic precedent: the first capital city in the world to divest itself of that most polluting of fossil fuels. And the city is just the highest profile in a series of major urban areas that have made bold moves in recent weeks, ridding themselves of fossil fuel investments and becoming more carbon friendly. Leichardt, Australia voted to completely divest from fossil fuels within three years, while Byron Bay announced the decision to commit to zero emissions. Smaller US cities have already gotten on board in various ways, while last week in London, the GLA passed a motion asking the mayor to approve pulling City Hall’s pension fund out of all fossil fuel holdings. The list of cities that have divested appears set to grow ever longer. But does Oslo’s decision really mean much, given that Norway’s own pension fund – the gigantic Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) – continues to invest in fossil fuels? Is the momentum behind municipal divestment as unstoppable as it seems? And is divestment something that should, or could, be emulated by bigger cities like London?  Erik Lae Solberg, Oslo’s vice mayor for finance, admits his city’s decision to sell 40m krone (£3.3m) worth of coal investments in the Oslo Pension Fund isn’t much. But it sends a signal, he says, that Oslo does not want to contribute to the most climate-damaging fossil fuels, and that the city has a wider goal to be climate-friendly. “We’ve seen that coal is clearly the energy source that is most harmful,” Solberg said. “It’s been said that the cities of the world contribute about 70% of carbon emissions. So clearly the cities of the world are an important part of the problem of climate change.” In 2011, the council set a goal to reduce the city’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, and be climate-neutral by 2050. To do so, it has set out an array of measures, from 258 municipal electric-car charging stations, to recycling household waste for bio-fuel to power the city’s buses. Still, it is a conundrum for Norway, a major producer of oil (and, to a lesser extent, coal), which channels its excess petroleum revenues into its own pension fund. The government has so far resisted parliamentary calls for Norway’s 5.5tn krone (£470bn) nest egg, GPFG – the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund – to divest from fossil fuel. A government-appointed panel recently recommended that the fund not divest from fossil fuels, but rather set up a new climate-related exclusion criterion on a case-by-case basis. It concluded: “Energy production constitutes an important basis for our society, and fossil fuels – both petroleum and coal – will remain part of the mix for decades to come,” the report concluded in December. “The question is thus not whether investors will own these companies, but which investors are ‘good’ owners of these assets from a financial and ethical perspective.” The giant Norwegian fund held at least 316.7bn (£26.8bn) krone in oil, gas and coal investments in 2014, according to NGOs Urgewald and Future in Our Hands. It did divest from 52 coal companies last year, but Urgewald says it actually ended up increasing the value of its coal holdings, from 82.2bn krone in 2013 to 85.7bn krone last year. It wasn’t Norway’s cities which led the charge to divest, however. The divestment movement here has its roots in the small community of Eid, population 6,000, whose mayor Alfred Bjørlo took up the cause with its pension fund manager more than two years ago, after he was inspired by a city in the US. “It was towards the end of 2012 when, by chance, I read about the Seattle mayor’s plans to pull out of all coal funds,” said Bjørlo. “I thought if a city like Seattle could do something like this, then it is fully possible in Norway.” It was indeed Seattle that was the first US city to join the Fossil Free divestment campaign led by 350.org. Mayor Mike McGinn announced in December 2012 that Seattle would not invest any of its $1.4bn operating cashflow in fossil fuel companies, and would seek to divest its $1.9bn pension fund and $700m deferred compensation plan. Whether the world’s megacities will follows suit is another question entirely. Last week’s vote to call on the mayor to divest London’s’s £2bn GLA Group Investment Syndicate from fossil fuel investments, as well as to ask the chair of the £4.8bm portfolio London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA) to commit to divestment, falls on Boris Johnson – whose office pointed out what it considered the drawbacks. “The mayor takes climate change extremely seriously,” a spokesperson said, adding that the mayor’s office believed a sudden divestment on London’s part from fossil fuel investments would cause “a huge disruption to the world economy, let alone the retirement plans for millions of UK residents”. There was, the spokesperson said, “a realism that there needs to be transition away from fossil fuel and not a sudden cliff-edge”.  Danielle Paffard, a campaigner for Fossil Free UK divestment, calls Johnson “a fossil fuel head” and is less than optimistic. But she says that with mayoral elections next year, the issue of divestment could become a big part of the debate. In the meantime, Fossil Free has set its sights on encouraging some European cities, such as Amsterdam, Berlin and Stockholm, to divest. Her US colleague, Amy Miller, points to the progress being made in states such as Massachusetts, which just received the support of the local Great Barrington Select Board; the Minneapolis City Council, which will vote on the issue next week; and great strides being made in Washington DC and her hometown of New York City, which sits on a $160bn pension fund (“a very big goal,” Miller says).  Whether New York is any more likely than London to divest, however, is up in the air, she says. City politicians remain concerned about the possible financial impact of divesting. “They prefer to remain investors, and to influence through active engagement,” she said. “But it just doesn’t work. Are you asking [these fossil fuel companies] to leave 80% in the ground?”"
"The United Reformed Church (URC) of Scotland has committed to pull out its investments in fossil fuel companies.  The resolution was passed with “overwhelming support” on Saturday at a meeting of their General Synod at the Scottish Police College in Fife. The synod contains 50 churches and is one of 13 synods representing 60,000 members in the URC in Great Britain. A spokesman for the synod says about 4% of its total portfolio is invested in oil, coal and gas companies, including Shell and Total. They have committed to divest from all such companies and to not make any future fossil fuel investments. Eco-Congregation Scotland, the environmental movement for Scottish churches, estimate that their current assets amount to £70,000. On March 16 the Guardian began a campaign calling on the world’s two largest charitable foundations – the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – to divest from fossil fuels. The campaign, which has attracted more than 144,000 signatures, is part of a new climate change project introduced by editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger.  There are several times more fossil fuel reserves in the ground than can be burned if the world is to reach international targets to keep global warming within a 2C rise and avoid catastrophic climate change. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has said that “the vast majority of reserves are unburnable” which would mean that the assets of fossil fuel companies would become “stranded” or worthless. Reverend John Humphreys, moderator of the church’s synod in Scotland, said: “I’m delighted that the synod has shown a clear commitment to ethical investment. They have taken affirmative action against climate change and put people and the planet at the heart of their decision making. We hope and pray that other churches will feel able to respond ethically to the growing threat of catastrophic climate change.” The URC joins a fast-growing divestment movement, begun by the global climate organisation 350.org. Since its beginning in 2010, more than 220 institutions have committed to divest including universities, pension funds and philanthropic foundations. The divestment campaign targeting the URC emerged from a small group of its members. They say it was prompted by a recommendation from the World Council of Churches, which ruled out fossil fuel investments in July 2014. The umbrella organisation represents half a billion Christians and 345 member churches worldwide. Mark Letcher, campaign co-ordinator for the faith-based divestment campaign at Bright Now, said the decision by the URC “marks a huge step forward for the UK church divestment campaign, which is gathering momentum as churches around the world disinvest. This decision demonstrates the church’s commitment to lead the urgently needed transition away from fossil fuels. We call on other UK churches to follow them”. The Church of England (C of E) has set up a group to take advice on climate change and investment and has been reviewing their strategy for 18 months. The diocese of Birmingham passed a motion on Sunday calling on the C of E to divest, following a similar motion passed by the Oxford diocese in November 2014. The C of E is due to report back later this year. • This article was amended on 29 March 2015. An earlier version said that the United Reformed Church of Scotland represented 1,472 churches. The Scottish synod represents 50 churches."

"This month, Costa Rica’s state-run electricity company announced that the country had gone 75 days using only renewable resources for electricity. Costa Ricans are the first in the world to power their country for so long without the use of fossil fuels, and the record-breaking achievement was quickly picked up by news agencies all over the world. Costa Rican residents have certainly benefited from the clean energy, with electricity prices set to tumble between 7% and 15% in April. But despite the world’s congratulatory backslaps for the renowned green country, its clean energy production is not likely to last at this scale, nor is it a model that would work in many other parts of the world. Costa Rica gets most of its electricity from hydroelectric plants and a recent period of unusually heavy rain allowed the country to reach the milestone. This clean power is bolstered by geothermic energy from the country’s volcanoes and a small amount of wind and solar power. Most years, these sources allow Costa Rica to generate approximately 90% of its electricity without burning fossil fuels. The abundance of natural resources, combined with Costa Rica’s strong commitment to environmentalism, spurred policymakers to set a goal for carbon neutrality by 2021. If Costa Rica meets the target, it will likely become the first carbon-neutral country in the world, but there are obstacles. The downside to hydropower is that it requires consistent rainfall. Though the dams in Costa Rica are now full, just months ago the country was suffering one of the worst droughts in its history. This forced Costa Rican utility companies to burn fuel to generate power, releasing greenhouse gases and causing rate rises. This unpredictability in rain patterns isn’t unique to Costa Rica and is considered to be one of the primary effects of climate change. Ironically, this means that the bulging reservoirs that gave Costa Rica its green energy surge are likely to be attributable, at least partially, to climate change. And while there is plenty of clean power today, it could just as easily be gone tomorrow. Even if Costa Rica were able to sustain 100% clean electricity production, the country still relies on petroleum for transportation, and emissions from this sector are the largest hurdle the country faces in reaching its carbon neutrality goal. The environment ministry reports that fuel burned by cars, buses and trains accounted for almost 70% of the country’s carbon emissions in 2014. According to customs there are only 200 or so hybrid cars in Costa Rica to take advantage of the energy produced by renewables on the grid. The fact that even a country like Costa Rica, which has made major investments to produce clean energy, still struggles with these obstacles, shows just how difficult it would be for larger, more industrialised nations to follow in its footsteps. With a population under 5 million and no major industry, Costa Rica uses much less power than most developed countries, and its geography of tightly packed volcanoes, rivers and mountains is more suited to producing clean power than most. Though small, Costa Rica is able to produce enough energy to power itself while leaving much of its wilderness intact. To tap into all of the natural resources in the rest of the world would require environmental loss of a different kind, by altering rivers, displacing people and animals, and destroying vegetation. Solar and nuclear power offer other alternatives for clean energy but need more research and investment to make them cost-effective and safe. Even if it were possible to power the world’s largest countries with renewable energy, the destruction required would be unfathomable with only the current technologies. These limitations, along with a lack of political will, are what has meant the world relied on fossil fuels for almost 90% of its energy since 1999. As admirable as Costa Rica’s feats in energy production may be, its model is not realistic for the world’s largest energy consumers. But what most of the industrialised world lacks in natural resources, it more than makes up for with other assets. To seriously make a difference in global energy consumption would require significant investment in the research and design of new sources of non-polluting energy, a task most easily funded by richer nations. While the world may not be able to tailor its energy programmes to Costa Rica’s geography-specific model, the lesson here is not about science and infrastructure, but about volition and ideals."
"The Australian government has been urged to place US-style regulations on coal-fired power plants to ensure they shut down, as a new analysis highlights the vast scale of emissions pumped out by the largest carbon dioxide polluters in the country. Just 10 companies are responsible for a third of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) study. “We have got to close down the worst polluting plants in Australia,” said Geoff Cousins, ACF’s president. “At the moment the government is offering no incentives for companies to get off fossil fuels.” Cousins said he would welcome the kind of direct regulations placed by Barack Obama’s US administration on coal-fired plants, effectively making them untenable without expensive carbon capture technology. “In Australia there are taxpayer subsidies to keep these plants open, whereas in the US, China and parts of Europe, the government is taking actual direct action to close them down,” Cousins said. When direct and indirect emissions, such as energy consumption by a coal power station, are considered, the top 10 polluters emitted 158m tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2013-14. Most of this pollution comes from the production and use of energy. The list is headed by Energy Australia, responsible for 20.8m tonnes of heat-trapping gas. Macquarie Generation, at 20.3m tonnes, and AGL Energy, at 19.9m tonnes, are in second and third position. The rest of the top 10 comprises energy and mining giants, including Rio Tinto, Origin Energy and Alcoa.  EnergyAustralia and Origin Energy chalked up the largest rises in emissions from 2012-13 to 2013-14, at 66% and 230% respectively. This was due to the companies buying power stations previously owned by the New South Wales government. A separate ranking of Australia’s most polluting power stations is dominated by ageing power stations burning carbon-intensive brown coal in Victoria’s La Trobe valley.  Hazelwood, owned by GDF Suez, emits 15.5m tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, followed in the rankings by Yallourn and Loy Yang B. The ACF report also notes the political donations made by the large energy and mining companies. For example, EnergyAustralia donated more than $45,000 to the Labor and Coalition parties, at both state and federal level, in 2013-14. Victoria has previously considered shutting down its most polluting power stations, only for the plan to be shelved.  The introduction of carbon pricing included a large hand-out to the brown coal polluters, while the federal Coalition’s new Direct Action plan, which provides voluntary grants to lower emissions, is aimed at “cleaning up” power plants rather than shutting them down. The UN’s IPCC has said that fossil fuel energy without largely unproven carbon capture technology must be phased out by the end of the century if the world is to avoid highly dangerous climate change.  The ACF said Australia needed to start phasing out fossil fuels, pointing to Energy Supply Association of Australia data that shows wind and solar energy projects already earmarked could provide a quarter of Australia’s electricity demand by 2023-24 “These companies should not be paid to shut down,” Cousins said. “There should be compensation for redundancies and retraining, but to pay them to shut down is wrong.” But a spokesman for Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, said: “Labor ran a failed contract-for-closure program. By contrast, we have passed the emissions reduction fund which is about to hold its first auction. “We are not about to abandon our legislated policy in favour of an utterly failed policy.” Cousins said there was a “real disconnect” between large energy companies acknowledging the risks posed by climate change and their opposition to the renewable energy target, a measure to increase clean energy that the Coalition wants to pare back.  “I think it will be very possible to change the policies of the government on this matter,” Cousins said. “There has been a remarkable coming together of events – climate change got on the G20 agenda against the wishes of the government, there was that remarkable speech by Obama at the Queensland University and there was the China-US climate deal. “I think this has led the population to realise that we are being left behind, that the government has pulled the wool over our eyes. And now we see fossil fuels and climate change are back in the top five areas of concern in voting intentions. It’s clear the government is completely out of kilter with the rest of the world.”"
"Scottish politicians should consider congestion charges, reducing speed limits and rethink plans to cut air passenger duty after Scotland again missed its climate targets, an influential advisory committee has said. The committee on climate change, the Scottish government’s official advisers, said far-reaching action was needed to reduce CO2 emissions after the reduction targets were missed for the third time by some 4.5%.  While the figures for 2012 showed Scotland’s emissions were better overall than the UK’s and it has been faster on installing renewables, the CCC said it needed to do far more on cutting transport emissions – which are not falling – tackling home fuel use, and that it would require deeper cuts from the wider public sector. Environmentalists have predicted the Scottish government would also miss the 2013 target by a very wide margin, after failing repeatedly to implement tougher measures to cut transport, home energy and public sector emissions – the sectors over which it has direct control.  The committee said Scottish ministers should weigh up the impact of their plans to cut air passenger duty when Holyrood gets control over the duty – because it could increase aviation emissions – and use other new powers to cut speed limits on roads. The CCC said: “Meeting future targets remains very challenging, and will require further action in a number of sectors including low-carbon heat, energy efficiency, transport and agriculture and land use. Even in areas of good progress, challenges remain to achieve the stretching targets set out by the Scottish government.” The Scottish government was pushed by opposition parties in 2008 into accepting an ambitious emissions reduction goal of 42% by 2020, and has since boasted it has “world-beating” targets, relying heavily on its successful expansion of onshore wind farms. The CCC said those renewable energy policies were having a positive effect: with green electricity accounting for 44% of Scottish consumption in 2013, and a 40% growth in community owned energy projects, Scotland would likely meet its 2020 green energy target early. However, only about 30% of Scotland’s emissions are linked directly to policy areas directly in the control of the Edinburgh government. It relies heavily on action by the UK and EU to cut most of its emissions, including improvements in vehicle efficiency, home appliances and lighting.  Scotland’s target for 2013 involves the most ambitious annual cut of the entire programme of 10% from its target in 2012 of 53.22mte (million tonnes equivalent) to 47.98mte. It actually allowed 55.6mte to be emitted in 2012, widening the gap between the target and expected emissions for the following year. Tom Ballantine, the chairman of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said this was the fourth time the CCC had urgedministers to take tougher action. “This is a crucial year for the fight against global warming, as world leaders meet in Paris in December to thrash out a new global agreement on climate change,” he said.  “Scotland is rightly proud of its world-leading legislation on climate change but, as the CCC highlights today, the Scottish government must deliver what is set out in our Climate Change Act, so that we can retain our credibility in this area and show other countries what the benefits are of a low carbon nation.”  The report was drafted before Scottish Power announced on Monday that it was planning to close down Longannet coal-fired power station, Scotland’s largest single polluter and one of Europe’s dirtiest power plants. Longannet emitted 9.5mmte of CO2 in 2013, 17% of the 55.6mte of CO2 that Scotland emitted the previous year. But WWF Scotland said that under the EU’s current emissions trading regime, where the energy sectors CO2 output is pooled across the EU, its closure would have no impact on Scotland’s emissions because another country could open a power station in its place. That would change in 2020, when the emissions accounting regime would include each country’s power stations onto its domestic totals, said Gina Hanrahan, WWF Scotland’s climate and energy policy officer. “Longannet’s closure is really good news overall in terms of Scotland’s real emissions, but the way its emissions are counted, it is not credited to Scotland yet,” she said. "
"When the president of Vanuatu said that years of progress had been wiped out by a single extreme weather event, it was both a warning and an echo. Hurricane Mitch did the same to Nicaragua and Honduras in 1998; and in 2005 political failure combined with the collapse of sea defences under the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina to wreck the rich, vibrant culture of New Orleans. Climatic extremes in a warming world stand to reverse human progress and expose broken social contracts. But in the case of Vanuatu there seems to be a crueller twist. Vanuatu is distinguished by having come top of a global index that measures how ecologically successful (low in impact) nations are at producing good lives for their people – so-called “happy life years”. Vanuatu beat all other nations through treading lightest on the Earth for the quality and length of life its people enjoyed. Now it sits in the pathway of a giant climatic steamroller, fuelled by the energy-intensive lifestyles of nations much further down that index. Its people are the national equivalent of the individual who leads an exemplary, healthy life only to suffer chronically due to someone else’s bad habit – innocent, global victims of passive smoking. Vanuatu’s president, Baldwin Lonsdale, was quick to point the finger of blame at manmade climate change for the severity of Cyclone Pam, saying that “the cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected”. Many may think it’s too soon to jump to such conclusions. For years cautious scientists have balked at attributing the effect of warming to individual events. Attribution can sometimes be hard to prove, either for methodological reasons of complexity or due to lack of data. While trepidation remains, things have changed rapidly. Instead of simple claims of cause and effect, climate scientists now readily discuss how the probability of any particular event has been raised by the existence of warming. Hence joint work in 2011 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US and the UK’s Met Office concluded that a Texas heatwave was 20 times more likely to be caused by climate change than by natural weather variation. A winter warm spell in Britain the same year was 62 times more likely than in the 1960s. The Met Office’s Hadley Centre now confidently states that it “can identify any changed risk of such events”. In time, more analysis will be done on Cyclone Pam, but Lonsdale’s personal experience and gut reaction fits a pattern of expectations described in the most recent and most comprehensive collation of science on extreme events in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. It concluded that: “The frequency of the most intense storms will more likely than not increase in some basins. More extreme precipitation near the centres of tropical cyclones making landfall is projected in North and Central America, east Africa, west, east, south and southeast Asia as well as in Australia and many Pacific islands.” So, while the present is pretty bad for Vanuatu, in a warming world the future looks set to worsen. For this island nation, that is bitterly ironic. Vanuatu is an archipelago in the western Pacific, famous for having no regular military. When it topped the index in 2006 its ecological footprint per person was no higher than those in non-industrialised countries like Mali and Swaziland, life expectancy matched that in Turkey, and life satisfaction levels were considered as high as New Zealand’s. It is democratic, rich in natural wealth but, being remote, exports little, avoiding the scramble of competing in global markets. It is also hugely culturally diverse with more than 100 languages spoken across its islands. Small island states tend to do very well in the index topped by Vanuatu. Over countless generations and in the face of geographical isolation, many Pacific islands developed more cooperative economies and highly resilient farming methods. In a warming world they are bellwethers, and carry lessons for us all. If climate change renders small island states unliveable, the international community will sooner or later have to learn to accept and support environmental refugees. Though this would be tragic, remote island populations can, at least, relocate. However, blue island-planet populations cannot. We will seal our own fate if we fail to learn to share and live within our overall environmental thresholds. There is a long way to go. The World Bank recently tweeted that climate change exacerbates the risk of already costly disasters. It’s a shame then, that as recently as 2012-13 the World Bank Group increased lending to $2.7bn for fossil fuel projects, including toward new oil and gas exploration. It’s one more reason why the Guardian’s campaign for divestment from fossil fuels is so important. If you haven’t signed it already, do so for Vanuatu."
"The Abbott government will ask for advice about how far Australia should cut its greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, and what policies it should use to make the long-term cuts. A discussion paper to be released this week asks how deep Australia’s emissions cuts should be, what domestic policy should be used to make the cuts and how Australia should compare its greenhouse gas reduction targets with other countries.  The paper will inform a special ministerial taskforce, chaired by the prime minister Tony Abbott, which must decide on Australia’s post-2020 target by mid year, ahead of a United Nations meeting in Paris in December where it is hoped a post-2020 emissions reduction deal can be struck. Many observers, including the communications minister Malcolm Turnbull, and all available modelling, have concluded the government’s existing “Direct Action” policy of competitive grants is unlikely to be able to deliver deeper emissions reduction costs at an affordable price.  The chair of the bureaucratic team working on the policy told an Australian National University seminar last week his job was to advise on the target and to give the government a “plausible menu” of policies to meet it. “Along with the post-2020 target it will be important to think about how Australia will reach the target,” deputy secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, David Gruen, said. He said the taskforce was “looking at a broad range of policies with a fresh perspective and is not ruling anything out at this stage”. Decisions were up to the government, but his taskforce would be looking at “policies across the broad range of relevant sectors of the economy that could achieve abatement in a cost-effective manner ... for example measures to improve energy productivity”. The European Union has announced it will reduce emissions by 40% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels and officially submitted this target to the UN. The United States has said it will reduce emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 levels in 2025, and is expected to lodge this pledge soon. China has announced plans to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and “to make best efforts to peak early”. The discussion paper will emphasise Australia’s “unique national circumstances” including its reliance on resource exports, geography and population growth. The ministerial taskforce that must decide on a target by mid year includes Abbott, foreign minister Julie Bishop, environment minister Greg Hunt, trade minister Andrew Robb and industry minister Ian Macfarlane.  Successive governments have established taskforces to examine climate policy, including the 2006 taskforce headed by the then head of the prime minister’s department Peter Shergold, which recommended the Howard government introduce an emissions trading scheme and two reports by professor Ross Garnaut to the former Labor government to inform its emissions trading scheme, which the Abbott government repealed. The Abbott government would never introduce a new economy-wide emissions trading scheme, but its existing policy contains a provision which, if activated, could create a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme for heavy industry and electricity generators and make longer-term emission reductions more affordable. The government is about to issue another discussion paper about this so-called “safeguards mechanism”."

"“Faith is an island in the setting sun,/ but proof is the bottom line for everyone,” wrote a certain songwriter who could well be among a wealth of treasures spilled onto the shores of this week’s nominations. But is an island a place to escape reality, or face it? An adventure where dreams come true, like that of 1970s series Fantasy Island featuring the smooth-talking Ricardo Montalbán and his squeaky sidekick, Tattoo, played by Hervé Villechaize? Or a place where hopes are dashed on the rocks of isolated despair, as in Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, before the protagonist eventually finds inner strength and friendship in Friday? The answer must surely include both – song takes us to a new place, but also seeks a new perspective from it. Islands are a place to provide that relief.  The 17th-century metaphysical poet, John Donne said: “No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent.” He had something there. Sometimes we may a wish to escape society, catch up with ourselves, perhaps write a song, but we cannot deny our connection with or need for other people – for after all, how can a song exist unless someone else hears it? Abba’s Björn and Benny, for example, escaped to splendid rocky Scandinavian isolation to write their songs, but always came back to perform them. We, like all living things, need the recognition of others, otherwise we are damned. For there is only one good context in which to be dammed - when building a small island because you are a beaver.  Islands in song can be as much psychological as geographical, philosophical as geological. They may be sandy, and tropical, but are often topical, and tell you that life is often less of a beach, more of bitch. Thomas More’s Utopia conceives of an ideal society in the form of a fictional island. The third part of Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels describes the floating island of Laputa where fantastical science experiments take place, but they in fact parody the real world of ideas. Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island brings us escapism and adventure, but also teaches us the moral lessons of greed.  Shakespeare’s The Tempest takes us to a magical, poetic place, a mirror in which to view social control through the words of Prospero and the basics of half-formed humanity in Caliban. Isla Nublar is where dinosaurs are mistakenly recreated in the concept of Jurassic Park. Craggy Island is the place from which Father Ted wants to escape, but where others cannot function without him. Either that or it’s just a brilliant sitcom. Danger Island is where the Banana Splits have no danger, only fun. And Lost, the behemoth fantasy TV series about plane crash survivors on a remote island, reveals one universal truth about how screenwriters can, where plot is concerned, become utterly and completely – lost. BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs is, however, a true terra firma, a haven of treasure among splashy media awash with rocks, shingle and shite. One of my very favourite episodes features the Hollywood heart-throb actor George Clooney. In a surprisingly witty and charming edition, he revealed that the one record he would keep, if all the others were washed away from his choices, would be William Shatner doing Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, because if forced had to listen to that to the end of his days, it would give motivation to “hollow out my own leg and make a canoe out of it to get off the island”. Pure class. But let us now also escape back to reality, and quickly fly over some actual islands that may also be mentioned in your song suggestions. What islands are richer in their musical heritage than the reggae of the Caribbean? Or the tropical from the Bahamas, South Pacific, or Hawaii, and the true sound of the ukelele? Or the volcanic beauty and utterly unique culture of Iceland and all of its output? If such songs refer to island culture, then they are valid.  By contrast, songs may be inspired by the more urban Coney Island or Long Island of New York, a different haunt of musical inspiration. And then there are the remoter places – the natural wonders of the volcanic Galápagos islands or Madagascar, where evolutionary isolation brought about extraordinary species such as the giant tortoise and lemur. Then there is the dark history of Easter Island, where former inhabitants destroyed their future by cutting down all the trees, and, perhaps more broadly related to human behaviour this, Vanuata, recently devastated by cyclone Pam, surely evidence of human-induced climate change. Islands are a prism through which we can see our world, but they have also been prisons from which to escape – if, for example, you are Papillon, aka Henri Charrière, who fled Devil’s Island in 1969, or Robben Island, from which the great Nelson Mandela escaped by other means - his strength of character and the willpower and bravery of those who supported him. Some islands are artificial, such as the obscenely expensive projects of Qatar’s Pearl resorts or Dubai’s Palm Islands. For less recreational reasons, the Netherlands has the world’s largest artificial island – the Flevodolder – built as part of a vast project to withstand flooding.  But of course thousands of islands made by natural upheaval, and course includes those closer to home – the cluster we call the UK and Ireland, which though are not desert, oceanic or tropical, are continental islands, special in their own form of isolation and interesting genetic mix. Again if they are referred to as islands in song, they can come into contention. In Richard II, Shakespeare referred to it as “this scepter’d isle, this other Eden, demi-paradise, this fortress build by Nature itself”, but perhaps what has given the UK its true fertility, particularly in song, is best summed up by that cantankerous cultural figure John Lydon: “Britain is an island; it’s always had a constant ebb and flow of immigration – it makes it a better place.” This week’s far from isolated Robinson Crusoe, who, playing the calypso or any other number of styles, is RR’s very own venerably wise veteran sonofwebcore.

"Plans to boost the North Sea oil industry, announced in the budget, could lead to the UK emitting tens of millions more tonnes of CO2 over the next five years, Guardian analysis reveals. The chancellor, George Osborne, this week announced a package of measures in the budget designed to help boost North Sea oil production in the face of plummeting global oil prices. The moves include tax cuts on profits for oil producers, a new investment allowance, and funding for seismic surveys to help find oil deposits. In all, the measures will cost the exchequer £1.3bn over the next five years. The budget document states that the aim is for the measures to lead, in the next five years, to at least 120m barrels “of oil equivalent, of additional production”.  The assumption prompted the Green party to question why the “greenest government ever” was providing additional support for burning fossil fuels.  “This Lib Dem, Conservative coalition government started claiming to be the ‘greenest government ever’, and ended giving huge subsidies to the oil industry,” said Andrew Cooper, the party’s spokesman on energy. “More investment is really needed in energy efficiency and renewable energy, precisely the areas this government has cut … this government are climate-change deniers in all but name.” Figures published by the US Environmental Protection Agency suggest that on average each barrel of oil burned emits 0.43 tonnes of carbon dioxide, suggesting that if the UK budget measures succeed in producing an extra 120m barrels of oil in the next five years, these will add 50m tonnes of carbon dioxide to the UK’s emissions, if burned domestically. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, last week pledged his support for the Guardian’s “keep it in the ground” campaign, which urges keeping most of the discovered fossil fuel deposits in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change. However, Davey defended supporting North Sea oil extraction in the short-term as a solution to the UK’s dependence on Russia and the Middle East for energy resources. “I have been clear that coal assets are very risky but you are not going to get rid of cars and gas heating systems overnight and so we are going to need quite a lot of oil and gas,” he said. “The question is, would you like that to come from Russia and Qatar or locally where it is well regulated, gives us jobs and provides tax revenues?” The non-partisan Green Alliance noted it was possible for the UK to produce more oil without increasing global emissions, but said this relied on another country cutting back its own extractions in response to Britain’s increased activity. Dustin Benton, the Green Alliance’s head of energy and resources, said: “From a climate perspective, as long as UK oil production displaces production elsewhere, there’s no effect – other oil producers will just lose market share. But if new oil production increases the total amount of oil that gets burnt, then there’s an inconsistency with our climate aims.” Benton also said there was a risk that subsidy and investment in North Sea oil could be a waste of money, due to the relatively high cost of extracting oil from those fields as opposed to elsewhere in the world. If oil prices stayed low, or if serious policies were enacted to tackle climate change, the investment and infrastructure could easily be wasted. “From the perspective of financial prudence, the question is whether changing tax treatment to shift infrastructure investment towards high cost oilfields increases the risk that these will become stranded assets – even the Bank of England is concerned at this prospect,” he said.  A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “The UK will continue to need oil and gas as a part of our energy mix even as we cut our carbon emissions over the coming decades. That includes working to maximise home-grown energy sources rather than relying on imports from volatile markets like Russia and the Middle East, which is why the government continues to work hard to support the future of the North Sea industry.”"

"Europe’s wild bee population is in dramatic decline with nearly one in 10 species facing the threat of extinction, according to the first ever assessment of all the continent’s nearly 2,000 bee species. Another 5.2% of bee species are likely to be threatened in the near future, while more than a quarter of species such as the European bumblebees are at risk of dying out, said the study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Population trends for 79% of the continent’s pollinators – mostly wild honeybees – are still unknown, but over a third of bee populations for which data was collected were shown to be in decline.   “This report should be a wake up call to the ecological disaster that is unfolding in Europe’s countryside,” Ariel Brunner, the head of EU policy at Birdlife told the Guardian. “It’s very clear that something is going horribly wrong with our agricultural practices which are the main driver of these declines, whether it is increased pesticide use, the destruction and conversion of grasslands, or the loss of natural vegetation and intensified farming methods.”  The IUCN paper said that sources of food and forage for pollinators have been hit hard by intensive silage production at the expense of hay-cropping. The widespread use of insecticides and herbicides has also reduced the availability of flowers and promoted rank grassland, which is low in flowering plants and legume species.   Climate change has been another factor in the dip in bee numbers, the report said, because heavy rainfalls, droughts and increased temperatures can alter and reduce habitats that species have adapted to over many generations.  Of 1,965 bee species in Europe, the EU-funded paper found 9.2% were threatened with extinction, 12.6% of species were stable and 0.7% were increasing. But the peer-reviewed research by more than 40 experts was constrained by a lack of verifiable data, and the true number of bees at risk could be higher.  “This assessment is the best understanding we have had so far on wild bees in Europe,” said Jean-Christophe Vié, the deputy director of IUCN’s Global Species Programme. “However, our knowledge about them is incomplete as we are faced with an alarming lack of expertise and resources.”   Bees play an essential role in sustaining ecosystems and pollinating crops and the IUCN is calling for urgent investment into new research on ways of reversing the decline. The EU’s environment commissioner Karmen Vella described the study’s findings as “very worrying”.  “Our quality of life – and our future – depends on the many services that nature provides for free,” he said. “If we don’t address the reasons behind this decline in wild bees, and act urgently to stop it, we could pay a very heavy price indeed.”  However, Brussels has been criticised for the application of measures to ‘green’ its Common Agricultural Policy, which were intended to make farmland management across all 28 EU states more sustainable.   “It is shocking that just a couple of weeks ago, the commission accepted a French implementation of this ‘greening’ which recognises maize monoculture as green,” Brunner said. “Monoculture is about the most unfriendly thing you can do to biodiversity in general and pollinators in particular. In the name of greening the CAP, we are actively fomenting this crisis with public policies.”  The annual value of global crop pollination by bees has been estimated at €153bn globally and €22bn in Europe.  More than a third of global agricultural volumes come from crops supported by bees, while 84% of crops grown for human consumption require insect pollination to enhance product quality and yields."

"This was the consensus reached by the collection of journalists that met in January to plan the project. It’s also the consensus reached by many of the world’s most prolific scientists, economists and statesmen.  Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England has warned that “the vast majority of reserves are unburnable” while Desmond Tutu has called for an apartheid style boycott of fossil fuel companies. Barack Obama has said simply: “We’re not going to be able to burn it all”.  To avoid catastrophic and runaway consequences, the increase in global temperatures must be kept to 2C above pre-industrial levels.  Yet the oil, gas and coal reserves that companies plan to burn will emit quantities of carbon that will take us well beyond that target. If we continue on our current trajectory, international scientists estimate we will exceed the 2C rise by mid-century. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground to avoid this.  “You’ve been negotiating all my life,” said Canadian student Anjali Appadurai as she stood on the podium at the 2011 international climate conference in Durban, South Africa. In the 23-year history of these negotiations, there has as yet been no mention of keeping fossil fuels in the ground. The focus has been on regulating emissions, not on regulating production. “Breaking such silences requires a conscious and painful effort,” writes George Monbiot in his piece on the issue. “It seemed so obvious, so overwhelming, that I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t on everyone’s lips. Before writing about it, I circled the topic like a dog investigating a suspicious carcass. Why, I wondered, is no one touching this? Is it toxic?” In December, representatives from 196 countries will meet to negotiate an international agreement on climate change. As important as this will be, the climate fight won’t wait for Paris, argues environmental campaigner Bill McKibben. He is the founder of 350.org, a global climate movement that has founded the fastest growing divestment campaign in history. It targets institutions – from universities to pension funds to faith organisations – and asks them to move their investments out of the fossil fuel industry. According to a Guardian analysis of their most recent tax filings, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have a minimum of $1.4bn (£1bn) invested in oil, coal and gas companies. These endowments are held by 35 of the top 200 fossil fuel companies, according to rankings of their reserves. Despite declaring that climate change demands that the world “moves much more aggressively – right now”, the world’s largest charitable foundation refused to comment on fossil fuel investment. A spokesman for Bill Gates’ private office said: “We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognise that there are many views on how best to address it. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in the effort [to develop clean energy].” At least £450m worth of the Wellcome Trust’s £18bn endowment is invested in Shell, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and BP. The foundation has refused the Guardian’s call for it to divest, arguing that the campaign is only a “grand gesture” and that engagement with the companies “offers a better prospect for change than divestment”. However, last week the Guardian revealed that Wellcome disposed of $138m (£94m) it had invested in ExxonMobil, the oil company that has funded climate change denial. In the past 10 days, more than 140,000 of you have signed our petition asking the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation to commit to divesting from fossil fuels and to immediately freeze any new investments. Tilda Swinton, Yotam Ottolenghi and Bianca Jagger have added their support to the cause. Ed Davey, minister for energy and climate change has given the campaign his strong backing, while calling for divestment from “very risky” coal assets.  Keep it in the ground: Guardian climate change campaign pic.twitter.com/7rK3SuNSQp http://t.co/Cv4A9QL4ct Some of Europe’s most senior scientists have also spoken out. Professor Anne Glover, former chief scientific adviser to the European commission said: These are leaders. These are people that others look to. So they have enormous responsibility. That’s why for me it is important that they react to this."
"The amount of carbon the Amazon’s remaining trees removed from the atmosphere fell by almost a third last decade, leading scientists to warn that manmade carbon emissions would need to be cut more deeply to tackle climate change. Trees in untouched areas of the forest have been dying off across the basin at an increasing rate, found the study, published in Nature on Wednesday. Meanwhile the tree growth produced by higher CO2 levels in recent decades levelled off.  The authors said this may be because the Amazon’s seasonal weather variation had become more extreme. They also suggested more CO2 in the atmosphere was, counterintuitively, leading to trees dying younger. Dr Roel Brienen of Leeds University said the Amazon was responsible for one-fifth to one-quarter of carbon sequestered on land, so any decline in its efficiency as a carbon sink was of consequence to efforts to combat climate change. “If this trend continues then that is worrying because that means that basically the subsidies that we have been getting from nature – the forests that are taking up part of the emissions that we have been putting out into the atmosphere – if that is going to stop then that means that we have to make even stronger cuts in our CO2 emissions in order to keep the rate of climate change as low as possible,” he said. Brienen said the declines were occurring in pristine forest areas and were not directly related to the overall deforestation of the Amazon caused by logging and mineral exploration. The study found the Amazon’s overall ability to soak up CO2 dropped by 30% from the 1990s to the 2000s. During the same time, global CO2 emissions rose by 21%. “We observed that these undisturbed forests over the last 20 years have been taking up carbon, acting as a CO2 sink, but the rate at which they are taking up carbon is decreasing over time,” said Brienen. The study is based on a continuous survey of trees at 321 sites across the Amazon over three decades. It found the growth rate stalled between 2000 and 2010, but more trees were dying every year.  Globally, vegetation is locking away more carbon as atmospheric CO2 levels rise. Plants are growing faster, fuelled by a more fertile atmosphere. But the Amazon is eschewing this trend.  Brienen said the growth in mortality could be the result of increased variability in the Amazonian climate. Two large droughts, in 2005 and 2010, caused mass tree die-offs.  But Brienen said the long-term trend of increasing mortality could not be explained by these isolated events. Overall the region is experiencing wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons. The unfamiliar patterns place the trees under increased stress, possibly affecting the health of the forest. Brienen said the forests may also be experiencing an unanticipated consequence of higher CO2 levels. He suggests the accelerated growth is leading to trees dying younger. The dead trees decay, slowly releasing much of their stored carbon to the atmosphere. The idea is consistent with a prediction by an Australian scientist in 2009 that the Amazon would lose much of its ability to absorb carbon as the air became more rich with it. “Our study does indicate that there is a limit to the amount of carbon that forests can be taking up. Then that is truly worrying,” said Brienen."
"Nearly a quarter of the damages caused by natural disasters in the developing world affect the agricultural sector, exacting a heavy cost on poor farmers who do not have insurance or the resources to rebuild their lives after floods, droughts or other extreme events, the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) has said. The initial findings of a new report on the impact of natural disasters on agriculture and food security were released by the FAO at the third world conference on disaster risk reduction in Sendai, Japan, and showed that the cost to farmers was considerably higher than previously estimated.  Between 2003–2013, natural hazards and disasters in developing countries affected more than 1.9 billion people, and caused more than $494bn in damages. Economic losses from natural disasters have tripled over the past decade, and continue to rise. The FAO analysed 78 post-disaster needs assessments in 48 developing countries during that decade, and found that 22% of all damages were absorbed by the agricultural sector, including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries – compared to previous assessments of around 13%. Out of a total $140bn in damages, $30bn affected agriculture, but only 4.5% of post-disaster humanitarian aid in the same period targeted agriculture, it said. “This (22%) is quite a large number and we think it is underestimated because ... we have been facing a huge data gap ... Yet this 22% is much bigger than results for previous studies,” said Dominique Burgeon, FAO’s resilience coordinator, who is attending the UN conference in Sendai. In its report, the FAO also compared decreases in yields during and after disasters with yield trends in 67 countries affected by at least one medium- to large-scale event.  Using this methodology, it estimated total damages to crops and livestock over the 10-year period at $70bn. Asia was hardest hit, with estimated losses of $28bn, while Africa registered losses of $26bn. The FAO found that 82% of production losses were caused by droughts and floods, with 77% of all agricultural production losses worldwide due to drought occurring in 27 sub-Saharan countries and costing those economies $23.5bn. After natural disasters, trade flows were also jolted, the FAO said, noting an increase of $18.9bn in agricultural imports, and a decrease of $14.9bn in exports after natural disasters in the countries it surveyed. Around 2.5 billion small-scale farmers, herders, fishermen and forest communities depend on agriculture to survive, and their labours account for more than half of global agricultural production.  These people are particularly at risk from disasters – storms, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions – that destroy or damage harvests, equipment, supplies, livestock, seeds, crops and stored food.  “We know we need to increase global food security by 60% ... Bearing in mind that around 50% of global food production is produced by these 2.5 billion smallholders, we have a huge challenge ahead of us, and an increasing number of disasters affecting these people,” Burgeon said. The FAO announced it was launching a special facility to help countries reduce risk and limit impacts of natural disasters in food production sectors. Under this new scheme, technical support will be provided to those who need it most. “One thing that is emerging is countries’ realisation that they have to make sure that the risk dimension is mainstreamed into their sectoral policies – livestock, crops and fisheries,” Burgeon said. “We consider that for a country to adjust its policies accordingly, you need six to nine months and therefore there is a cost involved to organise the capacity development, (and) the training ... so that people can own the process,” he said.  The FAO has estimated the cost at around $500,000 per country, and Burgeon said they needed $10m to be able to support 20 countries to start this process.  The work of the new facility will be guided by the FAO’s Framework Programme on Disaster Risk Reduction for Food and Nutrition Security. This calls for better information-gathering and early warning systems, as well as investment in more sustainable models of food production, and wider use of improved technologies and practices.  The importance of disaster risk reduction took on a particularly poignant relevance in Sendai, where the president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, spoke on Monday of the devastation caused by cyclone Pam, which ripped through the Pacific island nation of mainly subsistence farmers at the weekend.  Lonsdale said climate change was contributing to more extreme weather conditions and cyclone seasons.  “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” he said. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.” Around 4,000 government officials and civil society participants are in Sendai, which was devastated by a tsunami and earthquake four years ago, to agree a new protocol to update the Hyogo Framework for Action, adopted 10 years ago in Kobe, Japan."
"The Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, has hinted strongly that he would oppose a second coalition with the Tories because their policy on Europe amounts to “economic and environmental irresponsibility of the highest order”. Davey, seen as a likely contender in any contest to succeed Nick Clegg, told the Observer that, by contrast, the Lib Dems and Labour shared many views on the environment, although he feared that Ed Miliband’s policy of regulating energy prices would drive away investment. In a significant intervention in an increasingly tense debate within the Lib Dems, Davey said he found another deal between the Lib Dems and Tories that would involve backing an in/out EU referendum “incredibly difficult” to envisage. The UK had made huge progress in the last five years on green issues and was now a respected international player, but a British government prepared to entertain the idea of leaving the EU would lose influence in climate change negotiations, including crucial talks in Paris at the end of this year. Davey said: “The Conservative position on Europe is potentially economic and environmental irresponsibility of the highest order. Overall our voice in the debate will be dramatically reduced if at the time we are trying to renegoiate our membership of the EU club before a referendum.” Some senior Lib Dems believe Clegg would strike a second coalition deal with the Tories after the election, backing legislation to allow an in/out referendum by the end of 2017 in return for major concessions to the Lib Dems, such as progress towards PR in local elections and House of Lords reform. But senior colleagues, including business secretary Vince Cable, and former party president Tim Farron, also potential leadership contenders, have indicated that they too would find signing up to an EU referendum to be a bridge too far for a pro-European party. Davey’s intervention adds a “green dimension” to the argument. He pointed out that his party would be putting its commitment to a low-carbon economy on the front of its election manifesto, and suggested this would sit uneasily with any deal with the Tories which involved a potential EU exit. “I am genuinely worried,” he said. “The Tories are putting the national interest behind the party interest. It will be very difficult to get Liberal Democrat agreement to an EU referendum.”"
"Industry minister Ian Macfarlane would not have believed his luck when the clean energy council (CEC) buckled to a 20% reduction in the renewable energy target (RET), diminishing the target from 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy to 33,500GWh. Up until this point, Tony Abbott and his team had nowhere to go on this issue. They had made an absolute, pre-election commitment to retain the RET at the legislated 41,000GWh. The last thing they needed, given their leadership and policy difficulties, was to have to fight on yet another front, especially having promised to deliver “good government.” They were in no position to pick a fight they couldn’t win. After all, the vast majority of Australians support renewable energy. The government has become desperate to demonstrate where new growth, investment and jobs would come from, now the mining boom is clearly over. And yet the CEC let them off the hook, allowing them to claim that they didn’t “break another promise”, but merely gave ground towards the industry’s “preferred position”. They were on the ropes. Now a rejuvenated Macfarlane will rub the Australian public’s noses in it by holding out for an even lower RET. Let’s hope Bill Shorten and the opposition have the courage to stand firm. The Greens and most of the Senate crossbenchers would back them to block the government’s attempts to make the necessary legislative amendments to the RET. The real villains here, however, are Australia’s three biggest energy companies: AGL, Energy Australia and Origin. Abbott has been extensively “advised” by these companies. Surely it is in no small part their influence that led to the coalition setting up an inquiry into the RET, headed by climate change sceptic Dick Warburton.  Interestingly, the inquiry found that the RET will drive down the price of power for consumers. Not a particularly helpful finding for a government that had been pushing the same tired line it did on the carbon price, that the policy is bad for consumers and would lead to higher power prices.  The Coalition persisted, following more lobbying from the big three who control over 70% of the retail energy market in Australia. These companies made their positions absolutely clear: some wanted the RET scrapped altogether and others would be happy with a significant cut.  They knew weakening the RET would drive up the value of their fossil fuel assets, such as their investments in polluting coal fired power plants and coal seam gas mining. And, of course, it would limit new competition in the energy market, which lowers power prices for consumers, too. Let’s be frank, Origin, Energy Australia and AGL have significantly influenced the Abbott government’s ditching of its clear election promise to keep the RET at 41,000GWh. Their claim to support renewable energy while walking the corridors of power lobbying to undermine it smacks of hypocrisy.  And, unlike the renewable energy-backed companies they want to undermine by attacking the RET, they’ve been getting away with screwing households on their electricity bills by hitting customers with almost obscene profit margins as energy retailers.  But here’s the good news. The Australian public, the vast majority of us who support cleaner and cheaper power from renewable energy and are opposed to dirty coal and damaging coal seam gas, have the ability to reclaim control over our public policy.  In order to stop vested interests like Origin, AGL and Energy Australia who have much to gain by halting the growth of renewable energy, all we need to do is switch our energy provider to a company backed by 100% renewable energy.  Credit Suisse has found that, “a coordinated campaign targeting AGL’s electricity and gas customers and prospective customers could result in customer loss and costs to AGL.” And Citi Research recently said: We think there are early warning signs of negative connotations around Gloucester (CSG) impacting AGL in some retail customer segments. If these negative associations become more mainstream, walking away from/disposing of Gloucester may become the right option to protect the larger retail brand and earnings. So despite the CEC’s position strengthening Macfarlane’s arm, the battle is now well and truly on. Australian consumers can change the balance of power. We can stop the rollout of CSG, we can say no to dirty and polluting coal and we can save the key policies that we need to build the infrastructure for cleaner and cheaper power. It’s time for all of us to stand up and be counted. I urge you to consider joining me in withdrawing your custom from Origin, AGL and Energy Australia. These dirty companies are blocking Australia’s renewable energy future and clinging on to their misguided and outdated investments in expensive and dirty power.  The more of us that switch to companies that genuinely support the RET and oppose CSG, the better we will make things for all Australian consumers, our communities and our environment."

"A very important study was just published in the Journal of Climate a few days ago. This paper, in my mind, makes a major step toward reconciling differences in satellite temperature records of the mid-troposphere region. As before, it is found that the scientists (and politicians) who have cast doubt on global warming in the past are shown to be outliers because of bias in their results. The publication, authored by Stephen Po-Chedley and colleagues from the University of Washington, discusses some major sources of error in satellite records. For instance, after satellites are launched, they scan the Earth’s atmosphere and calibrate the atmospheric measurements using a warm target onboard the satellite and cold space. The accuracy with which the atmospheric measurements are calibrated can influence the inferred temperature of the atmosphere (called the warm-target bias). Additionally, over the years, multiple satellites have been launched and the selection of which satellite data are used can play a role. Finally, biases can occur because the satellite orbits drift during their lifetime and the influence of diurnal temperature variation can affect the global temperature trends.   Of these three errors, the last one (probably the most important one), was the focus of the just-published paper.  It is known that there is a problem because there are multiple groups that create satellite temperature records. For instance, NOAA, Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), and the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH). The problem is, their results don’t agree with each other. In particular, the UAH team, led by Dr. John Christy and Dr. Roy Spencer (who have discounted the importance and occurrence of climate change for years) present results that differ quite a bit from the others. In fact, in the current paper, it is stated that “Despite using the same basic radiometer measurements, tropical TMT trend differences between these groups differ by a factor of three.” An important aspect to this issue is that for many reasons, it is expected that the tropospheric temperatures in the tropics will warm more than surface temperatures. This is called “tropospheric amplification.” According to two satellite groups, there is in fact such amplification. According to the UAH team, there is no amplification. The presence or absence of amplification is often used by some skeptics to discount the importance of global warming. Why are there differences? Well that’s part of what this paper tries to answer. Each of the teams try to deal with and correct for various satellite errors. For instance, sometimes the diurnal cycle effect is removed using temperatures from climate models. The RSS and NOAA teams “apply a drift correction based on the diurnal cycle from a GCM (global climate model) whereas UAH produces a microwave sounding unit mid-tropospheric temperature diurnal correction based on temperature comparisons between three co-orbiting satellites ... UAH does not yet correct the diurnal drift for satellites carrying Advanced Microwave Sounding Units because they attempt to use these satellites during periods when the diurnal drift is small.” The present paper presents a calibration scheme that allowed them to obtain a diurnal correction from the satellite measurements themselves, in particular, by solving for a common diurnal cycle correction using temperatures from all available satellites. As the authors state in the paper, their new results agree with the two groups that show more warming. They disagree with UAH. As the authors state,  In general, our trends corrected with a GCM and trends corrected with our observationally derived diurnal cycle correction are similar to trends from NOAA and RSS ... the UAH ocean trend is notably lower than trends from the other datasets. So, how do the trends compare? Well the lowest trend, in degrees Celsius heating per decade are from UAH and they equal 0.029 for the 1979–2012 period for the mid-troposphere region between 20° South and 20° North. The new results are almost 4 times higher at 0.114°C per decade. The results using a diurnal correction from a climate model are in close agreement with the new findings (0.124°C per decade). As additional support, the NOAA and RSS values are also close to the corrected results. The simple fact is, UAH is an outlier. They also discovered that the results from RSS, NOAA, and the new study all show tropical amplification and are in agreement with the expected amplification from climate models. They state, “There is no significant discrepancy between observations and models for lapse rate change between the surface and the full troposphere.” To summarize the amplification factor, the new study obtains a value of 1.4. If the diurnal cycle is eliminated using climate models, the result is 1.49. According to NOAA and RSS, the values are 1.31 and 1.10, respectively. Again, UAH is the outlier with an amplification factor of 0.56. I wrote to Stephen Po-Chedley and asked for a summary. He told me, We developed an observationally based diurnal cycle correction to remove the influence of satellite diurnal sampling drifts on long-term tropospheric temperature trends. This is important because other analyses (RSS and NOAA) used a model-derived diurnal cycle correction and questions have been raised about the validity of this bias correction. Trends from our work are in accord with trends from global circulation models and basic theory.  We also found that the model-derived diurnal cycle correction used by RSS and NOAA is similar to our bias correction. The tropical tropospheric trend from the present study is 2.5 times that from another group, UAH. While this work shows that it is possible to understand discrepancies between MSU/AMSU datasets there are still important differences between the datasets that need further scrutiny. In short, the Earth is warming, the warming is amplified in the troposphere, and those who claim otherwise are unlikely to be correct."

"The Wellcome Trust has quietly sold off a $138m (£94m) investment in ExxonMobil, the oil giant which previously funded climate change denial, the Guardian can reveal. But the medical charity, which says “climate change is one of the greatest contemporary challenges to global health”, has refused to divest all its fossil fuel assets, as called for in a Guardian campaign launched on Monday. Doctors and Wellcome Trust grant recipients labelled this stance contradictory and called for full divestment. The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) said health professionals should take a leading role in fighting climate change and that divestment by the Wellcome Trust would be in line with calls from UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to cut such investments. Existing fossil fuel reserves are several times greater than can be burned if the world’s governments are to fulfil their pledge to keep global warming below the danger limit of 2C, but coal, oil and gas companies continue to spend billions on exploration. The fast-growing divestment movement argues that fossil fuel investments are a threat to both the climate and investors, as action to combat climate change could render the fuel reserves worthless. The Wellcome Trust is the world’s second biggest non-governmental funder of medical research and is dedicated to improving global health, most recently leading the fight against the ebola epidemic in west Africa. It declines to reveal the full extent of its fossil fuel investments, but in 2014 its £18bn endowment included over £450m invested in the fossil fuel majors Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton alone. The chair of Wellcome’s board of governors, Sir William Castell, set out the Trust’s position in a letter to the medical campaign group Medact in 2014: “The Wellcome Trust considers climate change to be one of the greatest contemporary challenges to global health. We have made understanding the connections between environment, nutrition and health one of our five key research challenges.” But the Guardian can reveal just 0.9% of the £3.5bn given out by the Wellcome Trust over the last five years was dedicated to this key challenge. Castell is a former senior director of BP and chaired the oil company’s safety committee at the time of the Deepwater explosion in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. A spokeswoman for the Wellcome Trust said climate change and health was “a highly complex issue which we take seriously in our decisions and on which we engage with policy-makers, researchers and the businesses in which we invest.”  Wellcome argues engaging with the fossil fuel companies it invests in “offers a better prospect for change than divestment”, but it declines to give examples of its engagement.  A spokeswoman said Castell had no conflict of interest: “He has, and has had, no material interest that would exclude him from discussing wider investment policy in the energy sector.” His directorship at BP ended in 2012. “Climate change poses the single biggest threat to the health of humanity over the next few decades,” said Dr David McCoy, director of Medact and a former NHS director of public health. “It is already causing deaths, ill health and suffering. The Wellcome Trust’s acknowledgement that climate change is a very serious public health issue is contradicted by their investment policy. I am absolutely sure that within the Wellcome Trust and among their grant holders there are many, many people who want to divest from fossil fuels.” Dr Taavi Tillmann, at University College London and whose research into heart disease in eastern Europe is funded by the Wellcome Trust, said: “I really think the Wellcome Trust should divest from fossil fuels. It makes perfect sense, as health organisations have already divested from other sectors which are thought of as unethical, like tobacco.” “We take the precautionary principle very seriously in the health sector and the risk of climate change to health invokes that principle,” Tillmann said. “We have the right and responsibility to invoke that principle, and to speak out and take action.” “The World Health Organisation is very much convinced that health professionals should take a leading role in fighting climate change,” said Dr Maria Neira, the WHO’s director of public health and the environment and a former health minister in Spain. “It is clear from the global perspective that we have to stimulate companies to disinvest from fossil fuels. Our secretary general Ban Ki-moon has been very strong on urging companies - and the Wellcome Trust could be one of those - to reduce their investments in fossil fuel.” In February, a coalition of medical groups including Medact issued a report arguing that the health sector, including the Wellcome Trust, should not be helping to fund the harm they exist to tackle. The British Medical Association, which represents UK doctors, voted to divest from fossil fuels in June 2014. The Wellcome Trust is a “transparent” investor, according to Castell, but only publishes its 30 largest holdings in its annual reports. Its investment in ExxonMobil was revealed in regulatory filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed in January. The Wellcome Trust said the investment was sold in January, but did not give a reason. Many senior figures and institutions in the financial world, including the World Bank, Bank of England, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Standard and Poor’s, have warned that only a fraction of known fossil fuel reserves can be safely burned and that the remainder could plummet in value posing huge risks to investors. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s richest, revealed on Friday it had dumped over 50 coal companies. Over 180 institutions around the world, including pension funds, cities, universities and faith groups, have already divested and the Go Fossil Free campaign received a significant boost on Sunday, when it received the support of the UN organisation in charge of global climate change negotiations."
"The Conservative environment secretary, Liz Truss, has said she would not request the MPs’ pension fund to divest from fossil fuels. She told the Guardian: “I believe the right way [to affect investment] is through carbon reduction targets.” Caroline Flint, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said she would “look into it”. She declined to support divestment and said the debate over divestment should be about setting the right conditions for long-term investment in environmental sustainability. The MPs were speaking to the Guardian on the fringes of a public debate on green policies in the run-up to the general election, held by the Green Alliance and a consortium of environmental NGOs. More than 200 institutions worldwide have now either divested from fossil fuels or have committed to do so, including faith organisations, local authorities and universities. The Guardian is currently calling on the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to move away from fossil fuel investments, reasoning that much of the world’s fossil fuel reserve will need to be kept in the ground if greenhouse gas emissions targets are to be met and the ravages predicted from climate change are to be avoided. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy secretary, told the debate that he supported divestment away from coal, but not gas as it would continue to be needed, and which currently makes up 80% of the UK’s energy use. He said this move was already happening. He said: “The way pension funds are going, they are interested in placing their money in what they see as sustainable forms of investment. To give incentives we need decarbonisation targets. I would make a distinction between coal and oil and gas.” He also called for more transparency for investors. “If you look at the work of the Bank of England, the Bank of Brazil, the Bank of South Africa, you need to ensure investors have real disclosure about the assets of the companies they are investing in, [to see whether they are] building assets or long-term liabilities. Investor disclosure is one thing we can push through.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s only MP, said she was enthusiastically calling for divestment through the MPs’ pension fund and others. The MPs were also asked about the future of shale gas in the UK, with Lucas firmly opposed while the others said they supported shale gas development with good regulation. Flint said: “We not setting our faces against shale gas – we will need gas for years to come.” She said Labour had put forward a variety of measures for environmental protection and regulation on shale drilling in the infrastructure bill. Davey said producing shale gas in the UK was greener than importing gas from Qatar. Truss said: “We have done a lot of work on the risk. Provided we have the right protections in place, it can have minimal impact on the environment. There is already onshore oil and gas in this country [without the use of fracking technology and] which has the support of local residents. Just like other forms of energy, shale has to go through local planning protections put in place by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). It really is very heavily protected – that is the right approach.”"

"Scientists are hailing a new breed of bean seed as a breakthrough, thanks to its ability to grow amid rising temperatures and yield more nutritional value, qualities they believe can thwart the anticipated destruction of nearly half of all bean production. The new seed was launched on Wednesday by scientists from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa. As well as being more resilient to heat, the bean has a higher iron content. About 400 million people rely on beans for subsistence, according to CGIAR. But by 2050 nearly half of the world’s bean production could be wiped out by rising temperatures if new seed varieties are not rolled out immediately.  “Beans are not very well adapted to high temperatures because they originated in the cool hills and mountains of central America, Mexico and South America. So pushing them down into the warmer areas has always been a challenge,” said Steve Beebe, a researcher at CGIAR, based at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. In 2012, CGIAR researchers began to test more than 1,000 types of beans in a bid to find “heat beater” beans able to grow amid high temperatures and drought. Scientists cultivated test plots on Colombia’s Caribbean coast and in greenhouses, before eventually discovering 30 heat-tolerant bean types that can withstand a 4C increase in temperature. CGIAR said it used natural breeding to discover the seed. “In the short run, [bean production in] central America is going to be up against the wall, in terms of high temperatures, droughts and hurricanes. In east Africa currently, the bean production is at mid to higher altitudes, so – in the short-term – Africa won’t be under quite as much threat. But by the end of the century, east Africa will be under serious, serious threat from climate change,” said Beebe. Beebe believes seeds should be distributed in small, affordable packages that farmers can test before committing to more. “When you sell seeds in very small packets it gives the farmer the option to invest in a very small amount – it’s the cost of a cup of tea – and then test it in their back yard. If they like it, they can buy more,” he said. “Otherwise you might have NGOs giving seeds away, which is not sustainable, or you have private sector firms selling 50kg bags, which farmers can’t afford.” Rising temperatures and ambitious food security targets have created an urgent need for better seeds that can grow in warmer climates and yield more nutritional value to farms in the world’s poorest countries. But how this is done, and how farmers access the seeds, is hotly debated. Earlier in the week, protestors gathered outside the London office of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to demonstrate against a meeting they said would promote corporate interests in Africa’s seed sector. Dangling a cage full of seeds in front of passersby, they yelled, “Come and free the seeds!” before smashing open the cage, which they said symbolised the corporate takeover of Africa’s seed markets. As seeds spilled on to the pavement, the meeting, hosted by the Gates Foundation and the US Agency for International Development (USAid), promoted production and distribution in Africa’s seed sector. The attendees were listed as key donor organisations, private seed companies and agricultural research centres, but did not include any groups representing farmers, according to a leaked document seen by the Guardian.  The Gates Foundation and USAid have said they are working to improve food security in the world’s poorest countries. USAid’s flagship programme, the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, has been criticised for requiring African governments to change laws and policies in favour of businesses.  The Gates Foundation said the meeting would focus on “[encouraging] the development and promotion of appropriate models for the production and delivery of early generation seeds of improved varieties for a diversity of food crops in sub-Saharan Africa”. Attendees are understood to have discussed seed markets for maize, rice, sorghum, cowpea, cassava and sweet potato in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. African agricultural groups said the conversation around improving Africa’s seed sector needs to involve groups that represent small-scale farmers. The Gates Foundation was not immediately available for comment. Mariam Mariet, director of the African Centre for Biodiversity (ACB), said: “Public-farmer partnerships that integrate farmer and scientific knowledge will generate a more accountable process, and produce longer-lasting and more meaningful solutions for African agricultural production, than these profit-driven, exclusive and narrow processes,” she said. Ali-Masmadi Jehu-Appiah, chairman of Food Sovereignty Ghana, added: “This meeting will push this corporate agenda to hand more control away from our small farmers and into the hands of big seed companies.”  • This article was amended on 26 March to clarify that Ali-Masmadi Jehu-Appiah is the chairman of Food Sovereignty Ghana and not chairwoman as previously reported"
"What I remember most about the image from my graduation ceremony was the pride shining from my mother’s face as she stood beside me. She and my dad had sacrificed a lot for this day to happen. Now her beloved son had a doctorate of philosophy from Oxford University. My research had been conducted in the Department of Earth Sciences, an elite training house for the extractive industries. Back then, 35 years ago, I would talk to executives from oil, gas, and coal companies and be quite faint with admiration. We all did. How things can change in just a few decades. Today, after all that has emerged about climate change since the mid 1980s, I constantly fight to suppress anger about how doggedly the incumbency, and its institutional supporters, protect a transparently ruinous way of fuelling the global economy: how hard they fight to slow the near-inevitable energy transition. That is why I agreed to support the Oxford student divestment campaign by pledging I would give my degree back if the university voted against dropping fossil-fuel investments. On Monday the university debated the issue, tabled by the students 18 months ago, and elected to defer its decision. It says it needs to give divestment “thorough consideration”. The truth, I suspect, is that after a year and a half it has had plenty of time to mull over this simple moral choice. It wants to buy more time. It fears offending the energy companies who plough so much, directly and indirectly, into its coffers.Just in case the consideration process is genuine, let me contribute three thoughts to it. The first is that with every month that goes by, the university risks being on the wrong side of history. Thirty-five years ago, I hammered out my DPhil thesis on a typewriter. I hand-drew my diagrams and annotated them with stencils. Compare that to the firepower students have at the fingertips today. And where will we be 35 years from now, where energy is concerned, in a digital age? Not relying on the fuels that give the energy incumbency its current power.  Google has already passed the billion-dollar mark in its renewable-energy investments. The Bank of Abu Dhabi, no less, has already said that the majority of future energy investment in that time frame will be in renewables. The Bank of England is currently investigating whether or not the fossil fuel industries today pose a threat to the stability of the global capital markets. I could go on, and do, on my website. The point is that a self-respecting university will need to be in the vanguard of pioneering and promoting the revolutionary transition, not the forlorn-hope rearguard defending the incumbency. The second thought involves the “engagement versus divestment” debate. There is a case for large pension funds and other fund managers worried about climate change to keep some of their investments in fossil fuels, so that they can engage as shareholders in order to contest the capital-expenditure decisions being made by carbon fuel companies in coal, oil and gas deposits that will never be economic because of their high costs of production, or can never be burned for climate reasons, or both.  But this engagement is a role easily left to the big funds. For an academic institution charged with the responsibility of shaping young lives the choice ought to be clear. It doesn’t make sense to train young people to nurture civilisation with one hand while bankrolling the sabotage of it with the other. The third thought is the one any PR adviser worth his or her salt would tell the university. You have simply created more time, in a digital age, for bright young minds to work out new ways to embarrass you in the eyes of the world. And of prospective future students. And of prospective donors. You have also given fresh resolve to ageing alumni without those digital skills.So my typed DPhil remains on the line. Sorry mum."

"There has been a lot of attention on the influence of rapid warming of the Arctic on weather in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. Much of the work has focused on changes to the Jetstream amplitudes and association of these changes to ice loss in the Arctic.  We know that the Arctic is heating faster than the planet as a whole. Consequently, there is more energy in the Arctic which can be transmitted to the atmosphere. Much of the excess heat is transferred to the atmosphere in the late fall or early winter. This extra energy is connected to what’s called Arctic geopotential height, which has increased during the same times of the year. As a consequence, the Jetstream might weaken in the cold seasons. But what about summer? Have these changes been detected then too? Well just recently, a paper was published in that answered this question. The authors, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and from the University of Potsdam reported on three measures of atmospheric dynamics (1) zonal winds, (2) eddy kinetic energy, and (3) amplitude of the fast-moving Rossby waves. Rossby waves are very large waves in the upper atmospheric winds. They are important because of their large influence on weather. The authors found that the summer zonal winds have weakened. The reason for the weakening is that since the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, the temperature difference between the Arctic and the lower latitudes is getting smaller. It is this temperature difference which maintains the wind speeds. The authors also found that eddy kinetic energy is decreasing. So what does all this mean? Well two things. First, it means that there are either fewer or less intense summer storms or a combination of both. But secondly, it means that weather patterns can get “stuck”. Storms are excellent at breaking up persistent weather patterns, and bringing cool and moist air from ocean regions to land zones. With fewer storms, “warm weather conditions endure, resulting in buildup of heat and drought.” The authors looked to the future to inquire about how things would continue to change. They find that continued global warming will increase the risk of heat waves. We all know that the warming temperature will make heat waves more likely. But added to this, “stickiness” of weather patterns will play a big role as well. Whether it is the heat wave in Europe of 2003, the Russian heat wave of 2010, the heat waves in the USA in 2011 or 2012, or last year’s (and still continuing heat in California), these events have economic and human consequences. It is crucial to understand how our current climate works if we have any hope in predicting what will happen in the future. This study makes a great contribution to putting the puzzle of the Earth’s climate together.  I asked colleague Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf about this work and he said,  I think the idea that the mid-latitude winds, especially the jet stream, may be changing in response to Arctic warming has proven to be a highly fruitful one. Now that scientists have started to analyze the available wind data in a systematic way, very interesting patterns emerge that also make physical sense. It is increasingly clear that global warming does not just mean global warming in a narrow sense. Our planet is not simply getting warmer - rather this warming comes with real changes to the workings of the atmosphere and the oceans "

"Senior scientists including former chief advisers to the UK government and European commission have called on the world’s two largest health charities to sell their investments in leading fossil fuel companies.  They argue that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust should offload their holdings in major coal, oil and gas corporations because the investments are undermining the charities’ aims. “There’s an anomaly there. It is like giving with the one hand and taking with the other,” said Prof Anne Glover, who was chief scientific adviser to the European commission until last year.  “These are leaders. These are people that others look to. So they have enormous responsibility. That’s why for me it is important that they react to this.”  She said there was a lack of progress in the development of cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. “Gates and Wellcome and many others are huge investors,” she said. “Their endorsement or investment in the accessing and using of fossil fuels – it makes a big impact. If they were to reconsider and think about investing elsewhere, they could use their power as investors in a very positive way.” On Monday, the Guardian launched a major campaign to encourage the two charities to divest their endowments from fossil fuels. By Friday over 100,000 people had signed the petition with supporters including actor Tilda Swinton, activist Bianca Jagger, Costa award-winning author Helen Macdonald and chef Yotam Ottolenghi. “[By signing the petition], individuals can say that this matters to us. I don’t think [the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust] are organisations who don’t care about what people think about them. I think that they will listen. It really matters that people make their voice heard,” said Glover. “We have to leave more of the fossil fuel that has sequestered over millennia in the ground,” said Lord May, the UK government’s former chief scientist. “If we continue to extract it unremittingly, there’s no doubt that we are not going to be able to stay within any plausible envelope of a habitable Earth.” Divestment from the most intensive fossil fuel companies would send a clear signal about the urgency of this challenge, he said. Sir Bob Watson, former adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, also urged the charities to rethink their investments. “The more people invest in fossil fuel companies, the more these companies will exploit fossil fuels,” he said. The scientists have cast a spotlight on the tension between the funders’ shareholdings in fossil fuel companies and the grave toll that climate change, driven by burning the fuels, threatens to inflict on public health. “One of the major impacts of climate change is on human health, especially in developing countries through vector borne disease and heat stress,” said Watson. “This is where Wellcome and Gates have put a huge amount of money.” Professor Chris Rapley, former director of the Science Museum, said the position of Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation is “fundamentally inconsistent”, adding that as scientific thought leaders, any gesture was particularly powerful. “We have to confront our own inconsistencies,” he said. “Either they accept the argument that we need to wean ourselves off fossil fuels or they don’t. It’s highly symbolic when charities like this make a stand.” But he added that there was still room for the industry to change. “Threats to divest from fossil fuel-based companies and expose the potential carbon bubble, should be tempered in such a way to strongly encourage the industry to invest seriously in solving the technical challenges of carbon capture and storage - or better carbon capture and utilisation.” A spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said: “Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in this effort and the breakthrough innovations needed and will continue to speak out about it. We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognize that there are many views on how best to address it.” A spokeswoman for the Wellcome Trust said climate change and health was “a highly complex issue which we take seriously in our decisions and on which we engage with policymakers, researchers and the businesses in which we invest.” Maria Neira, director of public health and environment at the World Health Organisation, warned last year that climate change will cause an extra 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, mostly from rises in malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, heat exposure and inadequate nutrition. Last year Wellcome gave £727m in grants in fields including ebola and cancer research. In total, the Gates Foundation has given $32.9bn in grants to health programmes around the world. Its work focusses on prevention, immunisation and vaccination. The Wellcome Trust’s endowment originates from funds left by Sir Henry Wellcome, the co-founder of a successful multinational pharmaceutical company, after his death in 1936. “Given that Henry Wellcome essentially gave away his fortune in the hope of making the world better, I can only believe that he would be on the side of the people who want to keep the carbon in the ground,” Lord May said. The global divestment movement, which is encouraging investors to sell their fossil fuel holdings is growing rapidly with over 200 organisations worth over £33bn signed up.  The driving force for many is the calculation that existing fossil fuel reserves already hold far more carbon than can be burned while still having a hope of keeping the global temperature rise below 2C. “If we don’t do that we are leaving a dreadful legacy for the next generation,” said Glover. Sir Martin Rees, of the University of Cambridge and former president of the Royal Society, said: “Obviously it’s important that most fossil fuel reserves remain underground, rather than being exploited.” However, the case for divestment is less obvious, he argues. “I think our cause would be far more effectively boosted if Bill Gates stood up and made eloquent speeches at [ExxonMobil’s] AGM than by divestment,” he said. “The one thing that is clear, I think, is that large charities shouldn’t hold big shareholdings in these companies and remain passive.” Sir John Beddington, former government chief scientist, agreed that fossil fuel reserves could not continue to be burnt without major technological advances in carbon capture technology, although stopped short of backing the call for divestment. “The sums are pretty clear,” he said. “What’s under the ground cannot be burnt within a 2C framework unless you have some method of sequestering the carbon dioxide or that you change in other ways.” Additional reporting by James Randerson"
"The US government is expected this week to give the go-ahead to a controversial plan by Shell to restart drilling for oil in the Arctic.  The green light from Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, will spark protests from environmentalists who have campaigned against proposed exploration by the Anglo-Dutch group in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas off Alaska. Jewell will make a formal statement backing the decision as soon as Wednesday, the earliest point at which her department can rubber-stamp an approval given last month given by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The US Interior Department had been forced to replay the decision-making process after a US federal court ruled last year, in a case brought by environmental groups, that the government had made mistakes in assessing the environmental risks in the drilling programme.  However, the BOEM, an arm of Jewell’s department, has backed the drilling after going through the process again, despite revealing in its Environmental Impact Statement “there is a 75% chance of one or more large spills” occurring.   A leading academic, Prof Robert Bea, from the engineering faculty at the University of California in Berkeley, who made a special study of the Deepwater Horizon accident, has raised new concerns that the recent slump in oil prices could compromise safety across the industry as oil producers strive to cut costs. Bea, who has worked as a consultant to BP and Shell, told the Guardian:  “We should all be concerned about tradeoffs between production and protection ... With the significant reduction in the price for oil, there are equally significant pressures to reduce costs so that acceptable profitability can be maintained.”  Bea was brought in by Shell in 2004 to reviewhow the group had assessed the risks associated with the proposed drilling in the Chukchi Sea. “At the end of the week’s discussions, we agreed to disagree,” he said. Meanwhile, Greenpeace argues that drilling in extreme Arctic conditions is always risky, especially during a period when industry is trying to reduce overheads due to a price of $50 per barrel oil. “Piling cost-cutting pressures onto these contractors, who already have frankly atrocious safety records, doesn’t bode well for the Arctic, or the people and wildlife that call it home,” said Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace’s Arctic campaigner. But Kronick said the move particularly made no sense in the context of countering global warming. “If we want to avoid catastrophic climate change we can’t even burn all the fossil fuels we already have; we definitely don’t need to trash what’s left of the melting Arctic looking for more.  “Obama needs to show leadership ahead of the Paris climate talks; allowing Arctic drilling in Alaska will seriously undermine that leadership and US credibility.” Ed Davey, the British energy and climate change secretary, has asked the Bank of England to investigate threats to the financial system due to a carbon bubble caused by fossil fuels which cannot be burned because of global warming. Shell declined to comment on the prospective Arctic go-ahead but has previously said a decision on whether to start drilling again this summer would depend on a number of factors including regulatory and legal certainty. Ben van Beurden, the chief executive, told a recent financial results conference that he was keen to proceed: “We have retained very significant capability to be ready this year to go ahead. So will we go ahead? Yes, if we can.” On the issue of safety a spokesman for the company said: “We’ve said clearly that our plans must meet our own high bar as well as the one set by US regulators. Both have taken unprecedented measures to ensure offshore operations and contingency plans in the US Arctic are second to none.” Shell was forced to halt operations in Arctic the middle of 2012 after the failure of a key piece of safety equipment that would be used to tackle oil spills. The situation for the company became worse when the drilling rig it was using, the Kulluk, ran aground after it was being towed back to port. A US coast guard report into the incident was heavily critical of the incident and Noble Drilling, which was working for Shell, was slapped with $12m worth of fines and community payments.  Shell hoped to restart in 2013 and then again in 2014 but failed after a series of legal challenges and other setbacks. Despite its determination to press ahead in the Arctic, Shell aims to confront the risk that climate change may pose to its future, backing a resolution from activist shareholders to be debated at its May annual general meeting. This requires Shell to test whether its business model is compatible with the pledge by the world’s nations to limit global warming to a further rise of 2C. The group also says it has always made clear that cost cutting must never compromise safety and remains committed to the highest safety initiatives through a Goal Zero initiative. “Goal Zero captures the belief that we can operate without fatalities or significant incidents despite the often difficult conditions in which we operate.”"

"The Abbott government has been accused of politicising the release of official greenhouse gas projections that confirm Australia’s international climate change pledge for 2020 is becoming easier to reach, but which will also increase pressure for Australia to adopt a more ambitious post-2020 target. The official figures have shown that the total greenhouse gas reduction required to meet Australia’s bipartisan minimum target of a 5% cut by 2020 is now 236m tonnes, a decrease on previous estimates.  The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the previous projections had been “Labor’s numbers” and that the lower projections were “because Labor’s numbers exaggerated the abatement task by more than a billion tonnes of emissions”. “Labor used these figures in an attempt to justify the world’s largest carbon tax that hurt families and businesses by pushing up electricity prices,” Hunt said. The former Liberal leader John Hewson said the official projections were, and always had been, produced by the environment department based on the best available evidence at the time. “Both parties have always based their policies on these projections. To try to politicise them in this way is enormously counterproductive and damaging to the national interest,” Hewson said. Professor Ross Garnaut, Labor’s former climate change adviser, said there was “nothing at all political in the change in trajectory … these figures have been produced in the same way since the Howard years”. The official figures attributed the decrease to “lower electricity demand … due to the uptake of household solar, energy efficiency and increased retail prices; worse-than-expected agricultural conditions due to drought; lower manufacturing output due to industrial closures and weaker growth expectations for local coal production due to a fall in international coal prices”. The latest forecasts are very close to private estimates, including those from Frontier Economics, published by Guardian Australia in September 2014, which calculated Australia’s task to 2020 would be about 225m tonnes. The revised figures mean the task of reducing emissions by 5% requires less than a third of the effort envisaged when both major parties signed up to the 2020 target. In 2012 the promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In 2014 new government calculations reduced that figure to 421m tonnes. The new figures were based on the assumption that the renewable energy target is reduced to a “real 20%” – something the government has yet to agree with Labor. If it is unable to achieve this reduction and the existing RET remains, additional renewable energy is likely to take greenhouse emissions even lower. The figures explain why the government remains confident it can meet the target even though it has repealed the carbon tax and has not yet begun auctions under its $2.55bn “Direct Action” scheme. The first auction will be held in April. Hunt said the new figures meant the Coalition would “easily meet our commitment to reduce Australia’s emissions by 5% from 2000 levels by 2020”. But modelling by Sinclair Knight Merz, released during the 2013 election campaign, which found the Coalition would need to find at least another $4bn to meet its target, was based on broadly similar projections. Energy market analyst RepuTex said it still believed the $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, on its own, would fail to meet the 2020 target – even taking the new projections into account. “We forecast that the ERF will purchase between 80m and 120m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions abatement. This is equivalent to around half of Australia’s new 2020 abatement task,” RepuTex said. RepuTex said that to meet the target the government would have to establish a “baseline and credit” emissions trading scheme, using so-called safeguards mechanisms that have been legislated but not yet explained in detail. The government is soon to release a discussion paper on how it will set its post-2020 emissions reduction target. It will announce this target mid-year, ahead of the United Nations conference in Paris in December. The Climate Institute thinktank said the new figures did not explain how the government would meet its 2020 emissions reduction targets, let alone deeper cuts after 2020. Its chief executive, John Connor, said: “It’s not much use to say that the job has got easier when you still don’t have the tools to do it properly.” “Without a plan to modernise and decarbonise our economy, Australia’s ballooning pollution through 2020 and beyond will require massive dollops of taxpayer funds if the primary policy tool remains the Emissions Reduction Fund.” “These new projections are consistent with independent modelling that shows the government’s policies still aren’t up to the task of cutting Australian emissions even by the minimum amount we’ve committed to, let alone match comparable countries’ efforts or drive the deeper decarbonisation we will need over coming decades. The government has provided no modelling to argue otherwise.” Garnaut said the government’s optimism was also based on a continuation of recent reductions in electricity emissions, which “were helped by a carbon price and have been hindered by recent policy developments”.  The total task of reducing emissions by 236m tonnes takes into account a “carryover” because Australia exceeded its 2012 reduction target, which actually allowed a small increase in emissions and was easily achieved through calculating the impact of reduced land clearing.

"Hundreds of miles of railway lines around Britain’s coast are becoming increasingly vulnerable to waves, landslides and storms triggered by climate pollution, an expert has warned. Professor Robert Duck from the University of Dundee says that numerous sections of railway in Wales, Cumbria, Devon and elsewhere are at risk of being washed away because they skirt so close to the sea. Three lines had to close in 2014 after being damaged by waves, most memorably at Dawlish on the south coast of Devon where the track was left hanging in mid-air. Trains on some of the vulnerable coastal tracks carry nuclear waste to the Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria and from the Wylfa nuclear site in north Wales. They are also vital lifelines for hundreds of communities. Duck is the author of a new book on UK coastal railways called ‘On the Edge’ to be launched on Thursday. It points out that over 93 miles (150km) of the operating railway network in Wales are on the coast, along with many other stretches around England and Scotland. The seawall protecting the railway at Dawlish was destroyed in February 2014 and the line was out of action for two months. “This was a dramatic example of the problems we face as climate change leads to more storms and exacerbates coastal erosion,” says Duck. “Much of our coast has railway lines at the edge forming the first line of defence from the sea. This leads to spectacular scenery for passengers to enjoy but increasing difficulties for franchise operators and government.” For railway builders in the mid-19th century the coast was cheaper, flatter and easier than using inland sites, he points out. “We wouldn’t have built these railway lines where they are if we had today’s knowledge.” One of the most vulnerable lines runs along the Cambrian coast in northwest Wales. Winter storms in January 2014 damaged the track in several places between Machynlleth, Barmouth and Pwllheli, and took five months to repair. Ballast and earth supporting 200 metres of railway line at Flimby, to the north of Workington in Cumbria, were also washed away by high tides and strong winds in January 2014. It is on the coastal line between Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness that carries highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power stations to the Sellafield reprocessing plant. Another line at risk runs close to the north Wales shore from Chester to Holyhead. It connects with Wylfa on Anglesey where there is an ageing nuclear power station, and contested proposals to build a new one. Duck, a professor of environmental geoscience at Dundee, warns that hard engineering solutions for protecting coastal railways may become too expensive. “The time will come when we have to look at alternatives, building inland diversions and re-opening long-closed lines as a way of ensuring that we do not cut off communities,” he says. Edinburgh rail consultant, David Spaven, agreed that diversions might work in some places but in others there were major engineering challenges. “It’s ironic that climate change, which should generally mean a bright future for energy-efficient rail transport, also threatens the integrity of coastal routes,” he said.  Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining the railways, accepted that coastal lines were vulnerable to extreme weather. “That’s why we spend millions each year protecting the railway from nature’s worst attacks,” said a company spokeswoman. “We’ve published a series of route-based weather resilience and climate change plans which explain our understanding of how weather can affect the railway and the potential impact of changes in our climate. We explain what we’re doing to mitigate the impacts.”           "
"The director of the Wellcome Trust has rejected calls from a Guardian campaign to shift the charitable foundation’s investments out of the fossil fuel industry, warning that such a move would mean less pressure on those companies to be green. However, Jeremy Farrar said that Wellcome shared considerable common ground with the Keep it in the Ground campaign and that fossil fuel producers had responsibilities to society, including protecting the environment. The public comments are the first by a senior figure at the health charity, the second largest non-governmental funder of medical research in the world, since more than 141,000 people signed a petition calling for Wellcome to divest from fossil fuels.  Senior scientists including former chief scientific advisers to the UK and European commission have backed the call for divestment. It comes after a series of analyses that show that existing fossil fuel reserves are several times higher than the amount that could be burned if global warming is to be to kept below limits that world governments have agreed. But Farrar, writing in the Guardian on Wednesday, said that while divestment was a “grand gesture” it was not as effective as engaging with fossil fuel companies. “By maintaining our positions, we meet boards again and again, supporting their best environmental initiatives and challenging their worst. We would not be able to have the frank discussions we require if we published details, but we are confident that our engagement has impact,” he said. Selling its shares in such companies could undermine efforts to persuade companies to make their operations more low carbon to fight climate change, he said. “Were we to sell our holdings, it is unlikely that the buyers would exert the same influence.” In 2014, Wellcome’s £18bn endowment had more than £450m invested in Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. The foundation sold a £94m stake in Exxon Mobil in January, though it has not explained why.  However, Farrar noted in his article that: “when we are not satisfied that a company is engaging with our concerns, we are perfectly prepared to sell.” He added that the extent to which companies meet their environmental responsibilities was a factor in deciding whether to sell or not, and said “all companies engaged in fossil fuel extraction are not equal”. The foundation was founded with the capital left by businessman Henry Wellcome and has become a major funder of health research, most recently leading efforts to tackle the ebola virus, including co-funding the first trials of a vaccine in the UK. The Guardian is also calling on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world’s biggest charitable fund, to commit to divesting from coal, oil and gas companies. A spokesman for Bill Gates’ private office said: “We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognise that there are many views on how best to address it.”"
"Students occupied an administrative building at Oxford university on Monday in protest at the university’s decision to defer a decision on whether to dump its shares in fossil fuels. Around 15 student activists peacefully occupied the Clarendon Building and unveiled a banner. One activist told the Guardian that two police vans and two squad cars arrived at the university. “There’s lots of police around. They’ve put two security guards inside here with us,” she said. No attempt was made to remove the protesters and the security staff made no attempt to block the protesters from entering the building just as it closed for the day. Despite their stated intention to stay the night, the activists left the building at around 8pm. John Clements, who was Oxford’s director of finance until 2004, joined the sit in. He said: “We are bitterly disappointed about the university’s failure to come to a decision. Oxford should be leading the move away from investment in all world-destroying fossil fuel companies to more sustainable forms of energy.” The protest was prompted by the university saying it needed to give thorough consideration to a campaign asking it to divest from fossil fuels. A student union resolution in October called on the council to drop its shares in coal and tar sands companies and shift its investments towards low-carbon industries.  A statement released by the council on Monday said: “Last October’s Oxford university student union resolution has raised an important and multi-faceted matter which requires thorough consideration. The university council had a good discussion of the issues and agreed to consider the matter further at a future meeting.” In response to the students’ request, the university’s Socially Responsible Investment Review Committee last year conducted an inquiry on the divestment of the university’s £2bn endowment. Their report has not been made public. The council discussed the committee’s recommendations on Monday morning and decided to hold off on making a decision. Oxford student campaigner Ellen Gibson said she was “disappointed” by the decision. “Choosing not to act at a time when inactivity is an increasingly risky and unethical move. Avoidance of divestment by the University will not slow our campaign or indeed the pressing need for meaningful action on the climate crisis.” The students’ two-year campaign has been supported by a broad coalition of voices within the university. Alumni, donors and staff have all called on the university to join other educational institutions, including Stanford and Glasgow, in the divestment movement. Guardian journalist George Monbiot has told the university he will hand back his degree should they fail to divest. “I think Oxford has a moral responsibility to stop procrastinating and to engage with this issue now. Climate change is the great moral question of our age, and ducking it, as Oxford seems inclined to do, is an insufficient response. It’s a simple matter: does the university continue to invest in the destruction of the benign climatic conditions to which we owe almost everything, or doesn’t it?” he said. Solar entrepreneur and Oxford alumnus Jeremy Leggett, who has similarly vowed to return his degree, said: “I don’t think universities should be training young people to craft a viable civilisation with one hand and bankroll its sabotage with the other.” The university’s relationship with fossil fuel companies goes beyond its investments. Royal Dutch Shell funds a geoscience laboratory at the university, which investigates, and may assist with the extraction of, “unconventional hydrocarbons” (shale gas, shale oil, tight sands, clathrates and coal bed methane). Shell said it did not want to comment on the divestment decision. BREAKING: Oxford Uni alumni occupying @UniofOxford offices in protest at deferring decision on fossil fuel divestment pic.twitter.com/Rcm431ucR9 Campaigners said the imperative to divest from fossil fuels goes beyond morality. Scientists say more than two thirds of fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided. This means the companies that hold these reserves may be overvalued. Oxford’s own stranded assets programme identifies the fossil fuel campaign as the fastest growing divestment movement in history. A total of $50bn has been committed to move out of the industry as a result. High profile institutions to have committed to shift their money include the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, the British Medical Association and the World Council of Churches. Also on Monday, the Guardian launched its campaign calling on two of the world’s biggest philanthropic funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, to divest from fossil fuels."

"The debate about climate change in Australia has been hijacked in recent years by claims that reducing greenhouse gas emissions means unacceptable costs on business and consumers. Be it wiping out Whyalla or $100 roasts, the rhetoric has been overblown and absurd.  The annual report of the Better Buildings Partnership released this week demonstrates what sensible businesses know is true: that action on climate change is not just good for the planet, it can be good for the bottom line.   The report shows that the 23 members of the partnership, who represent the owners of over 50% of commercial office space in the Sydney CBD, have reduced our greenhouse emissions by 35% since 2006. Members have improved the overall sustainability performance of their buildings through measures such as lighting upgrades and green infrastructure including trigeneration. As a result, we are half way to our 70% emissions reduction target by 2030, ahead of schedule.  By making these reductions, Partnership members have also slashed our collective energy bills by $30m a year. That sounds like good business to me. Behind the headline numbers in the Partnership’s latest annual report are examples of even greater emissions reductions. At 44 Market Street, Dexus Property Group was able to achieve a 68% reduction in emissions through a building refurbishment that has transformed a dual duct plant system. As a result, the building’s Nabers Energy Rating improved to 5 stars in 2015, from 1 star at the start of the project. This is important because action to reduce greenhouse emissions from cities is crucial to the global effort to address climate change. Cities already contribute about 80% of emissions and as our planet’s population becomes increasingly urbanised this will rise.  A major contributor to emissions from cities is commercial buildings. In the city of Sydney, they are the source of over half of all greenhouse emissions.  It was this fact that led to the establishment of the Partnership four years ago, with businesses including Mirvac, Lend Lease, Dexus and Stockland. They have been joined by other including Jones Lang LaSalle, CBRE, Knight Frank and Colliers International, and the Property Council of Australia. Yet while the Partnership has made great progress, there is so much more that can be done to use energy more efficiently.  The city of Sydney has just released its Energy Efficiency Master Plan for public comment. Based on analysis by energy experts pitt&sherry, it shows how we could reduce greenhouse emissions from buildings in the Sydney local government area by 42% below 2006 levels by 2030, and save more than $600m in energy bills if existing policies are strengthened and new measures introduced.  The plan already aligns with the NSW government’s energy efficiency action plan to improve energy productivity and has been welcomed by the NSW environment minister Rob Stokes. It is on public exhibition until 4 May.  The success of the Better Buildings Partnership is real world proof that the savings identified in the city’s Efficiency Master Plan can be achieved. More than that, the Partnership is a model for how much progress can be made when government and the private sector work together on sensible, effective climate policies. "

"In 2014, the European car magazine Auto Bild drove a Mercedes C220 on autopilot for 965 kilometres (600 miles), only twice applying the brake and barely touching the steering wheel. The automated vehicle, no longer the stuff of science fiction, is on the cusp of revolutionising the way companies do business. Half of new road vehicles are registered by companies rather than individuals, and foresighted organisations are redesigning their fleets. “Everyone in the industry is looking at this”, says James Hookham, managing director for policy and communications at the Freight Transport Association. The major cause of road accidents is driver error. In the US there are 5.5m road traffic accidents annually, 93% of which are thought to be caused by human error. Approximately 1.3 million people die in car accidents every year worldwide, with driver error accounting for over 90% of those losses.  Lukas Neckermann, business consultant and author of The Mobility Revolution, believes that autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce this figure to zero. “The robotics involved are quicker to react and quicker to process data ... with no abrupt braking or acceleration, no swerving out of lane”, he says. Autonomous vehicles are not entirely accident-proof. A taskforce set up by the Casualty Actuarial Society last year warned that when factoring for “weather, vehicle errors and inoperable traffic control devices”, autonomous vehicles would reduce accidents by 78% at best. Nevertheless, that would mark significant progress. Advocates believe there’s no need for delay in this business revolution. Driverless vehicles can co-exist with human-driven cars, says Neckermann, because they “effectively calculate the actions of the non-autonomous ones, based on mounds and mounds of data” giving them “better eyesight” than human drivers. Most commercial flights are already controlled by auto-pilot – save for take-off and landing – so if we trust technology when several thousand miles up in the air, he asks, then why not on the road? Eliminating driver error has an environmental benefit. “There is a massive difference between miles per gallon from driver to driver”, explains Paul Hollick, chairman of the Institute of Car Fleet Management. “Having an autonomous vehicle, you can know exactly what that vehicle can and will do.” On motorways, automated heavy good vehicles could drive in trains with small gaps between each truck for improved aerodynamics. This offers fuel economy gains of 20-30%, says Neckermann, who believes the first logistics company to take the leap will gain significant competitive advantage. In this brave new world, traffic jams caused by the accumulative effect of people braking would be no more. “The autonomous vehicle doesn’t just see the car in front, but sees the car 20 cars in front”, says Neckermann, thanks to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The economic impact of traffic jams amounts to €100bn (£80.7bn) across the EU; in the US, they lead to an unnecessary 2.9bn gallons of fuel guzzled every year.  “You will also potentially have a reduction in staff costs because you can run your fleet with fewer people”, Neckermann says. This doesn’t mean the end of the line for professional drivers, however, of whom there is already a shortage. Hollick believes autonomous vehicles will still need a person per vehicle, only they will be “far more engaged in the duty they have to perform when they arrive, for example on the customer experience.” He believes this could open up more employment for disabled people too. Driverless cars free up the time of commuters. British commuters lose 10 working days a year stuck in traffic. If that time was spent on work or rest, rather than frustrated behind the wheel, it could have significant economic impact. Much of these benefits remain theoretical, however. Neckermann admits that currently driverless sensors struggle with things such as potholes, faulty traffic lights, missing signs or unexpected diversions. There is also a significant question regarding liability. “If there is a crash, who is responsible?” asks Hollick. “Is it the manufacturer, is it the telematics company which has provided the sensors, is it the driver, is it the employer? We don’t know.” Most agree that autonomy is coming – it just depends how soon. Business will likely be an early adopter because of its high turnover of vehicles, with most fleets replaced every eight years. Fleet managers now “select vehicles very strategically, looking at whole life costs rather than just the cost of the metal”, says Hollick, meaning adoption may come quickly. But how quickly? Neckermann suggests autonomous fleets will be on our roads by 2025. Renault-Nissan and Volvo both intend to sell self-driving cars by the end of this decade, with other major car manufacturers close behind. Prototypes of the Google car, designed to drive autonomously without a steering wheel, are already on public roads. The UK is hosting four driverless prototype trials. “I think it will benefit every fleet in the UK”, says Hollick. “In 20 years time children will look back and say, ‘what, you actually drove that yourself?’ It’s going to be a revolution.” The business futures hub is funded by The Crystal.

"For over 200 years, modern civilisation has been built on fossil fuels; now climate science says we must phase out fossil fuel pollution in just a few decades. That’s a colossal challenge – especially if we are to keep anything resembling current lifestyles while also ending the poverty that blights the lives of more than 1 billion fellow human beings. We are already seeing a significant shift in thinking. The Rockefeller Foundation is divesting from coal and tar sands. Oxford University is considering similar action. And the Bank of England is analysing the impact on financial systems of fossil fuel investments becoming “stranded assets” – in other words worthless – if the world gets its act together on climate change.  I want this year’s UN climate change negotiations to be the seminal moment when humanity faces up to these challenges. That’s why I’m strongly backing the Guardian’s campaign to raise the profile of the divestment debate prior to climate change negotiations in Paris in December. My own party has been clear: we want to see Britain’s unabated use of coal ending by 2025. The world has been preparing for Paris for four years – as it did not for Copenhagen’s failed summit in 2009. That won’t guarantee success but it means Paris is our best chance of getting that elusive global climate deal. I’m proud to have led the brokering of the ambitious 2030 climate package in the European Union to cut greenhouse gases by at least 40%, which puts the EU ahead of the global pack in terms of commitments. Yet I’m all too aware of the remaining political hurdles, whether it’s supporting Barack Obama in his climate leadership working with the Chinese and Indian governments to promote a new “green growth” development model or taking on the massive vested interests linked to fossil fuels. In order to make Paris a success, politicians must lead – and, frankly, put the hours in. Deals of this significance do not come easily. Liberal Democrats have now adopted my proposal for five green laws, for our general election manifesto’s front page. These include a zero-carbon Britain bill to raise the UK’s own 2050 climate change targets and give the UK’s green investment bank borrowing powers. We won’t rescue humanity from self-destruction without a dramatic change in how we invest for our future energy needs. While recent years have brought massive capital flows into clean energy, fossil fuel investments remain huge. Many long-term insurance and pension liabilities are offset by fossil fuel assets. Yet groups as diverse as the International Energy Agency, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Carbon Tracker Initiative tell us that such investments look increasingly risky – because much of the known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground, to keep warming under the two-degree limit scientists tell us we must stick to. The Bank of England is not the only central bank looking at this. Brazil and South Africa are among those quietly analysing the fear that investors could in the future be left with stranded fossil fuel assets, potentially leading to ` bankruptcies and even a repeat of the 2008 banking crash. This is not to say that they are arguing we can, or should, suddenly turn off fossil fuel production or investment. Too many commentators fail to distinguish between different fossil fuels, and fail to take account of what I call the time dimension. The immediate fossil fuel challenge is to get out of coal. Analysts reckon 82% of global coal reserves must be left unburned. With China set to reach peak coal production more quickly than expected, coal investments look especially risky. Even carbon capture usage and storage won’t save many coal investments. Oil and gas are different. While we already have alternative ways of producing electricity –renewables and nuclear – technologies for replacing oil in transport and gas in heating are less developed. Replacing some 50 power stations in the UK is a different proposition from replacing nearly 30m cars and more than 20m gas boilers. The UK’s carbon plan sets out ways in which we can meet our Climate Change Act targets. It shows we can safely use oil and gas for a few decades more, as long as low-carbon heat and transport technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles gradually roll out. The near-term challenge is securing our oil and gas supplies, particularly from the North Sea, so that we can avoid becoming more dependent on imports from less reliable countries, be they Middle Eastern states or Russia. But we must shift away from fossil fuel investments into clean energy over the next two decades. Government policy here and abroad must facilitate that with strong regulations – particularly on transparency and disclosure, with new reporting requirements on firms and financial institutions about their fossil fuel assets. Don’t underestimate how powerful this would be. When global fund managers react to fuller information about the carbon risks they are holding using normal hedging techniques, modest adjustments of investors’ portfolios will release several trillion dollars into the low-carbon economy. If London and New York can agree this year on new regulations requiring such disclosures, ideally with Brussels and Tokyo too, that would be a historic step forward in global climate change policy. And it might help persuade the rest of the world that the developed, richer nations were really serious about helping the emerging and developing world to grow, but in a low-carbon way. An ambitious global treaty in Paris would then look so much easier to achieve."

"David Rose is a writer for the UK tabloid Mail on Sunday, and is known for his inaccurate and misleading climate change coverage. Rose is particularly fond of cherry picking data to hide the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice. In August 2014, he published a piece focusing on the fact that at the time, there was more sea ice in the Arctic than during the record-breaking summer of 2012. Rose’s misguided focus on noisy short-term data is underscored by the new record low winter Arctic sea ice extent we experienced this year, less than seven months after his piece was published. Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics and Political Science, filed a complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) about Rose’s piece. Ipso is intended to police the UK print media. It replaced the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) in this assignment after the latter was roundly criticised for failing to take action in the News of the World phone hacking affair. Ipso describes itself as,  the independent regulator of the newspaper and magazine industry. We exist to promote and uphold the highest professional standards of journalism in the UK, and to support members of the public in seeking redress where they believe that the Editors’ Code of Practice has been breached … IPSO is here to serve the public by holding publications to account for their actions. The first clause in the Editors’ Code of Practice deals with accuracy of the Press and includes the following provision. i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information, including pictures. Bob Ward’s complaint alleged that Rose and the Mail had violated this section of the Code on several points, for example by giving the impression that the long-term decline in Arctic sea ice had reversed and by claiming that polar bear populations aren’t declining. On each point, Ward was correct that Rose’s piece is at best misleading, and often factually incorrect. Nevertheless, yesterday Ipso ruled in favor of Rose and the Mail. On the Arctic sea ice decline, although Rose makes too much of the last two years worth of data, he does acknowledge that ‘the long-term trend still shows a decline’ and states carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for global warming which has in turn caused sea ice to decline. He also quotes climate scientist Dr Ed Hawkins, one of four scientists he spoke to, warning “against reading too much into ice increase over the past two years on the grounds that 2012 was an ‘extreme low’.” But he also cites contrarian climate scientist Judith Curry, who allegedly told him, The Arctic sea ice spiral of death seems to have reversed. This claim is entirely false, as the data in the following video illustrates. Rose also quoted climate scientist Ed Hawkins saying, in understated fashion, I’m uncomfortable with the idea of people saying the ice has bounced back So Ipso ruled that by including these comments from two climate scientists, Rose “had made clear that scientific opinions regarding the significance of the most recent data varied.” In this specific case, most of the fault lies with Judith Curry for providing Rose with a misleading and scientifically indefensible quote. However, on several other points, Rose’s piece was simply factually wrong. For example, it claimed, Yet even when the ice reached a low point in 2012, there was no scientific evidence that bear numbers were declining As Ward pointed out in his complaint, the Polar Bear Specialist Group has reported that several polar bear sub-populations are declining. Specifically, in the group’s latest report, they found that three sub-populations are declining, six are stable, one is increasing, and nine lack sufficient data. For example, one recent study found that the number of polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea has declined by approximately 40% over the past decade. Polar bear survival is strongly tied to the abundance of sea ice, which they rely upon to hunt seals. While Arctic sea ice as a whole is declining rapidly, in some areas it has remained stable, depending upon local geographic conditions. In areas with stable sea ice, polar bear sub-populations have also generally remained stable.  However, sea ice in other regions has declined, and the local polar bear sub-populations along with them. The long-term outlook is bleak for both Arctic sea ice and polar bears, including in most regions where the ice has so far remained stable. Uncurbed global warming will eventually melt the ice, even in currently stable regions. In any case, there was scientific evidence in 2012 that several polar bear sub-populations had declined. Ipso ruled in Rose’s favour because he wrote, the main international bear science body, the Polar Bear Specialist Group, admits it has no reliable data from almost half of the Arctic, so cannot say whether numbers are falling or rising. However, this is different from claiming that there is no scientific evidence that polar bear numbers are declining. The data show that three sub-populations are declining, and some very rapidly. In short, Rose has confused a lack of data from some sub-populations with “no evidence” of population decline. The latter is simply untrue. The available data are very concerning, which is why polar bears are listed as a threatened species. Rose also took comments by Al Gore out of context, and plotted Arctic sea ice extent data for the period 2004–2014 while claiming the “melt has slowed over 10 years”. Ward raised issue with both points, in the latter case noting that if we consider the long-term data, the Arctic melt has actually accelerated over the past decade (as illustrated in the above video).  In both cases Ipso ruled that because Gore was quoted correctly and the data were plotted correctly, the fact that they were cherry picked and taken out of context did not violate the code. Given that the editor’s code prohibits the publication of misleading and distorted information, this ruling seems incorrect and indefensible. In short, Rose has cracked the Ipso code. In order to publish misleading articles without repercussions, British tabloids need only to include scientifically indefensible quotes from contrarian scientists, and to accurately represent the information that they’ve misleadingly cherry picked. Sadly, Ipso seems as toothless to curb climate misinformation as the PCC before it. • This article was amended on 2 April 2015 to include the fact that David Rose had stated that the “long-term trend still shows a decline” and that he had spoken to four scientists in total. In addition we have appended the following response from Rose:  “Like anyone who challenges aspects of the so-called ‘consensus’ over climate change, I’ve grown inured to being called a ‘denier’, as some of the commenters ‘below the line’ claim I am here. It is with some weariness that I must point out, as I did in the article that started this fuss, that I accept that the long-term Arctic ice trend is down, that carbon dioxide of human origin is an important cause of this trend, and that, unchecked, it will lead eventually to ice-free Arctic summers – albeit perhaps not for decades.  “But to be attacked for something I didn’t actually write is unfortunate. The fact remains there are large uncertainties and intense debate among scientists on this and other climate change topics, even if, as has been said, 97 per cent agree that the world is warming and that humans are partly to blame. But that doesn’t take us very far, and there are important differences of opinion. Professor Judith Curry isn’t a ‘contrarian’ but a very distinguished scientist and ice expert with a long record of peer-reviewed publications, though she happens to disagree with Mr Nuccitelli.  “As for the bears, the head of the Polar Bear Specialist Group said last year that the bear totals it issues have only ever been a ‘qualified guess to satisfy public demand’, and that the gaps in the data are so big that ‘the range given for total global population should be viewed with great caution as it cannot be used to assess population trend over the long term’.”"
"Ted Cruz officially kicked off the long US presidential campaign when he declared his candidacy this week, but his anti-environmental rhetoric has already set the stage for a looming war over whether climate-change denial is a legitimate barrier to the most powerful job in the world. Leading scientists are preparing for an American election in which global warming may receive much higher billing than before – and Republicans’ statements will be exposed to a level of scrutiny they have not formally had to deal with.  Cruz, the red-meat Texas senator with an army of conservative followers, raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he told the Texas Tribune that people who believe global warming is real are “the equivalent of the flat-Earthers”. “It used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier,” Cruz said. The comments were emblematic of the environmental threat that has plagued the Republican party for years. Buoyed by the oil and gas companies and fossil-fuel-funder mega-donors that increasingly bankroll their campaigns, most prominent Republican politicians have either denied that climate change exists or refused to stake out a clear position, citing their personal lack of scientific knowledge. But as the subject’s specter looms larger by the day, and as presumed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has stepped up her calls on the need to battle climate change as a potential signature issue, the “I’m not a scientist” line is infuriating scientists. “I think, frankly, the Republican party is going to have to make a decision,” Michael Mann, director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, who contributed to a Nobel Prize-winning landmark report on global warming, told the Guardian. “Are they going to move in the direction of logic and rationality, or are they going to continue to pursue this anti-scientific fringe movement within their party that is personified by people liked Ted Cruz? “As long as the Koch brothers are pouring tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns,” Mann said, referring to the top conservative donors, “there’s going to be enough oxygen to keep these folks going.” The real test, Mann said, lies with establishment-backed candidates like former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who recently declared himself a climate skeptic despite his previous assertion that the climate may be warming.  As the governor of a state regarded as the hotbed for hurricanes and coastal erosion, Bush fought against drilling off the Florida coast and launched a massive Everglades restoration project.  Among the potential candidates expected to announce their intentions beginning in an April wave, only Kentucky senator Rand Paul and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham have bucked their party by acknowledging that climate change is real.  The conservative field for the 2016 election is otherwise made up of proud deniers, such as Cruz, and those who would rather plead ignorance, along with Florida senator Marco Rubio and Texas governor Rick Perry. This ambiguity falls short of the criteria by which scientists believe the media – and undecided young voters – should judge each candidate’s response. “I’m not a doctor, but I know not to drink arsenic,” Mann said. “Each of these candidates is going to have to decide how they’re going to contend with this.” Recent polls that show support among the majority of Americans, including half of Republicans, for government action to curtail greenhouse gas emissions may make uncomfortable reading for GOP candidates. Two-thirds of Americans said they would be more likely to vote for candidates who campaigned on fighting climate change. Among Republican voters, 48% said they preferred candidates who would take on climate change. Growing concern among the American electorate suggests climate change may emerge as a major issue in 2016, something that would mark a change from prior elections in which it was scarcely discussed in debates or on the campaign trail, failing to make it into the topics that mattered most to voters.  In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney was not alone in ignoring climate change. Even Barack Obama, who has taken a more aggressive approach in cutting carbon emissions during his second term, took heat from environmental activists in his base for being elusive over global warming during his presidential campaign. More recently, the president has made the fight against climate change one of the top priorities of his administration. The Pentagon’s declaration that global warming is a national security threat has also raised the debate’s national political profile. Even so, scientists are not holding their breath for any outright climate change acknowledgements by Republican candidates.  “It would be suicide in their primaries,” John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St Thomas School of Engineering in Minnesota, told the Guardian. The fate of the political discourse over climate change, he argued, in many ways lies in the hands of voters in town halls as well as reporters and debate moderators – and whether they accept outright denial from Cruz and vague obfuscation from other candidates at face value. “If this were a political issue, the media would be entirely within its rights to provide equal voice to both sides,” Abraham said. “However, this is a story that is grounded in science – it’s a lot like what causes Ebola, what causes flu, or how do we treat cancer. “Global warming is not a political problem – it’s a scientific problem.”"
"Leaders and representatives of 30 European cities will gather in Paris on Thursday to declare their commitment to “clean” policies to fight climate change. Officials will also sign a declaration agreeing to use their collective purchasing power – estimated at around €10bn (£7.4bn) a year – to buy eco-friendly.  The gathering comes eight months before Paris hosts the United Nations climate change conference, known as COP21, aimed at achieving a binding, universal and international agreement on climate for the first time in more than 20 years of UN negotiations. In a joint statement signed by 26 European mayors, including London’s Boris Johnson, city representatives said they hoped combining forces to favour green and low-carbon industries for procurement contracts would have a “leverage effect on the private sector that very often aligns its own requirements with the public sector”. “[The] time has now come for European capitals and metropolises to pool our efforts to tackle climate change. This requires a closer dialogue between cities through a more regular exchange of expertise and good practices,” they declared. The mayors will arrive at Paris’ city hall in electric Autolib’ cars, from the city’s car-sharing service, decorated in the colours of their country. The summit comes a week after Paris was declared the most polluted city on the planet after a choking cloud almost obscured its most symbolic monuments including the Eiffel Tower and left the city of light looking more like the capital of smog."
"The final element of the Abbott government’s Direct Action climate change policy will at best mean major polluters continue business as usual and at worst lead to significant increases in their greenhouse gas emissions according to the Climate Institute thinktank. The framework for the final part of Direct Action scheme – the so-called “safeguards mechanism” – confirms it will allow big polluters to buy carbon credits if they exceed new baselines for their greenhouse emissions, but also that it will set those baselines at levels that ensure few companies will have to.  An issues paper on the “safeguards” released Thursday confirmed the policy could become a “baseline and credit” emissions trading scheme, but said at the outset that emissions baselines would “reflect the highest level of reported emissions for a facility over the historical period 2009-10 to 2013-14”.  Baselines for new projects would be set “at a level to encourage facilities to achieve and maintain best practice”. “This places no real responsibility on the largest emitters in Australia to reduce their emissions,” said the Climate Institute’s Erwin Jackson. “In theory it could set real limits on emissions and in theory it could become a baseline and credit scheme, but there is no indication from the government they would be prepared to do that.” The safeguard mechanism is supposed to ensure that polluting industries not increase their emissions and undo the emission reductions purchased through the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund. It will apply to around 140 facilities with emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 – electricity generators, mines, manufacturers – and will be administered by the clean energy regulator set up by the previous government. The government has given stakeholders a month to respond to the issues paper. According to the paper, the government is also considering allowing some mines to have baselines higher than their historical average if “historical high point does not fully reflect expected business-as-usual emissions.” “These are operations where there is a natural resource or reserve associated with the operation of a facility; the grade or depth of the resource or reserve will have a direct effect on the emissions performance of a facility; the facility has limited ability to control for such emissions; and facility emissions are expected to exceed their historical baseline and the change in natural resource grade or depth is the primary reason for this.”"
"Scotland’s carbon footprint appears to be on the rise according to a report published by the Scottish government, with the growth in consumer spending pushing up the country’s CO2 emissions. The country generated overall emissions of 76.8m tonnes equivalent (mte) of CO2 in 2012, the study found, an increase of 5.3% on the previous year.  While the figures show a longer-term decline from a peak of 94.3mte CO2 in 2007, the recent increase is a blow to the Scottish Government, which has failed to meet its legally-binding emissions targets every year since they were introduced. Today’s figures account for greenhouse gas emissions produced within Scotland, but also include estimates of the environmental impact of goods and services consumed in the country, no matter where in the world they originate.  While emissions generated directly in Scotland fell 6.6% from 13.8 to 12.9mte CO2 between 1998 and 2012, the reduction has been offset by an increasing reliance on imports. Foreign sources represented 44% of Scotland’s emissions in 2012. Commenting on the figures, Friends of the Earth Scotland Director Dr Richard Dixon said: An economy powered by excessive consumption drives dangerous climate change, but often the true scale of our impact is hidden. Almost everything that we buy has a carbon cost which measures the energy, materials and water that goes into producing it. We now buy so much stuff from overseas that the impact of these spending choices is just as important as the emissions we generate here at home. He added that the increase in emissions seemed to be linked to Scotland’s recovery from the global financial crisis. As the economy has recovered our carbon footprint has shot up again by 5.3% in just one year. If we are serious about cutting our carbon footprint we need to buy less stuff, buy more locally, get help with making our homes more energy efficient and switch to public and active transport. Improving European product standards are helping but the Scottish Government needs to do more to make the low-carbon choices the easy ones, from transport to where we get our food and from insulating our homes to buying the right goods. Lang Banks, director of WWF Scotland, echoed Dixon’s concerns: It’s disappointing to see that Scotland’s carbon footprint appears to be back on the rise.  These figures are an important reminder that decisions taken here in Scotland result in greenhouse gas emissions around the world.  Our carbon footprint is a one of the Scottish Government’s national performance indicators and if it is to be turned round we need to see the Ministers use all their powers to help secure the low carbon economy Scotland needs and wants.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman emphasised that, in spite of the recent increase, the country had seen a reduction in emissions in the long term: We are working hard to reduce Scotland’s greenhouse gas footprint, and have seen a 6.3 per cent decrease since 1998 while our population has increased by almost five per cent over the same period.  Although the Scottish Government is leading the way internationally with our transition to a low carbon economy, tackling climate change is not for governments alone – it needs everyone to play their part. Taking action to cut waste and use resources more efficiently can help Scottish businesses and households save money as well as reducing emissions, no matter where products are sourced. The Scottish Government has committed to reducing Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by the end of the decade. It has previously said that the country is on track to meet the target, despite repeatedly failing to achieve its annual reductions in CO2."

"A Guardian petition which calls for the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to ditch their fossil fuel investments has gathered more than 100,000 signatures since it launched on Monday. The campaign asks the world’s two largest charitable foundations to divest from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies within five years and to immediately freeze any new investments. It was launched by Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger in partnership with the global climate movement 350.org. High profile signatories include Scottish actor Tilda Swinton and Professor Anne Glover, the former chief scientific adviser to the president of the European commission. The campaign has also attracted the support of activist Bianca Jagger, Costa award-winning author Helen Macdonald and Rou Reynolds from the band Enter Shikari, while chef Yotam Ottolenghi said he backed it “because we’re running out of time and it’s pretty terrifying”.  Rusbridger said: “The argument for a campaign to divest from the world’s most polluting companies is becoming an overwhelming one, on both moral and pragmatic grounds. The usual rule of newspaper campaigns is that you don’t start one unless you know you’re going to win it. This one will almost certainly be won in time: the physics is unarguable.” Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, said: “We’re at a tipping point and it’s become clear that people and institutions of good conscience have to cut these ties. Now 100,000 people from around the world have combined to say that these giant philanthropies need to walk their talk.” The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have more than $1.4bn (£1bn) invested in fossil fuel companies, according to a Guardian analysis of their most recent tax filings in 2013. The charity has already given out $33bn in grants to global health programmes, including those dedicated to tackling the spread of malaria, polio and HIV. The Wellcome Trust, which is one of the world’s largest funders of medical research, has an endowment of over £18bn. In 2014, a minimum of £450m was invested in fossil fuel companies including Shell, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and BP.  More than 200 institutions worldwide have now either divested from fossil fuels or have committed to do so, including faith organisations, local authorities and universities. In September 2014, a coalition of more than 50 philanthropic organisations and individuals in control of $50bn in assets committed to divestment. The Wellcome Trust has refused to divest, arguing that its investments allow it to engage with fossil fuel companies, which offer “a better prospect for change than divestment”. The foundation was unable to provide the Guardian with examples of this engagement. A spokeswoman for the Wellcome Trust said climate change and health was “a highly complex issue which we take seriously in our decisions and on which we engage with policy-makers, researchers and the businesses in which we invest.” The Gates Foundation refused to comment on its position on fossil fuel divestment, arguing their investments are handled by the Asset Trust, which does not make public statements. A spokesman for Bill Gates’s private office said: “We respect the passion of advocates for action on climate change, and recognise that there are many views on how best to address it. Bill is privately investing considerable time and resources in the effort [to develop clean energy].” The most recent annual letter from the $43.5bn Gates Foundation asks “whether the progress we’re predicting will be stifled by climate change. The long-term threat is so serious that the world needs to move much more aggressively – right now – to develop energy sources that are cheaper, can deliver on demand, and emit zero carbon dioxide.” Both the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation sold off their respective £94m and $766m investments in the oil company ExxonMobil, which has funded climate change denial in the past. Both companies refuse to invest in tobacco on moral grounds. Ed Davey, Minister for Energy and Climate Change  backed the Guardian Keep it in the Ground campaign on Tuesday, urging pension and insurance funds to consider divestment from “very risky” coal assets.  Writing in the Guardian, he said: “I want this year’s UN climate change negotiations to be the seminal moment when humanity faces up to these challenges. That’s why I’m strongly backing the Guardian’s campaign to raise the profile of the divestment debate prior to climate change negotiations in Paris in December.” The campaign has also received the backing of the Climate and Health Council, which encouraged the British Medical Association to commit to divestment last year, the first health organisation in the world to do so. Co-chair Dr Robin Stott described the Wellcome Trust’s decision to maintain their fossil fuel investments as “a dereliction of duty”. The coalition was one of a number of medical groups that published a report in February, calling on health organisations to divest on moral grounds, as they previously did with tobacco investments. The report cited the UCL/Lancet commission on climate change which described climate change as “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century”. Professor Hugh Montgomery, co-author of the report and director of the Institute for Human Health and Performance at the University College London said: “I am backing the Guardian divestment campaign because I support the Gates Foundation and am a great fan of their work. I just want to help them to do more good.”"
"The Prince of Wales has described how the world faces the challenges of an economic system with enormous shortcomings, and an environmental crisis that threatens us all. His words of warning came on Friday at the end of his four-day tour of America when he gave a speech on health and the environment following a symposium in Louisville, Kentucky.  Earlier that day the heir to the throne was praised as “the greatest” by Louisville’s most famous son, renowned boxer Muhammad Ali. The sport superstar’s words came in a letter – not in person – as he was not well enough to join leading figures from the city at a cultural greeting for Charles and Camilla. At the Kentucky Centre for African American Heritage – a stone’s throw from Ali’s childhood home – Louisville’s mayor, Greg Fischer, read Ali’s words: “[My wife] Lonnie and I welcome you to our hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, USA. “We are honoured that you have come to explore, share and learn about new sustainable initiatives that are so close to your heart.” The former boxer added: “As you travel back to your homeland, we hope you know how much this city respects and admires the many contributions you have made in the world. “We think you are the greatest.” Later, speaking at the Cathedral of the Assumption, Charles told the invited audience: “We are standing at a moment of substantial transition where we face the dual challenges of a world view and an economic system that seem to have enormous shortcomings, together with an environmental crisis – including that of climate change – which threatens to engulf us all.” He added: “Our ability to adapt to the effects of climate change, and then perhaps even to reduce those effects, depends upon us adapting our pursuit of ‘unlimited’ economic growth to that of ‘sustainable’ economic growth. “And that depends upon basing our approach on the fundamental resilience of our ecosystems. Ecosystem resilience leads to economic resilience. “If we carry on destroying our marine and forest ecosystems as we are doing, then we will rob them of their natural resilience and so end up destroying our own.” On Thursday the heir to the throne was presented with the exceptional leadership in conservation honour, from the International Conservation Caucus Foundation during a ceremony in Washington. It recognised how Charles has been highlighting his environmental concerns for decades and during that time has set up a number of bodies to help find solutions to rainforest deforestation and over-fishing of fish stocks, while he is now tackling a new issue of the dumping of plastics in the world’s waters.

"Pension and insurance funds should consider urgent divestment from “very risky” coal assets and then gradually retreat from oil and gas, Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate change secretary, has warned. Throwing his weight behind the Guardian’s “Keep it in the ground” campaign, he said a recent analysis which suggested 82% of coal reserves must remain untouched if temperature increases are to be kept below 2C – the widely accepted threshold for dangerous climate change – was “realistic”. Davey said it was not up to an energy minister to tell fund managers how to run their businesses, but added that it was vital to introduce regulatory transparency that would drive investors from fossil fuels to renewables. “If you invest in a lot of coal assets you may be over-exposed but it is up to you to make that decision and for government to ensure the information is available. The 82%... is quite a number. It seems to me to be relatively realistic,” he argued. “We are going to need a lot of oil and gas over the next two or three decades but increasingly over time I think these oil and gas assets will look risky as the world makes climate change treaties, as it will do, as carbon pricing becomes more ubiquitous and companies cut down on fossil fuel use far, far quicker than you expect and therefore this argument is really, really significant.” On Monday, the Guardian launched a campaign asking the two largest charitable foundations in the world – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to move their investments out of fossil fuel companies. More than 72,000 people have signed the petition calling for the foundations to divest. Introducing the campaign, editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger wrote: “This [campaign] will almost certainly be won in time: the physics is unarguable. But we are launching our campaign today in the firm belief that it will force the issue now into the boardrooms and inboxes of people who have billions of dollars at their disposal.”  Davey wrote in a comment piece, “I’m strongly backing the Guardian’s campaign to raise the profile of the divestment debate ahead of the December climate change negotiations in Paris.” His support comes amid signs that British pension funds, banks and insurance companies have not changed their behaviour since a major report warned last year they were much more financially exposed than their European counterparts to overvalued or “stranded” fossil fuels. And it comes as members of the European parliament in Brussels plan to establish a specialist group to campaign in favour of carbon divestment and demand new carbon reporting requirements. Davey said investors such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, heirs to the Standard Oil fortunes, were already showing the way by divesting from coal and highly polluting oil or tar sands. “Government cannot instruct these trillions of pounds and dollars that are in the control of private funds to move from x to y. What we can do is to put in place an incentive structure that will encourage people to think like that. “Even modest swings out of fossil fuels into clean energy will have a dramatic effect. Carbon Tracker and Mark Carney [governor of the Bank of England] are not saying you cannot invest in fossil fuels but if you have a high level of disclosure it can be a game changer.” Asked whether it was compatible to issue these kinds of warnings and yet give short-term subsidies to keep coal plants open, support fracking and continue to give tax breaks to North Sea oil companies, Davey said coal had to be treated more urgently than oil or gas even though, for energy security reasons, the UK needed some coal-fired power plants for the very short term. “I have been clear that coal assets are very risky but you are not going to get rid of cars and gas heating systems overnight and so we are going to need quite a lot of oil and gas. The question is would you like that to come from Russia and Qatar or locally where it is well regulated, gives us jobs and provides tax revenues.” While the Bank of England is looking at the dangers of a carbon bubble, there is frustration that nothing has been heard from the European Central Bank on the same issue. Reinhard Bütikofer, a Green MEP, said Europe’s financial institutions were largely “asleep at the wheel” on this issue, in spite of numerous wake-up calls on the carbon bubble from stakeholders such as the the Bank of England. Bütikofer and some of his colleagues are behind the establishment of a fossil fuel divestment group inside the European parliament.  They were also behind a report issued by the Green European Foundation, called Carbon Bubble: The Price of Doing Too Little Too Late published last year. This report shows that a British pension funds such as the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme “stand out as the most vulnerable” across the European Union. Current and former employees at British Airways and British Steel also have their pension investments more highly skewed towards coal, oil and gas investment than average, according to the report. Meanwhile, Barclays Bank has a high share of outstanding corporate loans to companies involved in carbon activities while Lloyds Banking Group has a higher than average share of high-carbon equity and bond holdings. The data and analysis concludes that up to €1tn of investments could be at risk from a sudden change to a low carbon economy triggered by a breakthrough in clean technology. The carbon bubble refers to the overvaluation of fossil fuel reserves and related assets should the world meet its stated aim of limiting climate change. The report points out that the objective of limiting any increase in the Earth’s surface temperature to 2C makes it impossible to burn many of the reserves that have been found, leaving “stranded assets.” But the report says that equity, bond and credit exposures to companies holding fossil fuels are substantial across the European Union. It is estimated that pension funds hold up to €330bn (£238bn), banks €480bn and insurance firms €400bn. “Such large figures raise serious concerns about the potential consequences of these investments if a large part of the oil, gas and coal reserves ends up stranded,” argues the report, which was written by Profundo, a Dutch economic research consultancy, and partly funded by the European Parliament. The overall impact of a carbon bubble is not seen as a likely source of systemic risk. “However, in the case of continued economic fragility in the Eurozone, a carbon bubble shock would come on top of other causes of financial instability and would be more difficult to absorb.” The report highlights Britain as a particularly vulnerable country. “Although a precise ranking is not possible, analysis shows than many pension funds from the UK have a large exposure to the carbon bubble. These include the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and BAE Systems Pension Scheme.” The Profundo research describes the fact that 12% of the USS, is invested in high carbon assets as remarkable, especially as the further education fund itself warned in its own report back of 2001 about the risk of climate change to investors. By comparison, the pension fund for Shell oil employees has less than 6% of its assets in high-carbon investments. USS said it had been looking at climate change as an investment issue for many years. The fund was already encouraging companies to improve their disclosures of carbon emissions and how they were managing climate risks. “In addition, since 2000 the fund has also committed approximately $300m in renewable energy, low carbon and clean tech investments.” Some energy companies are already taking steps to reduce their exposure to carbon. E.ON, one of the big six power suppliers in the UK, is splitting its business into two. The current name will remain with a business that will be dedicated to renewable power. The United Nations organisation in charge of global climate change talks said earlier this week it was lending its “moral authority” to the carbon divestment campaign."

"The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has said hundreds of millions of Earth hour participants around the world will demand a strong global climate agreement by switching off their lights for an hour on Saturday night. Many of the world’s brightest lights will go dark at 8:30pm (GMT) as Earth hour marks its ninth year. In a video address, Ban said the symbolic switching-off held more significance than ever, just nine months before a pivotal UN meeting on the climate crisis in Paris.  “Climate change is a people problem. People cause climate change and people suffer from climate change. People can also solve climate change. This December in Paris, the United Nations is bringing nations together to agree a new, universal and meaningful climate agreement. It will be the culmination of a year of action on sustainable development,” said Ban. More than 7,000 cities in 172 countries are expected to take part in the world’s largest ever demonstration, which has grown from a single World Wildlife Fund (WWF) event in Sydney in 2007. “Earth Hour shows what is possible when we unite in support of a cause: no individual action is too small, no collective vision is too big. This is the time to use your power,” said Ban. Organisers said this year’s demonstration would be the biggest yet. Sudhanshu Sarronwala, chair of Earth Hour global said: “Climate change is not just the issue of the hour, it’s the issue of our generation. The lights may go out for one hour, but the actions of millions throughout the year will inspire the solutions required to change climate change.” Some the world’s most famous landmarks will turn their lights out. The UN building in New York will join London’s Houses of Parliament, Rio de Janeiro’s Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. In Bulgaria a giant Danube sturgeon fish will be drawn in fire in the capital, Sofia. Millions of other, more humble, participants will take part by simply switching from electricity to candlelight for an hour. Colin Butfield, director of campaigns at WWF-UK said the mass participation was a demand for climate action and politicians should take heed. “The fact that such a huge number of people are taking part in Earth Hour across the world and are using it as a moment to inspire action on sustainability in their own communities sends a really clear message that the public is ready to tackle climate change – we now need politicians to show the same drive,” he said. Britain’s energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, who has been heavily involved in the climate negotiations at the UN, called for a response to climate change that was commensurate with its threat. “It’s time for everyone to recognise that climate change will touch just about everything we do and everything we care about. Earth Hour is an excellent opportunity for millions of people across the world to take one simple step to show they’re serious about backing action on climate change,” said Davey.  Ban said the focus on climate change should not distract from Earth Hour’s other key mission: introducing clean energy to the most remote and impoverished communities on Earth. “By turning out the lights we also highlight that more than a billion people lack access to electricity. Their future wellbeing requires access to clean, affordable energy,” he said. In 2014 Earth Hour used a crowdfunding platform to raise money and deliver thousands of fuel-efficient stoves to families in Madagascar and solar kits to remote villages in Uganda. The organisation also supplied islands in the Philippines with solar power for the first time and raised money for victims of Typhoon Haiyan."
" Dear Mr van Beurden In February, you gave a speech calling on your peers, as you put it in your title, to be “less aloof, more assertive” on climate change. Given your prominence as CEO of Shell and the resurgence of interest in climate, your speech has rightly provoked debate. Perhaps I could set out some reflections that passed through my mind as I studied it. Most of what I am about to say applies well beyond Shell. The title of your speech is intriguing. I have been involved in this debate for 20 years, six of them as the UK’s diplomatic envoy on climate change. During that time many adjectives have been applied to your industry - not always fairly. But nobody has ever accused you of being aloof. Yes, there have been more strident voices. You have spoken in measured terms, in prose not poetry, with the quiet confidence of those who know they never have to shout to be heard. And you have sometimes chosen to express yourselves behind closed doors, or through others, rather than out in the open. You have an undeniable interest in the choices society makes about climate change. But you have been sophisticated in pursuit of that interest, as you perceive it. From the start, nobody has been less aloof, more assertive, nor more influential than the oil and gas industry. For a leader in that industry now to express concern that it is not close enough to the climate debate sounds a bit, if you’ll forgive me, like a fish protesting that the ocean it swims through is not wet enough. The summary that accompanies the published text of your speech also catches the eye. It anticipates an “energy transition”. But it foresees no change “in the longer term” in the drivers of supply and demand for oil. And it urges the industry to “make its voice heard” at the UN climate conference in Paris in December (COP21). This would add “realism and practicality” to a conversation from which, by implication, these attributes are currently lacking. In other words, the energy transition to come will be an unusual kind of transition. It will have no structural consequences for the energy system itself, or at least for the markets on which your business model depends. But this prospect, your summary suggests, is in jeopardy. The unrealistic and impractical voices that currently dominate the climate debate want to use COP21 to unleash a more threatening kind of transition. To prevent this, the industry must overcome its habitual reticence and raise its voice. Engagement, with delusions of aloofness. Commitment, to a transition that ends where it began. Such cognitive dissonance suggests, even before we get to the text, that your speech may say more about the state of mind of your industry than the external conditions that prompted you to speak out. Those who have dedicated their lives and careers to your industry must sometimes feel your virtues go unacknowledged while the sins of the world are heaped at your door. The story of civilisation is an energy story. Nobody has told it better than your colleague Frank Niele in his classic book on energy, which should be better known. The most gripping chapter of the energy story spans the last 150 years. That is your story, the story of oil and gas. As in any human endeavour, there have been episodes of frailty, venality and hubris. But so too have there been epic, even heroic deeds. From beneath soil and sea you have wrested oil and gas in unimagined abundance, often under technically challenging and physically dangerous conditions, never failing to meet the demands of energy-hungry societies. It would be only human if you were to reflect occasionally that without you, the prosperity enjoyed by billions, and aspired to by billions more, would not exist. Human beings would be living shorter, more difficult lives, exposed to more hazards, trapped within narrower limits of experience, opportunity, and imagination. And as your industry has grown to maturity, it has forged strong values, nowhere stronger than in Shell itself. You are rooted in reality. With so many physicists and engineers it could hardly be otherwise. While our political discourse descends ever further into a miasma of dogma, artifice, spectacle and celebrity, you have done your best to remain reality-based. This is surely a virtue. Nobody should think that words like “realism” and “practicality” issue casually from your lips. You have never recoiled from the future. You have striven to solve its puzzles and bend it to your purpose. I am a lapsed diplomat (and a lapsed physicist). From early in my career the Shell Scenarios were seen in the British Foreign Office as the pinnacle of their art, and their then impresario, Ged Davis, as a modern Merlin. Later you were way ahead of governments in sounding the alarm about the dangerous nexus of global risks linking food insecurity, water insecurity, energy insecurity and climate insecurity. In Shell you quickly grasped the growing importance of cities, and the expanding cohort of newly affluent citizens, as a global shaping force. This is now orthodoxy. But Dave Sands and his team at Shell were on to it more than a decade ago. Stronger even than the tug of reality and of the future, one instinct has long defined your industry. Often in politics the first reaction to a new challenge is to ignore it and hope it will go away. There are enough problems. If it won’t go away, the second reaction is to delay. If you can push it into tomorrow, it might yet go away and anyway, in politics, tomorrow never comes. At your best you do not ignore or delay. You look for a response that turns challenge into opportunity. Drilling in extreme conditions; converting gas into liquids for shipment around the world; capturing and sequestering carbon dioxide – whenever you have bumped into a frontier, especially a frontier of engineering, your urge has been to break through it. You accept, grudgingly, the constraints imposed by the laws of thermodynamics. But within them no challenge has hitherto been too daunting. Now you are being asked to play your part in the response to climate change, the biggest challenge your industry has ever faced. Surely, you might reasonably think to yourselves, we should acknowledge in return your role in bringing within our reach the fruits of modernity. Those fruits have turned out not to be as sweet as they seemed. But it was we who desired them. You never had to force them upon us. It is in truth not your fault that climate change is a hard problem. Though your industry must bear some responsibility for our failure so far to face it, that is not exclusively your fault either. But the choices of your generation of CEOs will be decisive, not only for you as corporations but for the eventual success or failure of our response to climate change. That is why you will be held relentlessly to account for those choices; why what you said in February invites forensic scrutiny. Every speech tells a story. And beneath the story on the surface there is always another, told more subtly, about the compulsions, desires and anxieties that animate the first. Only if each story is true to the other; and only if each is rooted in an experience of the world shared between speaker and audience; only then will the speech truly be heard. Not one story but three. The story of the mask you show, the story of your face beneath it, the story of the world. The story of your mask in February was clear. You accept the “moral obligation” to respond to climate change, including for your industry. COP21 will be crucial. The stakes here in Paris will be high. But meanwhile, there is a march of progress. As we stride forward, a golden thread of growth links the size of the economy, demand for energy, and demand for oil and gas. This should continue indefinitely. Yours will remain “an industry that truly powers economies”, as “the world’s energy needs will underpin the use of fossil fuels for decades to come”. You do not, it appears, see climate change as a threat to the steady march. But you fear we might be overzealous. Excessive concern for the climate might lead us to break the golden thread by constraining the combustion of your products. This too is a question of morality. It is as you see it in conflict with the question posed by climate change itself. How, you ask, can we “balance one moral obligation, energy access … against the other: fighting climate change”. Your response is that we should ease off on climate. We can have a transition but it cannot transform. The aim, in any meaningful timeframe, should not be an energy system that is carbon neutral nor even low carbon. Instead we must settle for “lower-carbon”, whatever that means, to allow us the “higher energy” that “makes the difference between poverty and prosperity”. And so the story of your mask leads inexorably to the conclusion that no choice is needed after all. Only one approach is morally and economically available. It is not transformational. It proceeds by very small steps. And as for fossil fuels, “rather than ruling them out, the focus should remain on lowering their … emissions”. You have no compunction in immediately excluding coal, the product of a rival industry, from this endeavour. But that is to accommodate a shift to gas, not faster deployment of renewables (which would divert investment from gas); still less energy efficiency, which you do not mention at all. You urge the adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which Shell has, yes, pioneered. But you offer no proposal to overcome the main obstacle, the extra costs it imposes. There is no engineering reason why dozens of large CCS installations should not already be running across Europe. I helped negotiate the New Entrant Reserve financing mechanism in 2008, working with many others including your colleague Graeme Sweeney. We thought then that we had broken through on financing. Instead: still no plants. Your Peterhead project could be first. But with no compact to share additional costs between taxpayers, consumers and shareholders, CCS at scale remains empty talk. You call for “a well-executed carbon pricing system”. Leaving aside the poor execution of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, a carbon price can only ever drive change at the margin. And it will not do that as well in real life, with all its uncertainty about forward prices and conflicting price signals, as it will in a well-behaved model. It is now widely understood, except by those who live inside such models, that a climate response based primarily on a carbon price will deliver only marginal change. Politically it serves as a brake on ambition not a stimulus, especially when accompanied by an aversion, also evident in your speech, to hard caps on emissions. That is the story of your mask: a manifesto for the oil and gas status quo, justified by the unsupported claim that the economic and moral cost of departing from it would exceed the benefit in climate change avoided. Beneath the mask is the face. Its story is encoded in language and tone, and it does not match the mask. You reject “stereotypes that fail to see the benefits our industry brings to the world”. But you resort freely to stereotypes yourself, to attack those who want more ambition. You and those who agree with you have a monopoly on realism and practicality. You are “balanced” and “informed”. Your enemies are “naive” and “short sighted”. And you accuse them of wanting “a sudden death of fossil fuels”. No phrase in your speech is more revealing. Nobody is asking for this and if they were they would be wasting their time. But the Freudian intensity of your complaint flashes from the text like a bolt of lightning. Moreover, although you acknowledge doubts about the credibility of your industry, you don’t address them. You speak, as it were, peering down, with authority and detachment, at a world that should self-evidently look the same to others as it does to you. And from that height, you seem to be want us to believe that the issue is not how to deal with climate change but how to do so without touching your business model. You are not detached, and in reality your authority is compromised by your obvious desire to cling to what you know, whatever the cost to society. For a leader in the oil and gas industry to call for continued dependence on oil and gas will sound to most like special pleading. Unless you acknowledge this, what you say won’t be truly heard.  Narcissus gazed into the pool and was dazzled by his own reflection. Climate change is a mirror in which we will all come to see the best and the worst of ourselves. In that mirror you seem to see the energy system you have done so much to build and to find it so intoxicating that you cannot contemplate the need now to build a different one. There is a touch of narcissism in the story of your face. The paranoiac fears conspiracies that do not exist. You fear a non-existent conspiracy to bring about your sudden death. There is a touch of paranoia in the story of your face. The psychopath displays inflated self-appraisal, lack of empathy, and a tendency to squash those who block the way. All these traits can be found in your text. There is a touch of psychopathy in the story of your face. I am sure you are not in your personal life narcissistic, paranoid, and psychopathic. But yours is part of a collective voice, and those attributes colour that voice. To that extent you and your peers cannot complain if society increasingly comes to see in your behaviour the characteristic marks of the professional narcissist, paranoiac, and psychopath. The story of the mask and the story of the face behind the mask. The one, a picture of reason. The other in the grip of all too human emotions. They are not at peace with each other. Nor with the world. The story of the world is as old as antiquity. It is the story of the writing on the wall. The warning to the last King of Babylon at his last great feast that he has been weighed in the balance, as it is written in the Book of Daniel. The high carbon, resource-profligate modernity you helped build is a new Babylon. Every bite from its fruit poisons the tree from which we pluck it. King Belshazzar of Babylon plundered goblets of gold from the Temple of Solomon. We take our plunder from an ecological fabric we no longer recognise as our first Temple. But if it crumbles we die both in body and in spirit. Climate change is the writing on our wall. If we heed it we can repair our Temple and avoid the fate of Babylon. If we don’t, we, too, fall. You know this. If you didn’t, your exploration of the nexus must have shown you. Governments have obligated themselves to do whatever it takes to keep climate change within 2C. I once heard an industry peer of yours dismiss this. Politicians, he said, had promised it cynically to keep NGOs off their backs. But there was no will to act on it. At the table was one of your own predecessors, who did not demur. The 2C obligation is not going to go away. It will be reasserted at COP21, which should now also state clearly that this means carbon neutral energy by mid century. 2C was not a casual reaction to civil society impossibilism. It was a political judgement, informed by science, about the threshold beyond which climate insecurity is likely to become unmanageable. The commitments made at COP21 may still fall short of a 2C response. But the forces now at work will act inexorably to push up not rein back our ambition. Your strategy seems to be to try to hold the line until the door finally closes on 2C. But governments cannot walk away from their obligation. They would have to explain what had changed to justify doing so. Everything we have subsequently discovered invites more urgency not less. The real threat to prosperity lies in too little ambition not too much. The only means we have to make choices in the public interest across society is politics. I have lived in a period when politics has been linear, and therefore predictable. You are skilled at navigating linear politics. Corporations became ever more skilled at rigging the choices made by linear politics for their profit against the public interest. That is one reason why linear politics is ending. We are now entering a period of politics that is non-linear, politics whose outcomes will, from the old frame of reference, your frame of reference, be harder to predict. You are not skilled in navigating non-linear politics. There is no feel for politics in the Shell Scenarios. That didn’t matter when politics were linear but it does now. Non-linear politics will welcome new voices. Cities. Communities. Young people. Women. Consumers. Policy takers will become policy shapers. Their voices will act like a ratchet, driving up ambition on climate. Businesses exposed to climate risk will demand more ambition. Businesses delivering carbon neutral energy will demand more ambition. Businesses not locked into fossil energy supply chains will want to end up on the winning side and will welcome more ambition. Businesses holding out for less ambition will no longer be able to take cover in a big tent, no longer be able to pretend to be part of the solution when their choices belie this. They will have nowhere to hide. The low carbon economy is starting to take shape and it works. Germany has embarked on an irreversible restructuring of an electricity system that will be powered largely by renewables. You have misread this. You point to generous subsidies for renewables in Germany. But these are the legitimate product of political consent. You point to baseload coal. But, strangely for an engineer, you fail to note that this is transient noise in a structural transition whose signal is the rise of renewables. You deny your assets will be stranded. True, first tier assets are cheap, and those that are heavily invested in tend to bear fruit quickly. But your case also assumes failure on 2C and rates of renewables deployment long surpassed by reality. The Bank of England is watching the carbon bubble. Bloomberg screens include a carbon risk valuation tool. The divestment movement may still be small but it is rallying young people, has moral authority, and can now make a prudential case as well as an environmental one. Writing on the wall. Story of the world. A friend of mine, who rose high in another energy company, told me of the remorse that overtook him when he retired at having lived a lie on climate. Clean energy startups in the US are full of refugees from fossil energy. E.On’s best staff clamour to join its renewables business when the company splits. Few want to keep making legacy power from coal and gas. I wonder if people inside Shell feel the pull of the same forces. They find themselves in an industry squeezed in a three-way vice. Investors and regulators will increasingly want to derisk unburnable carbon and future climate policy. New resources cost ever more to bring to market, in dollars and reputation. Regardless of the oil price now, its volatility will make new investments more of a gamble. Is this industry still as inspiring to your younger colleagues as it was when you entered it? Everybody except the real psychopath wants to feel part of the common good. Your company is full of good people. But good people can make bad choices in an institution clinging to a bad idea. Your own position is unenviable. A gap has opened between wealth (which is high carbon) and value (which is low carbon). Non-linear politics is the response of the people, your customers, to that gap. For a while the gap was narrow enough to straddle. But no longer. You cannot choose wealth and value. You cannot choose to transform and to struggle against transformation. You cannot choose high carbon and low carbon. Now you must pick a side and accept the consequences. It’s an agonizing choice. Either way, the costs will be huge. Either way, you will be rolling the dice. Nothing in your experience prepares you for this moment. Choose wealth and you could stay, for a while, in your comfort zone, clinging to an old business model. Even in the three-way vice it will remain viable for some time. Demand for your products will grow before it falls. While this goes on you could keep trying to rein back ambition on climate. Your industry, acting strategically together as a political brake, probably can hold out until 2C becomes an impossibility of engineering and thermodynamics. But it can’t do that without being weighed in the balance, perhaps on your watch. Confidence would drip away. Talented young staff would drift away. Respectability, already tarnished, would drain away. Drip. Drift. Drain. Or you could choose value. You could accept squarely that your E.On moment has come, that the days of yesterday’s business model are numbered, that the challenge now is to manage its decline and build alongside it a new business fit for today, albeit that this is harder for an oil and gas company than it is for a utility. You would be accused by some of tribal betrayal and commercial lunacy. You really would be lifting the lid on carbon risk. Your share price would suffer, at least in the short term. But you would be buying the chance to renew your business by design, not by default in response to shocks. There would be no need for a mask. The face could look the world in the eye and see itself reflected back. I do not know what the new business model looks like. You won’t begin to know yourselves until you accept that as an instrument of the common good the old one is already dead. But I do know what the world needs to see if it is to accept your company as part of the solution and no longer part of problem. Stop frustrating ambition. Talk to us about how you will play your part in a 2C transition. Tell us the inspirational story of that transition, backed by your knowledge and experience. The electrification of vehicles and heating; the decarbonization of electricity; new frontiers in efficiency. A new golden age of energy. And don’t tell us through crocodile tears that this will all take a long time. Tell us what you will do to hasten it, and what you need from government to do it faster. Come clean on your 2C carbon risk, and get out of investments that would increase it. Stop pretending that gas is part of the answer to climate change, rather than a necessary stage in a transition to be kept as short as possible. Stop pretending that gas will always crowd out coal rather than renewables, that it won’t blur the political focus we need on efficiency. Urge your peers to turn their backs on new fracking around the world, as you wisely have in the UK. It’s a high carbon sugar rush and a recipe for political grief. Look at the news from Algeria. Stop grumbling about renewables. Unlock the opportunities they offer. Manage a retreat from the carbon frontiers, especially the Arctic. Keep it in the ground. Press the accelerator on CCS. Use your balance sheet to lever governments into a deal on costs. It’s easier for an outsider to say what you should stop doing than what you should start. But the more you turn towards a 2C world, the more you will see its opportunities. I am urging you to sail into a storm. But you are at your best in storms and the one that will hit you anyway if you delay will be more lethal. In Shell the spectre of Brent Spar hangs over the subject of political risk. Or if it doesn’t it should. The Risorgimento broke like a wave over Sicily in the middle of the 19th century. It threatened to sweep away the privileges of an inward looking aristocracy convinced that their glory days would never end. Their struggle to cling to a collapsing system of feudal power is brilliantly portrayed in Lampedusa’s novel The Leopard. A leading character is the worldly and cynical Prince Tancredi, who at one point remarks: “Things must change around here if we want things to say the same.” Wear a mask for change while setting your face against it. It’s a clever ploy and if the stresses aren’t too great - if politics is linear - it can even work. But when the stresses are existential, it only buys false security. Those who follow the Tancredi strategy get swept away anyway. You are now in Tancredi’s position. You gave a speech in February that was worldly. Will you now lead your company and your industry towards a choice that is wise? Yours sincerely, John Ashton John Ashton is an independent commentator, founder of think tank E3G and was the UK envoy for climate change from 2006-2012. The open letter was first delivered as a speech to the 4th European Energy Forum in Paris."
"England’s ability to sustain current levels of flood protection for homes and businesses faces “major risks”, MPs have warned. Some five million properties across the country, or around one in six, are at risk of flooding from coastal, river and surface water, and climate change is increasing the risks of extreme weather and floods, a report by the public accounts committee said.  While the budget for spending on new defences has been agreed for the next six years, allowing longer term planning, funding for maintenance is only settled annually. This prevents the Environment Agency from taking a long-term approach on maintaining existing flood protection and secure savings on its spending, the MPs said and urged the Treasury to agree longer budgets for maintenance spending. Committee member Richard Bacon said: “The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency have done a good job in improving the cost-effectiveness of their approach to flood risk management. “However, there are major risks to the sustainability of current levels of flood protection, which could impact on long term value for money.” Friends of the Earth climate and energy campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: “It’s good that they’re highlighting this because the government pulled a clever wheeze in the autumn statement by just announcing future capital spend on new flood defences, but nothing on money for maintaining the stuff we’ve already got. This too is crucial if we’re to be resilient to worse floods, rising sea levels and a changing climate.” The Environment Agency, which is responsible for just under half of all flood defences in the country, has limited resources and must make difficult decisions, but cutting spending on maintaining some flood defences may prove to be a “false economy”. Reducing maintenance could mean new investment in defences is needed sooner than expected, the committee said. It also warned there was a lack of transparency about the consequences of letting some flood defences fail, with the Environment Agency deciding to stop or reduce funding for maintenance, or handing responsibility over to local communities. The agency needs to be clearer with communities on the reasons behind changes to looking after defences and what the implications could be for the local area, the report urged. The MPs also warned that the approach to accessing funding for flood defences from local authorities and businesses was not matching up to the Government’s ambition for raising money from outside sources. There was also a lack of public awareness on the realities of flood risk management, such as responsibilities on landowners to maintain defences, the MPs said, and called on the Environment Agency to make sure the issues are more clearly understood."

"Climate scientists and cultural figures called on national history and science museums on Tuesday to sever their ties to the fossil fuel industry, singling out a major patron from the Koch family of conservative oil billionaires. Corporate sponsorships from the fossil fuel industry threatened the credibility of important institutions and eroded the public trust, the scientists said in a letter.  “We are concerned that the integrity of these institutions is compromised by association with special interests who obfuscate climate science, fight environmental regulation, oppose clean energy legislation, and seek to ease limits on industrial pollution,” the letter signed by nearly three dozen scientists and museum professionals said. The letter explicitly targeted David Koch, a trustee and leading donor and exhibit sponsor of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who has also spent at least $67m (£45m) funding climate denial front groups.  “When some of the biggest contributors to climate change and funders of misinformation on climate science sponsor exhibitions in museums of science and natural history, they undermine public confidence in the validity of the institutions responsible for transmitting scientific knowledge,” the letter said. Koch and the Smithsonian natural history museum came under attack five years ago for an exhibit sponsored by the billionaire which failed to connect the burning of fossil fuels to climate change. The letter – which raises similar arguments to the campaign against BP corporate sponsorship of the Tate Modern – was endorsed by a roster of leading scientists including the Nobel laureate, Eric Chivian, climate scientists James Hansen, Michael Mann, and a number of museum professionals. In April, campaigners will ask the American Museum of Natural History to remove Koch as a trustee. The letter represents the opening of a new front in the fossil fuel divestment campaign, which originated in college campuses and has since spread to charitable foundations, pension funds, and now museums. The Guardian supports the campaign, and has called on the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation to divest from coal, oil and gas. Campaigners said the gravity of the climate crisis compelled museums to take a stand against the fossil fuel industry. “Beyond the need to inform and educate people about science, we have a moral obligation to get on the right side of the issue of global warming,” said James Powell, a former director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, who signed the letter. The letter is being released amid growing concern about the influence of corporate funding on academic and cultural institutions. Last month, it emerged that a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer, Willie Soon, received $1.25m from industry sources, including the Kochs, for research denying a human role in climate change – and concealed the sources of that funding from scientific journals.  Beka Economopoulos, the founder of the Natural History Museum project and the organiser of the petition, said such associations, in the form of corporate sponsorships or board memberships, made it easier for fossil fuel companies to put off action on climate change and as such were “morally wrong”. “Regardless of whether exhibits are compromised or not – climate deniers and fossil fuel companies have no business in museums of science and natural history,” she said in an email. “They green their image while they bankroll efforts to obstruct action on climate change.” Roberto Lebron, a spokesman for the American Museum of Natural History, said in an email: “Donors do not determine the interpretation or presentation of scientific content.”  The Smithsonian also said patrons had no influence on exhibits. “Donors and supporters have no influence on the content or presentation of Smithsonian exhibitions, regardless of their private interests.” Koch Industries did not respond to requests for comment. In the case of the Koch family, the contradictions between the museums’ missions and their sources of funding were especially stark, supporters of the letter said. “They wouldn’t accept money from Philip Morris and Atria to do an exhibit on respiratory health. They wouldn’t do that,” said Chivian. “So how could they accept money from someone spending tens of millions of dollars undermining the science on the greatest threat we have ever faced.” Koch Industries, the largest privately held oil company and a major investor in Canada’s tar sands, has been a major source of carbon pollution. Koch Industries were also the biggest spenders of any oil and gas company in the midterm elections, outspending Exxon, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics’ Open Secrets website.  The Kochs have also been leading funders of climate denial, spending at least $67m since 1997 to bankroll ultra-conservative thinktanks such as the Heartland Institute, which denies the existence of climate change and lobbies against environmental regulations, the letter says. In 2010, the New Yorker reported that an exhibit – in the David H Koch hall of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC – minimised the role of fossil fuels in causing climate change, and suggested humans would easily adapt to a climate-altered future. In 2006, US government scientists accused the Smithsonian of bowing to political pressure from Bush administration officials and Congress by injecting a line about “scientific uncertainty” surrounding climate change in an exhibit about the Arctic.  Robert Janes, a retired museum manager in Alberta who also signed the letter, accused museums of being “asleep at the wheel” both on the dangers of climate change, and the unseen influence of oil industry sponsorship. “There is this magical belief in the museum world that somehow if you take money even if it comes from corporate malfeasance … it becomes morally pure and not a problem and of course that’s nonsense.” The campaign parallels the efforts against the Tate Modern in 2010, in the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. Organisers said the effort was aimed at cutting off a source of positive PR for BP. “We thought it was a fairly obvious contradiction for an apparently progressive institution to still be taking money from oil, when it was really obvious that this company was responsible for a massive ongoing disaster and for climate change,” said Anna Galkina, one of the organisers of the Divest Tate campaign. In a victory for campaigners, the Tate was compelled last December to disclose the extent of BP funding over the years. The sums were relatively small. BP contributed just 0.5% of the Tate’s budget from 1990 to 2006, according to the Tate. However, Galkina argued BP reaped big benefits in terms of positive PR and advertising aimed at elite audiences of museum visitors."

"On a perfect summer day in June 2014, on the grounds of a stately home overlooking the Hudson river, a handful of the descendants of America’s most enduring business dynasty made a fateful decision: they would cut their ties to fossil fuels in order to fight climate change. The ironies were inescapable. About half of those gathered for the board meeting were direct descendants of John D Rockefeller – founder of the oil empire that eventually became ExxonMobil – and here they were, gathered in the estate he built at Pocantico Hills, New York, surrounded by a collection of antique gas guzzlers and limousines, preparing to take a highly symbolic stand against fossil fuels. As descendants, they had an extra burden to fight climate change, said Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, a former middle-school special education teacher and chair of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF). “We all have a moral obligation,” she told the Guardian. “Our family in particular – the money that is for our grant-making, and what we are doing now, and that helps fund our lifestyles came from dirty fuel sources.” On 22 September, a day after 400,000 protesters marched through the streets of Manhattan demanding action on climate change, Wayne and the RBF president, Stephen Heintz, announced the fund would immediately purge its holdings in coal and tar sands, gradually withdraw from oil and gas, and invest 10% of the endowment in clean energy. On a day when more than 800 institutions and individual investors, controlling more than $50bn (£34bn) in assets, committed to divest, the Rockefellers were the marquee name – delivering a jolt of energy to the fossil fuel divestment movement that had been steadily expanding from college campuses to philanthropies and pension funds. “I think it was one of the most important moments in the whole divestment campaign just because of the symbolism that is attached to the original fossil fuel fortune,” said Bill McKibben, the writer and activist who helped launch the divestment movement. “It makes a very clear point that engaging with fossil fuel companies to somehow get them to change their ways is unlikely to work if the family of the founder can’t get Exxon to shift.” Six months later, the fund is proceeding cautiously to avoid losing money. RBF at the time had 5.2% of its endowment, or about $45m , in fossil fuels – still lower than the Standard and Poor’s index S&P. The fund has pulled out of coal and tar sands, but remains invested in oil and gas. Overall, exposure to fossil fuels has dropped less than 1% since that September announcement. RBF faces an even bigger struggle to make good on the investment part of its pledge. Only about 1% of the RBF endowment is now invested in alternative energy, and it could take three to five years to reach its goal of 10%, Heintz said. To hear Wayne and Heintz tell it, the fund’s efforts to quit fossil fuels were a natural. There has always been a green streak among the 230 or so living descendants of that original Rockefeller. Earlier generations protected America’s wide open spaces. RBF tried to support alternative energy in the 1980s, without much success. By the 1990s, RBF’s environmental focus shifted decisively to climate change. By the early 2000s, members of the Rockefeller family were demanding ExxonMobil respond to the threat of climate change. Within RBF meanwhile, there was increasing discomfort about the disconnect between their money and their mission. “For a fund that is so devoted to fighting climate change and helping to prevent climate catastrophe, to continue to be invested in fossil fuels that are actually causing climate change just was morally hypocritical and unacceptable,” said Heintz. “It felt hypocritical. It felt like we were compromising ourselves.” By that point, half of RBF grants were going to fight climate change. RBF supported efforts to stop the development of the Alberta tar sands and shut down coal-fired power plants. It also funded Carbon Tracker, which produced the data showing the majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid a climate catastrophe, and350.org, the campaign group founded by Bill McKibben, which has championed the divestment cause. Some of those grantees – including Carbon Tracker and 350.org – were already talking about divestment with Rockefeller trustees. A number of other foundations were also beginning to quit fossil fuels. At RBF, trustees argued for bringing the bulk of their $800m-plus endowment in line with their grant-making priorities. “We wanted to align our grant-making and our investing and this seems obvious now but it is actually a revolutionary idea in the non-profit world for organisations that have endowments,” Wayne said. “I think largely the feeling has been ‘make as much money as you can and then you give it away’. So the symbolism of saying actually we can have much more impact if we in fact align our investing and our grant-making, that’s an important symbol.” The Rockefellers are a large and sprawling family, with about 230 living descendants of the original John D. But according to Wayne, virtually all of her cousins were on side with using the RBF endowment to fight climate change. “There are people who think there should be a separation, or you should make the money first. Of course, there are some people like that. It is a really large family,” she said. “But I would say 99.9% of the family has been super supportive.” In 2010, Heintz said he recommended to the board that RBF invest 10% of the total value of the endowment in alternative energy. Board members had one over-riding concern – would the endowment take a financial hit? “The real fault line was people who would say: look, fossil fuels are still a very significant part of the global economy for some time to come,” said Heintz. “If you eliminate your investment options from that part of global economy you narrow down your investment choices. You increase risk and you may reduce return.” For RBF, that was a non-starter. “We were not willing to lose any money. Our business is giving away money so we were not willing to take any reduction in returns,” Wayne said. Over the next few years, RBF changed management of its endowment, taking on new external fund managers, who were willing to look beyond conventional investments. The financial managers began gradually screening the fund’s holdings to determine exposure to fossil fuels. In an additional complication, it turned out much of the endowment was in pooled investments, mixed in with funds from other institutions, which put them beyond RBF control. The Rockefellers also drew on the experience of the Wallace Global Fund, which began overhauling its investment structure in 2009. The Wallace fund, under its executive director Ellen Dorsey, has been a key organiser of the divestment campaign in the philanthropic world. It has withdrawn completely from fossil fuels and has invested 10% of its endowment in clean energy. After a dinner in 2011. Dorsey said she remained in regular contact with RBF in 2012 and 2013, urging the fund to front the broader divestment coalition. It took until February 2014 for the new financial managers to be in place – and for the RBF board to agree on the final step – that there was no turning back and the fund would quit fossil fuels. “Shareholder engagement wasn’t enough,” Heintz said. “I think you need all three strategies. I think you need shareholder engagement, divestment, and proactive engagement.” The board began preparing to make an announcement, timed for the UN climate change summit in September. By the time of the June board meeting at the Rockefeller estate, everything was in place. By that point, about 5.2% of RBF investments were in fossil fuels. Getting out of coal and tar sands was easy. Extracting RBF from oil and natural gas was slow and tedious work. Some of those holdings were in funds that will be tied up for years. Heintz said he hoped to whittle those holdings down to under 1% in three to five years. But the biggest challenge was finding the right vehicles for clean energy investment, he said. “I would really like to be at the 10% mark in another year but I don’t know if we are going to be able to get there,” he said. “Our goal here is to find investment grade opportunities to invest in the clean energy future. We want to say that you can be a good investor and get good returns and invest in the things are that are going to help create the clean energy economy.” The Rockefellers were aware their divestment decision would have a big impact. They also knew some critics would dismiss the move as mere symbolism – a blip in a global economy that continues to run on oil and coal. But 78 foundations have now signed up to the Divest-Invest movement – and campaigners hope to get the numbers up to 200 by the time of the UN climate conference in December. A number of other foundations have approached RBF asking for advice. At least one other Rockefeller philanthropy, the Rockefeller Family Fund which is still closely connected to the family, is actively exploring divestment. However, the much wealthier Rockefeller Foundation, whose endowment tops $4bn, is understood to be opposed to divestment for now. “It may start with a symbol, but for us there were years of conversation and study,” she said. “The symbol is important to start with. The moral impulse is what drives us. But it is how we execute it, and how much we can help others who are on this path.” She went on: “It feels arrogant to say we had a big impact. But I feel we did.”"
"  The highest ranking woman in the Anglican communion has said climate denial is a “blind” and immoral position which rejects God’s gift of knowledge. Katharine Jefferts Schori, presiding bishop of the Episcopal church and one of the most powerful women in Christianity, said that climate change was a moral imperative akin to that of the civil rights movement. She said it was already a threat to the livelihoods and survival of people in the developing world. “It is in that sense much like the civil rights movement in this country where we are attending to the rights of all people and the rights of the earth to continue to be a flourishing place,” Bishop Jefferts Schori said in an interview with the Guardian. “It is certainly a moral issue in terms of the impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable around the world already.” In the same context, Jefferts Schori attached moral implications to climate denial, suggesting those who reject the underlying science of climate change were turning their backs on God’s gift of knowledge. It’s hard work when you have a climate denier who will not see the reality of scientific truth. “Episcopalians understand the life of the mind is a gift of God and to deny the best of current knowledge is not using the gifts God has given you,” she said. “In that sense, yes, it could be understood as a moral issue.” She went on: “I think it is a very blind position. I think it is a refusal to use the best of human knowledge, which is ultimately a gift of God.” The sense of urgency around the issue has been deepened by Pope Francis forceful statements on global warming, which he is expected to amplify in a papal encyclical in June and during an address to the US Congress in September. The Episcopalian church will host a webcast on 24 March to kick off a month-long action campaign designed to encourage church members to reduce their own carbon footprints and lobby government and international corporations to fight climate change. An oceanographer before she was ordained at the age of 40, Bishop Jefferts Schori said she hoped to use her visibility as a church leader to help drive action on climate change. As presiding bishop, she oversees 2.5m members of the Episcopal church in 17 countries, and is arguably one of the most prominent women in Christianity. The two largest denominations in the US, Roman Catholics and Southern Baptists, do not ordain women. “I really hope to motivate average Episcopalians to see the severity of this issue, the morality of this issue,” she said. “Turning the ship in another direction requires the consolidated efforts of many people who are moving in the same direction.” She acknowledged that the challenge was deepened by the strain of climate denial in American politics, and by continued resistance to science in American classrooms. “It’s hard work when you have a climate denier who will not see the reality of scientific truth,” she said. However, she, like a number of church leaders, said they had seen an uptick in climate activism in recent months, spurred by the pope’s comments last January, and the conjunction later this year of United Nations conferences on development and climate change. Evangelical churches – once seen as a conservative force – were now taking up the climate cause, largely because of growing awareness of its threat to the poor. “One of the significant changes in particular has been the growing awareness and activism among the evangelical community who at least somewhat in the more distant past refused to encounter this issue, refused to deal with it,” Jeffers Schori said. “The major evangelical groups in this country have been much more forward in addressing this issue because they understand that it impacts the poor.” A number of denominations have also joined the growing fossil fuel divestment movement which is encouraging organisations to move their investments out of coal, oil and gas companies. The United Methodist church, the third largest denomination, dumped coal companies from its pension fund. The Unitarian church and the United church of Christ have also voted to divest, according to Reverent Fletcher Harper of Green Faith. And the World Council of Churches has pledged not to invest in fossil fuels. A number of individual congregations have also divested from fossil fuels. The Guardian launched a campaign on Monday to encourage the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to divest from fossil fuels. The Episcopal church has also come under pressure to withdraw its fossil fuel holdings. A number of diocese are pressing for divestment, and will bring the issue to a vote at the church’s annual convention this summer. Jefferts Schori opposes fossil fuel divestment. “If you divest you lose any direct ability to influence the course of a corporation’s behavior,” she said. “I think most pragmatists realise that we can’t close the spigot on the oil wells and close the coal mines immediately without some other energy source to shift to.” "
"One of America’s most powerful and outspoken opponents of climate change regulation received election campaign contributions that can be traced back to senior BP staff, including chief executive Bob Dudley. Jim Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma who has tirelessly campaigned against calls for a carbon tax and challenges the overwhelming consensus on climate change, received $10,000 (£6,700) from BP’s Political Action Committee (PAC). Following his re-election, Inhofe became chair of the Senate’s environment and public works committee in January, and then a month later featured in news bulletins throwing a snowball across the Senate floor.  Before tossing it, the senator said: “In case we have forgotten – because we keep hearing that 2014 is the warmest year on record – it is very, very cold outside. Very unseasonal.”  The BP PAC is funded by contributions from senior US executives and company staffers who sent in contributions to the PAC totalling more than $1m between 2010 and 2014. Over the same period the committee paid out $655,000 to candidates, with more than 40 incumbent senators benefiting.  Yet, BP and Dudley have long called for world leaders to intervene and impose tough regulatory measures on the fossil fuel industry. Publishing its 98-page research paper, Energy Outlook 2035, last month, BP warned: “To abate carbon emissions further will require additional significant steps by policymakers beyond the steps already assumed.” Dudley has personally given $19,000 since June 2011 to the BP PAC – very close to the $5,000-a-year maximum allowable by law. Although Dudley is resident in Britain, he is eligible to give via the BP PAC because he is a US national.  While the sums channelled to Inhofe’s campaign represent only a small proportion of the BP PAC’s election spending and the senator’s own campaign funds, they show how unafraid the committee has been to spread its donations to the most controversial candidates. According to the BP PAC website, it financially supports election candidates “whose views and/or voting records reflect the interests of BP employees”. Records suggest Inhofe’s 2014 campaign was a funding priority for the BP PAC, ranking as one of the top recipients of committee funds when compared with disbursements to other serving senators. This was despite Inhofe’s senate battle not being a close one. His opponent, Matt Silverstein, who Inhofe beat comfortably in last November’s midterms, had a tiny campaign war chest by comparison.  BP was asked whether it was appropriate for the PAC to make campaign contributions to such a vocal opponent of action on climate change, or for Dudley to be contributing towards such payments.  In a statement BP replied: “Voluntary donations [by staff] to the BP employees’ political action committee in the US are used to support a variety of candidates across the political spectrum and in many US geographies where we operate. “These candidates have one thing in common: they are important advocates for the energy industry in the broadest sense.” It added: “BP’s position on climate change is well known and is long-established. We believe that climate change is an important long-term issue that justifies global action.” The company declined to comment on Dudley’s own donations. PACs exist in the US where companies and trade unions cannot give directly to the campaigns of those running for office. Instead funds are pooled from staff – often senior executives – into a PAC, and disbursed by a committee board, often in a manner sympathetic to the company’s lobby and other interests. Other US oil industry leaders, including Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, make contributions to their own corporate PACs – money which in many cases can then be traced to Inhofe and other climate-sceptic politicians.  But Tillerson and other peers have not been as outspoken as BP and Dudley in calling for state intervention to tackle climate change, making the BP boss’s links to Inhofe campaign finance more controversial. Last week Obama said it was “disturbing” that Inhofe had been made chair of the senate environment committee. In broader criticism of unnamed political opponents, he then went on to say: “In some cases you have elected officials who are shills for the oil companies or the fossil fuel industry. And there is a lot of money involved.” Inhofe is unabashed about election campaign financing he receives from the industry. In his 2012 book, The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, he wrote: “Whenever the media asked me how much I have received in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry, my unapologetic answer was ‘not enough’.”  According to data compiled from public filings by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), Inhofe’s campaign raised $4.84m between 2009 and 2014, with $1.77m coming from PACs, many of them sponsored by fossil fuel companies. BP’s PAC was more active in the US 2014 election cycle than any other for more than a decade. Despite insisting it is non-partisan, 69% of contributions to federal election candidates in recent years have been to Republican politicians. This is a stronger bias than most other corporate PACs, according to the CRP. Not all recipients of BP PAC donations are climate change sceptics. Indeed, among other top recipients in recent years has been Steny Hoyer, House Democrat whip, one of the strongest advocates for government measures to tackle climate change. There are, however, other leading recipients who have attracted criticism from climate change campaigners, including Republican House speaker John Boehner and fellow Republican, Sen Mike Enzi from Wyoming. When asked his views on climate change in January, Boehner said: “We’ve had changes in our climate, although scientists debate the sources, in their opinion, of that change. But I think the real question is that every proposal out of this administration with regard to climate change means killing American jobs.” “I don’t see [Obama] as trying to control pollution. I see him trying to put business out of business,” Enzi said last year. Campaign contributions is just one aspect of US political engagement linked to BP and its staff. Filings show the oil and gas group spends millions on lobbying efforts.  The CRP classifies BP as a “heavy hitter”, ranking it among the top 140 biggest overall donors to federal elections since 1988. Its PAC ranks as the six largest such body with a sponsor company that is ultimately part of a non-US multinational.  Those on the PAC board, deciding how to spend staff donations, are senior executives and lawyers at the company. The board’s vice-chair is Bob Stout, BP’s Washington-based head of regulatory affairs, who also sits on the group’s global policy making body. Dudley does not sit on the PAC board. According to its website, the PAC makes donations to “candidates who support the principles of free enterprise and good government, support a fair and reasonable business environment for the energy industry and share our philosophy that energy diversity advances energy security.” It says staff contributions are encouraged but stresses they are voluntary. The first BP PAC contribution to Inhofe’s 2014 campaign was a given on 12 March 2012. This $1,000 donation came just two weeks after the publication of Inhofe’s book The Greatest Hoax, cementing his credentials as the most outspoken denier of climate change in US politics. Publicising the book, the senator gave a radio interview on Voice of Christian Youth America. “God is still up there,” he said. “The arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what he is doing in the climate to me is outrageous.”"
"For most of the journalists working on Keep it in the ground, the project began with an email on Christmas Eve from Alan Rusbridger. Reflecting on his two decades as editor-in-chief, he said he had very few regrets, except one. His email read: “Colleagues, this time next year I won’t be the editor of the Guardian: indeed, well before that I’ll have stepped down. I’m not at all depressed. This is the right time to be moving on. But I do have an urge to do something powerful, focused and important with the Guardian while I’m still here. And it will be about climate change.  Sometimes there’s a story so enormous that conventional journalism struggles to cope with it, nevermind do justice. The imminent threat to the species is the most existentially important story any of us could imagine telling – for our sakes, for our children and for their children. But, as journalists, we also know that we sometimes tire of telling, and that people tire of reading.” Alan had decided that in his time left as editor, he would do one last dramatic project to leave as his legacy, to “change the debate, wake people up and tilt the axis”. Keep it in the ground will continue throughout Alan’s remaining months as editor to add to political pressure in the runup to the climate conference in Paris in December. The subject is huge. Of course, the project would rest on a bedrock of reporting, analysis and investigations, but it needed a new narrative. Thus, in the first days of the new year, a group of about 20 journalists came together to discuss what the focus should be. Two things became clear to us. First, that the scientists and environmentalists have done their job – the debate needs to move on to the politics and economics. Second, we settled on a central message: above all else, most of the fossil fuels left available needed to remain in the ground. There were many environmental journalists in the room – George Monbiot, Damian Carrington, Fiona Harvey and Adam Vaughan – but if this was going to make a big impact, we needed people from across the organisation. We needed the investigative eyes of Felicity Lawrence and James Ball, as well as the financial insight of Larry Elliott and Simon Bowers. We decided we would also run a campaign and it would be about fossil fuel divestment. Many of us had taken inspiration from the many successes of the divestment campaign launched by the environmental movement at 350.org. Alan had met their founder, Bill McKibben, in Stockholm shortly before Christmas.  A campaign needs targets and we spent weeks choosing them. It was the twilight of a Friday evening when we hit upon the idea of asking two of the world’s most enlightened organisations to take the lead and divest: the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Of course, at the same time, we would also urge the Guardian Media Group to do the same. We also needed artistic vision and creative director Alex Breuer started to approach artists. Anthony Gormley offered artwork never seen before for the launch on the day of the climate march; later pieces were illustrated by art from indigenous Australian Judy Watson and images of the iconic melting ice sculptures of Néle Azevedo. The launch of the campaign on Monday was accompanied by Parliament, a poem from Carol Ann Duffy previously published in an anthology called The Bees. This being one of the most complex stories of our time, we wanted our decision-making to be transparent. Alan asked Francesca Panetta, co-creator of the award-winning Firestorm interactive, how we could showcase the inside story to our readers. She decided to create an audio documentary series and from that point on we started to record our internal meetings. “The biggest story in the world” is a weekly podcast, which you can subscribe to here. We want this campaign to be one that has our readers – and our members – at its heart. As well as communicating the weight of the issue, we hope we can inspire you to get involved. I’ll be editing our campaign blog and would love to hear from you. Got an idea or think your organisation can contribute? Email us at keep.it@theguardian.com or follow the campaign on Twitter @guardianeco.  You can also join us at a Guardian Live event on 13 May where George Monbiot will be talking to George Marshall about why we are in denial about climate change and what we can do to stop it before it’s too late.

"Mark Lynas says: “Solving climate change does not mean rolling back capitalism, suspending the free market or stopping economic growth” (Save us from the miserabilists in the battle over climate change, 12 March). This statement would have made much sense 35 years ago. The urgency for rapid action had not been established. But all this has changed. Whether or not the new “crisis” reinforces an ideological position on the left (despite splits over nuclear power and GM crops) leading to “an outright denialist position” on the right is now so much water under the bridge.  Immense changes to the economic system must be made over the next few years, and the blame game gets us nowhere. If Klein’s belief that “corporate capitalism must be dismantled’” is wrong, it is up to the right to show how the new measures required can work under the present system. Governments should play a powerful role in facilitating compromises, where these can be made, and encouraging national debates on the basis of evidence rather than belief.David AndersonBingley, West Yorkshire • It’s people like Naomi Klein and the left generally who are responsible for runaway climate change because their policies for dealing with it are too radical, says Lynas. So they frighten all those fair-minded, reasonable people in the centre and on the right into not caring a fig about it. Then the penny dropped. I realised Lynas was himself a Damascene convert, projecting all blame on to his erstwhile colleagues and comrades of “the left”. The solution is staring us in the face: it is nuclear energy and GM crops. Funny, that’s what big money has been telling (or selling) us all along. You don’t have to be “anti-science” to suspect the alliance of money and power that the corporate world represents. Being suspicious of it seems a good, open-minded place to start.Richard KuperLondon • Sound advice to non-tribal environmentalists from Mark Lynas: ignore both the flat-earth deniers and the eco-evangelists, and focus on good science, engineering, arithmetic and economics. If Keep it in the ground prompts a flight of capital away from fossil fuels and into clean, 21st-century energy solutions, we should investigage two constructive (and liquid) investment zones: small, modular, molten-salt reactors, being developed by the Canadians and the Chinese; and molten-metal, grid-level storage batteries, being piloted in Hawaii and Cape Cod.John McGrotherBuxton, Derbyshire • Lynas uses the wrong end of the stick to beat the wrong dog. Since the mid-1960s the “war on science” has been waged against any change that might have an adverse impact on vested interest. It began with a campaign against the regulation of tobacco products, orchestrated by the marketing Company RJ Reynolds. This was followed by a war against the regulation of other health or environmental hazards reported by the scientific community, for instance, ozone depletion. State interference of any kind, including against the causes of acid rain, CFCs, greenhouse gases and secondhand smoke, was (and is still) seen as an attack on liberty, a dangerous step on the path to communism: “Environmentalists were like a watermelon, green on the outside, red within,” Naomi Oreskes wrote in Merchants of Doubt (2010).Wiebina HeestermanBirmingham • The scientific narrative has not been “captured by one, rather extreme, end of the political spectrum”, but by global industries whose profits are threatened by the carbon bubble that will result if substantial fossil fuel deposits remain unexploited (the deniers) and by people who accept the scientific evidence but dwell on the apocalyptic image of a future world of runaway warming (the sensationalists). Apocalyptic images are exciting; they produce adrenalin, which is addictive. That is why disaster movies are big box-office. But this makes climate change just another spectacle. Lynas himself is a leading producer of this commodity in his books. It is a bit rich, then, that he accuses Naomi Klein of pursuing an “ideological project”, as if climate change could be anything else (but the right usually denies the politics of its own position). Klein has identified aspects of this late phase of global capitalism – the huge profits made from war and reconstruction, and the growth of a private security industry – that show it to be aggressively destructive. Environmentalists do not have a monopoly on Enlightenment values – no one does – but when Lynas asserts that Klein makes environmental responsibility “politically toxic” he is insulting and, again, alarmist, which is another indication that he is a purveyor of the alienation to which he objects. He makes the debate a spectacle rather than a rational exchange.Professor Malcolm MilesTotnes, Devon • The developing world’s emergence from poverty is indeed non-negotiable. Climate chaos doesn’t negotiate. But climate chaos is what will stop the developing world from acquiring, and the developed world from continuing to enjoy, unprecedented and lethal levels of material consumption. Our challenge is not to fantasise about technologies to save us from this future. It is to face it honestly, and start retrieving what we can.John FosterLancaster University • Had Lynas attended the alternative people’s summit at the COP 20 climate change talks in Lima last year, he would have heard a succession of speakers from Latin America’s indigenous communities rejecting development models imposed on them by transnational capital. They are in the frontline of the fight against climate change and are struggling to stop the destruction of their environment by mining and mono-crop agriculture for export. They would not see themselves in terms of left or right, but fully understand that an economic model based on infinite growth, with the conmensurate depletion of the planet’s natural resources, is incompatible with saving the Earth from the catastrophic effects of global warming. This does not mean sufficient energy cannot be provided for the needs of future generations, but that it must be responsibly sourced and publicly owned instead of being left to market forces and monolithic corporations whose priorities lie in ripping off consumers and making money out of burning fossil fuels. As an energy trade union, we support the necessary, just transition to a low-carbon economy, and are members of the global network Trade Unions for Energy Democracy. As the slogan read in Lima: “Let’s change the system – not the climate.”Bert SchouwenburgInternational officer, GMB • I went to the climate change march on Saturday 7 March expecting to be fired up. I came away disappointed. The issue, climate change, had been hijacked by multiple organisations pushing their own agendas – anti- nuclear, anti fracking, trade unions, political groups etc. Anyone viewing on TV would probably see several organisations they would not support. Earth is not affected by politics, just by CO2 emissions. The climate change movement has to work from the bottom up to change the minds of people in every country, so as to cause each country’s government to take action.Hugh BakerLeatherhead, Surrey • I picked up a programme for the Edinburgh international science festival in the week that the Guardian ran its stark climate change cover features. I was surprised to note the low profile given in the brochure to the most pressing issue facing scientists, and humanity in general, until I looked at the sponsors page: Total, Scottish Gas, Senergy, Eon, Exxon Mobil, Cairn and half a dozen other fossil fuel extraction and provision companies are prominent. All the energy events, which mostly focus on technological responses, are directly sponsored by Eon. A typical example is a debate on “how much oil is really left in the North Sea and what its value is… supported by the Scottish Oil Club”, the panel of which is entirely made up of oil industry representatives plus the shadow energy minister. The National Gallery in London has attracted criticism for accepting BP sponsorship but at least there was no direct conflict of interest. Such financing makes a mockery of the objectivity the festival is designed to promote. Technological fixes are mostly a distraction from the urgent issue of drastically reducing emissions this decade, which extends beyond the boundaries of science. Climate scientists have attracted flak for not speaking out more. They have done their job. What about the scientists who are the crux of the fossil fuel industry, not to mention those who work directly in public engagement through events such as this festival? How can they be aware of the imminent catastrophe facing our planet and yet continue to facilitate it? Are their personal interests in their job not overridden by their personal interests in their future and that of their children?Andrew RubensEdinburgh • Lynas’s article does not do justice to the great campaign of concern the Guardian has embarked upon. By its very nature, climate change is an extreme situation that demands extreme measures. Now is not a time for fudging about, desperately trying to seek some kind of moderate consensus that has no hope of tackling this global threat. Does he really imagine that the rich and powerful will finally face up to what is already happening to us without an intensification of the international pressure for absolutely fundamental change to the way we live our lives? When have they ever given anything up without an enormous struggle? The article could be read as some kind of PR appeal to take the debate back to square one on behalf of corporate interests. We have been discussing climate change for decades and, as Naomi Klein has said: “The only thing rising faster than our emissions is the output of words pledging to lower them.” Just because billions of us have long since recognised the link between capitalism’s insatiable appetite for growth and consumption and its catastrophic effects on our resources and climate doesn’t make that analysis wrong. Nor is it the preserve of “lefties”. Accepting the doubling or trebling of energy consumption by 2050 as a “hard reality” in a world that supposedly must continue to go on developing and expanding will not help anyone, nor will being an apologist for capitalism’s excesses. Can he not see that we may be forced to accept a simpler life, which, paradoxically, may make us more content in the long term? Have we really got an alternative to this?Peter StrotherUpper Finlarig, Highland • Campaigning on climate change should not be aligned to the left. The crucial element of change in British society is the small-C conservative. The anti-roads campaign of the 90s stopped hundreds of roads because local people, often Conservatives, came out to defend their countryside. My father-in-law, a staunch Labour supporter, worked closely with the local Tory mayor to deliver a superb children’s playground and a community bus service in Lichfield. Our conservative MP spent hours on the phone to persuade the local council to allow a community garden. However, the issue is not about left or right but about thinkers and doers. The small-C conservative wants to make it happen, not to have a discussion about “inclusive proposals” and “social consensus”. Environmentalists tend to be good at attending general meetings about renewable energy but, when an application for a real wind turbine is before a council, they rarely engage. The green NGOs need to stop concentrating on attracting the thinkers and e-petition signers but also to engage apolitically with the rest of society on practical solutions with local councils, planning, communities and MPs.Victoria HarveyLeighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire • Lynas is spot-on. The triumph of ideology over scientific evidence hampers effective policy to slow down global warming. Opposition among greens to fracking is an outstanding example. Of course the location of fracking must take account of local geology and social factors, but the country that has recently done more than any other to slow global warning has been the United States, which has greatly reduced its carbon emissions by switching massively from coal to gas. It did so by unlocking vast reserves of shale gas through fracking. The most urgent need in policy on climate change is to prevent the huge projected increase in the building of coal-fired power stations. Gas is still a fossil fuel and can be only a transitional solution. But its carbon impact is about half that of coal. It can give us a breathing space, more effectively and quickly than any alternative now on offer. We need time to develop the most effective long-term solutions to avoid a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.Dick TaverneHouse of Lords • Lynas assumes the classic sophist mantle, exposed by Socrates some centuries ago, but regularly recycled as the comfort-zone from which to launch any “plague on both your houses” diatribe when serious change threatens or is needed. Characteristically, for him it is the left that is most at fault, because “the left’s global doom threats … have made the right embrace denialism” – rather than any long-term corporate commitment to poorly controlled carbon release. His acerbic parody of Naomi Klein’s analysis and intention raises questions about his own motives and affiliations, and are a gratuitous insult to people around the world who are coming together to keep up the pressure on governments and corporations to clean up their acts before it is too late. The scientists are predominantly on their side, too. Is Lynas’s real fear that the difficult processes of coping with climate change, in so far as they achieve success, will trigger new, more insistent questions about how we allowed our world to degenerate to this extent, and how the causes may correlate with those of other issues – inequality, educational opportunity, economic malfunction and so on? Given his apparent views, these could well be the real questions keeping him awake at night.Ralph WindleArts Social Action, Witney"
"The latest victim of Florida governor Rick Scott’s unwritten ban on state officials using the words “climate change” is his own disaster preparedness lieutenant, who stumbled through verbal gymnastics to avoid using the scientific term in a newly surfaced video.  Bryan Koon, Florida’s emergency management chief, was testifying before the state senate’s budget subcommittee on Thursday, answering questions about the news that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) will pull federal funding from states that refuse to directly address climate change. In the video, uploaded by the advocacy group Forecast The Facts, Senator Jeff Clemens asks Koon whether he is aware of the updated Fema guidelines, which would block 2016 funding in states whose governors refuse to implement so-called hazard mitigation plans for global warming. Koon affirmed that the state’s next plan would be required to include “language to that effect”. Clemens came back, saying: “I used ‘climate change’, but I’m suggesting, maybe as a state we use ‘atmospheric re-employment’, that might be something the governor can get behind” – to laughter among committee members and the audience. But Koon charged on, clarifying that “future versions of our mitigation plan will be required to have language discussing that issue”. “What issue is that”? Clemens asked with a smile. “The issue that you mentioned earlier, regarding …” Koon said, before being drowned out by laughter at his obvious discomfort. Scott and his staff have repeatedly denied that they have instituted a ban on allowing local officials to say “climate change”, “global warming” or “sustainability” in public, but the governor has not shied away from publicly expressing scepticism about the science of climate change on the campaign trail. Koon’s public gaffe comes after recent reports that a longtime state environmental protection employee was issued an official reprimand instructing him to take two days of leave and not return to work before a mental health evaluation ruled him fit for duty after he included the words “climate change” in meeting notes. Florida is far from the only state that has refused to make action on climate change a priority. Tennessee, Louisiana and North Carolina all have laws on the books that open the door for climate change denial to be taught in the classroom.  A recent study from Columbia University’s Center for Climate Change Law also found 18 states have disaster mitigation plans that either include no provisions for responding to the effects of climate change, or reference it in a dismissive or inaccurate way."
"A delegation of farmers has called for the Abbott government to act on climate change by restoring an emissions trading scheme, maintaining the current renewable energy target and spending on rail infrastructure to improve inland transport and reduce carbon emissions. The farmers have spent two days lobbying the Coalition to start implementing a suite of policies to deal with the effects of climate change, warning of dire consequences for the agriculture sector if the threat was not addressed.  They have told the government MPs, including John Cobb and the staff of the treasurer Joe Hockey, that the Direct Action policy, which provides incentives for polluters to reduce carbon emissions, will not work to ameliorate climate change, “but if the government wants to give away money, people will keep taking it”. The delegation said the lack of climate policies was being exacerbated by the cuts to research and development funding for applied climate science and the Bureau of Meteorology. The visit came as intense negotiations between the government and Labor continued over the RET, which currently requires the government to source 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy from renewables by 2020. The latest government offer to Labor is 32,000GWh. It also follows a report by University of Melbourne researchers called Appetite for Change, which charted the detrimental effects of climate change on Australia’s food production. The farmers, organised by Earth Hour Australia, said the Abbott government needed to show leadership on the issue and it could start by using the term climate change, rather than “climate variability”. John Pettigrew, who has an irrigation property at Bunbartha north of Shepperton, said calling climate change “variability” was “doing everyone a disservice”. “We are not going to revert to where we were 10 years ago,” said Pettigrew. “There will be highs and lows, but the trend is there. We saw it through the millennium drought and failing to acknowledge the problem is only adding to it. “It’s doing the industry a disservice. It’s about how the industry is perceived by overseas buyers. Already in dairy, large multinational companies are demanding environment and carbon emission recording to show it’s been factored in. “The Australian government’s international perception is not good [on climate change] and that is an impediment to us being able to get into high-value markets.” Peter Holding, who runs a 1500-hectare farm at Harden west of Canberra, said the science indicated that climate change was a bigger issue than the weather and Australia needed to protect its international reputation. “We want to see some leadership, we are tired of platitudes and saying it can’t happen, we are losing markets because Australia’s reputation is slipping on being clean and green,” Holding said. “Climate change going to have impacts right across the budget from dislocation of whole rural communities to drought assistance. “We need infrastructure spending and new industries in the renewable energy sector. Governments have to start thinking on policies that last a bit longer than a three year term.” Holding said while some carbon farming initiatives such as methane capture in piggeries were effective, Direct Action was generally rolling out slowly and farmers and researchers remain unconvinced the policy will meet any targets. “People will be more than willing to accept the funding but we – and the research – are not convinced you can make a difference to climate change by doing it and therefore it is a waste of precious government funds, but if the government wants to give away money, people will keep taking it” said Holding. Sid Plant, a grazier on the Darling Downs in Queensland, would like to see an emissions trading scheme, like the one first negotiated in 2009 by Kevin Rudd, Malcolm Turnbull and Ian Macfarlane. Plant said he was hopeful that “something sensible” on emissions trading was proposed because he believes it would allow farmers to benefit from increasing organic carbon in the soil, which had added benefits for the farm as well as turning a profit. “I hoped to position myself to have carbon to sell and it might not pay a lot but there will be benefits for increasing organic carbon, such as retaining more moisture,” he said. Plant’s family has farmed for seven generations and he first had to study weather patterns to get his pilot’s licence. He first noticed the El Nino pattern in 1973 and learned to apply the science to better manage his cattle. Under a changing climate, Plant no longer keeps a breeding herd so that he can sell down as soon as the weather turns dry. He is convinced he will not see much rain from now until Christmas. “The most significant part of climate change is declining rainfall, which applies to most of Queensland,” Plant said. “Australian farmers are feeling climate change as early as anybody in the world, and significantly, we have the world’s highest year to year rainfall variability. “Climate change is coming over the top and when the UN sees our farmers as leading the world, we seem to be running out of bright ideas without the right policies. I want to save world for my grandchildren. “I find it very difficult to find someone to vote for.”"

"The UN fund to help developing countries fight climate change can be spent on coal-fired power plants – the most polluting form of electricity generation – under rules agreed at a board meeting. The green climate fund (GCF) refused an explicit ban on fossil fuel projects at the contentious meeting in Songdo, South Korea, last week. “It’s like a torture convention that doesn’t forbid torture,” said Karen Orenstein, a campaigner for Friends of the Earth US who was at the meeting. “Honestly it should be a no-brainer at this point.” The fund was set up as part of the ongoing UN climate negotiations to help developing countries finance clean energy and measures to help adapt to climate change. Its website states: “The fund will promote the paradigm shift towards low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways by providing support to developing countries to limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.” It has struggled for support, however, with industrialised countries paying only about 1% of the $10.2bn (£6.9bn) committed at the UN climate negotiations in Lima last December. The deadline for contributions is 30 April. With no clear rules on climate finance, much of the funds can be channelled to dirty energy, campaigners say. Japan designated $1bn in loans for coal plants in Indonesia as climate finance, according to reporting by the Associated Press. Last week Japan counted another $630m in loans for coal plants in India and Bangladesh as climate finance. Japan claims the projects are less polluting than older coal-fired plants and so qualify as clean energy. “Japan is of the view that the promotion of high-efficiency coal-fired power plants is one of the realistic, pragmatic and effective approaches to cope with the issue of climate change,” Takako Ito, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, told AP. Campaigners say the lack of clear rules makes a mockery of the fund. “Many people think it’s crazy that they are not going to have a no-go zone,” Orenstein said. “The fact that the GCF won’t say it is problematic both for the integrity of the fund, and also reputational risk.” Japan, China and Saudi Arabia opposed such a ban, she said. The board agreed to set a minimum benchmark for the greenhouse gas emissions cuts that projects must achieve, but not until 2016. Meanwhile, they will apply an “assessment scale” to the first projects, which are set to be approved in October."

"Environment group the Australian Conservation Foundation released a top ten list yesterday. Now as any human of the internet age knows, lists of things are almost as difficult to ignore as compilations of cats falling off furniture or GIFs of baby elephants. Sadly, the ACF’s list isn’t as much fun. The list, Australia’s Top Ten Climate Polluters, used public government data of greenhouse gases emitted in Australia. The ten most polluting companies – led by Energy Australia, which generates electricity mainly through burning coal and gas – make up almost one third of the country’s entire emissions. The report also juxtaposes those companies’ huge greenhouse gas footprints with statements they have made about climate change.  Many of them say they’re worried about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (but not worried enough, some would fairly point out, to get out of the business of being major contributors to the problem). Last September, the company in third place, AGL, bought the company in second place, Macquarie Generation, meaning that AGL is likely now Australia’s top emitter. But more about AGL later. The ACF uses the established methodology of including emissions that companies generate from their operations, such as burning coal for electricity or running trucks on petrol. But that doesn’t include emissions from the burning of fossil fuels that some companies extract and sell to other people. If you did include those emissions then the top ten list would look very different. Take for example miner Rio Tinto, which occupies fourth spot on the ACF list with emissions of 18 million tonnes of CO2 last year. Rio Tinto emits greenhouse gases due to the energy-intensive nature of its mining, processing and smelting operations. Rio Tinto’s coal mining operation is concentrated in Australia. In the company’s 2014 annual report, Rio Tinto says the burning of its coal by its customers (for both power and steel making) was responsible for a further 129 Mt of CO2. That’s quite a bit more than 18 Mt. It’s also quite a bit more than the 20.8 Mt of CO2 emitted by Australia’s “top ranked” emitter, EnergyAustralia. A very rough rule of thumb on coal is that each tonne burned for power emits about two and half times that in carbon dioxide emissions. Glencore-Xstrata exported some 54 million tonnes of coal for power generation last year, but it is not on the ACF list even though the emissions from that coal are likely well above 100 Mt of CO2. Neither is BHP Billiton on the ACF list - a company which exported about 21 Mt of thermal coal in 2014. Yet assigning emissions to the companies that extract the fossil fuels is not a new idea. A study in the journal Climatic Change released in November 2013 also assigned emissions to the corporations who had extracted the fossil fuels. The report found that since the start of the industrial revolution just 90 companies caused 63 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions. A study led by CSIRO scientists in 2010 found that emissions caused by the burning Australian fossil fuels exported overseas were more than double the level of emissions generated by burning fossil fuels domestically. Yet those emissions don’t appear on Australia’s national greenhouse accounts. Altogether, Australia exported some 201 Mt of coal for power generation last year. I spoke to Kelly O’Shanassy, the CEO of ACF, and asked her about the way the report was put together. Internationally the way they account for pollution goes to the organisation directly responsible for it, so if we ship coal to India then the company there that burns it is responsible for the pollution. However, the company in Australia that dug it up has some responsibility because it is their product that has polluted the global climate and is causing the damage globally. So I think we might in future years include other scopes in that work. The companies are still making money from pollution.  O’Shanassy revealed the report marked the beginning of a shift in approach for ACF, which she said had previously played “the inside game” of working with governments. Whilst we have had success in those approaches, what has happened is that governments have come in and just unwound the progress. It’s not going to work anymore to be just quietly asking governments to do the right thing. So the purpose of this report is to say – we are going to hold you to account and we are going to go out to all Australians and build a huge constituency in this country to make sure you do what Australians want you to do. If governments put the interests of polluters above those of Australians then we need to start to grow a force to support clean energy, not coal. This is definitely a shift in our focus. She said they would also be working to build “community power” and to work with major financial investors to encourage them to get their money out of fossil fuels. We respect the role of politicians, but we don’t think they are doing enough. There’s a great saying that the power of the people is greater than the people in power. I think the people in power forget that sometimes. We are going to remind them. O’Shanassy said a key reason for putting the report together was to highlight the disparity between what companies do and what they say about climate change. We have got to start holding them to account for what they actually do. It’s pretty easy to put greenwash out there. Business sustainability is about what you produce, not whether you change lightbulbs in the corporate office. If those companies produce coal then that has a massive impact and we are going to hold them accountable for that. Many of these companies have actually increased their emissions in recent times. We will be putting out this report every year to track their progress. That brings us to third-ranked AGL, which last September bought Macquarie Generation, the former New South Wales Government-owned coal generator occupying second spot in the top ten polluter list. The ACF report places AGL’s statements of concern for climate change and emissions reductions with its position on Australia’s renewable energy target, which AGL says should be revised downwards. AGL sent me a statement, saying its position was not contradictory and had research to back up its view.  The statement said there was “little point in maintaining the target without complementary policy that ensures older emissions intensive power stations are permanently retired” which was consistent with a policy goal of “decarbonisation”. In effect, such policy would ensure that as new renewables are built, older emissions intensive power stations are removed from the system – ensuring a sustainable investment environment. In a separate statement, AGL said climate change and greenhouse gas emissions were “a long term challenge requiring long term and lasting solutions” and the company recognised it was a large emitter with a “key role to play” in cutting its emissions. The statement added the company had $3 billion worth of investments in renewable energy and 17 per cent of the energy it did generate came from renewables. AGL has a range of programs and policies in place to reduce its GHG emissions, including improving the GHG efficiency of our operations and those which we have an influence on. Now all that may be true.  But how does this sit with AGL’s decision to buy Macquarie Generation last year? Here’s what they bought. MacGen is the largest producer of electricity in New South Wales. The assets include the Bayswater (2,640 MW) and Liddell (2,000 MW) black coal fired power stations, Hunter Valley Gas Turbines (50 MW), Bayswater B and Tomago development sites, Liddell solar farm, extensive coal handling infrastructure comprising rail unloaders and conveyor systems, 104 million tonnes of contracted coal and approximately 4.2 million tonne coal stockpile. I have to wonder why a company concerned about climate change and cutting its emissions would buy another company with an annual greenhouse gas footprint of 20 million tonnes?"
"Recycle more, opt for “sustainable” products, offset your flights. In short, do anything, just please don’t stop buying our product. Companies know that most of us have a basic instinct to protect the environment. Some also know that our doing so could well be a serious threat to their business model. Why? Because a determined attempt to stave off climate change and resource depletion would require radical changes, not only to what we consume, but also – crucially – to how much we consume.     Here are four ways companies frame their marketing messages to make sure we keep buying their products despite our green instincts. For the easily convinced, it might be enough to do absolutely nothing other than colour the packaging green and employ environmentally-inspired language. Coca-Cola Life is a case in point: while clearly designed to engage environmental and natural values, nowhere does it claim to actually reduce planetary destruction. The ultimate natural beverage – tap water – isn’t quite so profitable. Statoil, the Norwegian energy company, wants you to think that natural gas will help solve climate change, ignoring the fact that we need to reduce the use of all fossil fuels. The NFU’s Buy British campaign proclaims the superior welfare standards of British meat, but neglects the possibility that we ought to just stop eating so much of it.  Car manufacturers trumpet the improving fuel use per mile, but keep schtum about whether we might need a wholesale transition away from road transport. And easyJet implores you to “Fly greener, fly easyJet”, saying its fleet is newer and more energy-efficient, while disregarding the need to drastically reduce flight volumes.  In many cases, governments are complicit in this messaging, championing incremental changes as long as they don’t encroach on our perceived right to consume as much as we like. Recycling is the ultimate act of environmental absolution. When you ask people what they are personally doing to tackle climate change, the most common response is: “I recycle”.  And yet, in environmental terms it is infinitely preferable to prevent waste altogether, rather than recycle it. Recycling alone is not going to do much to prevent disastrous climate change, but it makes people feel good and doesn’t threaten core corporate interests. Sometimes the attempt to co-opt sustainability frames is shameless: think back to Topshop’s blatant rebranding of a popular slogan: ‘Reshop. Reuse. Recycle.’ Or Shell’s ludicrous 2007 claim to recycle CO2 into flowers. Others are more subtle, like Jigsaw’s current For Life Not Landfill campaign, which instructs you to “invest” in your wardrobe, but offers no serious advice on why buying more clothes from Jigsaw might reduce the number of garments in landfill sites. If all else fails, just tell your customers that they have no choice but to buy your product. Seriously unsustainable industries that can’t hide their dirty practices are the most likely offenders here.  For example, fossil fuel companies are fond of reminding us that demand for their product will keep increasing, and the food industry tells us we will need 100% more food by 2050. This framing sidelines the question of whether we should be trying to constrain that demand and implicitly tells you that since everyone else is going to be doing it, you might as well join the party. The outdoor equipment company Patagonia famously urged its customers not to buy their products if they didn’t need them in their Don’t Buy This Jacket campaign. Corporate framing is so deliberately devoid of anti-consumption messages that when one does crop up it feels completely jarring and causes a media splash.  A cynic might argue that Patagonia is, in fact, the supreme master of greenwash here, but, whatever Patagonia’s aims, the campaign raised an interesting question: can retail brands ever be the ones to encourage truly sustainable practices? The current framing of climate change doesn’t generally accept that there are some things we simply need to do less or consume fewer of. The story pushed by businesses and governments is that we need to fit the problem of climate change into the continuation of our normal lives and simply make better choices at the checkout.  In this narrative, the biggest change you might have to make is to buy British lamb chops, not ones from New Zealand, exchange your gas-guzzling car for a Prius and, above all, remember to do your recycling. Ultimately, we can’t expect businesses to advocate constraining consumption. But we must recognise the way they exploit our environmental instincts in their marketing. It’s time we start questioning whether to buy, not just what to buy. The rethinking prosperity hub is sponsored by DNV GL.

"Arctic sea ice has hit a record low for its maximum extent in winter, which scientists said was a result of climate change and abnormal weather patterns. The US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) said on Thursday that at its peak the ice covered just over 14.5m sq km of the northern seas. This was 130,000 sq km smaller than the previous lowest maximum in 2011. The peak occurred on 25 February, which the NSIDC’s senior research scientist Ted Scambos said was “very early but not unprecedented”. Climate change is driving declining ice coverage in the Arctic, with a recent study finding it has also become significantly thinner, down 65% since 1975. Scambos said northern oceans have progressively warmed because of climate change. This winter, the warmer seas combined with mild weather to create exceptionally poor conditions for the annual freeze. “[The record low extent] is significant, in that it shows that the Arctic is being seriously impacted by our warming climate,” said Scambos. “In general, sea ice retreat has proceeded faster than modelling expects in the Arctic, although models are catching up.” Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE, said: “This is further evidence that global warming and its impacts have not stopped despite the inaccurate and misleading claims of climate change ‘sceptics’. “Over the past few weeks, there has been an increase in the amount of misinformation from climate change ‘sceptics’ in the UK and elsewhere which is intended to mislead the public and policy-makers into believing that the effects of global warming on the polar regions are absent or negligible.” The most pronounced deviation from the 1981-2010 average cover was in the Bering and Okhotsk seas in the northern Pacific. There, the ice edge was 100-200km further north than in a normal year. After March the summer thaw will begin, with the ice retreating towards its summer minimum, which usually occurs in September. The summer ice cover in the Arctic is also on a long-term decline, although Scambos says a low winter maximum does not necessarily indicate a low minimum is on the way. The loss of ice from the Arctic has raised questions over when the region will experience its first ice-free summer. Scambos said he expects the summer minimum to dip below 1m sq km (386,100 sq miles) within the next 15 years. At this stage, he said, the Arctic will be profoundly changed. “A less than 1m sq km summer would mean that the north pole would be open water, that a broad seaway would exist north of Siberia and that major ecosystems and fauna would be severely impacted. My own guess is that we will reach this level around 2030.” The absence of sea ice and abnormally mild weather affects communities and wildlife in the Arctic circle, which are adapted to extreme conditions. In Svalbard, Kim Holmén, the international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, said the fjords there remained unfrozen and instead of the normal snowfall the island experienced rain which froze when it hit the ground. “Much of Svalbard is covered with ice on land, which is a fatal state for the reindeer. When the landscape is covered by ice they can’t move around and they can’t eat.”  Too much ice on the land and none in the sea has also made life difficult for the 2,600 people who live on Svalbard. “This iced landscape is miserable to travel across on your snowmobile and your skis,” said Holmén. “We can’t ride our snowmobiles across the fjord so there are places where people want to go that they can’t go. We have had tragic events with avalanches. Living in Svalbard we’ve always had avalanches but we’ve had one casualty this winter. Some of the risks are changing because we have more icing events.” He said this type of weather is expected to become normal under a changing climate. “This winter is an example of what we believe will become more common and has profound influence on the reindeer and the ptarmigan [a species of bird] and other creatures that roam the land,” he said. This week, on the opposite side of the Arctic Ocean, Alaska’s Iditarod sled race was forced to shift its start 362km (225 miles) further north due to a lack of snow. This has only happened once before in the race’s 43-year history, in 2003. Meanwhile, the NSIDC said ice floes surrounding Antarctica reached a relatively high summer minimum on 20 February. The extent of ice was 1.38m sq km, the fourth largest on record. Antarctic sea ice has confounded some scientific modelling by growing in recent years. There are several theories why the extent of the ice is growing despite a general warming trend across the southern continent. “This is a matter of considerable debate,” said Scambos. “The important thing to say is that the Antarctic is most definitely seeing the effects of warming and circulation changes – it is participating in ‘global warming’ in its own way. There are several effects in play. Primarily it seems that increased strength in low-pressure areas near the Ross and Weddell seas are pushing ice outward from the continent.”"
