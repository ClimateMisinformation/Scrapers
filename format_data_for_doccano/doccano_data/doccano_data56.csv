"The president of the United States openly mocked a teenage girl. After dismissing the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg in person and earning her ire, he tweeted to his 65 million followers: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”  Dismissive. Sarcastic. Mocking. Utterly typical. Is anyone surprised? The Republican party has a teenage girl problem. And Thunberg knows what’s up. On Monday, she gave an impassioned and emotional speech at the climate summit in New York. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.” Trump took it personally – hence, his tweet. On Tuesday, Thunberg fought back, changing her Twitter bio to read “a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”. She’s fierce. And she’s not the only one. Just last year, a 13-year old Canadian water activist named Autumn Peltier told the United Nations it was time to “warrior up” on World Water Day. “Our water deserves to be treated as human with human rights. We need to acknowledge our waters with personhood so we can protect our waters,” the Anishinaabe girl from Wikwemikoong First Nation told the diplomats gathered in New York City. Greta Thunberg and Autumn Peltier will join the pantheon of teenage girls who changed everything. Girls like Anne Frank, a young teen when she wrote her diary. Or Joan of Arc, who led an army. Or Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel peace prize for her work securing education for girls in Pakistan and around the world at the age of 17. It’s no wonder men like Donald Trump are shaking in their boots. Because hell hath no fury like a teenage girl who is awake and aware and done with your bullshit. The fears of men like Trump have made mocking teenage girls a favorite American pastime. We mock their trends. In the 1980s, it was the Valley Girls. Their big hair. The way they spoke. The way they pegged their jeans and chewed their gum. The accessories they carried. Today, newspapers and parenting magazines are full of hand wringing over “VSCO girls”, the modern day Valley Girl, most of whom are in their early teens and some even younger. All the things they enjoy – Fjällräven backpacks, HydroFlasks, Birkenstocks, scrunchies. It’s all fodder for their elders’ mocking. We dismiss their water bottles, their fashion choices, the words they use. We mock their selfies (narcissists!), their clothing (cheap and too much skin!), their makeup (too much in general! Be natural!). What would happen if teenage girls were actually allowed to feel good about themselves? What if we allowed them to have their interests with no shame? They might rise up and change everything. And that scares a certain kind of man. The Fox commentator Michael Knowles called Thunberg a “mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. Knowles issued an apology. But he wasn’t the only one. The conservative pundit Dinesh D’Souza compared Thunberg’s image to ones used in Nazi propaganda. He posted a photo on Twitter of Thunberg, with her long braids, next to an illustration of a young woman with a similar hairstyle standing in front of a swastika flag. As the mother of a teenage girl myself, I know how hard they are to manipulate. They are strong and smart and know themselves in ways big and small. They can’t be forced by anyone – not teachers or parents – to say things they don’t mean at a school assembly, let alone on world stage. Thunberg doesn’t need anyone to push her. She pushes herself. She’s well-informed, brilliant, and unafraid to take on all the leaders in the world. Like so many other teenage girls. Like Anne Frank. Like Peltier. Like Joan of Arc. Republicans are due a reckoning. Where do they really stand on 16-year-old girls? Are they children, manipulated by George Soros and their parents, when they are saying intelligent things? Or are they women? They certainly seem to be treated as “women” when it’s time to hang with the likes of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein or former Alabama chief justice Roy Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women and girls and still had many Republican supporters. It’s no wonder so many Republicans are scared of teenage girls. If teenage girls can accomplish so much and live so powerfully even as they are mocked, condescended, demeaned and shamed, imagine what they could do if we just shut up and got the hell out of their way."

Hamburg storm of 1962
Today is the 50th anniversary of the great storm of 1962, which with winds peaking at 200 km/hr hit Hamburg, Germany particularly hard. More than 50 dikes burst as the tide surged and submerged one sixth of the city. Imagine if that heppened today!

In total, the homes of about 60,000 people were destroyed, and the death toll amounted to 347 in Hamburg alone.
The European storm of 1953 – the worst in 500 years
It caused floods that took 2,000 lives. Holland was worst hit. Dikes gave way and flooded towns all across Europe.

Other great European storm disasters (when CO2 was 280 ppm):
17 Feb. 1164: Julian Flood, 20,000 dead.
16 Jan. 1219: 1st Marcellus Flood Reportedly 36,000 dead
14 Dec. 1287: St. Lucia’s Flood 50,000 dead
16 Jan. 1362: 2nd Marcellus Flood 100,000 dead.
1 Nov. 1570: All Saint’s Flood over 20,000 dead
11 Oct. 1634: Burchardi Flood, at least 8,000 dead
24 Dec. 1717: Christmas Flood; 14,000 dead

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the kind of green propaganda that poor Germans have to endure from their obviously panicked and hysterical Green government.
The German Environment Agency has put out a booklet advising citizens on how to achieve a Climate Neutral Lifestyle, in a bid to avert imminent catastrophe. This is really spooky. The guide communicates that it is Germany’s collective, ethical duty to save the planet from the scientifically proven “climate catastrophe” and that all citizens need to mobilize.
It defines the morality and ethical standards that citizens are to adopt. The guide first starts off by warning citizens:
We are all aware of the importance of climate protection. We are also aware that time is running out.
Scientific evidence on the imminent danger for humans and nature and the resulting cost has been increasing dramatically over the past decades, as has the knowledge about possible action to avert it.”
and:
What is needed is a political and economic U-turn in favour of climate protection.
Social commitment (such as membership in environmental groups) could further the introduction of more environmentally friendly legislation.”
5 examples of living green
So if you are a good citizen, care about the planet, and want to assure that future generations will have a happy planet, then it is your duty to live like one of the following 5 example persons. How you cut CO2 emissions is a “difficult ethical question,” the guide says.
Sabine P.
1. lives in a well-insulated flat
2. participates in car sharing
3. uses bicycle for short trips
4. buys green electricity
5. buys organic produce
6. buys energy-efficient household appliances (A++)
7. supports environmental organisations
She has no car, but “has a clean conscience as well as a lower electricity bill. However, Sabine’s commitment does not end with consumption. ‘I am a member of various environmental organisations and donate on a regular basis.’”

Or you can live like Peter B.
1. lives in a passive house
2. has a solar panel on his roof
3. drives an economical car (3.5 l/100km)
Peter B. says: “It is fantastic to shower with water heated by the sun.” I never knew you could tell the difference.
Check out Katharina C.
1. limits consumption by limiting work hours and salary
2. lives in a small flat
3. turns the heating down
4. lives close to her workplace
5. participates in car-sharing
6. uses the bicycle for short trips
7. avoids long-distance travel
8. buys green electricity
9. buys energy-efficient appliances (A++)
10. cooks vegetarian dishes
11. buys organic food
12. looks out for ecolabels such as the Blue Angel
13. buys CO2 certificates from the EU emissions
By now you are getting the feeling this is communist central planning economy that will fail quickly. Soon Germany and Europe will look like North Korea. Or how about:
Sybille B.
1. has a season ticket for the railway and no car
2. invested money in wind energy (€ 30,000)
3. invested money in sustainability funds (€ 20,000)
The keep telling where to invest. Someone is getting awfully rich from this scam. This is not trickle down, but gusher up economics. Finaly we have
Linus L.
A successful executive, always on the go. His CO2eq emissions come to 18 tonnes per annum. Clearly, this is not a sustainable lifestyle, and he knows it. No problem though: He donates 420 € per year to a reputable carbon offsetting service provider. Hence, his money only goes to UN-certified projects that fulfil the Gold Standard. He sees it as part of his global responsibility – helping other countries to build low-carbon industries.
Some of you may ask what Pierre G. does to reduce carbon emissions. Answer: Not a damn thing. I leave lights on, eat steak, own 2 cars, drive instead of walk, leave windows open etc.
Result? The planet has not warmed in almost 15 years. Screw the green religion, take your hysteria and get out of my house.
Personally I’m going to put a copy of this booklet in the safe so that my children one day can look back and marvel at the degree of collective madness and hysteria that is capable of gripping a society when science runs totally amok. It is truly scary that some societies today are led by institutions seized by such hysteria.
Surely this will be another case study (and again from Germany) for the historians of the future.

"A sample group of 150 French citizens — from unemployed people to pensioners and factory workers — will this week begin advising the French president Emmanuel Macron on how France can cut carbon emissions to tackle the climate emergency.   The panel was chosen by selecting people, aged from 16 to over 65, from towns and villages across France. More than 25,000 automatically generated calls were made to mobile numbers and landlines to find a representative “sample of national life”. Coming from various backgrounds and professions, the citizens are not experts on environmental issues but are expected to have views on the difficulties of combating the climate change and to offer ideas. They will be asked to consider the role of individuals, and society as a whole – covering housing, work, transport, food, shopping and methods of production — and suggest solutions for cutting emissions, which will be put before parliament. Julien Blanchet, who is overseeing the process, said the citizens would represent “the diversity of the French population”. Environmental campaigners said the process, which will run until February, should not be used as an excuse to delay urgent climate action. Macron, the French president, had promised to appoint a citizens’ consultation body after he faced a crisis in climate policy last year when the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters took to the streets against a new carbon tax intended to urge motorists to change their behaviour. People in the countryside said it was deeply unfair to raise taxes on fuel use where there was no alternative transport to private cars, and while vast corporations were not doing enough. The tax was later abandoned. Macron has presented himself as a world leader on the climate emergency. But despite France’s ambitious promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in reality the country is far from delivering its goals, the French independent advisory council on climate has warned. Everyday life in France does not match political promises – particularly with regard to transport, car use and building renovation – and the government is seen as not doing enough to meet a net-zero emissions target for 2050. The citizens’ panel will advise on how France can cut carbon emissions by 40% before 2030, in terms of building construction and housing, transport methods, food production and consumption At their first meeting, the participants will be briefed by climate experts and will then meet over several weekends until the end of January. Of the thousands of French people contacted by phone to join the consultation, 30% quickly expressed interest, 35% asked to consider the idea, and 35% refused."
"Michael Mobbs has triggered an important conversation by “coming out” as a climate survivalist. He expects “societal collapse … a total breakdown within the next three to five years”, so he’s selling his ground-breaking and beautiful off-grid sustainable home in Chippendale and planning to move to the New South Wales South Coast. Mobbs has contributed an enormous amount over many years, but this latest intervention is deeply problematic. It is wrong in fact and wrong in approach, and could contribute to making an already bad situation worse.  While climate breakdown is well under way, and societal collapse is a very real possibility within my lifetime if not necessarily his, there is no serious projection to justify a timeframe as short as three to five years for total breakdown. And the approach of running for the hills (or the coast) is neither sensible nor helpful. It only makes societal collapse more likely, by curtailing action and dividing the community even further. And, in that scenario, it won’t even help you survive. Far be it from me to criticise Mobbs’ personal choice here. His exhaustion and lack of hope is completely understandable. He has been actively working for solutions to ecological destruction for decades, leading whole communities towards action, while being ignored by the vast majority. Some of the responses to his declaration, suggesting his approach has been an individualist one ignoring the need for collective action, are ignorant of his work. Mobbs has been working for collective action, using his own personal action as an inspiring example to support others to follow suit and work together for systemic change, as all effective collective organising does. In this way, he has driven vital shifts in building regulations, and more important shifts in understandings of how we humans can and should live as part of the natural world rather than trying to separate ourselves from it. Ecological thinking teaches us that all collective action is made up of interwoven and interlinked individual action. As Greta Thunberg says: “We need system change rather than individual change, but you can’t have one without the other.” Which brings us to why talking of literally burning bridges is not helpful. If we’re to survive in the far-less-hospitable world that two centuries of institutionalised greed, selfishness and short-sightedness have bequeathed us, it will only be together. It will only be by using the coming years to cultivate resilient, cohesive, cooperative, equitable communities, embedded in the natural world. That’s why, while Mobbs is of course entitled to choose to retire with our thanks for what he’s achieved, the criticism of his public declaration of survivalism as embedded in a culture of white supremacy and the right of wealth is also entirely legitimate. Survivalist retreat shuts off the possibility of action. It assumes that there is no longer any chance of preventing catastrophe, that there is nothing left to be done, that no action to reduce our impact will have any effect. While the scientists whose research I read and who I speak to are increasingly desperate, none condone this view. All argue that, even if we were to pull out all stops now and drive the fastest and largest transition in human history, we will still face severe impacts for generations to come. We will almost certainly lose all corals, including the Great Barrier Reef, for example. Fires and storms and droughts will continue to get more intense and frequent. Make no mistake, things will be bad. But, if we act fast, it doesn’t have to mean extinction. The worst thing to do right now would be to cut off that option and give in to those who want to keep milking profits out of the destruction of our only home. That only makes it less likely that any of us will survive. Retreat, of course, by definition, is only available to a select few. This is why the focus of the responses to Mobbs’ declaration from the left, in particular Amy Gray’s searing critique, attack it as inequitable and racist. My addendum is that just as survivalism makes extinction more likely by cutting off the option of action, dividing our society even further makes societal collapse even more likely. This would be the worst outcome of all. At this point in history, now that we have locked in ecological disruption on a scale our species has never known, we must learn the lessons of ecology. And the number one lesson is that resilience is the key. Resilience, not dominance, is the real strength, especially in hard times. And the secret to resilience is connected diversity, cohesion, cooperative coexistence. That means that in many ways our most important task right now is to build social cohesion while learning to live within natural limits. Luckily, there are ways of making sure that the two go hand in hand. Whether it’s urban community agriculture or local sharing and repair groups; whether it’s models of participatory democracy like Voices for Indi or community renewable energy cooperatives; whether it’s stripping corporations of the rights of legal personhood unless they properly respect social and environmental norms, supporting worker- and user-owned cooperatives to compete with them, or prioritising the long-term interests of traditional owners and workers over the profits of fossil fuel corporations; all these point the way towards holding off the worst ecological impacts of climate disruption while building the resilience to avoid the societal collapse it could trigger. If, at this moment, we turn even more against each other, we have no future. The strongest will survive for a while. Then they, too, will be lost. In reality, Michael Mobbs’ solution of urban living in harmony with the natural world, brought together with deep democracy and cultivating social cohesion, is the only path to survival. • Tim Hollo is executive director of the Green Institute"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome of us may have had suspicions in the past. Now it’s confirmed – some parts of the green/climate movement are so radical that they are now attracting neo-Nazis and extremists.
The online German leftist daily TAZ has come out with an article that describes a disturbing phenomena, namely: the green movement is being infiltrated by these psychos. The TAZ piece is titled: Nazis against coal.
The TAZ opens with:
Green. That’s the color that is inseparably linked to the environmental movement. But behind the appearance that there are lots of left-wing folks behind it, there are often ‘brown environmentalists’ who spread their extreme right wing ideas via their environmental friendliness. A new report by the Heinrich-Böll Foundation now shows that environmental initiatives are being ever more frequently infiltrated by Neonazis.”
Don’t get mad at me, I’m just the messenger. I don’t want to label the true green movement and environmentalists as brown by no means. But sometimes you have to admit that some of the features of the radical climate movement are strikingly similar. The most radical among them want to 10-10 the climate science skeptics, depopulate the planet down to less than a billion people, and dictate to the rest of the world how to live.

The 6 Heinrich-Böll Foundation authors of the 112-page book titled Brown Environmentalists examined extreme right activities within the environmental spectrum in the Mecklenburg region of East Germany. Unfortunately the book is not available in English. The activities included nationalistic protests against Polish plans to build nuclear power plants and extreme right wing parties providing legal advice on environmental issues. Makes you wonder who funds who.
Anti Americanism – protect the homeland!
The Heinrich Boll Foundation is concerned that organic food farmers in the far eastern part of Germany are taking on ultra right wing behaviours and so advises organic shops and individuals to “closely examine the backgrounds of organic farmers who they buy from.” The green brown radicals also were the first to appear at the founding of a citizens initiative called “Say no to coal!” in the town of Lübtheen in 2005. Apparently Udo Pastörs, a honcho in the quite brown NPD party led a protest against the American coal corporation with the intention of spreading radical anti-Americanism.
This ought not be a surprise. Indeed much of the green agenda is aimed against American ideals, and thus it is little wonder that it appeals broadly to haters of Americans. And how often have we heard radical warmists and environmentalists refer to the human race as parasites? That’s only one step away from picking up a spray can of Raid. There are things they seem to have in common. My suggestion to true greens is that you really ought to tone down the rhetoric against those who do not agree with you. Just look at the company you’re getting. It’s disgusting.
The organic farmers mentioned above have roots that go back a long time. Back in the 1920s in Koppelow near Krakow the Volks Nationalistic Movement of the so-called Artamanen started their grand settlement projects. Among the Artamanen, who were dedicated to a Blut und Boden (blood and soil)-inspired ruralism,  were the infamous Nazis Heinrich Himmler and Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höß. According to the TAZ report, extreme right wing ecological movements go far beyond the “68” generation, and are focused on defending the homeland and preserving the environment.

"It has been more than 10 years since a plump, crudely drawn and partially coloured-in blue whale, with an exaggerated and perhaps mildly offensive cartoon New Zealand accent, discovered he was in a spot of bother and exclaimed, “Oh no, I’m beached, bro. I’m beached az!” Time flies when you’re a giant aquatic mammal stuck on the sand, pondering the hopelessness of your circumstances. Created by Australians Nicholas Boshier (of the Bondi Hipsters), Jarod Green and Anthony MacFarlane, the first episode of the viral series cost just $16 to make and has racked up almost 10m views since it landed on YouTube in 2008. And now, after two initial series on the ABC and YouTube, Beached Az is back for a third. The gentle mockery of Kiwi vernacular continues – but in 2019, the whale and seagull have gotten more political, and more surreal. The first episode, which launched on Facebook on Tuesday, offers a glimpse of where it’s going. The two lead characters meet with the god of the sea, Poseidon, who shows them what the future holds in an increasingly desperate attempt to alert them to the ocean’s demise. But the seagull and whale – perhaps stand-ins for us all – are distracted and delighted by the cool tech instead. Each of the 10 new weekly episodes will be accompanied by an educational series, Teached Az, which expands on the ideas explored. If the word “educational” makes you want to run for the hills, fear not: directed by Jarod Green, these episodes hold true to the show’s deadpan tone, as the animated, climate change-denying seagull sits down to interview a range of Australian marine experts and conservationists. In the accompaniment to that first episode, for instance, the seagull asks Greenpeace Australia’s Jack Ballhausen about what the future of the ocean will actually look like. The answer? Less blue. More acidic. Toxic for birds. “That’s pretty shit,” the seagull says. “What are we talking here? Are we talking like a million years?” “We’re talking about 11 years.” “At least it’s still something I don’t have to worry about immediately I guess.” In another episode, the blue whale takes the form of bleached white coral – and the seagull character is now a seahorse. They interact with each other in the expected way: in furious agreement about the coral’s predicament. “Bro, you’re heaps bleached, ay?” “So bleached! I’m bleached az!” The seahorse announces his plan to save his friend: he’ll take a photo of the bleached coral and publish it to Facebook. As the coral politely explains that in fact he needs a real solution, the seahorse brags that the picture has racked up “six likes already!” and “a sad face emoji with a little tear on it!” “That looks like traction, but I actually need you to do something,” insists the dying coral. “What’s the systemic change at the end of it?” In his book The End of Protest: A Playbook for Revolution, the Occupy co-founder Micah White describes clicktivism (which includes writing social media posts and signing online petitions) as a form of political protest that “propagates a false theory of social change” and “encourages complacency”. The message, in this context, is simple: get away from the keyboard and take direct action. The episodes are self-contained, with no narrative through-line. Some revolve around the seagull and the whale, while others follow an assortment of fishy characters. It’s clear the budget is bigger than ever, and the creators seem to have been given carte blanche to expand the universe and take crazy detours – the connective tissue generally being a political point about the climate and ecological crisis. There’s an episode about overfishing that satirises conspiracy theorists; another that follows the seagull as he spreads pro-fossil fuel propaganda and befriends David Koch; and then Dolphins, the weirdest of all, which runs for an epic 10 minutes involving tripped-out dolphins on a psychotropic adventure. Yep. It’s pretty weird. But beached, bleached or teached, it’s still good az. • New episodes of Beached Az and Teached Az land on Facebook every Tuesday."
"Three days prior to Greta Thunberg’s surprise visit to Iowa City on Friday, the organizer and local climate activist, Massimo Biggers, a 14-year-old Iowa City high school student, was preparing to strike – as he has done every Friday, sometimes on his own, since the Global Climate Strike day Thunberg inspired on 15 March. Out of the blue, a message arrived from the Swedish teen activist, with whom he had been in touch, asking him if he was planning to strike again this Friday. “Of course!” he replied, and for the last 48 hours, according to his father, Jeff, neither had slept. “This was truly a miracle to have the town pull this together,” he said.  More than 3,000 people gathered at short notice in the shadow of the University of Iowa on Friday afternoon to hear Thunberg speak. “Wow” said Thunberg, squinting in the sun, as the crowd chanted her name. “It’s just so many people I don’t think any of us expected this many people. This is real hope, so many people gathering on a weekday at such short notice. This is real hope to me,” she said. Biggers has spent the last six months mobilizing fellow students to pressure the city council into adopting more stringent measures to address climate change. “At the time our specific goal was to get the school board to pass a climate resolution,” he said in an interview with the Guardian. “But then it was pretty easy to get the school board to get a climate resolution so we went to the city council and now we’re trying to get the coal fired [power] plant shut down,” he added. The University of Iowa burns coal at its power plant, providing a clear target for the young activists who lead the crowd in regular chants of “End Coal Now!” “To be part of a global movement and especially at this stage, it’s just an amazing, amazing opportunity to see a global leader,” said Abbey Jordahl, a freshman at UI from Ankeny, Iowa. “Honestly I couldn’t believe it when I read that Greta was coming here, I was like … Iowa City?! What?! I’ve been following her for a while, honestly I can’t believe I’m here!” Thunberg rallied an enthusiastic, young crowd, flush with high school and university students, many of whom had made their own signs to greet her. “Right now the world leaders keep acting like children and somebody needs to be the adult in the room,” she said, referencing her speech at the United Nations in New York the previous week. Thunberg said afterwards that she doesn’t like being the centre of attention. “It’s very hard to get used to,” she admitted, “but it’s something I have to do and I can’t really complain. I just kind of shut off the brain,” she said. Explaining why she believes she is now on the receiving end of criticism from world leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, she suggested: “They do it because they see something that is threatening and they want to silence that and if they don’t have anything else to say, if they can’t criticize the science, which is all we are saying, then they start attacking us personally and sending threats and hate and so on so maybe they can’t cope with it. “It could definitely be they feel threatened by a new generation,” she added “There is a lot of young people especially young girls in this movement who are leading and maybe they don’t like that, I don’t know!” Claire Carlson, a senior studying geoscience, environmental science and business at UI from Ottumwa had joined friends from the Environmental Science Club at the rally. “Its nice to finally see a large group of people come together and address the problem,” she said. “I think Greta’s done a really good job of bringing a voice to that especially at a really young age. I think it means that more people are starting to understand the need for impactful legislation with regards to climate change.” Carlson, like her friend Emma Hartke, will be able to caucus next February for a Democratic candidate. “I think Elizabeth Warren has a really good plan for climate change,” said Hartke. Carlson favours the young mayor from South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, but Warren is the name on most people’s lips when asked which way they’re currently leaning. “There are still some centrists who like to play both sides on climate … such as Joe Biden,” said Derek Torres who has moved to Iowa City from Atlanta. “They always speak in terms of jobs … but if there’s no air or water there’s no jobs,” he reasoned. Thunberg has become adept at using Twitter to spread her message, but does she enjoy using it? “Yes and no,” she said. “A lot of it is just meaningless. And people wanting to brag about themselves or whatever, lots of hate, trolls, anonymous people who have separate accounts.” But she admitted she does enjoy updating her tagline. “You need to have fun as well,” she joked."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHave you ever been to a dinner party with lots of people when suddenly a mouse runs across the room and someone yells “mouse!” Most people simply ignore the intrusion, while others may ask “where?” But you can always count on someone flying into a fit of hysteria, jumping up on a table screaming and shaking violently until the medics arrive and shoot the person up with a massive dose of tranquilizers before wheeling the sedated patient to the nearest hospital for overnight obsevation. Irrational? Yes.That was pretty much how German politicians and media reacted in the wake of Fukushima. As the rest of the world watched with concern, and had their reactors checked over for good measure, Germany flipped out and plunged into a wave mass panic not seen since Orson Welles’ radio adaptation of War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells on October 30, 1938. After Fukushima, Germany immediately shut down 8 of its older reactors and then rammed through a law ordering the remaining 9 reactors be shut down as soon as possible.
That bout of total irrationality and panicked decision-making is now going to cost Germany a bundle, so estimates engineering giant Siemens AG here. Hat-tip Benny Peiser.
According to Reuters:
Germany’s exit from nuclear power could cost the country as much as 1.7 trillion  euros ($2.15 trillion) by 2030, or two thirds of the country’s GDP in 2011,  according to Siemens (SIEGn.DE),  which built all of Germany’s 17 nuclear plants.”
If that does not bankrupt something, nothing will. Germany wants to switch over to renewable energy. How much will that impact global temperatures? A few hundreths of a degree?
The estimate from Siemens makes some assumptions. Reuters writes:
The estimate of 1.7 trillion euros assumes strong expansion of renewables, with feed-in tariffs as the biggest chunk of costs. The cost would be lower — at about 1.4 billion euros — if gas was one of the major energy alternatives, Suess said.

The estimates given by Siemens factor in feed-in tariffs — costs that utilities have to pay to generators of renewable energy — investments into power transmission and distribution, operations and maintenance as well as technologies to store renewable energy and carbon dioxide.”
Siemens’ estimate is much higher than the 250-300 billion euros estimate given earlier by power plant executives. In the end, the price increase will be paid by the consumer, both private and business. This will hardly make Germany an attractive place to work (which is an activity that requires energy).
So it’s little wonder that businesses are calling it quits in Germany and moving to places that are more business friendly and energy is cheaper.
Don’t take my word for it. According to CO2 Handel here, comnpanies now see Germnany as a risk:
Rising energy and raw material prices are the top risks for Germany as a place to do business. Also 58% of companies fear that power outages. Since switching off 8 nuclear power reactors, power plants are have to switch on and off faster than ever before.”

A quite recent headline in our news warned that “Regions must brace for weather extremes: UN climate panel”. Apparently this will be the after-effect of global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gases. We can expect more frequent extreme events such as the drought in Texas and the Thailand floods because of global warming, they said.
Figure 1
 
It is strange that the IPCC panel should link recent extreme weather events to global warming because quite simply there has been no global warming to speak of for 10-15 years now based on the official climate data from the governments of the world [US /NCDC, ENVIRONMENT CANADA and THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY. Recently US meteorologist Anthony Watts showed that the continental U.S. has not warmed in the last 10 years, and in fact has grown cooler in the summer and colder in the winter. The climate data numbers come from the National Climatic Data Center.
Not only have the US temperatures been flat for the last 10-15 years, but a similar pattern is happening in Canada. The Canadian national annual, summer and winter temperature departures from the 1961-1990 averages have been flat for 10-14 years when measured on Excel linear trend and based on Environment Canada’s own data. Comparing today’s winter temperature departure with that of the period 1961-1990 can be misleading since the 1961-1990 period was low or cool phase of the planet’s 60 year cycle and any comparison will always show warming not due to man generated global warming, but due to natural and regular changes (30 years of cooler weather followed by 30 years of warmer weather) in the planets climate pattern. It is like comparing summer temperatures with winter temperatures, the summer will always show warming.
Regionally 7 of the 11 regions reported by Environment Canada showed declining or flat winter temperature departures over the last 10 years. The average winter departure was about 2°C between 1998-2011. Only the Atlantic Coast, Northeastern Forests and Arctic Tundra, Mountains, and Fiords showed rising winter temperature departures. But the North Atlantic Ocean heat content is dropping and so is the Arctic Ocean’s heat content.
The Northern Hemisphere, North Atlantic, North Pacific and East Pacific SST Anomalies are all dropping. It will not be long before the Atlantic Coast and the Arctic regions will show similar cooling as the AMO goes cool or negative. North America is more likely see much cold weather during the next 20-30 years rather than global warming of 3-6°C as predicted by the IPCC. The recent severe winter weather along Alaska and the US east coast was just a sample of what may lie ahead. This cooling has been building for a decade now. So how can global warming be causing current and future extreme weather events when global warming as predicted has not been happening for a decade and is unlikely to happen during the next 30 years since the world 60-year climate cycle is heading for colder weather due to changing ocean surface temperatures and changes in deep ocean currents?
Ocean SST as measured by PDO, AMO, ocean heat content and ENSO cycles and pressure changes as measured by AO and NAO are all pointing to a future cooling planet. AMO has gone negative in November 2011 for the first time since early 2009. Time will tell whether this is just the normal seasonal dip or a long-term pattern. This cooler AMO, if sustained through the winter, could signify cooler weather for the US east coast and Western Europe. Several severe storms have already happened this fall on both sides of the Atlantic.
Here are two web references to support the above evidence of global cooling in North America: http://wattsupwiththat.com and http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs.
So why are we pouring all this taxpayers money to solve a the non-existing problem as currently defined when the world is near financial collapse and there are so many more pressing problems in our world today? Any prudent leader should see we need to change our priorities.
Further evidence of global cooling 
The five following graphs illustrate the lack of global warming in US and Canada.

North American snow extent as reported by Rutgers University 
The North American snow extent has been increasing for 5 years in a row since the Pacific Ocean SST pattern started to show cooler water as measured by PDO. Already the 2011-2012 winter snow extent is greater than that of 2010-2011 winter by some 60% by week 45. Snow extent levels are approaching the record levels of the late 1970s.

Canadian winter, summer and annual temperature departures from 1961-1990. Averages for the years 1998 -2011
The annual trend of the departures as shown below indicates a flat or slightly cooling trend, and not global warming at all. Yes they fluctuate but that does not mean the trend is warming.

The winter cooling is especially apparent in the Canadian bread basket, namely the Prairie Provinces and their north half or the Northwestern Forests. Environment Canada reports in their Trend, Extremes and Current Season Ranking, 1948-2011[64 years] that the warming trend in these areas is 3.2 and 3.7 degrees C over the last 64 years. What is far more meaningful and not stated in their bulletins is that this area has been cooling for 10 years and very rapidly since 2006. The winter temperature departures dropped some 7°C between 2006 and 2009 alone and have been below or at the 1961-1990 averages for the last 3-4 years (see below). No wonder we are having all the spring floods from the extra melting snow in this area.
The cold winters are likely to continue and so are the floods for the next 20-30 years as the 60 year planetary climate cycle goes into its cold phase. We are having the winters like the previous cold cycle 30 years ago. Yet Environment Canada only talks about continuing global warming . on their web page. There is absolutely nothing about possible global cooling or warning to the Canadian public and businesses about possible flooding again, crop losses, infrastructure disruptions, etc from the pending weather.

PDO 
In November, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO dropped to its lowest level since 1961 at -2.33. The 1961 level was -2.69. PDO  is an after effect of the ENSO signal and reflects a spatial pattern of the amount of cooler water in the north Pacific. Negative levels are accompanied by much cooler weather in the Northern Hemisphere especially in North America. This index started to go negative in 2007 and based on historical patterns, it could be negative for the next 20-30 years, signifying cooler weather for the same period. This has already been apparent the last four years in the North American weather – especially the winters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how greeny two-shoes EU thought it could implement the EU Directive requiring all airlines that start or land in Europe to participate in its costly emissions trading scheme beginning in 2012  – all to rescue the planet?
EU airline emissions directive meets reality. (Photo credit: NASA)
In the system greenhouse gas emissions would have a price and the airlines would have to buy emissions permits. And the EU meant business. Any airline that refused to play along with its let’s-pretend-to-rescue-the-planet-game would be restricted from flying to and from Europe. Yes, it was time to tell the rest of the world how to behave and to bow to its demands.
Well, reality has a way of catching up with obscene and absurd green ideas. In this case it isn’t taking long.
Today the German CO2 Handel.de reports here that the EU has decided to back off.  Hey, we were just kidding. The EU will now accept pledges from countries to cut emisions at home. Yeah, we know what that’s worth. It needs to be pointed out that airlines in EU countries can forget about getting out of buying certificates…it appears the concessions are for non-EU airlines only.
Gee, I wonder why the tune is changing. According to CO2 Handel:

There was massive resistance from outside. More than 20 countries, among them Russia, India, Brazil, China and USA, threatened to revoke landing and air space rights for European airlines if the EU stuck to its plan. Behind the scenes, China warned that it could cancel billions of euros in orders for French and German Airbus planes.”
Well hey, maybe climate is not really that serious after all. A promise to cut somewhere else will do.
Humiliated, EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard sent out her spokesman to deliver the message on Thursday in Brussels:
We’re flexible.”
Economics and reality have a way of focussing the mind, don’t they?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes I don’t know whether to sympathize with the protesters, or to tell them “I told ya so, stupid”. This industrialization of Vermont’s landscape is happening because these environmentalists originally spurred it all on with their ridiculous protect-the-climate nonsense, led by kook, dimwit senators like Bernie Sanders.

This is Green Energy? Let’s call it the Bernie Sanders Environmental Rescue Reserve.
Now the protesters are horrified at the consequences of their earlier stupidity and climate folly. Vermont has already ruined the Sheffield heights ridgeline, and now they are busily doing the same to the ridgeline of the Lowell Mountains, both are just a few miles from my boyhood home.
The protest is small but gathering in size and momentum. But I’m afraid it’s all a little too late though. You just don’t spend millions in planning, permitting and site preparation only to abandon the project. It’s definitely going to happen. At this point all we can hope for is that it’ll put the brakes on the other landscape desecration projects slated for elsewhere. I know the next time I’ll be driving there I’ll be seeing a massive industrial complex where once a beautiful mountain ridgeline once stood.
Sure you get more wind on a mountain-top. But I know the climate of Northern Vermont, and it aint that windy. Nobody can honestly say that they are going to reach anywhere near 20% capacity for these 450-foot windmills. There just isn’t that much wind there – look at the video. See any wind?
What’s really stupid is that 95% of Vermont’s energy was CO2-free to begin with. But who cares, let’s blast the mountain tops off and industrialize them, and pretend we’ve rescued the planet like real heroes.
As far as the protesters are concerned, I have to wish them the best of luck. I encourage them to do whatever it takes to stop this true environmental crime now taking place in Lowell. I’d trespass in a minute if I were there. James Hansen and Greenpeace do it all the time; get right in their faces. If the law fails, then you have to force it until it works again. I’m not advocating violence, just a peaceful protest. Readers ought to donate whatever they can, at least write a message of support. What’s happening here is not law, it’s the law selling out.
The protesters have started a blog, and updates are being provided. http://lowellmountainsnews.wordpress.com/
I really don’t want to write about this – it’s just too difficult.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a snippet from a CFACT news conference in Durban I find quite amusing.
Some British-accented girlie-guy, tree-hugger warmist ocean acidist (Felix von Geyer, Platts Emissions Daily) demands to know “who-the-hell” funds CFACT, and that CFACT comment on ocean acidification.
Lord Monckton gives the yuppie retread more of an education in 2 minutes than he probably ever got during all his years as an undergraduate student.
You can watch the entire CFACT press conference here.
You can watch the entire CFACT press conference here.
I wonder if von Geyer is ever going to realize what a fool he made himself out to be. The guy could have spared himself all the embarassment had he just changed his tone a bit and his words. But oh no. he had to come in there, filled to the nose with arrogance and conceit, and act like he has to lecture everyone else.
Some advice: If you’re a pathetically ignorant soul on a particular subject, then it is a good idea not to run around a pretending to be informed. People see right through it.  In this case we got a full body scan of von Geyer.
Worse, for the students, the guy teaches at Concordia University, Department of Political Science, in Montreal (when he isn’t busy globe-trotting). They’re going to learn from this guy?
If von Geyer’s question signfies anything, it is that the movement has abandoned CO2 gas and has now moved on to Co2 acid.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome of you may be wondering what happened to the video clip of Prof. Dronskowski which I had put up 2 days ago. This video was first put up by our friends at Science Skeptical here.
Unfortunately some Green thugs are still unable to learn tolerance and the lessons of history, and felt they had to threaten and harrass “thought criminals” who dare to question the Greens’ uncompromising vision of the future. Rudolf Kipp, who runs the Science Skeptical blog, had to take the video down. He left his reason as a reader comment (emphasis added):
For those of you who wonder where the video has gone. Remember, this is still Germany. We tolerate everyone’s right to free speech, so long as he shares our opinion…I have put the video off-line since the lecturer has been molested by mails and defamation and has received anonymous phone calls in private and his family has been affected as well.”
For those of you inclined to dissent, let Dronskowski be an example to you. Keep marching in lockstep – don’t ask questions, or else.
This is not the Germany I’ve come to know over the last 20+ years. I wonder what is becoming of the country. Dissenters are being labelled criminals. Professors can no longer speak up. Who can remember the last time this was so?
My view is that these green thugs are hardly different than the brown crap who allegedly murdered a number of Turks whose only crime was to dare to live a different culture in Germany. Germany’s intelligence services sat on their thumbs, not taking the threat seriously, read here. Obviously they are also not taking the threat of the greenshirts seriously either.
And some say we are living in an age of enlightenment. Well, all this is starting to enlighten me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman scientists have made a spectacular find. Near the Bavarian city of Augsburg they found a 14-million year old fossil of a python.
What’s interesting is that pythons like very warm, tropical weather, and not the cool, crappy stuff Germany has to offer. That means Germany (Central Europe) had to have been a balmy place 15 million years ago. In fact it was about 10°C warmer than it is today, the fossil indicates. German scientists published a paper in the journal Geodiversitas (DOI: 10.5252/g2011n3a2), which the online Frankfurter Rundschau here reports on. The FR writes:
Never before has such a find been discovered this far north. The remains give us clues on the climate back then.
Because pythons prefer warmer temperatures, today they live in the tropical regions of Asia and Africa. About 15 million years ago the predecessors of the today’s giant snakes also felt at home in Germany.”
How warm was it 15 million years ago in Germany? The Frankfurter Rundschau quotes the leader of the study, Madeleine Böhme of the University of Tübingen:

We gather that temperatures had an average of 19°C, otherwise the snakes would not have felt comfortable here.“
Currently the average annual temperature for Augsburg is about 8°C. So why did the pythons disappear? Climate change, says the Frankfurter Rundschau.
Climate change did the pythons’ ancestors in.
In any case the giant snakes found optimum living conditions in Germany for only a very short time, the scientists write. After the warm-subtropical temperatures of 14 million years ago, it got cooler and drier.”
So much for the claim the planet only changes when man lives on it.

"On Monday, the activist group Extinction Rebellion will begin a week of global protests. In Brisbane, home to the grassroots organisation’s first Australian chapter, activists are preparing to stage protests around the city. At the group’s headquarters in Woolloongabba, a busy training schedule is under way. It is hosting introductory sessions at local libraries planning two large-scale marches, with a litany of other “non-violent disruptive actions”.  Since the group conducted its first action in Australia in April, there have been more than 170 arrests, with penalties ranging from a warning to a $1,500 fine. When new laws designed to target the tactics used by Extinction Rebellion pass parliament, those penalties will escalate. The use of a purpose-designed “dangerous attachment device to disrupt lawful activities”, referring to the Extinction Rebellion tactic of locking on to railways and roads, will attract a $6,500 fine or two years’ imprisonment. Peaceful protest, the Queensland government says, is only acceptable if it does not disrupt people going about their ordinary business. But disruption is the point. “We are using civil disobedience to cause economic disruption and a disruption to business as usual,” Extinction Rebellion south-east Queensland member Emma Dorge says. “Without disruption, our voices are not being heard.” She is not deterred by harsher penalties. “We are fighting against extinction,” she says. “People are doing what’s necessary in the face of complete inaction from governments on climate change.” Queensland has proposed two new amendments this year designed to clamp down on protests: increased trespass penalties aimed at animal welfare protests, currently going through a parliamentary committee, and the lock-on laws. It has also introduced biosecurity regulations with on-the-spot fines for entering an agricultural premises. New South Wales has also introduced new $1,000 on-the-spot penalties through biosecurity regulations and is considering draft laws with broad new trespass penalties. When the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, was opposition leader in 2016, he ceremonially ripped up anti-protest laws proposed by his predecessor, but his government has also said it will increase penalties for trespass. The reforms are aimed at animal welfare protesters described by the attorney general as “mushy-headed vegans”. Victoria is holding a parliamentary inquiry to determine if it ought to strengthen trespass laws, following uproar about a $1 fine levied against an activist who stole a goat from a Gippsland cheese cafe. The Law Institute of Victoria has suggested the government instead introduce laws promoting greater transparency in the agriculture industry. Tasmania, still bruised from a 2017 high court decision that struck down its anti-protest laws, is working on amended legislation to reintroduce the laws. That high court ruling – that environmental protests are political and protected under the constitutional implied freedom of political communication – could potentially apply to Queensland and NSW laws as proposed. “When we see the positioning that’s been coming out of the government we tend to look at it through two filters,” the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders, says. “One is: is what they are proposing actually legal? And secondly, what are they trying to achieve politically?” The NSW Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian, says the NSW legislation is framed as a narrow provision supporting farmers but could actually work against their interests by penalising almost all protest actions. Farmers have been heavily involved in environmental protests in Australia, particularly against coal seam gas. The Bentley Blockade, a seven-year protest in the Northern Rivers region which successfully halted gas exploration and is cited as inspiration by Dorge and other Extinction Rebellion members as an example of successful activism, was underpinned by farmers. And when more than 300,000 people join climate strikes around Australia, can protesting still be considered a fringe activity? “There is a culture war going on that is trying to pit those people that care about the environment against other people, and I think that’s incredibly worrying,” Gambian says. Take these comments from Peter Dutton. “People should take these names, and the photos of these people, and distribute them as far and wide as we can so that we shame these people,” said the home affairs minister in his regular spot on Sydney’s 2GB radio. “Let their families know what you think of their behaviour … We should push back on it because these people are a scourge, they are doing the wrong thing. If you want to protest, do it peacefully.” In this context, “peaceful” can be taken to mean “unobtrusive”. Dutton also suggested protesters should face mandatory minimum sentences and murmured support for host Ray Hadley’s suggestion that the welfare payments of protesters be restricted. In the world of talkback radio, the Venn diagram of ordinary working Australians and people who protest are two circles that never meet. Reality has more overlap. Gambian is a spokesperson for a loose coalition of environment groups, Unions NSW and legal groups that have banded together to oppose the proposed NSW anti-protest laws, which would result in protesters facing fines of up to $22,000. A similar coalition of 80 organisations, from unions to religious groups, staved off the most recent anti-protest laws in WA and is waiting to see the draft of the new proposed laws. “It was a matter that brought together a really broad cross-section of society,” Perth-based public advocacy lawyer Kate Davis says. “I don’t think any laws that are targeted at restricting the right to protest have a place in our democracy.” The proposed NSW laws, like new federal laws passed in August, are targeted at “farm invasion” protests from animal activists who have targeted abattoirs, factory farming operations and family-run farms in the past 18-months. They make use of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act and are “breathtakingly broad,” says Gambian, and would capture protests on environmental grounds, including anti-mining protests. That act was amended in 2016 to introduce a $5,500 penalty for aggravated unlawful entry to enclosed lands. It was up for review next month, but that review has now been superseded by the proposed Right to Farm Bill. The proposed amendments would increase the penalty for aggravated trespass to $13,200 or 12 months’ jail. If a person was accompanied by two or more other people, or taken to be interfering with the conduct of the business, they would face a $22,000 fine or three years’ jail. “Enclosed land is any land that has a fence around it,” Gambian says. “Including a temporary fence. Including a temporary fence erected while the protest is going on.” It includes public land, such as state parliament. Emily Howie, legal director for the Human Rights Law Centre, says the proposed laws could run afoul of the same constitutional provisions that allowed the former Greens leader Bob Brown to win his high court challenge against the Tasmanian anti-protest laws. If the laws were found to be denying Australians their constitutional freedom to talk about things that are politically important, Howie says, they could be found to be invalid. Moves by governments to protect businesses from disruption are legitimate, Howie says, but they must be “reasonable and proportionate”. “The last thing that we want is for laws that are meant to be protecting business to in fact be deterring people from engaging in peaceful and lawful protest and our concern about this bill in New South Wales is that is exactly what it does,” she says."
"Australia’s central bank has delivered a clear warning that climate change is exposing financial institutions and the financial system more broadly to risks that will rise over time if action isn’t taken. The RBA’s financial stability review, released Friday, concluded that while climate change is not yet a significant threat to financial stability in Australia, it is becoming increasingly important for investors and institutions to actively manage carbon risk.  The bank notes Australian insurers are the most directly exposed to the physical impacts of climate change, and points out that inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters this decade are more than twice what they were in the previous 10 years. It notes “this impact is likely to grow over time”. “An increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters will increase the incidence of damage to, or destruction of, physical assets that are insured or used as collateral,” the RBA said. “Assets that are exposed to increasing physical risk – such as property located in bushfire-prone or coastal areas – could decline in value, particularly if these risks become uninsurable. “Climate change could also reduce certain types of business income that is used to service loans. Examples include changing rainfall patterns that result in lower or less predictable income from agriculture, more frequent storms disrupting supply chains and therefore sales, and damage to natural assets that reduces tourism income.” The RBA says banks and other lending institutions are also exposed to physical risks because climate change can result in a decline in the income or value of collateral that they are lending against. It says Australian financial institutions that have exposure to carbon-intensive industries – such as power generation and mining, or to energy-intensive firms – “will also be exposed to transition risk”. “Transition risk will be greatest for banks that lend to firms in carbon-intensive industries and to individuals or businesses that are reliant on these firms,” the bank said. “Other financial institutions investing in carbon-intensive industries, such as superannuation and investment funds, are also exposed to the risk that climate change will diminish the value of their investments. This could occur both through direct investments in carbon-intensive industries, or indirect investments in banks that lend to these industries”. It warns financial institutions “also face reputational damage if they are seen to be contributing to climate change or failing to manage climate risks”. The RBA concludes that climate change poses a clear systemic risk, but it is not yet an imminent threat to financial stability. But it warns this could change. “Climate change could emerge as a risk to financial stability if it is not properly managed, or if the size of climate-related losses increased materially. “Rising climate-related losses could also erode confidence in an institution or the financial system, leading to a withdrawal of funding. This would be more likely if the physical impacts of climate change are more severe or occur sooner than currently projected, or if the transition to a low-carbon economy occurs in a disruptive and costly manner.” The RBA notes that both the banking regulator Apra and the corporate watchdog Asic have become proactive in managing carbon risk, and the Council of Financial Regulators has established a working group on the financial implications of climate change to help coordinate agencies’ actions. Friday’s analysis builds on a warning by the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, who said in March climate change posed risks to Australia’s financial stability. Debelle said policymakers needed to consider warming as a trend and not a cyclical event. He said policymakers and businesses needed to “think in terms of trend rather than cycles in the weather”. “Droughts have generally been regarded, at least economically, as cyclical events that recur every so often. In contrast, climate change is a trend change. The impact of a trend is ongoing, whereas a cycle is temporary.” The deputy governor said there was a need to reassess the frequency of climate change events, and “our assumptions about the severity and longevity of the climatic events”. In March, Apra flagged an intention to increase scrutiny of how banks, insurers and superannuation trustees are managing the financial risks of climate change to their businesses. Last year Asic said climate change was “a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries” and warned directors and management of listed companies “to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks including climate risk that may affect the company’s business”. In that same assessment by the corporate watchdog, 17% of listed companies in the Asic sample identified climate risk as a material risk in their operating and financial reviews. The RBA noted on Friday, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it will take significant effort to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as targeted in the Paris agreement. “Even if targets are met, this level of warming is likely to be accompanied by rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather including storms, heatwaves and droughts,” it said. “Some of these outcomes are already apparent. These changes will create both financial and macroeconomic risks”."

From Steven Goddard, sea level rise drop.

Der Spiegel reports today how the UN has just come out with a new report claiming the big threat now is local heat waves and freak storms.
That’s quite a change from global-wide warming and sea level rise.

Remember how for years and years UN scientists, armed with their mighty models, warned the planet faced massive hurricanes, rapid sea level rise and global-wide warming? Funny how we’ve been hearing very little about that lately. We’ve gone from “global warming” to “spot heating” with local storms sprinkled in.
Maybe the change in narrative has something to do with the hard statistics showing no real hurricanes hitting the USA in over 3 years or so. In fact it’s been yet another year with not a hurricane hitting the coast. Indeed tropical cyclone activity looks everything but out of control, and has been taming big time for 20 years! See: Ryan Maue. Can’t dupe the public with that anymore.
Even worse (if you’re an alarmist) is that sea levels are dropping! See Steve Goddard’s site here. They’ve been showing a declining trend over the last couple years. Oh dear! oh dear! The models never predicted that.

These disappearing horrors, once their favorites, have turned into shock and awe over the warmist camp. It’s panic time for them. How on Earth are they now supposed to spread fear and panic when all their old horror scenarios are dissolving before their very eyes?
The answer of course is to trot out new ones, this time they’re using horrors where the statistics are incomplete, thus making it difficult to disprove alleged increasing trends. Not only that, their models have suddenly begun to show they’re coming! And we all know how flawless their models are.
Der Spiegel reports today on how a new UN study has now just come up with local extreme heat waves as the next man-made climate disaster. It’s perfect – man-made heat waves are now lurking somewhere out there, waiting to pounce on unsuspecting regions and fry unprepared citizens. It could happen anywhere, and you may be next! The UN cites Russia and Texas as compelling evidence. Also waiting to ambush locally are storms and flash floods, so says the UN.
But even Der Spiegel is not so convinced and adds:
This year other studies show no increase in weather extremes: Winter storms in the northern hemisphere have been trending less, report scientists in the magazine ‘Tellus’. The same goes for river flooding in USA. That US rivers are being influenced by man-made climate change cannot be discerned, the US Geological Service summed up in October.”
Global sea level rise and global-scale warming are obviously dead. Looks like a tough road ahead for warmists and their desperate efforts to keep the climate Halloween party going.

"It is heartening to read that arts organisations are choosing to sever their links with fossil fuel companies following public pressure (National to cut ties with Shell as theatres bow to pressure on climate action, 5 October; RSC bows to pressure from climate crisis protest by cutting short BP sponsorship, 3 October). Of course, similar ethical choices had to be made in the past regarding financial support from tobacco companies. Thankfully that was long ago consigned to history. But was it? In fact, the London Symphony Orchestra still receives sponsorship from British American Tobacco. The LSO, like the NT and RSC, takes its work with schools and young people seriously, and it is therefore unfortunate that the orchestra retains this anachronistic relationship.

"A majority of Australians believe Scott Morrison was wrong to snub the United Nations climate summit while on a high-profile visit to the US, but have otherwise backed the prime minister’s handling of the relationship with Donald Trump. The latest Guardian Essential poll, taken in the wake of Morrison’s trip to the US last week, shows that most Australians believe it is important for the prime minister to have a good relationship with the US president, “whoever they might be” for the good of the nation.  While 15% of people disagreed with the statement, 77% agreed, with men and Liberal voters most likely to back a strong relationship. The survey of 1,097 people was taken before Tuesday’s revelation that Australia had agreed to help investigate the genesis of the Mueller inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which Trump has suggested was a “hoax” to bring him down. But while 57% of those surveyed agreed that Morrison had shown “good diplomacy skills” during his official visit to US, 70% said that he should have joined other world leaders in attending the UN climate summit in New York, which was attended by foreign affairs minister Marise Payne rather than Morrison. About 40% of people strongly agreed that Morrison should have fronted up to the climate summit, with a further 31% saying they somewhat agreed. A breakdown of voting intentions of those who believed the prime minister should have attended the summit – where Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered an impassioned speech to world leaders – shows that 78% of Labor voters thought he should have shown up, compared with 64% of Coalition voters. Morrison defended Australia’s record on climate change at a separate speech to the UN, but observers at the summit said his failure to attend despite being in the US had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Voters were also asked whether a good relationship between Morrison and Trump “reflects badly” on Australia, a sentiment that 38% of people agreed with, with 48% disagreeing. Greens voters were most likely to be critical of the relationship forged between Morrison and Trump, with 60% saying it was a bad look, compared with 27% of Coalition voters and 48% of Labor voters. But while most people were supportive of the US alliance and Morrison’s handling of Trump, just 32% believe his presidency, which has sparked global geopolitical uncertainty, has been good for Australia, with 49% of people disagreeing. Australia’s recent decision to assist the US in the Strait of Hormuz, in what it said would be “modest, meaningful and time-limited” commitment, was supported by 51% of those surveyed and opposed by 35%. But more people were concerned (57%) that the engagement could plunge Australia into another conflict in the near future as a result. Liberal voters were more supportive of Australia’s engagement in the Middle East and less concerned about future conflict in the region. The Essential poll also gauged voter sentiment on the state of the Australian economy ahead of Tuesday’s decision by the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates to a record low 0.75%. Views were mixed, with an equal third believing the economy was in a good state (32%), poor state (33%) or neither good nor poor (32%). Compared with May last year, more people felt the economy was in a poor state, up nine percentage points and edging closer to the December 2016 high of 36%. Liberal voters were more likely to be positive in their assessment of the economy, with 45% saying it was in “very good” or “quite good” shape. When asked which indicators were most important in assessing the health of the economy, most people pointed to the unemployment rate, which increased to 5.3% in August from 5.2% in the previous month, as well as the cost of household bills. Half of those who think the national budget surplus is the best indicator for economic performance believe the economy is in a good shape, whereas those who look at household bills to gauge economic strength were the most pessimistic."
"Next week thousands of Extinction Rebellion protesters will descend on Westminster, the latest example of direct action in a year when committed women, men and children across the world have pushed climate change to the top of the global agenda, where it belongs. Although London will again be the focal point, the movement mustn’t overlook the committed activists in places such as Bolton, Wigan, and Sunderland who are also spreading the message across the country. For the climate movement to succeed we have to build a broad coalition that covers our nation’s towns as well as our cities, and reaches out across class divides. Calls for individual action can’t just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle-class city dwellers. Telling people to get out of their cars can’t be the solution in those parts of the country where decades of chronic underinvestment have left us without public transport. In towns such as Wigan, jobs have disappeared as investment flowed into cities, creating lengthy commutes on public transport for most working-age people. Trains are overcrowded, deeply unreliable and ceased to function entirely for a large part of last year, while the buses are few and far between, and often more expensive than getting a taxi. Demanding people abandon their cars isn’t realistic if the alternative is a round trip of 42 miles a day on foot or by bike, just to get to work. Campaigns to tackle climate change need to link up with campaigns for better transport and fairer funding for it, particularly for buses.  Rooting calls for action in the reality of people’s lives is essential if the battle against climate change is not to become a battle against each other. It is galling to be lectured on not eating meat when you and your family are struggling to get by and relying on help from friends and local food banks. It isn’t fair to ask families to forfeit the one foreign flight they have saved for all year, while we have global corporations whose business models rely on frequent air travel and governments that refuse to tax them for it. Climate activists must also rethink their language. Phrases such as “dirty coal” are profoundly condescending to communities in which generation after generation did dangerous, backbreaking work down the mines to build the country’s wealth and influence at great cost to themselves; pneumoconiosis victims are still fighting for justice decades after the mines closed. We are owed new clean energy jobs, and the infrastructure to create them. In Wigan and Barnsley, the desire for good jobs that provide a sense of purpose is palpable. Positive movements for change, such as the One Million Climate Jobs trade union campaign, provide an antidote to the stark warnings about climate scenarios that often leave people feeling powerless to act. We must not let the climate crisis become a further source of division in Britain. The last Labour government’s decision to load the cost of clean energy subsidies on to energy bills left the poorest people paying six times as much of their disposable income on energy bills as their wealthy counterparts. If climate change becomes a major cause of migration it may prove fertile ground for the far right looking to exploit disillusion in towns that have experienced rapid, relative decline. Instead, let’s seize this as an opportunity to rebuild our towns so they can play a major and significant part in our national story once again. Fighting for a better environment was always part of socialist tradition, as working-class people living among the smoke and soot of industry fought for parks, protection of the countryside, wildlife conservation, clean air and fresh water. The first Bolton Extinction Rebellion meeting saw people queueing out of the door on a hot summer evening, and I get more letters about the environment from my constituents than any other single issue. Building an environmentally sustainable future will require the talent, intellect and hard work of the whole of our society – so it’s time for the climate movement to break out of the cities to make itself a movement for the many, not just the few. • This is an abridged version of an essay in a special climate change edition of the latest HOPE not hate magazine. • Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan"

Global Cold Season Temperature Trend
by Ed Caryl
In Figure 1, the continents are cooling already. So are the oceans.

Figure 1 above depicts the NH cold season temperature trend over the last ten years. The global trend is zero! (the number in the top right corner). Source: GISS.
Figure 2 below depicts the oceans only. The NH cold season ocean surface cooled 0.04 degrees C in the last decade, or 0.4 degrees C per century.

So, where’s the warming? Wasn’t it supposed to result in warmer winters?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN just released its summary report on how we should all expect extreme heat in the future. Well forget all that.It’s all nonsense coming from unrealistic models that do not even take the cycles of the sun (source of 99.9% of the Earth’s surface heat) and cycles of the oceans (which cover 70+% of the Earth’s surface) into account. Garbage in, garbage out. Simple as that.
And a few days ago German climatologist Mojib Latif spewed out more nonsense, claiming Germany would soon experience Sahara-like summers – also based on the same completely bogus climate models that ignore 99.999% of the Earth’s energy systems (sun and oceans).
Alaska gets a taste of the ice age, -40°F in mid November!
Alaska is just the latest example of how glaringly deficient the models are. Not long ago the models said global warming was supposed to be especially pronounced up in the Arctic – in places like Alaska. Someone forgot to tell the climate that.
The following are excerpts from the newsminer.com (temperatures in degrees F).

Fairbanks, Alaska set a new low temperature record on Thursday the second time in three days with a temperature of 41 degrees below zero. That broke the old record of 39 below set in 1969. Fairbanks also set a new record of 35 below on Tuesday, and hit 39 below on Wednesday, two degrees shy of the record. The last time Fairbanks saw 40-below temperatures in November was in 1994, when temperatures of 45, 43 and 45 below were recorded on Nov. 24, 25 and 30, respectively.
“This sort of thing is certainly more common in December and January than November,” meteorologist Dan Hancock at the National Weather Service in Fairbanks said. “We can go through an entire winter and not get this cold.”
Several record low temperatures set more than 40 years ago were broken in the Fairbanks area. Eielson Air Force Base had a low of 43 below early Thursday morning, which broke the previous record of 40 below in 1969. It was the second day in a row a new record was set at Eielson. It was 42 below there on Wednesday morning.
The coldest temperature reported Thursday morning was a record 54 below in Manley Hot Springs. A temperature of 49 below was recorded at KNJP radio station in North Pole, also a record. Thursday morning saw lows of 46 below in Fort Yukon, 45 below in Nikolai, 42 below in Nenana and Tanana and 40 below at Bettles.
Worse, there’s a chance even colder air could move in early next week. How cold it gets will depend on how much cloud cover there is. Meteorologist Julie Malingowski said. “If it does clear out, we’re doomed.” …read all about it here!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports today that scientists have identified soot (black carbon) as one of the major global warmers out there.
According to Science Journal here, a team of 24 experts led by NASA scientist Drew Shindell looked at 400 emission control measures and identified 14 measures targeting methane and black carbon (BC) emissions that would reduce projected global mean warming.
Source: http://atmoz.org/blog/2007/06/12/global-melting-big-thaw/
Recently scientists and activists have been frustrated by the slow progress and dogged reluctance by countries to cap CO2 emissions, which are thought to be causing global warming. So Shindell looked for alternative ways to avert warming. Suddenly, lo and behold, soot (BC) and methane have emerged as major global warming factors. The amount they admit soot and methane contribute to warming is in my view astonishing.  The abstract states (emphasis added):
We considered ~400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming ~0.5°C by 2050.”
This equals the total amount of warming we’ve seen in the last 40 years!
Now scientists are telling us that soot and methane will have the same effect that CO2 is claimed to have had over the last 40 years? Whatever happened to the assertion that man-made CO2 has caused 95% of the warming over the last decades? Obviously CO2 as a driver is seriously getting cut down to size. Throw in the emerging solar effects and there isn’t much left for poor old CO2.

The abstract continues:
This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at $700 to $5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs (less than $250). The selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide–reduction measures. Implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2°C threshold.”
No need to worry any longer about a doubling of CO2 concentrations. Indeed CO2 as a driver and its hypothesized positive feedbacks simply aren’t materializing. We haven’t seen any warming in 15 years. Now scientists are realizing that soot is a big league player.
Der Spiegel writes:
About 3 billion people prepare their meals over open fires that burn wood, dung or coal, and thus emit huge amounts of soot. However attempts to get people in Africa and Asia to get interested in other cooking devices have often proven to be difficult.
Of course it has been difficult. When idiot bureaucrats attempt (and are successful) to slow down progress, people remain poor and all they have left to burn is wood. But if they promote growth, free markets and development so that poor countries can attain western standards of living, then they will be able to afford to burn cleaner fuels like gas and oil. And if someday they should get really rich, they too will be able to afford wind and solar energy.

"Hallam was arrested in 2017 for criminal damage when he and another person spray-painted “Divest from oil and gas”, “Now” and “Out of time” on walls at King’s College London, using water-soluble chalk-based paint. Both were cleared of all charges by a jury in 2019 after they defended their actions as being a proportionate response to the climate crisis. People joining Extinction Rebellion (XR) are trained in how to conduct themselves peacefully when participating in direct action. According to Hallam, direct action has several aims and objectives. One is to cause disruption and financial costs to the state to build pressure for political change. Another is for individuals to show their commitment – that they are willing to sacrifice their liberty for the cause. Increased disruption and more people arrested creates a bigger impact. The training explains the possible legal implications of getting arrested. Once people have been informed about this, it is up to them to decide if they are willing to get arrested or not. If they sign up, they become part of the growing list of arrestables.  “I got to London and joined the rebellion at lunchtime Thursday [during protests in April], and I was looking for my affinity group in Oxford Circus by the pink boat when I saw a guy I know from Bristol. I told him, ‘I have just arrived and I am willing to be arrested.’ “A police officer behind me heard me say that and he tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘I think I can arrange that. Are you aware this is a section 14? Please leave the area. I am officially asking you to move away or I will have to arrest you.’ “I told him I was not going anywhere and he then read a caution and my rights. I sat down to make clear I was not moving. He was on his own so he had to go away to get more police and came back after a while with three colleagues who picked me up and carried me away. There was a lot of clapping and cheering as they carried me down the road to the van. We were four in the van and they took us to West End Central where there was a long queue of people waiting to get processed. “I was then searched and had my fingerprints and DNA taken, and was put in a cell. Everyone was very nice and polite and at 9pm I was given a toothbrush and paste and was fed twice, vegetarian food. The cell was very bright so I had to pull the blanket over my face to get some sleep and I read a detective novel given to me by the custody officer. I was let out at 2pm. “I feel my time is running out and the world’s time is running out and what energy I have got left I will spend on fighting climate change, not just for my children and grandchildren but also for the non-human world.  “I am very happy to be able to use my privilege as a white elderly woman this way and I will be back in London in October.” Radford was charged under section 14 and was given a conditional discharge with a £70 fine.  In February,  Osborn, who is also a city councillor and press officer for a Green MEP, and eight other XR activists walked into the county council chamber in Norwich. Osborn says he felt peaceful direct action was the only way to stop a proposed new road, the Norwich Western Link. For four hours, the activists sang and stood arm in arm wearing T-shirts that read: “NCC guilty of ecocide – care not cars.” The councillors first asked them to leave, then switched the lights off and left, pretending the meeting was over, and later played Rule Britannia through loudspeakers to drown out the singing. Osborn was arrested and charged. He accepted a caution and was released without further action. His conviction was later quashed. “I just want to take action that is more commensurate with the seriousness of the situation we are in,” says Jarman, who has been arrested seven times. “I want to know I have done everything I can – when you are in a police cell, you know there is nothing more you can do but pray. And you then have plenty of time to do that.”  “Civil disobedience seems the only moral choice. When the laws and policies of the land are actively destroying what God has made and my children’s future, when ordinary campaigning has failed, when all we need to do to allow climate breakdown is for everyone to carry on their lawful daily business, civil disobedience seems the only moral choice. “The theory shows you need arrests, you need people prepared to go to prison – someone has to be those people. Why shouldn’t I be one of them?” Parfitt was arrested in April at Oxford Circus. “I was very well treated during my arrest,” she says. “Being part of XR I realised being elderly is a great privilege and we have to offer ourselves as arrestables and be on the frontline. We get our pensions and have no jobs or careers to worry about. “The moment when you become most vulnerable, putting yourself in the hands of the state, is when you have most power.” Parfitt is not aware of any court summons and is planning to take part in this week’s action in London. “It was on the last day of the occupation of Waterloo Bridge during the international rebellion in April … we listened to a Brazilian indigenous woman speaking about how she and her fellow activists in the Amazon faced violence and death in their struggles.  I felt the need to stand with her in solidarity and was inspired by all the women around me on the bridge, so later as the police were clearing the road I decided to join in and stand my ground, refusing to move on.  “I was with my husband and we had decided only one of us should be arrested, so he was with me but on the pavement, and he waved goodbye. I was arrested at 8.30pm and held in custody for 21 hours. I tried not to make too much fuss, apologised to the police for taking up their time and made a ‘non-comment’ interview. I still do believe I did the right thing in the light of what we are facing, and when I was in court I read out a prepared statement on that which got me a round of applause.” Lindo was was fined £100 and given a conditional discharge. Kingston was arrested for his part in a protest disrupting the DLR at Canary Wharf in April. “It’s really very hard for many elders to break the law, because of the culture we have been brought up in – unlike younger people now,” he says. “The things I do, I do for my grandchildren and other lifeforms and future generations. Whatever the future situation, I hope we will learn to live a very different way of life to what we have learned under capitalism.” Kingston is facing a crown court trial in early 2020. “I was standing alone on the pavement near Parliament Square outside the supreme court building,” says Goodchild. “I wanted to test the law. I was approached by two police officers. The male officer suggested I go to Marble Arch, ‘where I could have fun’, or words to that effect. I felt this advice to be insulting, because I was protesting against something seriously dangerous: the UK government’s lack of action against climate change. “I replied: ‘Three hundred of my colleagues have been arrested already – why should I be any different?’ “One of the officers patted me down and found an open pin badge in one of my pockets, which was her reason for handcuffing me.  “After a night in a cold cell with noisy ventilation I had fingerprints, photos and DNA taken for processing and was then released with a letter saying I was under investigation. The police have sent me an invitation for interview. I’ve ignored it, but they’ve taken no further action.” Goodchild has since been given a nine-month suspended sentence and must pay a total of £640 in costs. Raven was arrested in April in Parliament Square. “I had slept overnight on the roadblock we had created across Parliament Street with about seven students from UEA and Leeds, as well as the guy who had been up the tree,” she says. “We knew the police were intent on clearing all the road obstructions, and had cleared the one closest to the Houses of Parliament the previous evening . It had been a highly moving experience. The police were visibly moved by the singing, cheering, and peaceful supportive conduct of all present. “The students were already lying together linked by hands in a metal tube, another had glued his hand to the outside of the tube. I said I would like to join them, lay down and glued my right hand to the other end of the tube. A legal observer was present. “I was told that my hand was going to be unstuck by a special PC who used acetone and a soft toothbrush. He did this very gently, finger by finger and then the palm, releasing my hand. “Four officers organised themselves to carry me. I was totally limp. They had to put me down twice before they got to the police van. They were careful and gentle. “I can’t fault the police in their handling of the situation; I hope their exposure to peaceful protest has gone deeper than their uniforms. Nor can I praise XR enough for providing such a supportive, caring network for all arrestees and for modelling a different way of doing things so well. “I was thanked so many times by complete strangers for being arrested. I feel humbled by this, and glad that I have been able to use my freedom and privilege to act in a small way to stand up and be counted. My grandson calls me gangster gran.” Norton was arrested in November after a protest at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “I got into the lobby where I was arrested for spray-chalk painting six XR symbols on the glass walls,” he says. “I got in at 1.30pm and was arrested and taken out at 6pm. I was taken to Charing Cross station where they asked me to fill in forms and when they saw my age they told me to go home. I was later officially charged by letter with damage to the tune of £5,000. “It was a long time after my arrest and two witnesses said the paint had been wiped off straight away so no damage was done. At the first court hearing we pleaded not guilty. We were then given a court date but our solicitor told us other defendants in a similar case had their case discontinued. A few days before we were due in court the CPS let us all know our case was dropped. “We have been called dangerous anarchists, but that is obviously not true. What we want is our government to do what is required to control the change in the climate for the safety and security of the country and the world at large.” Photograph: Tomm Morton/Extenction Rebellion Eastburn joined XR as she became increasingly concerned about the trajectory of the climate crisis and lack of action from the government. Until that point, she had never done anything similar and initially joined in a supporting role, but soon decided to become an arrestable. “Putting myself in harm’s way and risking arrest is really not a big deal compared with what other people are going through around the world and compared with what is coming for our children,” she said. “I feel a very strong sense of duty and that it’s my turn to step up.” In February 2019, Eastburn took part in her first direct action, during an oil conference attended by the then trade secretary, Liam Fox. In April, during the widespread London protests, Eastburn superglued herself to the roof of a DLR train. She is facing a crown court trial in December for her DLR protest."
"Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $170bn AustralianSuper, has warned the Minerals Council its position on the climate crisis was not good enough and the peak mining body needed to do more. AustralianSuper’s head of environmental, social and governance issues, Andrew Gray, told Guardian Australia the council was a good example of a group of industry associations that had made a general commitment to the principles of the Paris agreement, designed to limit global heating to 2C, but had failed to say how their members would do so. “They’ve got a very high-level statement about alignment with Paris but I want to see them do more,” he said. The substance behind its statement needed to be developed. “A high-level statement like that was probably where people were at a few years ago, but people need to keep evolving,” he said. Over the coming year, tackling industry associations whose climate agendas did not match the stated goals of member companies would be a priority for Climate Action 100+, a global group of investment funds including AustralianSuper that control more than $35tn in assets. Other members of the 370-strong group include Australian fund manager BT, global bank HSBC and California’s state pension fund Calpers. In its first progress report, the group – which was set up in December 2017 – said many companies were making progress but more needed to be done. Gray, who sits on the Climate Action 100+ steering committee, said the initiative was still in its early days. “I’m not disappointed about the progress to date but that’s not the same as saying much more doesn’t need to be done,” he said. “I think these achievements are really significant and we’ve got a lot of momentum.” The Minerals Council’s position on the climate has already caused significant pain for the peak body, with its chief executive, Brendan Pearson, leaving the organisation in November 2017 after clashes with BHP and Rio Tinto, who were unhappy with its advocacy for coal. Despite changes at the council, activists and investors have continued to pressure the big miners over their continued membership. Rio Tinto threatened to quit if the council made statements contradicting the Paris agreement, and BHP is reviewing its membership of all industry organisations. On Tuesday, after lobbying from Climate Action 100+, BHP released new guidance that broadened the issues it would examine when deciding if it should be a member of industry groups. “I think it’s very good steps in the right direction,” Gray said. In its report, Climate Action 100+ said 77% of companies clearly assigned responsibility for climate to the board of directors, but less than 8% ensured their positions were consistent with those of industry associations. “It’s important that industry associations of which companies are a member have consistent positions with their members,” Gray said. “If that’s not the case that represents a business risk for us.” This was because any inconsistency was “potentially undermining the company’s position”, he said. “Generally speaking the climate policy positions of industry associations aren’t where they need to be, they’re not as strong as they need to be,” he said. “The Minerals Council, I think, is a good example.” The Minerals Council’s chief executive, Tania Constable, said it “welcomes AustralianSuper’s endorsement of our public policy position on climate change and agrees with them that there is more that the industry can do, and is doing, to improve environmental outcomes”. She said the Australian minerals industry supported the Paris agreement and claimed the industry’s direct emissions “might have peaked already”. “Australian mining businesses are working together to make our contribution to lowering emissions,” she said. “This includes reducing the emissions from minerals extraction and processing, investment in low emission technology such as carbon capture and storage, energy-efficiency initiatives and increasing the use of renewable energy in operations.” Gray said although AustralianSuper did not screen out companies based on their environmental performance, it was an issue that fed into how they valued potential investments. “The size of ownership or whether we own it or not will be affected,” he said. Companies had to deal with both the physical risk global heating posed to their businesses and with the risks associated with moving the world to a low-carbon future. “I think it is inherently a difficult issue because we are dealing with a) the weather and b) a wholesale economic transition,” he said. But this was not much different to working out the risks associated with other changes, such as technology, he said: “A lot of things investors have to forecast for the long term are inherently difficult.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English Der Spiegel presents a blistering report on the solar energy debacle in Germany this week in a piece titled:
Solar Subsidy Sinkhole, Re-Evaluating Germany’s Blind Faith in the Sun.
The costs of subsidizing solar electricity have exceeded the 100-billion-euro mark in Germany, but poor results are jeopardizing the country’s transition to renewable energy. The government is struggling to come up with a new concept to promote the inefficient technology in the future…continue reading at Der Spiegel here.
Some bits of reality:
Solar farm operators and homeowners with solar panels on their roofs collected more than €8 billion ($10.2 billion) in subsidies in 2011, but the electricity they generated made up only about 3 percent of the total power supply, and that at unpredictable times.
Until now, Merkel had consistently touted the environmental sector’s “opportunities for exports, development, technology and jobs.” But now even members of her own staff are calling it a massive money pit.

If all commitments to pay subsidies so far are added together, Frondel adds, ‘we have already exceeded the €100 billion level.'”
Read about the entire dismal mess at Der Spiegel, see link above.
Yet, the Greens in Germany are proud of this debacle and cannot get enough of it. Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin says here at CO2 Handel (emphasis added):
‘We are experiencing a concentrated campaign against renewable energy over the recent days,’ Trittin thinks. ‘It is being led by the coal lobby at RWE and Eon, but it is also being incited by the Federal Ministry of Economics.’ Trittin said, the Feed-In Act is by far the most inexpensive way of expanding renewable energies. ‘That’s why it has been copied by over 50 countries.’ “
50 countries that are ruining their energy supply. It should be clear just how detached from reality people like Trittin are.
But with such handouts, I really ought to start thinking about having a system of my own installed on our house. If you don’t jump through the hoop, then you pay through the nose. But on the other side of the hoop, you get rewarded. So it’s stupid not jump through it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper here on the Jorge Montt Glacier at the Chilean Patagonia is out in Climate of the Past journal. What’s interesting is that this glacier is located in Chile – in South America, far away from the North Atlantic region.
Jorge Montt Glacier, Southern Patagonian ice field. (Photo credit: NASA - public domain photo)
A team of scientists studied tree rings from old trees recently exposed by the retreating Patagonian glaciers. Samples of these trees were dated using radiocarbon methods, yielding burial ages between 460 and 250 years ago.
Well guess what! The study confirms that the Little Ice Age existed in Chile too. Now remember how the high-sticking hockey team kept trying to have us believe that the Medieval Warm Period-Little Ice Age thing was a local phenomena, and not global? That claim is looking more and more like a real joke with every passing study.
The person who brought my attention to this paper is an expert geologist, and wishes to remain anonymous. He wrote me in an e-mail:
Amazing how globally widespread the ‘local North Atlantic’ Little Ice Age was in fact.”
And he quoted the paper’s abstract:
The dendrochronology and maps indicate that Glaciar Jorge Montt was at its present position before the beginning of the LIA, in concert with several other glaciers in Southern Patagonia, and reached its maximum advance position between 1650 and 1750 AD.”
No misprint there. It’s correct. Before the LIA the Chilean glaciers were at the same spot as the present position. Send a copy of that paper to Michael Mann and the rest of the climate clowns.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI must admit that over the last record-breaking 10 days here at NTZ, it’s been interesting to watch the climate activists and the end-of-the world whackos hyperventilate about Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s questioning of climate science.
So over-the-top have some of the attacks been that readers are beginning to question the very sanity of some of these obsessive Armageddonist.
At Germany’s version of moveon.org, www.vorwaerts.de, the mouthpiece of Germany’s socialist SPD party, to which Vahrenholt himself is a member, party honcho Michael Müller unloads. Müller’s rambling diatribe runs over an exhaustive 5 pages. Strangely on the surface, his screed appears like a book review of Die kalte Sonne, but after going through Müller’s rant, one finds almost nothing about the book itself!
Müller obviously has never read it.
So it’s good that the very first and only reader comment makes a point, one that hopefully will remind Müller what a raving public fool he looks like. Reader Gerhard v.d. Straten left the following comment:

Do you think that’s okay? Climate denier, irresponsible, climate-Sarrazin? Indeed that goes too far. We really have not gone back to the Dark Ages where everyone who questions the faith gets stoned to death. Vahrenholt and Lüning don’t even do that. They are only bringing into the discussion the point that global warming is 50% caused by man. How would it be to first read the book before first foaming at the mouth, Herr Müller?
Yours,”
That’s good advice for any mouth-foaming end-of-worlder. Obviously discussing anything with the closed-minded basket cases we’ve seen over the last few days is a waste of time. All they’re interested in is finding the closest tree to carry out their political lynchings. I suggest to Müller that he take steps to have Vahrenholt booted from the SPD Party. Go ahead and try.
Unfortunately, Mr Straten, the end-of-worlders like Müller are indeed back in the Dark Ages. I wonder how much longer your comment will even remain. Here’s the original German in case it should disappear:
Finden sie das in Ordnung. Klimaleugner, verantwortungslos, Klima-Sarrazin. Das geht doch nun wirklich zu weit. Wir sind doch nun wirklich nicht im Mittelalter angekommen und müssen jeden steinigen, der eine Glaubensrichtung in Frage stellt. Varenholt und Lüning tun das noch nicht einmal. Sie bringen nur die These, dass die globale Erwärmung 50% menschgemacht ist mal wieder in den Blickpunkt. Wie wäre es mal mit Buch lesen und nicht gleich Schaum vor den Mund kriegen, Herr Müller.
M.f.G.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe woes in the renewable energy sector continue unabated. We’ve heard a number of headlines of jobs being lost in the solar industry – now jobs are being lost in wind as well.
According to news reports, the world’s largest wind tuirbine manufacturer, Vestas,  will lay off another 2300 workers worldwide, along with a possible additional 1600 jobs in the USA.  The reason is sluggish demand. The company also announced the closure of a number of facilities. Last year the company had laid off 3000 employees.According to the German language CO2 Handel, 1300 jobs will be lost at the headquarters in Aarhus Denmark.
The wind turbine manufacturer had again lowered its forecast for sales turnover for 2011 and now expects 6 billion instead of 6.4 billion euros in turnover.”
The company no longer believes it’ll make a profit. CBS News writes:
…a potential slowdown in the United States could also result in the layoff of an additional 1,600 employees there.”
and
Last year, Vestas laid off 3,000 workers after posting a 24 percent drop in the third quarter.”
According to Global Winnepeg, job losses in the USA will depend on whether or not the company will get more handouts from the taxpayers:
It said the U.S. layoff plans would mainly depend on whether the Production Tax Credit — which gives a favourable low tax rate to makers of renewable energy — would be extended or not. In 2010, Vestas was awarded about $51 million in tax credits through the U.S. federal stimulus program.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s official: the Alfred Wegener Institute Antarctic Neumayer-Station III is a meteorological observation station that’s been measuring air temperature and other magnitudes in Antarctica for 30 years, which is the period of time used to define climate for a region. The results are clear and indisputable. The AWI writes in its press release:
At the Neumayer Station it has not gotten warmer over the last 30 years.”
Note they avoid saying it got cooler. If the trend had been the opposite, the results would have been blasted out to the world in the most vivid terms. Annual mean temperature for the years 1982 to 2011 measured at the Neumayer-Station (all graphics come from the Alfred Wegener Institute):

Mean annual temperature plot at the Neumayer Station shows cooling. (AWI)

According to the press release, the temperature station uses instrumentation that makes US climatological measurement system look like a meteorological junkyard. The Antarctic station uses a special type thermometer that is protected from the sun’s rays and has a sensitive platinum wire. The thermometer is 2 meters above the surface. Whenever a measurement is made, the surrounding air is set into turbulence and the measurement is then input into a computer. According to Director Gert König-Langlo:
We check the stability of the measurement system on a regular basis using calibration thermometers.
At the station the annual mean temperature over the last 30 years was minus 16°C. The year 1996 with a mean temperature of minus 14.3°C was the warmest of the last 30 years and the year 2000 was the coldest with a mean temperature of minus 17.8° Celsius.”
With all the concern over global warming gripping Europe, you’d think this would be all over the news. Nope! Not a peep of this cooling trend has appeared anywhere in the German news as far as I can tell. Unfortunately, the AWI did not offer any explanation as to why they have measured cooling. But it is quick to add:
This development is however a regional change and the measurement data from the Neumayer-Station III  is in no way representative for global climate changes. ‘Only at the centre of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer. On the Antarctic peninsula on the other hand, the mean temperature has risen up to 3°C. We also observe a similar warming in the Arctic,’ says König-Langlo.”
I’ll now take the liberty to offer the AWI scientists a clue: perhaps ocean cycles and currents have something to do with it?

The Neumayer station also shows a powerful upward trend for the amount of sunshine:
Amount of sunshine at the Neumayer Station of the AWI.
Here, however, König-Langlo doesn’t hesitate to offer an explanation:
Our weather data shows that the part of Antarctica where our station is located is increasingly influenced by high pressure. We have clear skies more and more often. And wherever cloud cover is missing in polar regions, heat gets radiated out and the lower air layers cool.”
More and more high pressure resulting in clear skies. (AWI)
Polar temperatures depend a lot on cloud cover? A couple of days ago it was soot. Sometimes it’s aerosols. Other times it’s all CO2.  I wish these scientists would make up their minds for once! But it’s never the sun, never the oceans (though without them there would be no climate to change). We keep hearing of different warming drivers, but the numbers never add up because nobody dares to scale back CO2 is as a driver. In the end the scientists look absolutely untrustworthy with their explanations – in layman’s terms they make themselves look like they’re FOS.
When you add their numbers up, the result says they absolutely are.
Near the end of the press release comes the pitch for more funding to conduct more research.
Why the temperature curve of the Neumayer-Station differs so much from the other research stations on the Antarctic peninnsula is still the object of current research. “Further measurements and research efforts are necessary to clear up the matter,’ says Gert König-Langlo.”
Dear Dr. König-Langlo, please order this book: Die kalte Sonne by Drs. Sebastin Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt. Delivery in February.

By Ed Caryl
“No place on Earth is warming as fast as Greenland,” we keep hearing. Or: “Greenland is approaching a tipping point!”

The Arctic is known as a desert, with little rain or snow, winter or summer. When I was at Thule AFB in 1962 – 63, snow accumulation was a few inches each winter, and most of that was blown in from the ice cap. In more recent years, however, the snowfall at Thule has increased.

Over the recent years we have been inundated by media reports that Greenland is losing ice at a rapid rate, raising sea-levels, etc, etc. But what is really happening? To find out, look at the following chart from Rutgers University:

Figure 3: Greenland snow cover from Rutgers University Global Snow Laboratory website. ww.climate4you.snowcover.htm
The plateau at the top of the chart depicts complete snow cover, 100%. Note how the trend is clearly steadily up.
Greenland is approaching a condition of year-around complete snow cover.
Is this getting reported in the media? I wonder what condition triggers an ice age?

A recent news clipping on the research of an international climate scientist claimed rising temperatures during the other three seasons are actually cooling off winters in North America –all because of snowfalls in Siberia and an atmosphere pressure pattern in high latitudes called the Arctic Oscillation (AO).
The argument that is being made is that the recent warmer summers (due to global warming) are causing more negative Arctic Oscillation, which in turn causes colder winters in North America and Europe. This is totally opposite to what the IPCC predicted.
Here is what the actual abstract to an article called Arctic Warming, Increasing Snow Cover & Widespread Boreal Winter Cooling by Judah L. Cohen et al 2012 in the Environmental Research Letter said:
The most up to date consensus from global climate models predicts warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes to middle latitudes during boreal winter. However, recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections. For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia. We argue that this unforeseen trend is probably not due to internal variability alone. Instead, evidence suggests that summer and autumn warming trends are concurrent with increases in high-latitude moisture and an increase in Eurasian snow cover, which dynamically induces large-scale wintertime cooling. Understanding this counterintuitive response to radiative warming of the climate system has the potential for improving climate predictions at seasonal and longer timescales.”
I like the words ”most up to date consensus from global warming models” and “recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections”. In plain English the AGW scientists are finally admitting that even their latest climate models are wrong with respect to global warming. I give the above authors credit for finally admitting what most of us have known for some time.
Also the statement “For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia “seems overstating the cooling. There has not been large-scale cooling for 2 decades, only the last 10 years in North America – as noted below-  and in Europe only the last 4-5 years.
As has been recently reported by this writer on this blog and at Anthony Watts on WUWT, the summers in both the contiguous US and Canada have not warmed but have actually cooled in US and the trend is quite flat in Canada over the last 10 years. Therefore warmer summers cannot be causing more negative AO and colder winters.
The colder winters are more likely due to changing spatial pattern of more cooler water in the North East Pacific than in the Central and North West Pacific Ocean, especially since 2007 (see PDO) and more recently the slow cooling of the Atlantic Ocean (see AMO) here.
While it is true that a negative AO can result in cooler winters, what causes the AO to cycle unpredictably is not yet clearly understood. Scientists have been unable to predict AO levels for more than a week or two. Whatever has been causing AO to cycle or to be negative, it has been causing this for at least a century and probably much longer – our records only go back to about 1899. This not a new phenomena caused by recent global warming. Below is a plot of winter AO provided by Jiaso.Washington.edu for the years 1899-2002.

More recent AO Index data after 2002 to 2011 can be found at NOAA:

http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/ao_index.html
Here is how the winter AO has varied during past warming and cooling phases of this planet for the last century:
JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH AVERAGE AO INDEX
1900s decade: 7 positive, 3 negative AO winters
WARMING PHASE [temperatures rising] 1910 -1939
1910s 6 positive, 4 negative
1920s 8 positive, 2 negative
1930s 6 positive, 4 negative
TOTAL 20 positive, 10 negative
COOLING PHASE [temperatures dropping] 1940 -1969
1940s 4 positive, 6 negative
1950s 4 positive, 6 negative
1960s 4 positive, 6 negative
TOTAL 12 positive, 18 negative
WARMING PHASE [temperatures rising] 1970- 1999
1970s 5 positive, 5 negative
1980s 5 positive, 5 negative
1990s 7 positive3 negative
TOTAL 17 , 13 negative
POTENTIAL COOLING PHASE? 2010-2030
2010s 6 positive, 4 negative (temperatures have been declining slightly during the past decade)
2010 negative AO WINTER
2011 positive AO winter
Final Comments
It would appear that the Winter AO Index has a significant impact on global winter temperatures. During recent two 30 year global warming phases there were more positive (warm) AO winters than negative (cold) AO winters and almost twice as many. During 30 year global cooling phases, there are more negative AO winters than positive AO winters and about 50% more. During individual peak warm decades (1920s and 1990s) there were 2 to 4 times as many positive AO winters as negative AO winters. During individual peak cooling decades [1940s, 1950’s and 1960s, there were 50% more negative AO winters.
Clearly the recent negative AO winters are not new phenomena caused by warmer summers due to global warming but is a continuing natural climate process that has been ongoing for centuries. A recent extreme cold spell in Canada during January 2012 was happening with mostly positive AO, so we have a lot to understand about our climate. There seems to be no end to some climate scientists trying to tie every climate phenomena, however small or varied, to global warming.

"Jonathan Safran Foer published Eating Animals in 2009. I didn’t read it until 2015, because I had a feeling that it would be persuasive and I would have to stop eating meat, which I found delicious, especially buttery, white-bread ham sandwiches and chicken shish kebabs. It took a long time before I was ready to have my last pepperoni pizza, but in choosing to pick up a book that I knew laid out the horrors of mass meat production, it was clear that I was almost there. And when I’d finished reading it, I simply stopped eating meat. The trade-off no longer seemed worth it. Safran Foer now aims to repeat that trick with We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast. Rather than focusing on the grotesque scale and inhumane practices of factory farming, he talks about the environmental impact of meat and dairy and offers practical suggestions for reducing our consumption of animal products instead. We hear again and again that in the US and the UK, to have any hope of slowing the climate emergency, we need to cut down on meat by 90% and dairy by 60%. Safran Foer’s idea is that we eat meat and dairy only in the evening. Easy.  Last week, though, steak fans everywhere were excited by a new study that concluded there was insufficient evidence that red meat is bad for our health. The problem is that, at this stage, it’s not really about us: cows are beautiful creatures and when farmed en masse to meet our enormous appetites, their methane-filled burps (not farts, contrary to popular belief) are awful for the planet. Even so, it seemed to stand as symbolic green light for filling one’s boots at the bovine buffet. The hunger for even a hint of permission shows that there is a long way to go. Safran Foer’s new approach, measured and moderate, gives me hope. I know people who won’t read Eating Animals, because they simply like meat too much. This is stealthier. Guilt and shame are not effective tactics for changing anyone’s minds, in any field, and neither is absolute rigidity. He admits that, even after Eating Animals, he craved meat and ate burgers at airports, because they were comforting and easy. He knows this makes him sound like a hypocrite, but that kind of honesty is realistic. The vegan accounts I follow on Instagram are funny and open to people who are interested in what vegans are doing, even if they aren’t doing it themselves. They are not didactic, they are not judgmental, and those qualities, rather than shame, offer the best chance of the shift in habits that we need. It has been a long, arid, laughter-free 18 months without it, but at last Dear Joan and Jericha is back. The Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis comedy has the pair playing terrible agony aunts who shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near a problem, even the problems as awful as the gruesome ones they tackle. It’s recorded in Davis’s kitchen and improvised, which gives the added bonus of trying to work out which of them is trying not to laugh and who is egging the other on. Friends are already quoting this new episode to one another, as they did with the first season, and it makes Davis’s recent series Sally4Ever look positively PG. However, as a podcast, it is totally unfit for podcast purposes. I usually listen to them when I’m out walking or on public transport. After the last season, I realised I had to clear the decks for this one and put it on only in private. The sight of me snorting uncontrollably in the park is dangerously close to my own version of Joker, only instead of getting beaten up in an alley, I’ll have been bludgeoned with outrageously filthy gags. It should come with a warning: only suitable for listening in the safety of one’s home. As always, literary feuds prove to be as gripping and action-packed as any Real Housewives franchise, rap beef or tabloid-fuelling celebrity spat. Last week, John le Carré found himself was on the receiving end of sharp words from the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove. “He is so corrosive in his view of MI6 that most professional Secret Intelligence Service officers are pretty angry with him,” Dearlove told the Cliveden literary festival, explaining that he found Le Carré’s work to be nihilistic and cynical. “Intelligence organisations are based on trust between colleagues. His books are exclusively about betrayal.” Dearlove follows Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick in grumbling that an imaginary version of something invented by a writer with the purpose of entertaining people lacks realism. For her, police corruption in Line of Duty was an outrage; for Dearlove, it’s the idea that spies might betray one another. I look forward to a wave of dramatically inert stories about well-behaved police officers and trusting spies working together pleasantly and without event. The wait, I’m sure, will be more than worth it. Still, it gave Le Carré the opportunity to respond with fantastic acidity. Writing in the Times, he said he doubted that senior professional intelligence officers were angry with him, because at least a couple of them had told him they were not. He then went for the jugular, criticising Dearlove’s role in the Iraq war, reminding readers that “raw, single-source, unchecked MI6 intelligence was being passed to Tony Blair, and presumably to George Bush as well, on a regular basis. And that Sir Richard was instrumental in causing this to happen.” And then, in a sign-off so tart that it would have been right at home on RuPaul’s Drag Race, he thanked Dearlove for all the extra publicity. Gorgeous. • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"

"One of Britain’s and northern Europe’s rarest and most elusive mammals has been discovered living in the east of England for the first time in 115 years. The return to Kent of the greater horseshoe bat has delighted and astounded conservationists, who are now examining whether climate change is shifting the species’ range. The bat is normally found only in Wales and the west of England.  This secretive, buff-coloured, creature (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) is one of Britain’s biggest bats. It frequently evades and challenges pursuers, fluttering unseen through shadows and hiding underground in caves, tunnels and occasionally buildings. The animal hunts and navigates by screaming out high-frequency echolocation whistles through flaps on its horseshoe-shaped noseleaf, but the calls are beyond the human hearing range. The bat often navigates in silence or changes the shape, width and direction of its sonic beam, along with the intensity of the pulse, which means ecologists searching for it can easily miss it. The creature’s distinctive, alien-like, ultrasonic warbling signals were recorded at two locations near the coast during May and June by two separate teams of bat ecologists. Joe Nunez-Mino, spokesperson for the Bat Conservation Trust, confirmed that the unusual recordings had been verified by national experts. “It is possible that an individual bat was blown off course or has travelled over from France, or that a bat has dispersed across the UK from strongholds in the west of England or Wales. “It is also possible that the species is now able to expand its range into Kent due to climatic changes. The habitats in the area that the recordings were made are not dissimilar to those in its western strongholds.” No one has yet found the bats’ roost, and it’s not known whether this is a breeding population or how they arrived. These bats do not typically venture beyond a range of about three to 20 miles from a roost, and Britain’s 12 known isolated greater horseshoe colonies and 35 breeding roosts are all much further west. The news is a further sign that the greater horseshoe’s fortunes are turning round. Britain has lost more than 90% of this bat’s population and half its range over the last 100 years; numbers have fallen from an estimated 300,000 individuals. However, the Mammal Society says the animal’s numbers have roughly doubled in the last 10 years, from an estimated 6,500 to about 13,000 individuals. Recent evidence suggests climate change is driving up the numbers of greater horseshoes, bringing more insects in warmer springs, earlier bat births, spring rainfall and better temperatures when the animals emerge from hibernation. The Bat Conservation Trust says good farm and landscape management can mean huge potential for greater horseshoes. They need woodland, a lack of light pollution, pesticide-free grazed pasture with chemical-free dung harbouring dung beetles, as well as moths, cockchafers and flies, plus tall continuous hedgerows that are not trimmed for up to 10 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt appears the tactics of Stefan Rahmstorf are truly beginning to catch up with him. What goes around, comes around.H/t: Lubos Motl
Der Spiegel today has a story on IPCC bigwig and ultra-alarmist Stefan Rahmstorf, who is also a lead scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and elite member of the Hockey Team. For those of you who may not recall, Rahmstorf is the outlier oceanographer that projects a sea level rise of about 1.4 meters, even when the rest the world, including real observations, all point to something that is about 1/7 of that.
It’s a bit late at night here and so the main points only. Der Spiegel starts:
Renown climate scientist and German government advisor Stefan Rahmstorf was found guilty of a blog attack against a journalist.  According to the opinion of a state court, he made untruthful assertions. Also the ‘Frankfurter Rundschau’ has come under fire.”
A State Court says he’s guilty of making untruthful assertions. Interpret that how you wish. The Frankfurter Rundschau is a sort of daily that former East German comrades lean towards. On the Rahmstorf ruling by the court, we reported about it here.
To make a long story short, journalist Irene Meichsner wrote a critical report about the IPCC, which appeared in the Frankfurter Rundschau daily, to which Rahmstorf reacted quite nastily. He asserted at his blog that the journalist had been dishonest, sloppy, had never read the IPCC report, and that she even lifted text from another source (Richard North and Jonathan Leake). For a journalist, such accusations are of course career threatening and thus deadly serious.
Meichsner didn’t stand for it, took the case to court, and won.
The Original text of the Court Judgement is here.
That should have been the end of it but, according to Der Spiegel, the PIK (Rahmstorf ‘s employer) has gotten into the fray. The PIK you’ll recall is run by German masterplanner Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, who chairs the WBGU and directly advises Chancellor Angela Merkel. If you ever wondered where Merkel comes up with all these brilliant climate policy ideas, e.g. like the 2°C warming limit, then look no further.
Der Spiegel tried to contact Rahmstorf directly for comment on the Cologne State Court ruling, but received only a statement from the PIK which attempted to play down the incident. The statement was also posted at the PIK site. According to Der Spiegel the statement claimed:
‘Mistakes can happen.’ This involves ‘interpretation questions’ and ‘misunderstandings’.”
and that:



<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




“The PIK asks his colleagues to understand that it is the duty of a scientist “to inform the public about errors”.
Der Spiegel, citing the Cologne Court Ruling”, calls the PIK published statement:
An amazing interpretation”.
The State Court ruling against Rahmstorf is a cease and desist order that requires Rahmstorf to refrain from making the false assertions about the journalist. Yet at the PIK website the statement (on behalf of Rahmstorf?) again was clearly implying there had been “errors” in Meichsner’s report when in fact there weren’t. Talk about defying a court order! According to Der Spiegel, the PIK has since revised the text at its site. Obviously it’s not the journalist Meichsner that’s sloppy and loose with the facts. The Court was very clear on that.
Der Spiegel reminds readers that this is not the first time that Rahmstorf has maliciously taken on people who do not share his opinion and speak out.
Time and again he has not only gone after journalists, but also after scientists who have openly expressed views that Rahmstorf didn’t like.”
Der Spiegel cites the Franfurter Rundschau daily as an example, who according to Der Spiegel:”played an unusual part in the affair. The editors at FR distanced themselves from Meichsers critical piece two months after they had published it” after Rahmstorf had intervened and then published a full two-page story on how “the IPCC had been the target of an awkward campaign.” In plain English, the FR went down on its knees before a group of elite scientists.
That is disturbing. Der Spiegel was unable to obtain any comment from the FR.

// ]]&gt;Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht Germany was also once a target of Rahmstorf. According to Der Spiegel, today he keeps a copy of the original State Court Ruling up at his private website.
At his blog Rahmstorf in the meantime gripes that “in the classical media you no longer have any control over the end product.”
The ice under Rahmstorf feet is getting awfully thin, and it’s not because of global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBitter conflict with climate skeptics has moved to the newspapers and media. Earlier this year, German science review magazine WPK Quarterly published a report here on how one scientist dealt with a skeptic journalist, hat-tip here and here.
It’s front page cover bears a full page photo of Stefan Rahmstorf along with the headline:

Independent Scientist or Poltical Agitator?
 A journalist defends herself against the malice of Stefan Rahmstorf”

The feature story, written by Markus Lehmkuhl, starts on page 4 and is titled:

Ideology and Climate Change or:
 How to shut up journalists
A freelance journalist becomes a target of of renown climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who in the fight for the alleged truth doesn’t hold back using personal defamation.”

Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is an IPCC lead author, advisor on Hans Schellnhuber’s WBGU, and one of Germany’s most influential climate scientists. Today it is widely known that journalists and scientists who express doubt over man-made climate change or criticism over the science and the IPCC often find themselves attacked by the Potsdam professor via the press or his Internet blog.
For German science journalist Irene Meichsner, it was in the wake of Climategate when she penned an unflattering piece about the IPCC and the slew of errors and false assumptions in its Fourt Assessment Report. Her story was published on February 8, 2010, in two German dailies: the Kölner Stadtsanzeiger (KStA) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (FR). Sticking to the facts, Meichsner’s damning piece cast the IPCC’s credibility into serious doubt.
Rahmstorf, who acts as sort of a gatekeeper and watchdog when it comes to guarding the global warming hypothesis and the institutes that propagate it, responded by publishing 2 pieces at his blog, the first on 20 February and the second on 26 April 2010. He also had a letter published at the FR on March 25, 2010, where he called the accusations made in Meichsner’s story false and made up. He attacked Meischsner, implying that she played loose with the facts, and that she had even lifted part of her text from skeptic blogs.
Rahmstorf even convinced the FR to publish a 2-page retraction on April 30, 2010, which, according to the WPK Quarterly, claimed that Meichsner’s accusations aimed at the IPCC were “part of a campaign by skeptics” designed “to discredit the IPCC”.
According to the WPK, Rahmstorf wrote in his February 20 blog piece that Meichsner’s story represented:
…a media scandal where a few journalists mislead the public with completely exaggerated or freely made up pseudo-scandals. Too many among them are naive and go along without seeing through the farce.”
Rahmstorf also aimed harsh words at the journalist’s integrity and credibility, suggesting that she never bothered to read the IPCC report and that she did things that never happened. For example, the WPK Quarterly writes:

//-->




He accused her of uncritically copying text from [Richard] North and [Jonathan] Leake.”
As credibility and reputation are especially important for the survival of a free-lance journalist, and based on that she had stuck to the facts in her article, Meichsner felt Rahmstorf had obviously ventured too far in his response to her story, and so took the matter to court demanding that Rahmstorf be forced to cease and desist making the untrue claims.
So what judgement did the State Court in Cologne hand down? WPK Quarterly provides that (my English legal translation – you’ll forgive me for not being a lawyer):

In the name of the People, 9 February of this year,
a judgement was issued and entails: The Defendant is
judged by the 28th Civil Chamber of the State Court
of Cologne “to (…) cease and desist from
arousing the impression that
a) the Plaintiff copied from bloggers Richard
North and journalist Jonathan Leake;
b) the Plaintiff had the defendent
informed through the editorial board of
the Frankfurter Rundschau that he should
remove the name of the Plaintiff from the
blog story of the Defendant ‘FR Retracts
Article Against IPCC’ and to name only
the Frankfurter Rundschau. Furthermore,
the Defendant must pay the plaintiff
511.58 euro plus interest and bear
two thirds of the costs of the legal dispute.
The Chamber determined that the grounds
were untrue allegation of facts that
violated her personal rights.”

WPK Quarterly wrote at length about this story and featured it in its up-front editorial, deeming the overall case merits special attention because:
“…a free journalist was able to successfully defend herself against the malice that a renown scientist who had dumped on her.”
Although Rahmstorf lost in court, he was able to chalk up an off-court victory. When asked if she would report more on climate change, the WPK writes:
For now she has had enough of climate science. She doesn’t write about it any more.”
Indeed it’s not a topic for those with thin skin and people who can’t afford to put their careers on the line. Expressing skepticism over a politically correct issue in Germany indeed leads to malicious attacks. Like the old saying goes: Sometimes it’s much more dangerous to speak up against wrongdoing than it is to commit it.

"Environmental activists from around Britain are converging on Westminster on Monday morning in an attempt to “shut down” the heart of government with two weeks of disruptive protests. Extinction Rebellion (XR) had earlier said its members are planning to blockade “every single road” into the central London district and plan to maintain the protests for at least 14 days, or until their demands are met.  Each site will be taken by groups of activists from different regions of the UK or with different political priorities. Activists started to stop traffic from around 9am. Planned sites around parliament included Trafalgar Square, Horse Guards Parade, the Mall, Victoria Street, and Westminster and Vauxhall bridges, among others. Throughout the week activists plan to take action around Westminster at government departments, to blockade Smithfield market, then later move on to London City airport, where they intend to stage a three-day protest. However, even senior members of XR say they do not know the full scale or extent of intended protests as many are being organised autonomously. Independent solidarity actions under the banner of international XR groups are also expected in about 60 cities around the world. XR UK claims to have recruited five times as many activists as during the last major protests in April, when more than 1,100 were arrested at blockades of four major London sites that lasted about a week. Metropolitan police commanders – after coming under fire for not ending those protests sooner – have said they are planning to be more proactive and agile in their response. Specialist police teams have been drafted in from around the country to remove protesters who try to lock or glue themselves in place. However, the activists believe their decentralised command structures and weight of numbers will overwhelm the police response. “Everyone will be like water and move to more disruptive locations if [police] don’t let them take the sites,” one told the Guardian. Activists have also been instructed to refuse bail when arrested, in the hope they can fill up all of the Met’s holding cells and prevent police from making more arrests. On Saturday, officers from the force’s territorial support group raided a building in south London and seized equipment that activists had planned to use. Seven women and three men were arrested for conspiracy to cause a public nuisance Officers used a battering ram to force their way in. However, a source within XR said that while officers were breaking in through the front door, activists were smuggling “a whole pile of stuff” out of the back."

Here’s another “glittering jewel of colossal science ignorance” at the German online Frankfurter Neue Presse. It is titled: Experiments Show Hesse’s Climate in the Future. Hesse (in German: Hessen) is a state in Central Germany, which puts it in the middle of Europe. Its largest city is Frankfurt.
Scientists of the University of Gießen and the State Department for Environment and Geology (HLUG), also in the state of Hesse, studied jointly at the Environmental Observation and Climate Impact Station, whatever the hell that is.
In a nutshell, a bunch of obviously misguided scientists and politicians, with lots of taxpayer money to waste, got together and pumped a bunch of CO2 over a 4.5 hectare plot of land for years to see how the plants there would react.
Now, with the results, they think can deduce the future climate of the planet. Yes, things really have gotten that bad. By now I’m sure you are all just dying to hear the results. Here they are, reports the Frankfurter Neue Presse (drumroll):

They presented some of their results on Thursday. Hard times are coming for fruit trees and Riesling wine. ‘It’s going to get warmer, the summers drier and the winters wetter’, says HLUG President Thomas Schmid. ‘In South Hesse we are going to have Mediterranean conditions by the end of the century.’ The Riesling grape, which doesn’t like it so warm, could get problems under certain circumstances, so could fruit tress. According to the findings from the scientists, the blossoms will be earlier and earlier. Nighttime frost will then have a greater chance of destroying the fruit blossoms and thus the fruit itself.”
More warming, more frosts. That’s logical. Hesse Minister of Environment Lucia Puttrich (Conservative Party) in Linden said:
The project opens a window to the future.”
That’s not a window that you are looking through, Madam. It’s a hallucination – one induced by being all drugged up in Green religion and junkie science. How about getting an education? It’s the only known cure against such chronic hallucinations. I’m doing all I can to hold back with the words.
How much worse can all the madness possibly get? Truly the Modern Dark Ages have befallen Europe once again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI really hate doing this, because I know that the poor scientist will probably be summoned to some office somewhere for an earful, or just suddenly disappear in some big ice crevice. We all know that in Germany terrible things happen to climate scientists (and journalists) and who don’t say the right things.
Our friends at here at Science Skeptical bring us this clip, which is a snippet from a report that appeared on NDR German public TV last Friday evening.

In the clip Prof. Heinrich Miller is working down at the Antarctic Neumayer III station and is interviewed by NDR. Miller is deputy director of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven and has been researching the Arctic and Antarctic for decades. He’s a true old hat of polar research who really knows what he’s talking about. Science Skeptical writes:
There’s hardly any other climate scientist that knows the polar regions as well and as long as Miller does.”
In the above clip, NDR asks Miller about the trend in Antarctica and what climate-related changes have been noticed? Miller says (emphasis added):
Here almost nothing has changed. At least not near the surface. The average annual tempertures have remained the same. There are of course large fluctuations from year to year. If anything over the last 30 years we have a slight cooling trend. And this flies in the face of what is always immediately claimed: ‘The climate is warming and the Antarctic is melting’.”
There it is, right from the horse’s mouth, from someone who really knows: Antarctica is cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuaternary Science Reviews has published a new paper: Combined dendro-documentary evidence of Central European hydroclimatic springtime extremes over the last millennium by authors Ulf Büntgen et al.
Photo credit: Hannes Grobe/AWI
See abstract here.
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and associated effects on the Earth’s climate system are supposed to be causing more frequent and severe weather extremes and thus having terrible impacts on ecosystem function, agricultural yield, and human health.
Well, this new study says it aint quite so. The abstract of this paper states it plainly (emphasis and spelling correction added):
Documentary evidence independently confirms many of the dendro signals over the past millennium, and further provides insight on causes and consequences of ambient weather conditions related to the reconstructed extremes. A fairly uniform distribution of hydroclimatic extremes throughout the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age and Recent Global Warming may question the common belief that frequency and severity of such events closely relates to climate mean stages.”
The main highlights:
11,873 living and historical fir ring width samples were compiled across Europe. The world’s largest tree-ring composite continuously spans the AD 962–2007 period. Tree-ring extremes were triggered by April–June precipitation anomalies. Documentary evidence independently confirms dendro signals over the past millennium. Reconstructed extremes may constrain climate model simulations over long timescales.
So yet another climate myth debunked. If anything, it shows that it’s the media and alarmist hysteria that’s extreme, and not the weather.

At least in Germany,  that is if the current string of harsh winters doesn’t stop. And according to Dr Karsten Brandt’s latest winter forecast for 2011/12 at donnerwetter.de, this coming winter is projected to be yet another harsh one. No let-up in sight.
That would make it Germany’s 4th consecutive harsh winter in a row. Brandt already calls 3 harsh winters in a row “unusual”.
The bulk of the cold will occur in December and January, with both months being interrupted by brief mild spells. November will start off mild, but will then fall sharply into a cold spell, with snow likely. Brandt reminds us that this a probable forecast. Things of course could develop differently.
As Brandt mentions, energy prices in Germany have surged over the years, and so many households are going to be taking another real battering with the heating costs.
Indeed today much of Germany’s inflation is driven by spiralling energy costs, due in large part to Germany’s mandatory energy feed-in laws, which require power companies to buy up renewable energies at fixed, sky-high prices and to sell it to consumers as “green” power. Power companies have no choice but to pass the high prices along to the defenceless consumers. Gas, heating oil and electricity prices are are all coupled. The only consolation consumers get, ironically, is the false belief they are helping to keep the planet from getting warmer.
Some power companies figured out creative ways of exploiting the system. According to one story I’ve heard, one Swiss or Austrian company was buying cheap French nuclear power for 3 cents a kwh, used the power to pump water in to a high-elevation pump-storage reservoir, then ran the water through hydroelectric turbines and sold the energy as green power at exorbitant prices. I have no idea how true that story is, but it would not surprise me. After all, we do know that there is no shortage of climate scams.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings are so bad for the warmists in the USA that they now have to hope that radical German papers will carry the day for them. This is really quite pathetic.
Yesterday German left-wing online Die Zeit, a favourite among German “intellectuals”, attempted to bring the hockey stick back from the dead by granting washed-up climate scientist Raymond Bradley an interview.
The following are excerpts of the interview. I think Al Gore or moveon.org provided the answers for Bradley.
“The curve is robust”
Die Zeit poses the question: “Does the hockey stick chart need to be corrected?” Bradley answers:
No, the curve is robust. It was only one of hundreds of charts in the IPCC report. But the climate deniers in the US industry tried to bury the credibility of the IPCC by casting the curve into doubt. Some US Congressmen, who are marionettes of the oil industry, demanded that we provide detailed information about all financial information for the last few years. It hasn’t been easy with them breathing down our necks.”
I don’t know what the aim of all this is. Of course the German public hardly sees the other side of the science, which is usually in English and rarely filters through the German media. Citizens have to rely on their one-sided media, like Die Zeit.
Germany is a bit like the North Korea of climate information. Warmists are hoping Germans will remain oblivious nd keep believing in the coming doomsday. Obviously Bradley is hoping that the many duped Germans are somehow going to rescue him from the mess he and his team are in. It’s not easy being one step away from permanent disagrace.

Die Zeit then asks: “Since then, several comissions have confirmed your climate diagram. Has anyone apologised to you?” Now what does that tell you about Die Zeit and Die Zeit readers? I guess they’ve never heard of “Climategate” or the Medieval Warm Period.  (Now readers outside of Germany are probably getting an idea of just how far from reality German has drifted). Bradley answers:
No, instead the attacks continue. Michael Mann, the lead author of the curve, is still under investigation. In mid November he had to fight to keep all his e-mails during his time at the University of
Virginia from being made public.”
I’ll refrain from comment here. Bradley then goes on to say that at this stage he no longer feels threatened. But he did some years ago, as “people used the power of the state to intimidate the scientists”.
Bradley also does not expect any progress in Durban. As far as the future of US politics, he is not too optimistic, and warns:
Only when Obama gets re-elected and is supplememnted by a new majority in Congress will anything change. As long as the Tea Party dominates, it’s going to be difficult for Obama.
Die Zeit is regarded in Germany as a leading “intellectual” paper. And, if you linked to their article, you’ll notice they’re still using the old disgraced hockey stick, and believe oil companies are behind the skeptics, that sea level rise is accelerating and all the other myths.
This all reminds me of an old lone Japanese soldier marooned on a desert island, still hiding because he thinks WWII hasn’t ended yet.
Really – I’m not kidding when I say Die Zeit is an intellectual paper in Germany. Now you know the sorrowful state of German “intellectuals” (and Ray Bradley).

"Extinction Rebellion seems to have cracked using protests to transform public debate. But as it starts another major rebellion this week, it might find the challenge ahead is even greater. Extinction Rebellion’s April protests were an enormous success. Together with the BBC’s Attenborough documentary and the school climate strikes, they created a surge in public concern about the environment. The climate emergency is now established in the top five most important issues facing the UK today, at around the same level as the economy. Since the April protests, the government has legislated for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and Labour is moving towards a much more ambitious target. Few people could have predicted that a two-week blockade of central London would be met with so much support or have such political impact. So the natural question is whether a new round of protests can repeat the success. The fact this month’s rebellion won’t be such a novelty could make things harder. It’s the difficult-second-album problem: repeat your material and you’re boring; innovate and you may lose the magic. And with the police preparing to move faster against protesters this time, it’s inevitable that opponents of climate action will call for tougher law enforcement. But difficult though it will be for the protests to recapture the novelty and public support of the April protests, that is far from the biggest problem. Ironically, the greatest threat to the movement is its apparent success over the past six months. If the public believe the protesters have already won, continued street blockades could look unnecessary. It’s here that public opinion turns from being helpful to being a problem for Extinction Rebellion. The overwhelming majority want action to limit climate change and support a net-zero target; most even support bringing that target forward from the government’s current date. But most people’s attention stops there. Few people pay attention to the details or punish politicians who don’t have a plan. This means there’s not much incentive for politicians to go beyond simply pledging to tackle the climate crisis with ambitious-sounding targets. Take the government’s net-zero law. It would just about make the UK compliant with the Paris agreement’s goal of avoiding dangerous warming (although it is too slow for that if you consider the UK to have a responsibility to clean up faster than less- affluent countries). But the government wasn’t even on course to meet its old, weaker target; we are nowhere near meeting the new one. Or take Labour’s conference motion to meet the net-zero target by 2030. This is close to Extinction Rebellion’s demand, but the party shouldn’t get much credit for environmental saviourhood until it shows how it would deliver. Scrapping its support for Heathrow expansion will be hard enough for Labour – with the party’s union funders firmly behind more tarmac and more planes – and that would be among the simplest of the policy switches needed to decarbonise in 11 years. So apparent allies of the protesters can actually be a threat to faster climate action. Emission-cutting pledges can be useful – but if they aren’t combined with a plan they can undermine the cause by making it seem like the battle has been won. The next wave of Extinction Rebellion protests will be a success if it forces climate-friendly politicians to show their proposals. When a politician says they will stop the climate crisis from escalating, the first question that needs to be asked is: “how?” Answering that question requires politicians to expose the fact that avoiding dangerous warming will be disruptive and difficult. Many people will look for reasons to find a way out and so the debate may return to “why?” But this is Extinction Rebellion’s specialist subject: its explanation of the climate emergency may be terrifying but it is well-evidenced. This challenge – to force apparently “green” politicians to come with a plan – is daunting. But few people would have imagined that a climate change protest could occupy central London and be met with widespread public backing. The protesters might just be the people who can do it. • Leo Barasi is the author of The Climate Majority: Apathy and Action in an Age of Nationalism, published by New Internationalist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’re hearing about clandestine evil deals being made in Durban and that the UN may indeed emerge as the global Führer soon. Rubbish!
Der Spiegel reports here that Durban threatens to sink into chaos.
According to Der Spiegel, a new paper had been drafted overnight and included things like “warming will be limited to 2°C, even 1.5°C” and that “by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions will be cut back 50 to 85 percent compared to 1990” and that developing countries “will be obligated to cut back projected emissions growth by 2020 by 15 to 30 percent”.
Rumours are out claiming they’re closing in on a deal and that our liberty is about to end. But fear not. Der Spiegel, who have well-embedded reporters in Durban, writes:
In any case, a deal will not happen. In paragraph 47 of the paper, which looks at financial aid for developing countries, it is stated: The payments will be ‘equal to the budget that the industrial country has for defence, security and war.'”
We all know that Europe does very little in defence and military. That would mean the US would have to pay just about everything. If Obama accepted this, it would be a Jonestown-scale political suicide by the US Democratic Party. Even the biggest leftists in the US could hardly fantasize such a massive transfer of wealth by a single country. The condition is a set-up to force the USA to reject it – and thus take the blame again.

Der Spiegel writes:
That passage will certainly be deemed as completely unacceptable by the US: The country would not only have to make the money it spends on defence available, but also additional billions that it spends on war. Just the Afghanistan operation costs the USA 100 billion per year.”
Dear readers – Durban has moved to Kooksville, and they just want to end this circus, blame the US, and go home. You’ll hear about a little something here, of a little deal there, some commitment here, etc. But in the end it’s all nothing.
Every year it’s the same. They draft something so unfair that the US can’t accept, then they all blame the US for the failure. I wonder why the US even bothers showing up at all.
The clowns are headed back home and the circus is moving to the next town.

"Last week, a report by US campaign group the National Task Force on Rule of Law and Democracy, compiled by ex-government officials, concluded that under the Trump administration that there were now “almost weekly violations” to the impartiality of scientific research.  In April the Trump administration withdrew funding for the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, a large and successful conservation programme that tackled issues such as the climate crisis, species extinction and energy security. Sixteen of the original 22 research centres have now been dissolved or are on an indefinite “hiatus”. This was in defiance of instructions from Congress, which had approved $12.5m of federal funding for the cooperatives. Donald Trump’s government has refused to publicise dozens of studies from the US Department of Agriculture that examine the impact of the climate crisis. Agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, has previously expressed scepticism about climate change, believing it to simply be due to “weather patterns”. In June, it was reported that the White House had tried to stop Dr Rod Schoonover, a senior intelligence analyst, from discussing climate change when delivering congressional testimony. The reason given was that the science was not aligned with the views of the Trump administration. James Reilly, the director of the US Geological Survey (USGS), has ordered that scientific assessments produced by USGS use climate models that only track the possible impact of climate change until 2040, rather than until the end of the century, as they had done previously. The second half of the century is likely to see the most dramatic impacts of global heating."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Der Spiegel yesterday published a piece by Hans von Storch, Director of the GKSS-Research Center in Geesthacht, Germany and Nico Stehr of the Karl-Mannheim-Professur for Cultural Sciences at the Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen. The title:”The world of the the world-saving professors has failed”
Their conclusion on Durban: “The conference in Durban was a disappointment; environmental policy is stuck. Climate scientists are to blame because they are fixated on conceitedness and missionary zeal for reducing CO2 emissions.” They add:
The UN Climate Conference in Durban was a swan song.”
The attempt by scientists to guide a successful climate policy has failed. […] The cause for this is a false understanding of the role of climate science and the simplification of the climate change problem.”
For years, science professors had taken on the role of saving the planet, their arrogance exploding faster than CO2 emissions in China. It wasn’t long ago that everything appeared to be in order for the climate scientists. Physicist and chancellor Angela Merkel even allowed herself to be advised by leading scientists of a renowned institute, one was even allowed to use the title: “Advisor to the Chancellor”. Von Storch and Steyr write:
 Their views were accepted throughout the world as fact and their suggestions taken as correct.
Politics was to be guided by science – the science of a few men. Since then climate policy has failed, and CO2 emissions have risen unabated.
They led to failed climate policy. The leading figures in climate science are now suffering from withdrawal syndrome because no one wants to listen to them any longer, let alone celebrate them.”
Citing James Hansen, von Storch and Steyr are calling for a new direction in climate communication policy, pleading that policymakers move away from “Hollywood scientists”, who are naively portrayed as playing the lead roles as “world rescuers”.

What’s needed, the two authors say, is a more open discussion and not “autocratic government forms as solutions to the climate problem” or “great transformations of society” backed by the authority of scientists.
Von Storch and Steyr write that all the scare-mongering has had a devastating impact. Claims that climate change will lead to climate wars, death, disease, refugees, etc. are “not only perceived as attempts by single groups of scientists to gain recognition and financing, but also lead to perceptions that everything is connected to climate change.” Von Storch and Steyr write:
This either gets understood as absurdity or leads to the acceptance of an inevitable fate.”
Von Storch and Steyr cite recent US surveys that show society no longer trusts scientists.
Factual discussions hardly take place between climate science, civil societal organizations, and politics. The acceptance of climate science as a competent, objective interpreter is disappearing.”
They conclude:
It’s time for scientists to devote themselves to science once again. The societal climate debate has to open up.”
If anything else can be concluded, it is that something has gone terribly wrong and that major overhauls of the entire process are long overdue and in dire need. And when Der Spiegel, who started this whole mess 25 years ago, starts bringing it up, then you know something is afoot.

"Four teenage girls are among dozens of protesters demanding government action on climate change to be arrested in Sydney on Monday. The Extinction Rebellion climate protests movement has planned a “spring rebellion” from Monday to Sunday, including marches aimed at blocking traffic. The protesters in Sydney were arrested and bundled into a mobile “custody unit” on Monday afternoon after they allegedly failed to move on when asked to do so by police. Some 30 people were arrested, including four girls aged under 16, organisers say. “Alleged offences committed range from obstructing traffic to disobeying reasonable direction,” New South Wales police said in a statement. The assistant commissioner Mick Willing said police respected the right of groups and individuals to protest, but “we have a responsibility to the community and local businesses to ensure they can go about their normal activities without being impacted on or put at risk”. “Unfortunately, despite the warnings issued by local police and our colleagues from across the country, this group continue to set out to break the law and put themselves and others at risk,” Willing said in a statement. Monday’s rally saw hundreds of people march from Belmore Park to Sydney’s CBD via Pitt Street. Among those walking were sisters 10-year-old Luka and 12-year-old Maddie Brett-Hall alongside Ember Henninger, also 10, from the Blue Mountains. The march was their second protest after they attended a flash mob at Echo Point earlier in 2019. “I feel like we need to make a difference,” Maddie told AAP. Young voices weren’t being listened to enough, Ember said. “The government tells us to just be kids ... and this makes me feel angry,” she said. Earlier in the day the Victorian activist Miriam Robinson said the group must “get right up in people’s grills” to convince governments to take firm action on climate change. “We always apologise for causing inconvenience,” the retired public servant told AAP on Monday. “But this is nothing compared to the inconvenience that is going to start happening when we start to run out of food and water.” The week’s events got off to a relaxed start in Melbourne with about 20 people attending a day-long meditation session on the steps of Victoria’s parliament. About 100 people were at the movement’s base camp at Carlton Gardens, where some people discussed the group’s values. But things are expected to ramp up in the evening, with protesters intending to make their presence known in the city by blocking an intersection. There was a notable presence in Canberra on Monday morning, when nearly 300 people marched across Commonwealth Bridge, blocking traffic. A march was also held in Brisbane, where people made their way across Victoria Bridge. In Hobart about 30 people crossed the Tasman Bridge, though they were on a public walkway, with another handful stationing themselves outside state parliament. In Perth, activists focused on the perspective of traditional owners and an Indigenous Welcome To Country ceremony. Police have warned they will intervene if there is violence, significant disorder or if a safety risk is identified. Extinction Rebellion specifically wants governments to “tell the truth” about climate change by declaring a climate and ecological emergency. It also wants them to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, and let the public drive decisions on climate change through a Citizens’ Assembly."

"The drought and water resources minister, David Littleproud, has acknowledged he “totally” accepts that worsening droughts are linked to climate change, as he signalled more taxpayer support for regional communities was coming as Australia’s big dry “escalates”. Littleproud, who stumbled last month by first telling Guardian Australia he did not know if climate change was manmade, then later clarifying he had always accepted the science on the role humans play in the climate changing, told the ABC on Sunday he understood the link between global warming and drought because “I live it”. The minister said the government had a responsibility to deal with climate change by facing up “to try and reduce our emissions”. But he said adaptation was now the main game. “This drought in my electorate alone has been going for eight years”. “The reality is, we can’t run away from that. We simply have to get on with it and equip our farmers and communities with the tools to be able to adapt as best they can”. Despite the fact emissions are rising, and have risen every year since the Coalition scrapped the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government, Littleproud said the government was living up to the commitments made under international climate agreements. He was also positive about the role of renewable energy. “We’re going to see 33,000 gigawatts of renewable energy put on in the next year or so. Most of that will happen in my own electorate. “We actually want to become the renewable energy electorate. Western Downs shire is screaming at me to become the renewable energy shire of the country with solar and wind,” the minister said. Asked whether he accepted that global warming meant some farms in Australia could become unviable, Littleproud said there was a market-led transition already under way. “We’ve seen farmers change their practices from being broad-acre back into grazing as the climate’s changed and as that’s taken its toll on its landscape.” He said farmers were already shifting with an eye to long-term viability and the question before government was how to assist people remaining on the land to adapt to changing conditions. Pressed on what the government’s drought strategy was, because the bulk of a $7bn package the Morrison government points to regularly has not yet been spent, Littleproud said the government was in the process of refining the package with input from significant stakeholders, such as the National Farmers Federation. The minister said he wanted the NFF to provide its strategy so he could “put that in front of cabinet” along with a report from the Joint Agency Drought Taskforce, which was established within the prime minster’s office and led by major general Stephen Day. He said the government was already acting on the recommendations from Day and would continue to work with state governments. Littleproud said what came next needed to extend outside his portfolio to a “whole of government” response, including health, education and infrastructure. The minister said drought was complex, impacting farmers but also on whole communities. “It’s not just farmers, it’s the small business owners – building that infrastructure to build the resilience into the future.” Labor last week asked the auditor general to investigate the government’s claimed $7bn in drought assistance, saying the drought response to date had been “ad hoc, confusing and lacking in direction”. The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has declared the Coalition risks “political annihilation” in the bush if the drought worsens and it does not start building dams – but there has also been controversy about the quality of Joyce’s own input as special drought envoy. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud was also asked about recent comments from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who declared protesters who disrupt traffic should have their welfare payments cut and be subjected to mandatory jail sentences, part of a rhetoric offensive by conservative MPs against climate change protests. Littleproud responded in low-key fashion but broadly backed Dutton’s arguments on Sunday morning. “Everyone wants a cause these days. They become angry and impose their will on the Australian people. What this should be is about respect. “I get everyone wants a cause. Everyone’s got to be angry these days. But for Christ’s sakes, respect your fellow Australians,” the minister said. He said the Morrison government had taken action against animal activists “that impinged on the rights of farming families, and we passed legislation. “But a lot of this comes back to the states. We wouldn’t have to do the heavy lifting if the states got in there and imposed higher penalties for these activists so that the magistrates had nowhere to go but to slip into them.”"
"Our diets can have a big environmental impact. The greenhouse gas emissions involved in producing and transporting various foods has been well researched, but have you ever thought about the water-scarcity impacts of producing your favourite foods? The answers may surprise you. In research recently published in the journal Nutrients, we looked at the water scarcity footprints of the diets of 9,341 adult Australians, involving more than 5,000 foods. We measured both the amount of water used to produce a food, and whether water was scarce or abundant at the location it was drawn from. The food system accounts for around 70% of global freshwater use. This means a concerted effort to minimise the water used to produce our food – while ensuring our diets remained healthy – would have a big impact in Australia, the driest inhabited continent on Earth. We found the average Australian’s diet had a water-scarcity footprint of 362 litres per day. It was slightly lower for women and lower for adults over 71 years of age. A water-scarcity footprint consists of two elements: the litres of water used, multiplied by a weighting depending on whether water scarcity at the source is higher or lower than the global average. Foods with some of the highest water-scarcity footprints were almonds (3,448 litres/kg), dried apricots (3,363 litres/kg) and breakfast cereal made from puffed rice (1,464 litres/kg). In contrast, foods with some of the smallest water-scarcity footprint included wholemeal bread (11.3 litres/kg), oats (23.4 litres/kg), and soaked chickpeas (5.9 litres/kg). It may surprise you that of the 9,000 diets studied, 25% of the water scarcity footprint came from discretionary foods and beverages such as cakes, biscuits, sugar-sweetened drinks and alcohol. They included a glass of wine (41 litres), a single serve of potato crisps (23 litres), and a small bar of milk chocolate (21 litres). These foods don’t only add to our waistlines, but also our water-scarcity footprint. Previous studies have also shown these foods contribute around 30% of dietary greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. The second highest food group in terms of contributing to water-scarcity was fruit, at 19%. This includes whole fruit and fresh (not sugar-sweetened) juices. It should be remembered that fruit is an essential part of a healthy diet, and generally Australians need to consume more fruit to meet recommendations. Dairy products and alternatives (including non-dairy beverages made from soy, rice and nuts) came in third and bread and cereals ranked fourth. The consumption of red meat – beef and lamb – contributed only 3.7% of the total dietary water-scarcity footprint. These results suggest that eating fresh meat is less important to water scarcity than most other food groups, even cereals. Not surprisingly, cutting out discretionary foods would be number one priority if you wanted to lower the water footprint of the food you eat, as well as the greenhouse gas emissions of production. Over-consumption of discretionary foods is also closely linked to weight gain and obesity. Eating a variety of healthy foods, according to energy needs, is a helpful motto. Aside from this, it is difficult to give recommendations that are relevant to consumers. We found that the variation in water-scarcity footprint of different foods within a food group was very high compared to the variation between food groups. For example, a medium sized apple was found to contribute a water-scarcity footprint of three litres compared with more than 100 litres for a 250 ml glass of fresh orange juice. This reflects the relative use of irrigation water and the local water scarcity where these crops are grown. It also takes more fruit to produce juice than when fruit is consumed whole. Two slices of wholegrain bread had a much lower water-scarcity footprint than a cup of cooked rice (0.9 litres compared with 124 litres). Of the main protein sources, lamb had the lowest water-scarcity footprint per serve (5.5 litres). Lambs are rarely raised on irrigated pastures and when crops are used for feeding, these are similarly rarely irrigated. Consumers generally lack the information they would need to choose core foods with a lower water-scarcity footprint. Added to this, diversity is an important principle of good nutrition and dissuading consumption of particular core foods could have adverse consequences for health. Perhaps the best opportunities to reduce water scarcity impacts in the Australian food system lie in food production. There is often very large variation between producers in water scarcity footprint of the same farm commodity. For example, a study of the water scarcity footprint of tomatoes grown for the Sydney market reported results ranging from 5.0 to 52.8 litres per kg. Variation in the water-scarcity footprint of milk produced in Victoria was reported to range from 0.7 to 262 litres. This mainly reflects differences in farming methods, with variation in the use of irrigation and also the local water scarcity level. Water-scarcity footprint reductions could best be achieved through technological change, product reformulation and procurement strategies in agriculture and food industries. This is the first study of its kind to report the water-scarcity footprint for a large number of individual self-selected diets. This was no small task, given that 5,645 individual foods were identified. Many were processed foods which needed to be separated into their component ingredients. It’s hard to say how these results compare to other countries as the same analysis has not been done elsewhere. The study did show a large variation in water-scarcity footprints within Australian diets, reflecting the diversity of our eating habits. Water scarcity is just one important environmental aspects of food production and consumption. While we don’t suggest that dietary guidelines be amended based on water scarcity footprints, we hope this research will support more sustainable production and consumption of food.

"Twenty of the UK’s leading universities have struck a £50m deal to buy renewable energy directly from British windfarms for the first time. The collaborative clean energy deal will supply electricity from wind farms across Scotland and Wales to universities including Newcastle University, University of Exeter and Aberystwyth University. The landmark deal, known as a “power purchase agreement” or PPA, is the first time that UK public sector energy users have clubbed together to buy clean electricity. The PPA was arranged by deal brokers at The Energy Consortium and Squeaky Clean Energy to fix the price of renewable electricity from a portfolio British windfarms for the next 10 years. The universities will be guaranteed clean energy by the windfarm owner, Norwegian energy giant Statkraft, which will issue certificates matching the output of the windfarms. James Rolfe, the chief operating officer at Anglia Ruskin University, which is part of the deal, said the university has joined others in declaring a climate emergency, and plans to be climate neutral by 2030. “To support this commitment we aim to source all of our electricity from zero carbon sources by 2025, and this power purchase agreement makes a significant contribution towards this goal whilst delivering financial savings and budget stability,” he added. Richard Murphy, the managing director of The Energy Consortium, said the “groundbreaking deal” would help universities reduce their carbon emissions and save money by accessing the power purchase market for the first time. Murphy helped arrange one of the first major corporate energy deals in Europe in 2008 to supply supermarket giant with renewable energy. Since then the PPAs have remained the preserve of larger, multi-site corporations because most renewable energy developers require hefty deals over long contract periods, according to Murphy. One of the UK’s largest deals was struck last year between Budweiser brewer AB InBev and solar developer Lightsource BP to build 100MW of solar power, without subsidy, to help power their nationwide operations. Last month, Google revealed the company’s $2bn plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. It is made up of 18 separate agreements to supply Google with 1,600MW of electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. Murphy said that collaborative energy purchase deals mean that even small institutions are now “able to navigate a previously inaccessible market” too. “The combined challenge facing the wider public sector is to secure reduced carbon emissions whilst saving money and I am delighted that these universities have secured both,” he said. • This article was amended on 10 October 2019 to clarify that this deal was the first between public sector energy users in the UK "

"For years, when the climate movement called for “connecting the dots,” they meant linking extreme weather to the broader story of human-caused climate breakdown. In the age of the Green New Deal, our job is to connect the dots in a different way: between the climate crisis and the crises of economic and racial inequality that afflict us every day. And we have an opportunity to get concrete – literally – by showing precisely how targeted green investment in racialized and working-class communities can slash carbon emissions. One truly radical and intersectional approach? Tackle the United States’ housing and climate crises at the same time – with a Green New Deal for housing.  Of course, the centrist climate wonks hate how expansive the Green New Deal idea is. They think every piece of its social policy is an expensive distraction. But they forgot to follow the carbon beyond their tidy little graphs. In the real world, you can’t separate the carbon causing the climate emergency from our physical and economic systems, any more than you can separate windows, furnaces, and air conditioners from your monthly rent bill. And you can’t separate voters’ – and political organizers’ – desires for a safe and affordable home from their commitment to a stable climate. In aggregate, the United States’ 138m housing units cause over 15% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, more than all commercial buildings combined. Housing inequality is also the biggest driver of the country’s horrifying wealth gap, with the median black family owning just $11,000, compared to the median white family owning over $135,000. And housing costs are destroying Americans’ budgets. Nearly 20m households spend over half their income on rent or mortgage payments. Another 20m pay over a third. While the climate movement flexes its muscles by holding climate strikes and blocking pipelines, housing movements all around the country are racking up wins, with campaigns like the Homes Guarantee putting national rent control on the mainstream political agenda. Anyone hoping to become the Democratic nominee should be able to answer the question: what will your climate plan do for the housing crisis? Or, to flip it around: What can your housing policies do for the climate emergency? Either way, a good answer should be the same: a lot. After all, the stories of inequality and energy converge. Homes’ carbon emissions are a reflection of something more visceral: brutal energy costs. Over a third of US households can’t readily afford their monthly utility bill, with people of color disproportionately burdened. One study found that the single main reason that people take out payday loans is to cover utility bills. The third most common reason? To make rent. So far, Bernie Sanders’ mammoth Green New Deal and Housing for All platforms go furthest in tackling these two crises together. Sanders’ plans call for building nearly 10m units of no-carbon, publicly funded housing. And his plans call for massive investments in green upgrades for existing public housing, and doing a massive energy efficiency retrofit program for other homes and buildings, with a focus on low-income residents who cannot afford their own upgrades. And Sanders’ plan calls for universal rent control and zoning changes to facilitate apartment building in affluent neighborhoods; together, these measures would greatly increase affordable density, the cornerstone of no-carbon urbanism. If you were wondering how a jobs guarantee would find work for everyone, now you know: making every home in the country safer, more comfortable, more affordable, and more climate-friendly. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also spoken about how beautiful, sustainable, and resident-friendly affordable housing complexes, with social services like childcare facilities on the ground floor, exemplify the conjoined social and ecological promise of a Green New Deal. We can push all this ambition forward, and make it even more specific. Here’s where the progressive group People’s Action’s Homes Guarantee campaign comes in. (Full disclosure: I was on the campaign’s policy team.) The Homes Guarantee plan’s headline demand is, to echo Bernie, yuge: 12m new units of social housing, built to emit net zero carbon emissions, include a mix of incomes (with the priority going to very low-income households), and built in a way that pioneers low-carbon and sustainable construction methods. Indeed, Sanders’ more recent housing plan explicitly echoes People’s Action’s proposal, from specifics like its Green New Deal tie-ins to its all-encompassing ambition. Sanders’ plan states outright that “we need a homes guarantee”. Yes, it’s counterintuitive to call for a big homebuilding program when we need to emit less. But here’s the thing. In the decades ahead, upwards of 13 million people living in the US could be displaced by sea level rise. Tens of millions of immigrants could – and should – come live in the US. Tens of millions of people will need new homes in the years ahead. It’s precisely through public regulation and public building that we ensure that new homes are net zero carbon. This will vastly reduce overall energy demand, making it much easier to reach zero carbon in our energy system fast. Projects of new and retrofitted affordable housing in the US and around the world are already pioneering green housing techniques. And it’s through those policies that we will develop the skills to slash the ecological footprint of new construction, through more efficient techniques of homebuilding, and by driving sustainable innovations in building materials, like no-carbon concrete. In this way, a Green New Deal for housing would have benefits that go beyond directly affected residents, by driving down the costs of going green for everyone. At the neighborhood level, Sanders and the Homes Guarantee call for making every social housing complex a resiliency center to keep people safe during disasters and heat waves. Our choice is private inefficiency, waste, and injustice, or equality and sustainability through public action, finally providing everyone with a decent home. The Homes Guarantee platform also calls for national rent control and pro-apartment zoning changes. And it calls for green upgrades to existing public housing, getting rid of natural gas and toxic mold. And the platform calls for massive investment into racialized communities to lift up households of color and tackle environmental injustice, through a vast array of careful policies, from energy retrofits to facilitating community land trusts to increasing access to clean transit to universal rent control to protecting families from displacement. A Green New Deal for Housing would be an effective and efficient lever for decarbonizing the economy, creating good jobs, and increasing social, economic, and racial justice. And its core components are already popular. Over the last year, polling by the think tank Data for Progress, where I’m a senior fellow, found majority support for many of this plan’s most crucial elements long before it was put together. In one poll, majorities of both Democrats and Independents – and an overall majority of 57% of total respondents – said that green investments should be prioritized in frontline communities, namely the working class and racialized neighborhoods that have suffered most from pollution and disinvestment. Majority support holds up even when respondents are told this green investment would require tax raises. This past April, Data for Progress also found majority support for the idea that the government should fund enough non-profit and public housing units to ensure that every American without a home should get one (60% support, 23% opposition, 17% no opinion). They found majority support for a policy creating a $50bn fund to weatherize all low-income homes (58% support, 23% opposition, 19% no opinion). And they found strong support for the idea that there that smaller, low-cost housing should be built in middle- and upper-middle-class neighborhoods (49% support, 25% opposed, 26% no opinion). Is it really so impractical to link climate policy and housing policy – the climate movement and the housing movement – around solutions that would tackle both crises at once? With the climate emergency, everything is connected. We know why that’s dangerous. It’s time to talk about the benefits of all that intersectionality: we can – indeed must – solve our most pressing crises at the same time. Daniel Aldana Cohen is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2. He’s also a senior fellow at Data for Progress, and a member of the Homes Guarantee policy team"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s media is sick and intolerant at times, seemingly continuing a once infamous tradition.
Yesterday NDR German public television had an interview with Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author with Sebastian Lüning of the bestselling book Die kalte Sonne now sweeping through Germany. The NDR piece is dubbed: “Vahrenholt and the ‘CO2 lies'”. The clip first introduces the climate topic and reminds viewers that “that man is causing global warming and storms.”
Established climate science is indignant about the scrutiny
NDR first questions Hartmut Grassl and Jochem Marotzke, both of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Grassl, obviously agitated by Vahrenholt’s skeptical book, crossly replies:
Ach, actually I have no desire to comment on such nonsense.”
If you listen closely, you’ll hear a burst of laughter from some hyena in the background. Jochem Marotzke also takes the same snobby attitude: No one should question AGW. Why the indignant reaction from Marotzke and Grassl? One can only speculate.
Suppressing open debate
Perhaps they feel that a chemistry professor (Vahrenholt) and a geologist (Lüning) have no business doubting their science. But my guess is that they are completely embarrassed, and thus terrified, about having been duped by what is turning out today to be a really dumb and simplistic hypothesis: climate trace gas CO2 rules the climate and other factors play no role. These two scientific men bought into the global warming end-of-the-world catastrophe hook, line and sinker. They have absolutely no desire to have all this exposed by an open debate.
And as Lüning writes at the “Die kalte Sonne site here:
One gets the sense they are now trying harder than ever to suppress debate.”

NDR could not resist delivering a low blow to Vahrenholt. The used old footage of him when he was Environment Senator for Hamburg over 20 years ago. The footage shows the young Vahrenholt climbing down through a manhole while the reporter says: “He has opted to descend into another world.” NDR’s message to the viewers is clear: “Skeptics belong in the sewers.  Now you know how nasty things can get in Germany.
Critics should first read the book
The NDR interview with Vahrenholt on the other was well handled.
During the interview, Vahrenholt’s calls out the major error made by the IPCC, not properly taking the sun and ocean currents into account, and falsely assigning all the warming to CO2 from 1980 to 2000. ARD asked Vahrenholt to respond to Mojib Latif’s recent criticism, also indignant. Vahrenholt replied.
“He really ought to first read the book.”
They all should read the book. From their comments, it’s clear that they haven’t, and they seem stunningly ignorant of the latest science – or they simply just don’t want to talk about it.
Good news! The book is selling like hot cakes – no. 14 on bestseller list
Here’s a little anecdote. I live in a small town and four weeks ago I ordered two copies of “Die kalte Sonne” from our local bookshop here in town – one for myself and one for the bookshop display window, which the owner kindly allowed. I told the owner that the book was highly controversial and politically incorrect. “What do you mean?” he asked. I told him “the book doesn’t believe in the climate catastrophe!” He just laughed.
Today the bookshop owner sent me a message to let me know that “Die kalte Sonne” is now on the Spiegel bestseller list and that customers have been snapping them up, and that he’s been ordering more copies.Then he told me on the phone that once a book is on the Spiegel bestseller list, then sales pick up.
So expect tens of thousands of copies to be sold nationwide!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader brings our attention to a paper published by the Quaternary Science Reviews, authored by Liang Chen, Karin A.F. Zonneveld, and Gerard J.M. Versteegh of the University of Bremen: Short term climate variability during “Roman Classical Period” in the eastern Mediterranean.This one is about a temperature reconstruction from Southern Italy going back 2000 years. The abstract states:
Climatic and environmental reconstructions based on a dinoflagelate cyst record from a well dated site in the Gulf of Taranto located at the distal end of the Po-river discharge plume have been established with high temporal resolution in order to obtain insight into potential forcing of short-term climatic and oceanographic variability in the southern Italian region during the “Roman Classical Period” (60 BC – AD 200).
So how much does the reconstruction say us humans and our CO2 emissions have warmed the planet since the Roman days? Here’s what the abstract concludes (emphasis added):
The dinoflagellate cyst association indicates that local sea surface temperatures which in this region are strongly linked to local air temperatures were slightly higher than today. We reconstruct that sea surface temperatures have been relatively high and stable between 60 BCeAD 90 and show a decreasing trend after AD 90.”
It was warmer back then!  Gee, did greenhouse gases cause the warming during the time of the Romans? What could it have been, we all wonder? Stop wracking your brains, the answer is:
Fluctuations in temperature and river discharge rates have a strong cyclic character with main cyclicities of 7 – 8 and 11 years.”
11 years? Now why does this number sound familiar? Could it have anything to do with a certain solar cycle that is very well known (at least outside of the IPCC)? The abstract continues:
We argue that these cycles are related to variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation climate mode. A strong correlation is observed with global variation in delta14C anomalies suggesting that solar variability might be one of the major forcings of the regional climate. Apart from cyclic climate variability we observed a good correlation between non-cyclic temperature drops and global volcanic activity indicating that the latter forms an additional major forcing factor of the southern Italian climate during the Roman Classical Period.”
Yet another reconstruction showing the sun at work. Today, however, the sun doesn’t do anything. At least that’s what the experts at the IPCC would like to have us believe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a presentation by the past Chairman of the American Solar Energy Industry, Armageddonist Chuck Kutscher, another person who can only be happy if he’s convinced the future is filled with doom and gloom.

h/t: Chris Smith
This is Al Gore repackaged. This is really a sorrowful, populist presentation. How did Kutscher get a PhD! We will redebunk this point by point.
It’s getting late – and I’ve watched the first half. Will finish tomorrow.
I can tell you right now that Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s new book Die kalte Sonne, using the latest data and peer-reviewed literature, completely demolishes every single point Kutscher makes. Sheesh – Kutscher is still stuck on TSI!
I can’t believe there are so many gullible suckers out there like Chris taking this crap in hook, line and sinker.
Debunking the presentation:
1. 4:30 mark – “Well-heeled misinformation campaign.” That’s bogus. Most of the doubt arises from privately run blogs with little or no money (Climate Audit, WUWT, etc.) and a rapidly growing number of skeptical scientists who are finding loads of flaws in the science. From time to time some media outlets are reporting on this. Public observation has also failed to detect the occurrence of any of the horror predictions. The warmist movement on the other hand is funded by billions.
2. 5:00 mark – “Climategate e-mails show the scientists wanted to get the message out.” Oh, that’s why they defied the requirements of thr FOIA and refused to make the data public. Read The Hockey Stick Illusion

3. 5:30 mark – “Independent panels exonnerated the Climategate scientists.” It’s proven that these were whitewashes led by warmist hacks. McIntyre has gone through all that.
4. 9:15 mark – “Mann’s hockey stick was fundamentally correct.” The national Academy of Sciences said Mann’s hockey stick was rubbish. The new ones that were made to replace it were also shown by McIntyre to be flawed as well. Don’t worry, we will go back and dig it all up again. The 2007 IPCC report did drop it. The one they depicted on page 457 was buried under the updated ones, which brought back the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.  Here’s the IPCC hockey stick history.

Share this...FacebookTwitterARD German public television presented a short clip of Fritz Vahrenholt  and the contents of his new book during its early morning show on Monday. ARD had an agitated Prof Mojib Latif on to respond.It is still unclear why Latif is agitated with Vahrenholt to begin with, as they both agree that CO2 is only half responsible for the recent warming.
Most likely it all has something to do with Latif’s love of being in the media limelight. He’ll say anything to get on TV.
Lüning responds to Latif’s TV comedy
Sebastian Lüning, co-author of the book “Die kalte Sonne” together with Vahrenholt, responds to Latif’s comments at his http://www.kaltesonne.de website, which I present in English as follows:
Early risers today were able see a report about “Die kalte Sonne” on the ARD-Morgen magazin. The report gave an overview of the book’s positions and of Fritz Vahrenholt. Then Mojib Latif appeared in the studio, and was visibly agitated with Vahrenholt. In addition to a tirade that is truly worth watching, Latif attempted to refute the book’s main assertions. According to Latif, it could be shown just by looking at the temperature development of the stratosphere that the sun has no big impact on the course of the climate, CO2 and the sun here would lead to completely different developments. Both of these competing climate factors would each have their own characteristic fingerprint, and so it would be possible to distinguish between the two. Latif: ‘Up there 30, 40, 50 kilometers in altitude we are measuring a massive cooling. And that is precisely the effect of of CO2. That can only be explained by CO2…” .
The audience, comprised mainly of laymen, probably were impressed by Latif’s every word. Latif then delivered the knockout punch, and summarized for the audience: ‘That means that I don’t need 400 pages to show it’s the sun. I need a full two sentences to show that it’s CO2.’

Unfortunately for Prof. Latif, stratospheric cooling cannot be in any way a strong indicator for a powerful climate impact by CO2 because:
1) The cooling of the stratosphere occurred mainly during the 1980-1995 phase, a time when the ozone layer was thinned out by FCKW emissions, as the following figure depicts:

Source: Ozone concentration/stratosphere (left) and temperatures/stratosphere (right): Avajon et al. 2007, also see webpage of Prof. Scott Mandia and webpage of Markus Gronotte.
The thinning out of the ozone led to a continuous decline in stratospheric absorbed solar energy, which led to a cooling in the stratosphere. In the 1990s, CFC emissions were cranked back by the Montreal Protocol and the ozone layer has been slowly recovering since 1995. Since 1995 there’s been no significant temperature changes – the values have been oscillating about a plateau.
For Latif, explaining why CO2 is the dominant driver can be done in only two sentences. Exposing these people for who they really are is turning out to be much easier than imagined. In the interview he says he did not even buy the book, and that he only read a few excerpts of it. Latif is not serious with his conclusion on the book.

"In the Mall, up Whitehall, or crossing Trafalgar Square early this morning, the climate activists looked like rush-hour office workers and civil servants – mainly 30 to 50-year-olds, with no dreadlocked tree-huggers, SWP banners or black-masked anarchists looking for a punch-up. Chanting about the climate emergency, frankly, they seemed a bit sheepish, not used to it. Their ordinariness makes Extinction Rebellion, or XR, especially effective: farmers, scientists, doctors, Cumbrians and other local platoons stand at the 12 key roadblocks. After their successful capture of central London in April, local cells or “affinity groups” all over the country have trained and planned for this protest. Deciding who would be “arrestable” for highway obstruction – and who wouldn’t be, because of jobs or young families – they were primed to expect a tougher police response after rightwing press complaints against the friendly policing last April, when officers were caught dancing at a blocked Oxford Circus. “I do wonder if protest makes a difference,” an office manager in her 40s from Hertfordshire said to me. “But what else can you do? My children really made me feel I must.” A steward in a pink gilet, a mother from south London, said the same: “It was my children who got me into this.” Thousands more are expected to join. For those who doubt the effect of last April’s XR protests, Ben Page of Ipsos Mori says: “In our polls in 2013, 59% said the planet was ‘heading for disaster’. This year it’s gone up to 78%.” He reckons Greta Thunberg, the school strikes and XR action played their part. What packs an extra punch is that London is just one of 60 global cities engaged in “uprising” at the same time. To those who say why bother, when the UK is too small for our carbon emissions to matter, this synchronised global action reaches all those leaders who attended last month’s UN climate change summit – where the UN general secretary warned: “We face a direct existential threat.”  I think few of these protesters read the rightwing press to know what they’re up against. In a double-page spread in the Mail on Sunday, Douglas Murray, Spectator associate editor and author of Neoconservatism: Why We Need it, launched a blistering attack on climate protesters and soft policing tactics. He writes: “Their refusal to acknowledge any view but their own deranged belief and their defiance of democratic norms is authoritarian, even fascistic … Despite the childish certainty these extremists promote, the science of climate change is deeply contested. Most scientists agree there are variations going on but they disagree on exactly what causes it.” So that’s where the climate deniers are now, ignoring Nasa’s survey showing 97% of global climate scientists agree that the five warmest years have been the past five, “extremely likely due to human activities”. Never mind the science: what free-market obsessives like Murray can’t bear is that solving the climate crisis requires state and international action. He would rather boil to oblivion, faithful to his free-market creed, than see the planet saved by means he regards as statist or even socialist. “Anarchists” and “warmed-over communists” demanding “draconian solutions”, he calls the protesters. His disgust spews out at Thunberg, “this privileged young girl … hectoring others on things she barely understands … delivering unhinged sermons to the credulous global elites”. Among the deadly weapons used against activists is that too many are middle class, and they are all climate hypocrites. Progressives are prone to self-flagellation, but being climate-pure is impossible. Do what you can, cast off the guilt. Murray’s is the blind rage of the losing side. David Attenborough is believed, not the Mail on Sunday. Even delivery drivers angry at the roadblocks weren’t denying the gravity of the cause. Weekly the news tells of sea ice and glaciers melting, species vanishing, the emergency evident: pollsters find people well understand it and trust the scientists who say humans are the cause. Murray accuses XR of wanting to “engineer the complete destruction of the global economic system”. But this highly democratic group is carefully nonprescriptive. All they ask is for politicians to accept the emergency, for a much tighter target than 2050 for net-zero carbon (the UK is already badly behind, our statutory Committee on Climate Change says) – and for a citizens assembly, such as President Macron has just set up with a sample group of 150 citizens to advise on how France can cut carbon emissions. That’s the task: finding solutions people will vote for. At the party conferences, the Tories barely mentioned climate, while Boris Johnson talks of fuel tax cuts. But Labour puts a green industrial strategy at the heart of its spending plans, building renewables in wind and solar, solar panels and insulation for a million social homes, £3.6bn on charging points and free loans for electric cars, nationalising the grid for a vast expansion of 37 offshore wind farms, tidal energy from Swansea Bay and no fracking. The UK may be entering a climate culture change that Page compares to the shift in our lifetimes from locking up gay people to a recent poll that found 66% would have no concerns about a same-sex marriage in the royal family. Flying, driving, eating beef may go the way of smoking – but only if the heavy lifting is done by the state. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

"Scientists are working to breed sheep that produce less greenhouse gases in order to reduce their impact on the environment. The Grass to Gas initiative will combine international scientific and industry expertise to measure two major factors affecting the environmental consequences of the livestock – feed efficiency and methane emissions.  Its goal is to develop ways to identify animals with a lower impact, which can then be selected for breeding programmes. Nicola Lambe, a sheep geneticist at Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC), said: “The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue requiring a transnational and transdisciplinary approach. “The project aims to produce tools to measure, or accurately predict, feed efficiency and methane emissions from both individual animals and sheep systems, which will provide the international industry with the means to breed, feed and manage sheep with reduced environmental impact as part of genetic improvement initiatives. “It will also contribute towards addressing the argument about the effect of eating meat on global warming, with sheep making use of land often unsuitable for other agricultural production, except conifers – at least in the UK.” The first phase of the three-year project, which runs until September 2022, will test different methods for their ability to accurately predict feed intake and methane emissions from sheep. Using technologies that show promise, researchers will then investigate the relationship between these two factors from sheep housed both indoors and at pasture. Genetic control of emissions and feeding will also be looked at in the project, by assessing the differences due to breed, parent, genetic line or breeding values. The research led by SRUC will use lambs bred from male sheep – known as sires – sourced from the Texel Sheep Society’s Texelplus programme, to investigate the effects of sire and breeding values on these measurements. Data will also be analysed to quantify the economic and environmental benefits of improvements in feed efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The UK part of the project will receive £250,000 in funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Research Council of Norway and New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries."
"Ridhima Pandey was just nine years old in 2017 when she filed a lawsuit against the Indian government for failing to take action against climate change. Pandey’s fierce, astounding passion for the environment is not accidental. Her mother is a forestry guard and her father an environmental activist; and the whole family was displaced by the Uttarakhand floods of 2013, which claimed hundreds of lives. In Kenya Kaluki Paul Mutuku has been actively involved in conservation since college, where he was a member of an environmental awareness club, and has been a member of the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change since 2015. Raised in rural Kenya by a single mother, Mutuku’s vigorous activism, like Pandey’s, was inspired by the direct challenges his family (and wider community) faced from the effects of climate change: “Growing up, I witnessed mothers cover kilometres to fetch water,” he says.  For years, young people across the world have been campaigning to draw attention to the crisis our planet faces, and to tackle it. Yet it seems the media is only interested in one young climate activist. Without doubt, the remarkable Greta Thunberg is a superstar. In just one year, she has gone from being an unknown teenager, living in the comfort of a middle-class home in Sweden, to being one of the most recognised faces on the planet. She is fearless, earnest, passionate about the planet and determined. But so are her peers. Born in a wealthy country, to parents who can afford to accommodate their daughter’s convictions, and in a culture where children are encouraged to speak up, Thunberg has intersecting privileges. She is aware of this and regularly mentions her fellow youth activists in her speeches, to remind journalists that there are others working alongside her. People such as the teenager Aditya Mukarji, who in March 2018 began a war against plastic straws. Within just five months, he had already helped replace more than 500,000 plastic straws at restaurants and hotels in New Delhi. “People listen more to children bringing up environmental concerns,” he says. Last year Nina Gualinga, an indigenous activist from the Ecuadorian Amazon since the age of eight, won the WWF’s top youth conservation award. At 15, Autumn Peltier from the Anishinaabe people of Canada, is a veteran clean water and climate advocate. And Leah Namugerwa is a 15-year-old Ugandan activist.  There are many more whose names we rarely, if ever, hear. Yet, frustratingly, these other activists are often referred to in the media as the “Greta Thunberg” of their country, or are said to be following in her footsteps, even in cases where they began their public activism long before she started hers – their own identities and work almost completely erased by a western media that rarely recognises progress outside its own part of the world. This tendency of the media to present Thunberg as the one who calls, and the others existing only to heed her call, is problematic, especially for those black and brown activists whose media invisibility leads to invisibility to organisations whose help they could greatly benefit from. This “white saviour” narrative invalidates the impact of locals working in their communities, and perpetuates the stereotype of “the native with no agency” who cannot help themselves. As an African I find these portrayals deeply offensive. It is insulting to present the members of the communities most threatened by climate change as passive onlookers who are only now being spurred on by the “Thunberg effect”. Why did it take a Thunberg for the UN to organise its first youth climate summit? Those most affected should not be exiled to the fringes of the conversation. These other activists are being told their works, their contributions, don’t matter. The privileging of one campaigner’s narrative over others creates a world where Namugerwa would mention a Swedish teenager she only heard about a year ago as inspiration, but not Wangari Maathai, the environmentalist from neighbouring Kenya who won the Nobel peace prize in 2004. One could argue that it is natural for Namugerwa to find inspiration in a young girl close to her in age, but it is also likely that Maathai’s Green Belt Movement influenced her and her friends’ decision to plant trees on their birthdays to help the environment. Planting trees. Collecting litter. Striking for the environment. I am in awe of all the young people calling attention to a very real and urgent problem. I applaud all of them for doing what they can, in big and small ways, to combat climate change. I must also acknowledge the young children in Kenya and Nigeria and other parts of the developing world who make toys out of recycled plastic and metal, and who would probably not know to call themselves climate advocates. I applaud Bangladesh for being the first country to ban plastic bags in 2002, and Rwanda for banning non-biodegradable plastic in 2008 (and Kigali for being named by the UN as Africa’s cleanest city). One day at a time, our collective efforts may yet save the planet. And while we continue to work towards that goal, the moral thing for western media to do is to also highlight the contributions of the black and brown saviours trying to make that happen so that when future generations talk of it, this will not be the story of a single narrative. • Chika Unigwe is a Nigerian writer.

"In the last week alone, members of Extinction Rebellion have been described as ecomaniacs (Daily Mail), ecoradicals ignoring our economic doom (Times), dangerous and a bloody mess (Daily Telegraph). They have been accused of “pulling 83,000 officers away from their normal duties” according to the police and costing Scotland Yard £16m. In London last week, dressed in funereal black, rebels tried to paint the Treasury red using 1,800 litres of fake blood and an old fire engine with a sign reading “stop funding climate death”. While its actions may seem controversial in some quarters, Extinction Rebellion’s rise and influence have undoubtedly been extraordinary, galvanising young and old across party lines. Last October, the journalist and activist George Monbiot introduced the group in the national press, a homegrown movement “devoted to disruptive, non-violent disobedience in protest against ecological collapse”. The hope was to turn a national uprising into an international one by March. In fewer than 12 months, Extinction Rebellion has become the fastest-growing environmental organisation in the world.  “We have seen protest movements on climate change before, but they haven’t attracted anywhere near as many people or had as much impact,” said Clare Saunders, professor in environmental politics at Exeter University. “For the first time, you have ordinary people engaging with radical action. It’s unique – I can’t think of any [protest movement] historically happening in that way.” There are now an estimated 485 Extinction Rebellion affiliates across the globe and, over the next fortnight, they are promising to shut down 60 cities, including London, New York, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Cape Town and Mumbai. Government buildings, airports and financial districts will all be targeted with protests aiming for maximum disruption to provoke urgent political action. In a bid to pre-empt the action, on Saturday police raided a warehouse in south London and arrested nine activists, charging them with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and obstruct the highway. How did they come so far, so quickly? The Observer has watched the movement at work in city centres, at festivals and meetings across the UK to try to find out. “It’s maintaining hope in people because people are feeling so worn out by the inaction,” said Steven from Cardiff, who joined the summer uprising in the city in July. When the Observer met him, he and his partner Clare were sitting on the green outside the town hall, where Extinction Rebellion had set up base with a boat, an impromptu campsite and stalls serving free food to the public. “I’m not sure the damage to the planet is irreversible at this point – all the science points that way, it’s grim reading – but this is pricking people’s ears up more than any other group, and that can only be a good thing.” The Cardiff rebellion, staged over three days, saw a massive police presence deployed as a procession of families and activists marched through the city centre. Jules Bywater, a builder of eco-homes, had travelled from Powys to join the action. “People think going vegan, banning single-use plastic and recycling will stop climate change – it won’t. Government has to act, and it’s on us to cause these disruptions to force them to. This has to be a mass movement.” Alice Taherzadeh, a PhD student and one of the key organisers, was buoyant but exhausted. “We had less than a month to get this together,” she said. As a decentralised organisation, XR, as it is known, claims no hierarchy: it is open to all and operates a “regenerative culture”. In theory, this means responsibility and workload is designed to be a shared, collaborative effort with heavy emphasis on community, and mental and physical wellbeing. In practice, a hierarchy does still exist, albeit under the surface, where some people are in the loop, go to the pub together and have access to the latest comings and goings from HQ, while others volunteer more on the periphery. Still, to witness it across uprisings in London in the spring, and across the UK over the summer at festivals and meetings, the spirit of XR is warm and often moving. The culture it has fostered also allows for a surprising amount of internal criticism of its founders, Roger Hallam and Gail Bradbrook. “The movement and its principles are far bigger than both of them; they’re not these messianic figures they’re made out to be,” said Taherzadeh wearily. Hallam is a former organic farmer who went on to study civil disobedience at King’s College London after “the weather went weird” and caused his business to fail. He formed XR with Bradbrook, an academic involved with Occupy and anti-fracking protests, and the two have championed non-violent resistance and civil disobedience. Their methods, including advocating a shutdown of Heathrow, have been effective but divisive. “I don’t think Roger is the best spokesperson, necessarily,” said Taherzadeh. “Some of his tactics – drones at Heathrow for instance – have caused huge conflict. But the unity in the movement exists because of the three core demands: get government to tell the truth, get government to act now, and to draw up citizens’ assemblies.” There is a quiet desperation and sometimes despair at how hard and possibly futile any personal effort seems in the face of the climate crisis. But those touched by Extinction Rebellion find it impossible to ignore the ways in which they are contributing to global heating. This isn’t just about recycling, switching to bamboo toothbrushes and buying in bulk; people are re-insulating their homes, dramatically scaling back family holidays to eradicate air travel and, in increasing numbers, deciding not to have children at all. “I’m scared of my own future,” said Dahlia, a 20-year-old student at the Bristol uprising. “How could anyone think about having kids now? It’s not even just about the carbon footprint and population growth … what kind of world are you thinking they’re going to live in?” The summer rebellion in Bristol took over the city centre and installed a pink boat and white gazebos on the Bristol Bridge. Billy Bragg performed, and hundreds joined talks and workshops explaining how activism works, how to get involved and what legal rights might be for protesters who get arrested.  But it isn’t just for the loud and energetic, or those willing to go to prison for the cause. At a crafting session in Totnes, a dozen women quietly work on their “craftivist” skills; almost every one joined XR in the last few months, and they volunteer as behind-the-scenes environmentalists making flags, banners and the like. Some are put off by the noise and physical toll of being on the streets; others describe themselves as too introverted to protest in that way. Yet the zeal is still palpable. “We’ve just spent our family holiday in the UK,” said Sarah Strachan. “Once you learn about it, read up on it … I can’t countenance how we could fly somewhere. You just can’t, and it does consume you. But how can you not try?” Strachan works as an artist in Totnes and lives with her partner and their son and daughter. She began making tiny doll figures of the school strikers last year, as a casual distraction from the puppets she was already crafting in her home studio. Nine months ago, she had barely heard of Extinction Rebellion, but in the summer she joined the rebellion in Bristol and is working for the next one. At home and at work, the climate crisis has engulfed her; last month, Ghost, her biggest piece yet, went on display in a local church and is set to tour next year. In it, she assembled 1,000 donated and secondhand toy plastic animals, painted them white and installed them as an eerie-looking herd. “It came from the horrible realisation that these plastic animals will be around for hundreds of years and will outlive some, if not all, of the animals they’re modelled on. How have we let this happen?” Extinction Rebellion’s success goes beyond the efforts of its volunteers, known as rebels, who are determined, as they are often heard to say, to be on the right side of history. Business has also been under by pressure to respond to a shift in public opinion. A sustainable building designer, who asked not to give his name, said: “Extinction Rebellion have had a tangible impact. Would things be moving as fast otherwise? Shortly after [the spring rebellion], the UK government became the first to pledge to cut [greenhouse gas emissions] to almost zero by 2050. Every architectural and engineering practice has been or should be trying to work out how net-zero carbon can be delivered.” Since XR’s launch, the architecture, engineering and construction industries have all declared a climate emergency, committing to work together to reduce emissions and work in a sustainable fashion. At least 232 councils out of 408 across the UK have followed suit. Possibly as a gesture, 15 universities including Bristol, Newcastle, Manchester and Goldsmiths have done the same, as has the UK music industry and “Culture”, an umbrella group of more than 50 organisations and artists. The National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company have severed financial ties with Shell and BP respectively. It remains to be seen what all this activity translates into: while some organisations have simply adopted the vernacular, many are actively working to force change in their industries. Either way, Extinction Rebellion has been credited as a catalyst – albeit not one without criticism within the environmental movement. “Some grassroots groups hate them because they’re not anti-capitalist [enough], they are for-profit and pro-arrest,” said one anonymous worker from a major environmental organisation. “The pro bono lawyers’ group Green and Black Cross [GBC] have been working with activists for decades and they’ve taken on so much casework for XR – for free, despite them raising so much money and the core crew being paid – that it’s taken away from other crucial activism work.” Earlier in the summer, GBC ended its relationship with XR, citing “serious concerns about the safety of both legal observers and those taking part in action associated with Extinction Rebellion”. Meanwhile, Wretched of the Earth, “a grassroots collective for indigenous, black, brown and diaspora groups and individuals demanding climate justice”, wrote an open letter to XR asking that their voices and experiences not be erased from the fight. “Making people feel guilty without offering anything else is a waste,” said Sylvia Kingston on the bridge at the Bristol rebellion, when asked whether XR could do better to engage marginalised communities. She described herself as a pensioner standing up for my grandchildren” who, like so many others at XR gatherings, claimed she wasn’t an activist, “or a hippy”, or particularly on the left. “You want people to feel energised, which is why things like this are so necessary. Perpetual despair will burn you out … My generation, people like me, can afford to be here – and they should be.” While the momentum behind XR shows no sign of slowing yet, answers for what happens next aren’t in easy supply. “We’re not claiming to have solutions,” said Bywater. “There are experts for that, there is a great deal of technology, there is plenty of knowledge to be harnessed. What we’re doing is telling government to listen to that. To act. And that pressure can only come from more of us being here.” It’s seen as good that minds are being changed, even if XR’s demands are not always perceived as realistic. “They must know what they’re asking for – net zero carbon by 2025 – is virtually impossible. I guess their statement is a calculated risk,” said the building designer. Saunders agreed. “There are very good reasons that Greenpeace and WWF will have to publicly distance themselves from XR – if you have more radical actions out there, your organisation’s demands might seem reasonable and palatable to a government taking steps to act.”"
"Teams full of similar people underperform. While sameness can create cohesion, cookie-cutter teams can’t successfully compete with diverse teams that can draw on a broad range of talents, perspectives and insights. At least that’s what empirical data from lefty organisations including McKinsey, Credit Suisse and the IMF have to say. But facts have a well-known leftwing bias, so maybe a sporting analogy will help. The Men’s Rugby World Cup is now being played in Japan. Being a men’s competition, the teams are comprised solely of blokes, but there is still an incredible diversity in the physical and performance attributes of players involved. The tallest player, Rory Arnold, is 6 foot 10 inches while the shortest player, Fumiaki Tanaka of Japan, is 5 foot 5 inches. Some players have more than a decade of representative experience, while others are new to the World Cup. Some are fast, some are strong, some can really kick and some can really jump. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the team that wins the Rugby World Cup will not be full of clones of the “ideal player”.  There are lots of reasons why our parliaments, our company boards and our media feed should be as diverse as the communities that we live in. The main one is fairness. Most Australians aren’t white men between 50 and 70 years old (though I almost am!) but many of our most important institutions are chock full of men who fit that bill. Indeed, there are more men named John who run big companies in Australia than there are women. And more men named Peter. And David. Given that there is no evidence that men or Caucasians are more intelligent, creative or strategic than women or people of other races, it is inconceivable that the current gender and racial distribution of powerful positions is based on merit. Fairness alone requires this problem to be fixed. And then there is performance. Lest I invite the full fury of the rightwing commentariat for talking beyond my expertise, it’s probably best that I simply quote the virtue signallers from the International Monetary Fund who concluded that: “Our analysis springs from the observation – supported by considerable microeconomic evidence – that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards.” Achieving diversity among our leaders isn’t a purely progressive objective. Even Scott Morrison agrees, in principle, that his party needs to recruit more women into parliament. But, much like his “in-principle” commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he simply hasn’t been able to achieve much progress on gender equity yet. The main reason that we need diversity in our leaders is that our leaders are more than the sum of the decisions they make on our behalf. Leaders, via their behaviour and their identity, say something important about the organisations they represent, and about our society. Which brings me to Greta Thunberg. There is no doubt that older white men have a dominant voice in the Australian media landscape. And there is also no doubt that some of the loudest of those white male voices expressed the most outrage that a young woman was given a global platform on which to speak. Much has been written about why so many old conservative men felt so angry that a young woman would speak truth to power. But what sticks out for me is that the Australian men who raged the loudest claim to do exactly what Thunberg dared to do. You’d think they would at least applaud her chutzpah. Alan Jones doesn’t let titles like premier or prime minister stop him tearing shreds off guests who are brave enough to come on his show but are not “good enough” to meet the standards he sets for them. Likewise, Andrew Bolt. Whether it was the Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull or the Labor prime minister Julia Gillard, Bolt has felt free to let the world know whenever a politician or business leader doesn’t live up to his expectations. But how dare a young woman hold elected leaders to the same account. How dare a “child”, a “brat”, a mere “girl” have the same sense of entitlement to express her judgment as the old codgers? A former AFL player called Sam Newman asked: “WHO lets this shit have a platform? Mendacious, inbred sycophants, that’s who. #ClimateChangeHoax.” Who indeed. Maybe the 500,000 people who turned up at the march she led in Montreal? Maybe the 300,000 Australians who followed her lead and joined the climate strike last month? But let’s flip the question. Who gives former football players a loud voice in debates about climate change? Who gives Alan Jones the right to use violent language against female politicians? You guessed it, the boards and chief executives – who are overwhelmingly male. If corporate boards in Australia had a majority of young women setting organisational strategy and culture, it is hard to believe that men who repeatedly incite violence against women would remain on air. Similarly, it’s hard to believe that climate denial would be as common on boards dominated by younger people as it is in Australia today. Leaders matter. As former army chief Lieutenant General David Morrison once said: “The standard you walk past is the standard you accept.” For decades, Australian parliaments and corporate boards have accepted climate denial, racism, sexism and even violence against women as “the price we pay to live in a free country” or even “just the way people are”. But the world – and Australia – is gradually changing, even if the loudest voices are not. It took 119 years to overturn the New South Wales law against abortion and, when it finally happened, conservative Coalition MPs complained that the process was “rushed”. Similarly, it was conservative Coalition MPs who thought we “rushed” the equal marriage decision too. And, unsurprisingly, it’s the same group of people who believe we shouldn’t “rush” into reducing greenhouse gas emissions either. One of the most important roles our leaders play is to decide which problems are urgent and which can wait. Scott Morrison’s Coalition wants to prevent the use of the term “almond milk” and inquire into discrimination against men in the family courts. Greta Thunberg thinks we should stop building new coalmines and urgently increase investment in renewable energy. But who is she to say what’s important and what’s not? Doesn’t she know? We have parliaments, boards and a media full of older men to tell us what’s important. That’s why diversity really matters. • Richard Denniss is the chief economist at the Australia Institute"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s been lots of disingenuous criticism from the CO2 end-of the world warmists and Armageddonists aimed at Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s new best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. Much of it attacking Svensmark’s theory of solar amplification via cosmic rays.
Again. none have really read the book, they simply repeat the same old debunked arguments.
Henrik Svensmark hits back at the skeptics at the Die kalte Sonne site (scroll down to the English version):
Prof. Henrik Svensmark, Danish National Space Center (Copenhagen) on the criticism aimed at his solar amplifier via cosmic rays: 
Some people, including your critic Florian Freistetter on ScienceBlog, seem to think that physics is a democratic process and what matters is to count how many papers favour or disfavour each hypothesis. That of course is nonsense. All that really signifies is the evidence from observations and experiments, and how a theory stands up to attempts to falsify it. Remember Einstein’s comment on the pamphlet Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein (1931) – “If I were wrong, one would be enough”.
The hypothesis that cosmic rays strongly affect the climate offers a serious challenge to the more fashionable hypothesis that man-made greenhouse gases have been the main cause of climate changes. So it does not surprise me that many people try to falsify it. In fact it’s quite flattering that they go to so much trouble, when one good outcome (for them) should be enough, and in my opinion no such paper has been produced so far.
Freistetter suggests that all the recent papers say I’m wrong. That shows he is not very familiar with the climate physics literature. I think he has gone to some trouble to select papers against the cosmic-ray theory and ignore the favourable ones. Continue…
For the climate end-of-worlders  and critics like Freistetter, it would help to first climb out of the holes of ignorance before spouting off. Try reading for once. Freistetter admitted to ramming his head into the sand: “I never read the book. I didn’t want to buy it.” He doesn’t want to deal with arguments he can’t beat.
In his recent Blog-Artikel, Freistetter provided 1001 reasons why Prof. Svensmark is wrong about his solar amplifier via cosmic rays theory. Unfortunately for Freistetter, CERN’s results and historical correlations between sun and climate are ignoring his junk science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsually warmists screech that humans are 95% responsible for the recent warming, and that huge positive water vapor feedbacks will get involved in the future. So it’s not very often you hear a warmist admit that humans perhaps could be just half responsible for the warming of the last 100 years.This is what German climate expert Professor Mojib Latif said in an interview this morning with NDR public radio.
AUDIO HERE!
Forget all the obligatory “we’ve got to cut our emissions soon” stuff. When you look past that, Latif had a few surprises in his interview, mainly he’s keeping the door open that human GHG emissions may not be such a big problem after all. Call it the Great Disappearing Crisis.
1.15 mark: Latif says he sees no positive aspects coming out of Durban, thus confirming it was a failure (warmist point of view).
1.45 mark, Latif:
Durban failed. Durban was the 17th conference of this type, and one now has to ask if such conference make any sense.”

Interesting is at the 3:15 mark. The moderator even now admits that the seriousness of the greenhouse gas problem is actually disputed. This shows that even the media is repositioning. The moderator asks Latif what his view on climate is. Latif replies:
The fact is that there is climate change. The fact is that man is also at least 50% responsible for the warming over the last 100 years.”
50% responsible? If warming has been 0.7°C over the last 100 years, then according to Latif man’s share would only be about one third of a degree Celsius°. That would make a doubling of CO2 look awfully benign.
Latif is now a lukewarmer. Politically, he’s hot on renewable energy. But that’s a different topic.
Some readers will accuse me of twisting Latif’s words. Sorry, but 50% of 0.7°C is about a third of a degree. That’s major back-pedaling.

The TAZ comments:
…that countries will talk until 2015 and that they will obligate themselves beginning in 2020 to legally reduce emissions. Emerging countries like India and China have recognized this, but have gained time and sufficiently expanded the paragraphs to allow the real binding obligations to be undermined. The USA does not have to deal with anything until 2020.”
Der Spiegel writes:
“Greenpeace was disappointed. ‘The watered-down compromise coming from pressure by India and USA will not lead to an international binding climate treaty, but rather to a loosely binding agreement,’ said  Greenpeace climate expert Martin Kaiser. ‘The conference created a last-second loophole for the USA and fossil fuel industries with the help of India.’ Now another protracted negotiation process threatens.

…the result can be interpreted according to one’s own preference. For those who stayed up late into night they can claim that at least a paper everyone can agree on resulted in the end. But the critics point out, and correctly so, that as far as content is concerned, no agreement that would actually limit the emission of CO2 was reached. The appearance of an agreement is preserved.”
The FAZ writes:
Now a new global climate treaty will be negotiated that will include for the first time climate targets for the United Nations and emerging countries such as China and India. Environmentalists complain about the too many loopholes in the agreement.”
Die Zeit writes:
By the year 2015 a legally binding contract is to be drawn up to limit warming to 2°C.
The circus will go on.

After years of being ignored by AGW climate scientists and modelers, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has more recently been recognized as a factor in climate forcing.
The Met Office at the December 5-9, 2011 presentation at the Fall AGU Meeting reported that they now use AMO unfiltered in their interannual and decadal climate forecasts.  I have been writing about AMO since 2009 (see below) along with other writers. Some of the articles have appeared on WUWT and ICECAP blogs. More recently Bob Tisdale has done some fine in-depth analysis of AMO [see below]. It is not the intention of this brief article to repeat all that material nor to explain what AMO is, or is not, other than just to summarize as follows:
The AMO is an ongoing series of long-duration changes in the sea surface temperature of the North Atlantic Ocean, with cool and warm phases that may last for 20-40 years at a time and a difference of about 1°F between extremes. These changes are natural and have been occurring for at least the last 1,000 years.
The AMO index is calculated at NOAAPSD by using the Kaplan SST data set (5×5), determining the area-weighted average over the North Atlantic over 0-70N and then detrending this data. The AMO has affected air temperatures over much of the Northern Hemisphere, in particular Eastern North America and Western Europe. For more information on AMO refer to the references at the bottom of this article.
It is the intent of this brief article to offer some preliminary or early results from my own analysis of AMO and the Canadian East Coast climate correlation. I will leave detail analysis to those who make their living in this field.
The AMO seems to be a significant climate factor affecting Canadian East coast surface temperatures, including the air temperatures of the four Maritime provinces, Labrador and Quebec air temperatures and even sometime reaching as far west as Ontario. These areas represent about 20% of Canada’s total surface area.
The first graph shows the Canadian Atlantic Coast Annual Temperature Departure from 1961-1990 averages and the Annual AMO index for the years 1948-2010. This period was picked because it was the only period for which Environment Canada provides temperature data summaries. The graph shows that the Atlantic Coast annual temperature departures seem to fluctuate with the cycles of AMO. The warm cycle when AMO was positive 1926-1964, a cool cycle when AMO was negative or cool 1965-1994, and finally another warm cycle 1995 to the present when AMO has been mostly positive. The year 2010 was the warmest annual year for the Atlantic Coast post 1948 with a departure of 2.1°C.

Figure 2 below shows a similar pattern for the Atlantic Coast but for the winters. Note that the winter AMO index has been scaled up by a factor of 3 for better visibility.

Figure 3 below shows a similar pattern for the winters of Northeastern forests area which includes areas like Labrador, Northern Quebec and Ontario.

Figure 4 below is for the period 1990-2010 and illustrates in detail how the annual Atlantic temperatures went up as AMO went positive or warm in 1995.

Figure 5 below illustrates the post 1998 period and how the Winter Atlantic Coast and Northeastern Forests temperature departures both seem to follow the winter AMO pattern. Both are relatively flat or slightly declining. One can clearly see the temperature drop in 2009 when AMO went briefly negative during early part of 2009 for about 5 months. This may happen again during early 2012.

The sixth and final graph below shows the monthly trend of the AMO index since 2005. As of November it had gone negative for the first time since 2009 at -0.035.

Final comments
Temperature departures in Eastern Canada seem to follow the AMO index as we saw above. I tend to think that the current negative AMO level is temporary and seasonal only. I think the durations of negative and positive AMO cycles are variable and the next sustained negative or cool phase for the AMO may not start for few years more (possibly 2015). In my opinion a cooling will be first observable in the Arctic Ocean SST and in the Arctic atmosphere caused by more high altitude cold atmosphere transferred to lower levels in the Arctic region. The cooler Arctic together with a negative AO will in turn cool the North Atlantic Ocean and the AMO via currents and atmosphere links and eventually cool the land areas of the Eastern Coast of North America and Western Europe.
The predictive value of the negative AMO is that once AMO starts to go negative for a more sustained period (and it can be as long as 60 years and as little as 6 years), it can foretell of sustained global cooling (especially Northern Hemisphere) and adds to the cooling already caused by the cooler SST pattern in the North Eastern Pacific. Such a period existed 1964 -1976 (and to the late 1980’s for Europe) when both PDO and AMO were negative. A stronger negative PDO index is typically a result of both more negative SST anomalies in the NE Pacific in combination with more positive SST anomalies in the Central North Pacific. During the last cooler period for Europe, namely 1962-1987, a period of 26 years, 21 (80%) years had a negative or cool AMO. AMO was last negative from 1964 to 1995 or 31 years and prior to that it was negative from 1902 -1926 or 24 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger at our friends Science Skeptical brings us this jewel of German dissent. Professor Dr. rer. nat. Richard Dronskowski at Aachen University brings loud applause from what appears to be a lecture hall full of his students as he slams the AGW science and the hucksters behind it.

At the 1.10 mark he calls Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth “inconsistent” and reminds us how scientists “warned of cooling” in 1970s. At the 2.25 mark he brings up Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart:
No chart has been so falsified as the hockey stick chart. It’s an embarrassment for the IPCC.”
A little later he referred to it as a “nasty fabrication” that was debunked by a “Canadian think tank”. Dronskowski reminds his audience that the scientists are talking about “tenths of a degree” with error margins “of a full degree” and that “nobody can believe it”. At the 3:42 mark he again repeats:
“This hockey stick curve was a very very nasty fabrication designed to spread fear”.
At the 4.00 min. mark he shows the GISS temperature chart and reminds us at the 4.50 mark that:
It was supposed to get warmer, but the temperature hasn’t gone anywhere.”
He cautioned the audience that “the datasets are very shaky”. At the 5:45 mark he brings up consensus, and states emphatically:

There is absolutely no consensus. Zero consensus!”
And then slams Al Gore’s claim that CO2 caused warming, and not vice versa. At the 7.20 mark he tells the audience there is huge money in the game…”$100 billion a year flow because of climate change” and calls the government’s attempt to limit the temperature when it can’t even limit health insurance costs as “madness”. At this point the audience applauds loudly.
He then slams the corruptive effects that the funding has on academics: “I know colleagues who run entire institutes only with climate. There’s no way for them to back down, otherwise the institute will be ruined.”
At the 8.25 mark he reminds the audience:
I want to be clear. There is no causal effect! No consensus! Correlation is not proof!”
To illustrate the point he shows how US domestic oil production correlates with rock music quality, which brings thunderous applause from the audience.
This is indeed a surprising development for Germany. Prof Dronskowski should not wonder tomorrow morning why many other German scientists, who are swimming ingovernment climate funding, are suddenly no longer talking to him.
Prof. Richard Dronskowski a chemist and physicist. He has a faculty position at the Solid State and Quantam Chemistry Department at the RWTH Aachen and is the winner of the Otto Hahn Award of the Max Planck Society. He’s a member of the Collegium of the German Research Society, member of the German Physical Society, and the American Chemical Society.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSorry, but I always get a little nervous when top German and European officials put themselves first in line for a “new world order” that will tell the rest of the world how to behave. Other countries outside of Germany or Europe can and should decide for themselves how to live and run things.
Why do Europe’s elitists always view foreign ideas and ways as inferior?
CO2 Handel here reports that German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen, one of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leading officials, has declared climate protection the “new world order“.
Röttgen obviously has been having disturbing visions of a planet headed for a climatic catastrophe – unless us humans stop burning fossil fuels and start rain-dancing to the beat of appointed climate high priests. Never mind that global temperatures haven’t risen in 15 years, visions from green prophets and wisemen trump.
Or maybe Röttgen is simply dreaming of wielding lots of global power. According to CO2 Handel:
There can only be one global answer to global warming in the words of Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen (CDU). Climate protection is a ‘Weltordnungspolitik’ (world order policy), said Röttgen on Thursday in Bonn at an international human rights conference.

That also means: ‘Everybody must be on board.’ To have a greater impact on global environmental and climate protection, a new UN special organization – something like the WHO for health – would have to be set up.”
Herr Röttgen says that the Kyoto Protocol, which covers only 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, is unable to function any longer.
Strange how activist warmists often accuse skeptics of being paranoid for believing that climate policy is masquerading as global governance. Here we have the German Federal Minister of Environment himself, a top government authority, calling for climate policy to be made into “world order policy”. How could anyone make the true intentions any clearer?
So dear global citizens, get ready to go out and rain-dance every day for good weather and climate, i.e. act like raving superstitious fools, because the government says you have to.

" In a fast-changing world, it’s a reassuringly unvarying truth that whenever the novelist Jonathan Franzen weighs in on current affairs, it drives people bonkers on social media. And so it went, a few weeks back, when Franzen published a New Yorker essay wondering if we should give up hope of decisively averting the climate apocalypse. Something about the sheer Franzenness of Franzen makes it hard for his critics to focus on what he’s actually saying: he was attacked as a nihilist and a fatalist, even though he urged action and investment to combat global warming; and the New Yorker was chastised for not assigning the piece to a climate scientist, even though the relative impotence of public pronouncements by climate scientists was central to his argument. It was difficult not to interpret the ferocity of the response as evidence that he’d broached a subject many would rather avoid. Lost in the commotion was what I’d say was Franzen’s most important reminder: that our capacity for concern is finite, and we ignore that finitude at our peril. Each of us has limited time, energy and other resources, and so, inevitably, if your sole priority is achieving victory in a planetary-scale existential battle, there’ll be nothing left for anything else. “Keep doing the right thing for the planet, yes,” Franzen wrote, “but also keep trying to save what you love specifically – a community, an institution, a wild place, a species that’s in trouble – and take heart in your small successes.” They needn’t be explicitly climate-related, either. There’s something wrong with a moral code that says you shouldn’t spend your spare time caring for a dying relative (say) because it’s time you could have spent saving the environment.  You might object, of course, that real-life climate activists don’t neglect their dying grandparents; they manage to attend to both demands. But then you’ve already granted Franzen’s point – that it’s justifiable to withdraw some of your finite energy from what seems like the only global priority in order to reinvest it locally, and on what matters most to you. More than justifiable, in fact: it may be the only way to avoid paralysis or despair in the face of the world’s problems. In the smartphone age, as David Cain observed recently on his blog raptitude.com, our limited capacity for concern is distributed over so many urgent demands that it’s like “releasing a tiny drop of water on each square inch of a forest fire”. Imagine, he wrote, if you could gather up all the public concern and distribute it differently, so that several thousand people would make one specific issue – or sub-issue, in the case of the climate – their primary moral concern for a decade. It’s hard to imagine more progress wouldn’t be made. We can’t engineer the world that way, obviously. But we could probably try harder, as individuals, to pick a handful of battles in which to invest our finite concern. The trickiest part would be ignoring all the others. “Not my problem!” we’d have to think, when encountering a story about Syrian refugees, or fires in the Amazon. Not from callousness, but because we’d nominated some different problems as “ours”, and were already busy making a difference. The veteran ecologist Joanna Macy explores environmental activism as a “dance with despair” on the podcast On Being. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSomehow I missed Nir Shaviv’s comment about Jasper Kirby’s CLOUD experiment, read here: Shaviv writes (emphasis added):
Ok, so what do these results imply?
The first point was essentially pointed above. The results unequivocally demonstrate that atmospheric ionization can very easily affect the formation of condensation nuclei (CNs). Since many regions of earth are devoid of natural sources for CCNs (e.g., dust), the CCNs have to grow from the smaller CNs, hence, the CCN density will naturally be affected by the ionization, and therefore, the cosmic ray flux. This implies that ion induced nucleation is the most natural explanation linking between observed cosmic ray flux variations and climate. It has both empirical and beautify experimental results to support it.
Second, given that the cosmic ray flux climate link can naturally be explained, the often heard ‘no proven mechanism and therefore it should be dismissed’ argument should be tucked safely away. In fact, given the laboratory evidence, it should have been considered strange if there were no empirical CRF/climate links!
Last, given that the CRF/climate link is alive and kicking, it naturally explains the large solar/climate links. As a consequence, anyone trying to understand past (and future) climate change must consider the whole effect that the sun has on climate, not just the relatively small variations in the total irradiance (which is the only solar influence most modelers consider). This in turn implies (and I will write about it in the near future), that some of the 20th century warming should be attributed to the sun, and that the climate sensitivity is on the low side (around 1 deg increase per CO2 doubling).
Read it all here: http://www.sciencebits.com/CLOUDresults.
He says he’ll write more about this in the future. Hopefully he won’t keep us waiting too long, as many of us are looking forward to his expert assesssments.

This is stunningly phenomenal. According to spokeswoman Julia Strack at Hoffmann & Campe publishing, 20,000 copies have been distributed over the last week and:
It will enter the German bestseller list on Monday as number 14.”
“Die kalte Sonne” is also the No. 1 seller at publisher Hoffmann & Campe.

Source: Hoffmann & Campe Top Ten List
The NWZ daily in Oldenburg writes here:
Seldom has a book about climate change and the role of CO2 on climate fired up the debate like ‘Die kalte Sonne’ has. For many climate activists, the book’s subtitle is a provocation: ‘Why the climate catastroiphe is not taking place’ – which is viewed as playing down the harm and risk to the Earth’s climate.”
The NWZ then writes:
The demand for the book is large. At the moment the book is out of print and will go through another printing, Vahrenholt reported.”
Being in the top 20 is great news. In fact, all books in the top 20 are normally placed at the entrance of the book-shops near the cash registers. This will further bolster sales.

Mass press coverage
Although climate activists have blasted the book, major media outlets have been giving it ample coverage. Here are some quotes from the press collected by Hoffmann & Campe:
“While all of Europe Freezes these days, Fritz Vahrenholt is providing a heated debate.“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 7 Feb. 2012
“Vahrenholt (62) a maverick who conveys the current zeitgeist.“ www.zeitonline.de, 6 February 2012
“…Germany’s most naughty renewable energy manager…“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, 29 January 2012
“… is Vahrenholt also a hardnosed climate skeptic?“ – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 12 Feb 2012
“With his claims on climate change Professor Fritz Vahrenholt […] has provided for headlines.“ – Welt am Sonntag, 12 Feb 2012
“A new book on climate change has […] triggered a heated discussion. Thus the authors plead that imthat everybody keep a cool head. In this country this is going to be tough to do.“ – Die Welt, 11 Feb 2012
The warmists, in their attempts to slam the book, have only succeeded in driving it up near the top of bestseller lists. Worse is that once people read the book, they are never going to believe the hoax again.
It needs to be noted that most of the warmists who have blasted the book have not even read it. Mojib Latif confirmed that on ARD television when asked if he bought the book. He said he “read parts of it here and there”. So of course he isn’t going to have a clue about the book’s arguments, and thus he ends up saying dumb things that will come back to him later.

"What would you do to save the world? Not the strapline for a Netflix series, but rather the question that sits behind Jonathan Safran Foer’s second work of nonfiction, We Are the Weather. The answer to the question appears to be “not very much”, given that despite the looming threat of global heating, despite the fact the next generation (and those that follow) will live more precarious lives, with food, water and clean air in ever-shorter supply, despite the fact that the future of our planet appears to be one of flooded cities, scorched forests and sulphurous skies, we continue to behave as if the climate crisis is someone else’s problem. In 2018, despite knowing more about climate change than we have ever known, we produced more greenhouse gases than we have ever produced, at three times the rate of global population growth. Climate change, therefore, exists as a rhetorical challenge as much as a scientific one. The most pressing question is how to persuade people to act, and to act now, both on an individual basis and, particularly, collectively. Extinction Rebellion provides a blueprint for action, but what about the majority who aren’t about to chain themselves to the headquarters of Shell? One landmark in the rhetorical battle was Al Gore’s 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, although it may surprise you to learn that Gore’s film, for all its rigour, didn’t mention the single largest contributor to global heating: livestock.  Now Safran Foer, best known for his astonishing magical-realist debut novel Everything Is Illuminated, but also the author of a bestselling 2009 book about factory farming, Eating Animals, has set about remedying that omission. In We Are the Weather, he demonstrates that, rather than being an insurmountable nexus of insoluble problems, there’s one small change that all of us can make that would have a sustained and far-reaching impact on the climate crisis: eating fewer animal products. “We cannot keep the kind of meals we have known and also keep the planet we have known. We must either let some eating habits go or let the planet go. It is as straightforward and as fraught as that.” First, a warning: this is a life-changing book and will alter your relationship to food for ever. I can’t imagine anyone reading Safran Foer’s lucid, heartfelt, deeply compassionate prose and then reaching blithely for a cheeseburger. There’s some dispute as to precisely what proportion of global heating is directly related to the rearing of animals for food, but even the lowest estimates put it on a par with the entire global transportation industry. A well-evidenced 2009 report by the Worldwatch Institute claimed that livestock-related emissions accounted for 51% of all greenhouse gases, “more than all cars, planes, buildings, industry and power plants combined”. Whichever the case, Safran Foer’s thesis is clear and compelling: by making “a collective act to eat differently” (he suggests “no animal products before dinner”) we can turn the tide of the climate crisis. The book is made up of five sections, each divided into a series of sharp, hard-hitting chapters. Part two, How to Prevent the Greatest Dying, is a bombardment of facts that seeks to overwhelm the reader with evidence. “Humans use 59% of all the land capable of growing crops to grow food for livestock”; “60% of all mammals on Earth are animals raised for food”; “There are approximately 30 farmed animals for every human on the planet”; “In 2018, more than 99% of the animals eaten in America were raised on factory farms”; “Animal agriculture is responsible for 91% of Amazon deforestation”; “If cows were a country, they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.” These facts, though, are part of the problem, rather than the solution. The point is, we know this stuff, we just don’t believe it. And so the rest of the book is dedicated to persuading us that it is our duty to act, just as, Safran Foer suggests, it was the duty of Jewish leaders in the US to act when Jan Karski, a member of the Polish underground, came to them in June 1943 with news of the murder and persecution of Jews in Europe. The Jewish leaders, and particularly the supreme court justice Felix Frankfurter, didn’t act. “I am unable to believe what you told me,” Frankfurter told Karski. History now judges Frankfurter as it will judge us. The final chapter is structured as a letter from Safran Foer to his children. The author’s grandmother, who herself fled Poland just before it was too late to do so, has just died. Most of her family were killed in the Holocaust and Safran Foer powerfully interweaves her story of action with his own history of inaction in the face of global warming. Reversing climate change, he says, “requires an entirely different kind of heroism”. This heroism is “perhaps every bit as difficult” as the sacrifice his grandmother made “because the need for sacrifice is unobvious”. That sacrifice begins, as the book’s subtitle suggests, at breakfast. • We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast by Jonathan Safran Foer is published by Hamish Hamilton (£16.99).

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone wondering what some US leaders envision for the USA’s energy policy may wish to attend the following Harvard German Conference to find out.
The energy part of the conference is taking place this weekend, Saturday morning, February 18, 2012:
9:30 – 10:30: Energy – Keynote Jeremy Rifkin.
The Third Industrial Revolution: The New German Model for a Post-Carbon Economy, Radcliffe Yard
10:30 – 10:50: Coffee Break, Radcliffe Yard
10:50 – 11:15: Energy Address, Dr. Hermann Ott (MdB German Green Party), Radcliffe Yard

And if you’re interested in finding out how the “new German model” is coming along, read about it here – it aint pretty! In fact, the power grid came only a whisker away from a collapse during the recent cold spell. And many German companies are relocating to places where supply is more reliable.

But who cares about these nuances – it’s the way the USA should go these misguided pointy heads tell us. I’ll let the German readers here tell you who these German masterminds are.
DR. KEIL’S FULL 28-PAGE REPORT IN ENGLISH
The above report is a must read if you are involved in energy engineering, planning or policy!
If you do, you’ll never want to touch the German strategy. In fact, according to experts from 21 of the World Energy Council’s country committees:
81% of the countries surveyed reject the German way as a model for the world, and none of the experts could imagine their own countries following the German way.”
I’ve read the entire 28-page report, and it sounds worse than Soviet-style central planning. If anyone happens to be near Harvard, go check out the conference.
So far in Germany, the current attempt to switch over to renewable energy has only succeeded in:
1) driving up electricty and energy rates for consumers,
2) making the power supply unreliable,
3. littering the landscape with windparks and solar panels,
4. driving up the price of food,
5. driving industry out of country,
6. regulating private lives more and more intensely, and
7. putting billions into the pockets of a few opportunists and carbon traders.

"How do we make sense of the Earth when it seems to be turning against us in revenge for its despoliation? The very act of writing about the devastation can sometimes create a kind of coherence. Elizabeth Kolbert shows us how with The Sixth Extinction, where she focuses on a few of the million or so species that are dying out in what is now known to be one of the greatest extinction events in the history of the Earth. The closeness of the focus creates a powerful sense of empathy, not just with the vanishing creatures but also with the writer as she struggles to account for the horrors to which she is bearing witness. Dahr Jamail’s The End of Ice is another unflinching attempt to grapple with almost incomprehensible realities. Jamail travels widely and listens closely to scientists, and to people whose ways of life are threatened by ecological breakdown. “The grief for the planet does not get easier,” he writes. “Returning to this again and again is, I think, the greatest service I can offer in these times.”  Our current predicament is both overwhelming and elusive, manifesting itself not in big events but in what the Princeton professor Rob Nixon calls a kind of “slow violence”, revealed in small but telling details. Such details abound in Annie Proulx’s Bird Cloud, a memoir of her experience of building a house in a very challenging location in Wyoming. Proulx has always paid close attention to landscape and this is no exception: it is the terrain that awakens the writer to the effects of planetary changes. A memoir of a completely different kind is Roy Scranton’s Learning to Die in the Anthropocene. Scranton served in Iraq as a private in the US army and he draws on that experience in trying to understand the implications of climate crisis for himself and his loved ones: the result is a book that is fiercely urgent and deeply poignant. In The Mushroom at the End of the World, Anna Tsing goes in search of the much-prized matsutake mushroom, found only in certain damaged forests. The matsutake serves as both vehicle and metaphor for a giddying exploration of capitalism, networks of trade and the hidden lives of forests, ultimately opening up the possibility of salvaging meaning from an increasingly disordered reality. The disrupted migration of monarch butterflies underpins a powerful human story in Barbara Kingsolver’s luminous novel Flight Behaviour. But human stories are precisely the problem – there is a terrible cost to privileging the human over other forms of life. We need stories that can accommodate other kinds of protagonists, and there is no better example of this than Richard Powers’s marvellous The Overstory, a novel that gives trees a wonderfully vivid fictional life. Many people have always known that emotions are not exclusive to humans. But what does it mean when someone says they can understand the inner lives of animals, trees, or even forests? Bruce Albert and Davi Kopenawa provide a vivid sense of this in The Falling Sky: Words of a Yanomami Shaman.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Winnepeg Free Press here and Yahoo report here that Western Canada needs to brace for a brutal winter. Hat tip reader Matti Vooro.
The Yahoo News blog writes:
Meteorologists are calling for an early and cold winter in Western Canada, probably one of the top three coldest in the last 20 years for the West Coast.”
This comes at the heels of last month’s reports from Britain  where long-range forecasters warned of below average temperatures from October through February, along with lots of whites stuff, which just a few years ago was said would be “rare and exciting” in the future because of global warming.
Cold events caused by natural factors
In times of global warming, people may ask what’s causing all the cold and snow? Accuweather’s Brent Anderson has the answer:
That’s typical of a La Nina, but (blasts) don’t last very long; they come and they go,”

In other words, when cold events occur, it’s because of natural factors. But when warm events happen, then it’s man-made global warming. And what about Britain’s coming cold weather? You guessed it -also  caused by natural factors (UV radiation!). And should cold extremes befall us, then of course it’ll be due to global warming, er, man-made climate change – which scientists say “leads to weather extremes”. If you are getting confused, don’t worry – so am I! (And so are the scientists).
So how cold is it going to get over the vast Canadian territory? The Winnipeg Free Press writes:
The forecast is one of the coldest winters in the past 20 years for Western Canada, major snowstorms for Ontario and Quebec and a drier than normal winter for Atlantic Canada.”
Accuweather’s Brett Anderson adds:
Western provinces can expect a fifth-consecutive deep freeze to move in and stay.”
and
Vancouver will experience one of its coldest winters on record.”
Last month German whippersnapper meteorologist Dominik Jung, a warmist, predicted here the fourth consecutive bitter winter would grip Central Europe this winter and could strain the energy supply. Looks like we’ll need to burn more coal, and not less.

Share this...FacebookTwitterImagine if the government forced supermarkets to buy bread from plain white bread bakeries, ordered them to pay these bakeries a fixed price that’s 5 times higher than normal for 20 years, and forced them to buy up all the white bread these bakeries could produce, whether needed or not.
And imagine if the government also forced the supermarkets to buy bread that was never baked to begin with! All of this of course justified by bogus science claiming plain white bread is healthy and whole grain bread is a killer.
You can imagine the consequences.
Well, that’s exactly what Germany is doing with electricity. It requires power utilities to buy up “green” electricity from every producer at exorbitant rates, and to do so for 20 years. And if the grid gets overloaded on windy days, the wind-farm operator is told to stop producing, but still gets paid by the power utilities.
Unfortunately, Germany’s green politicians here were too dim-witted to foresee the obvious consequences. Now reality has since caught up. The German electricity market is on the verge of collapse. The scale of the EEG Renewable Energy Feed-in Act is of unprecedented stupidity, a folly that will certainly go down in German history textbooks.
The backpedaling away from solar subsidies in Germany is now happening so fast that it’s making people’s heads spin. Call it the reverse energy supply transition – one from fantasy back to reality.
Germany pulls the emergency brake on solar energy
Today a growing number of German officials, who were once huge proponents of renewable energies and the EEG Feed-In Act, are now realizing that solar energy in gray and rainy Germany is a folly after all. Electricity rates in Germany are skyrocketing and the risks of uncontrolled energy supply interruptions are mounting. Officials are now screaming for a drastic scale-back of solar subsidies. Economics Minister Philip Rösler is now calling for an end to the fixed and guaranteed (for 20 years) renewable energy feed-in rates paid to green producers.
Even Germany’s super green Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen has seemingly woken up and now plans to drastically scale back new installations of solar systems in Germany, according to CO2 Handel here. In the new plan, subsidies will be scaled back on a monthly basis and accelerated. Subsidies for solar systems under the new plan would end by 2017.
Energy intensive industries are bolting, or are planning to do so

Power utilities have been finding it increasingly difficult to juggle the constantly and widely varying energy sources of wind and solar power, and are warning that power outages and grid collapses are just a question of time.
The mandatory feed-in of the vastly more expensive solar energy has caused electricity rates to surge and have been driving energy-intensive industries out of Germany. Solar energy was until recently seen as a way of filling in as a power supply in place of the shut down nuclear reactors, and rescuing the climate from coal plants. Now the focus of politics has reversed and shifted to rescuing the economy.
Recent surveys have shown that companies are becoming increasingly wary of conducting operations in Germany due to what they view as a potentially unreliable energy supply. The European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE) here reports that:
One fifth of every industrial company has moved activities to foreign countries, or plans to do so, because of the uncertain energy and raw material supply. This is the result of a survey conducted by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), in which 1520 companies participated. DIHK-President Hans Heinrich Driftmann finds this alarming: Here, fears that Germany is losing its appeal for foreign investors in the wake of it’s energy supply transformation.”
No wonder Environment Minister Röttgen plans to take drastic measures in curbing solar energy. Germany’s industrial economy is eroding rapidly. Prof. Dr. Dieter Ameling, a former steel industry leader and spokesman, recently said the (green) energy supply transition in Germany meant the downfall of energy intensive industry in Germany.
Unfortunately greens don’t understand that transferring clean, high-standard German industry to foreign, low-standard countries means more CO2 emissions and pollution, and not less. And they certainly do not understand even the most basic laws of economics. Germany’s Renewable Energy Feed-In Act is proof.
Kook greens in Canada think solar power is for free!
Finally here’s hippie David Suzuki (3 min. mark) saying “It’s free, man, it’s free!”

With idiots like that advising governments, we’re not surprised everything is going bankrupt.

"The New South Wales government is considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmines projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. It comes after a campaign from the NSW Minerals Council over decisions that have referenced the impact of “scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions” as a reason for either rejecting a mining project entirely or for imposing conditions on it.  For a coalmine, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of the coal after it is sold into the market, including overseas. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said it was “not appropriate for state governments to impose conditions about emissions policies in other countries”. He said the government was looking at a range of options, including legislation or a new guideline for how planning authorities should factor scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions into the assessment process. The recent decisions include the NSW land and environment court’s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when “a rapid and deep decrease” in global emissions was urgently needed. In August, the NSW Independent Planning Commission approved the expanded United Wambo coal project near Singleton but as a condition said the coal could only be exported to countries that have ratified the Paris agreement. In September the commission rejected the development of a greenfield coalmine in NSW’s Bylong Valley, citing the impact the mine would have on groundwater, agricultural land and on climate change. The NSW Minerals Council has since launched attack ads that target the planning system for “failing the people of NSW”. In a statement last week, the council’s chief executive Stephen Galilee said the decision to launch a campaign came after months of “warnings to the minister for planning and others in the government about the risk of the planning system to jobs and investment”. He said the situation had reached “crisis point” with the Bylong Valley decision. Stokes said the Minerals Council was one of the stakeholders the government was consulting in its development of a policy on scope 3 emissions. “We are working with key stakeholders, including the federal government, NSW Minerals Council and consent authorities, to develop a clear policy direction as quickly as possible to provide certainty to the community, industry and investors,” he said. “We are looking at a range of options including legislation.” The consent authorities in this instance include the NSW land and environment court. But environment groups are warning the government not to bow to pressure from the mining industry. Lock the Gate said the impact of downstream greenhouse gas emissions “is arguably the most complicated, severe and lasting environmental impact of NSW’ export coalmines”. Lock the Gate coordinator George Woods said the public should also have a say in how planning decisions address the climate consequences of coal developments and that should be done through a public hearing process run by the independent planning commission. “It’s disappointing and frankly dangerous for the planning minister to narrowly consult only with the mining industry on a matter of profound importance like this,” she said. “The mining industry has flexed its political muscle but the government really needs to address the bigger issue and the public sentiment on this.” Elaine Johnson, the principal lawyer with the Environmental Defenders Office of NSW, which represented Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill case, said if the government was planning changes to the way planning authorities consider scope 3 emissions, the consultation for that should be broad and include other key stakeholders such as community and environment groups. “The land and environment court, in the Rocky Hill decision, has confirmed that it is entirely appropriate for decision-makers to impose conditions on projects that will contribute to dangerous climate change in a planning context,” Johnson said. She said that was recognised by the independent planning commission in the United Wambo and Bylong Valley assessments. “We would also say that in 2019 we are making planning decisions in a context which includes advice from the world’s best scientists that we’re approaching a climate emergency,” she said. “If global emissions continue to rise and if serious action is not taken at all levels of government, by communities and business, the impacts of dangerous climate change will be catastrophic.” The NSW Minerals Council said recent independent planning commission decisions related to emissions generated in other countries were “inconsistent with the Paris agreement and its associated greenhouse gas accounting framework”. “The NSW government has attempted to clarify its policy on scope 3 emissions through correspondence to the IPC but this has been disregarded,” Galilee told Guardian Australia. “The NSW government must therefore provide legislative and policy certainty on this issue.”"
"An Australian mining company was able to massively increase greenhouse gas emissions from two of its coalmines without penalty under a government policy that is meant to limit carbon pollution from large facilities. Centennial Coal was given permission on three occasions since 2016/17 to increase the greenhouse gas emissions from its Myuna colliery and Mandalong mines in New South Wales, according to data kept by the clean energy regulator. The increases were approved under the government’s safeguard mechanism, which is supposed to ensure that emissions cuts paid for by taxpayers through its emissions reduction fund – now called the climate solutions fund – are not wiped out by rising emissions elsewhere. The safeguard mechanism sets pollution limits for large emitters such as mines and power plants. If a company exceeds this pollution baseline, it is required to purchase carbon credits to offset the increase, or pay a penalty. However, the government’s policy allows companies to apply to increase their emissions baselines under certain conditions, thus allowing them to increase their overall total emissions. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), which analysed emissions data for Centennial Coal published by the clean energy regulator, says flaws in the safeguard policy meant Centennial avoided having to buy about $8.3m in carbon offset credits, or pay an alternative penalty or implement stronger measures to cut their pollution. The ACF’s analysis found that in 2017-18, Centennial’s Myuna mine overshot its baseline of 402,028 tonnes by 65% – emitting a total of 664,956 tonnes – but it avoided penalty after having its baseline increased by the clean energy regulator. The mine’s total emissions were more than double its reported emissions for the previous year. It was also granted two baseline increases for its Mandalong mine, one in 2016/17 and one in 2017/18, for more than 300,000 tonnes in excess emissions. In 2016/17, Centennial reported emissions of 1,560,761 tonnes of carbon at Mandalong, exceeding their reported baseline of 1,508,644 by 3.8%. In 2017/18 the mine was granted another baseline increase and reported total emissions of 1,866,089 tonnes. Gavan McFadzean, the ACF’s climate and energy program manager, said the data highlighted the failure of the safeguards policy to effectively cap pollution from large emitters. “The fact that Centennial haven’t done anything legally wrong is the problem,” he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “These are huge overshoots in emissions which are done really with impunity by the industrial and mining sectors in the full knowledge that the Morrison government will give them a free pass on whatever emissions of CO2 or methane they pump out into the atmosphere above their baseline.” Australia’s emissions have continued to rise, despite the Morrison government’s claims it is taking action to address the climate crisis. The government’s most recent quarterly greenhouse data showed fugitive emissions produced during the extraction of fossil fuels were up by 5.9%. Centennial is not the only company to have been granted baseline increases under the safeguard mechanism. Mining company Anglo American nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years at its Moranbah North mine in central Queensland without penalty. McFadzean said the rise in pollution from companies such as Centennial and Anglo American was “swamping” the abatement purchased with public money through the climate solutions fund or the reductions coming from the Renewable Energy Target. “As a first step, the government must close the loopholes Centennial has exploited and tighten safeguard pollution caps over time, as recommended by the Climate Change Authority,” he said. “This is a bare minimum first step towards a comprehensive Australian climate change strategy that must bring down our pollution to zero by 2050 from all sectors of our economy including heavy industry, transport, energy and the land.” Katie Brassil, Centennial’s company spokesperson, said there were provisions in the legislation that allowed companies to increase their emissions in certain circumstances. “Both Mandalong and Myuna met these provisions,” she said. Brassil said the company was able to seek a baseline increase at Mandalong due to changes in the natural deposit that meant there was an increase in emissions of fugitive gas. In the case of the Myuna mine, the company was able to increase its baseline because it could demonstrate that its production – and therefore total emissions – had risen but it had reduced the mine’s emissions intensity per tonne of coal. “Centennial is due to lodge its NGER’s (National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting) return for 18/19 and we anticipate a reduction in Mandalong’s emissions and again reduced emissions intensity for Myuna for the period,” she said. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said baselines “are intended to allow businesses to continue normal operations, support business growth and encourage lower emissions production”. “As a result of changes made in March 2019, following a transition period, emissions limits will better reflect business as usual operations and will provide a more even and ongoing incentive for businesses to actively monitor and manage emissions,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLike all electric cars, the Norwegian Think Global electric car was the future. And because it held the promise of rescuing the climate, it was especially worshipped by the media. It symbolized technical savvy, progressive thinking, and was supposed to be proof that thinking green could lead to success, profit and a saved planet.
Well think again. All that was just slick marketing. And, as always, it never takes long for reality to catch up, pass and leave fantasy in the dust…no matter how much it is subsidized.
Cars waiting a year for parts, 30% broken down
About a week ago the English-language Norwegian online newspaper thelocal.no told us the story of how the hip “Think” electric cars has turned into a complete flop, at least in Norway. The Local writes here:
Think electric cars have begun to stack up at the few mechanic’s shops able to service them due to a spare parts shortage. Up to 30 percent of the 2,000-odd models produced have suffered breakdowns of a key power-control unit, or PCU. The car’s lithium-ion battery is powerless to recharge without the PCU, and the plant that made them shut its doors in Finland in June.”
When the car was first rolled out, the politically correct media loved it. Even Norwegian neswpaper Addresseavisa bought one of its own. But The Local writes that Addresseavisa’s own Think “was in for repair”.

Most likely sitting in a lot in the back waiting for spare parts that likely will never come. The Think car has had a history of failure. According to Wikipedia it went bankrupt 4 times since it was founded in 1991. Even Ford took a shot at it, but abandoned it.
Nissan Leaf and range anxiety 
The Think car is not the only electric car suffering from financial and technical woes. Other brands, even with the help of massive subsidies, have shown zero viability. Take the subsidized Nissan Leaf for example: Liza Barth of Consumer Reports panned it. Here’s what she wrote about it (emphasis added):
I decided to head out on my regular long commute, with the cheaper toll, but saw the Leaf quickly run though the charge and drop to 39 miles about halfway through my trip and I was freezing. I was very happy to see stopped traffic on the New York State Thruway (that’s a first) as that calmed my range anxiety and I saw the estimated range actually increase by six miles. The last two miles of my trip, I put on the heat with 24 miles left, but it did little to warm my already numb fingers and toes. I made it to the office with 17 miles to spare.”
The Leaf also comes with a “high-pitched whine”.   The infrastructure for charging up electric cars is also a complete flop.  For example North Carolina’s Duke Energy supplies charging stations for electric cars, but has asked its customers not to use them. According to WCNC:
Duke Energy is asking customers who own their electric car charging station to stop using the product after a house fire in Mooresville last month.”
Looks like lack of range, massive subsidies, impracticality and no infrastructure will continue to plague and cripple electric cars for a long time to come.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI thought the planet today was warm – too warm, we keep hearing. Well the Arctic was a heck of a lot warmer 53 million years ago. Today’s climate by comparison is downright frigid.
The Bild der Wissenschaft reports on a paper appearing in the Proceedings of the Royal Society here that shows the Arctic was covered with forests.
The Arctic appears to have been forested 53 million years ago, along with rich plant and animal diversity. According to the paper, conditions were similar to the southeastern North America, with climate conditions like Central Europe’s today. Scientists from the University of Birmingham discovered this by analysing rock layers of the Stenkul fjord on the Canadian island of Ellesmere and the pollen, fungus spores and fossils of animals they contained.
According to Bild der Wissenschaft, the average annual temperature was a relatively balmy 8 to 15 egrees Celsius back then, with summertime temperatures climbing above 20°C. In the wintertime the temperatures were around the freezing point, similar to what we have today in Europe and southern North America today.
The scientists were surprised by the diversity of plants and that they were found so far north during the warm periods.
Now that’s real global warming – and not the 0.7°C we have had over the last 150 years.
