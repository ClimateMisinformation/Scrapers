"Victoria has announced a plan to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. The move places Victoria at the head of the pack of states and territories, along with South Australia, which has the same 2050 target, and the ACT, which has other strong emissions and renewable energy targets. Victoria’s move could be more significant, though, since it contributed significantly more to Australia’s overall emissions.  After the recommendations of a review, the Labor state government announced it would legislate the targets by amending the Climate Change Act 2010. As part of the plan announced by the premier, Daniel Andrews, a “pledge program” called Take2 was also launched, where individuals, as well as government, business and community groups, were invited to pledge to play a role in reducing the state’s emissions to zero. The Victorian government said it would make pledges in various sectors, including energy, agriculture and transport, in order to make an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy. “Updating our laws and introducing a target to reduce emissions in Victoria will ensure we take advantage of the new jobs and economic opportunities created by renewable energy,” Andrews said. Cam Walker, the campaigns director of Friends of the Earth Australia, welcomed the move but said final judgment would be reserved until several other key policies were announced, including the Victorian renewable energy target, the coal policy and the fracking policy. The interim targets for 2020 and beyond would also be essential for judging the value of the plan, Walker said. “Taken collectively, that will give us a meaningful sense of where they are going with all this,” Walker said. “Today is not an endpoint but it is a significant point along the way. It’s the first time the premier has fronted the issue of climate change and really owned it.” Environment Victoria also welcomed the announcement. “Setting a clear target for reaching zero climate pollution provides a strong signal for all future government and business decisions,” Environment Victoria’s chief executive, Mark Wakeham, said. “We need to reach this target as quickly as possible.” He said although 2050 was some time away, it had implications for actions today. “Pursuing new coal or gas projects is inconsistent with a plan to decarbonise the economy,” he said. “Instead we need to embrace our renewable energy resources.” The Victorian Greens said the announcement set targets too far in the future and failed to make targets compulsory or set a policy to phase out coal. “If Labor is serious about climate change, they shouldn’t just announce they will maybe do something by 2050,” the Greens’ environment spokeswoman, Ellen Sandell, said. “They must urgently phase out coal and set a strong renewable energy target now.” "
" The week in which the self-taught education expert Michael Gove announced that “the people of this country have had enough of experts” is clearly not the best one for his cabinet colleague, the former miner Patrick McLoughlin, to admit that the experts got it wrong over diesel cars. By cutting the duty on low-sulphur diesel back in 2001, the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, correctly thought he was helping meet carbon-reducing climate change targets in Britain. Unfortunately no one explained that the harmful pollutants such cars emit – nitrogen oxides – can quickly build to lethal levels.   Or, as the fellow ex-minister and motor sports enthusiast Lord Drayson cheerfully put it during the VW rigged-tests scandal still engulfing the world’s carmakers, they’re “literally killing people”. For once the hyperbolic cliche was right. On some (expert?) estimates, 9,500 people suffer avoidable deaths each year in the capital alone. That’s true of many of our lifestyle choices, of course, though it’s been a while since a chancellor cut the duty on cigarettes to encourage smoking. McLoughlin signalled that he may have to ask George Osborne – or Nigel Farage if he is Boris’s chancellor – to reverse the tax break.  Meanwhile, a lot of well-meaning types, including me, went out and bought diesel cars as a small way of helping save Australia’s coral reef and other species threatened by climate change, also including you and me. It may not all be caused by human activity, but the experts – there we go again – are overwhelmingly of the view that most of it is and we must act together to offset its consequences. And there in a nutshell is the problem Gove so casually addressed. Experts are divided over the causes of the climatic changes we see all around us in every country, aren’t they? Well, no, actually. About 97% of those who are supposed to know what they’re talking about support the consensus.    It’s not hard to see why the populist in Gove knows he can get easy applause for denouncing experts and their expertise. In advanced secular societies like ours voters have been encouraged to look to highly educated technocrats, not to priests or princes, to provide the guidelines on how best to live.  But, just like priests and princes, they sometimes get it wrong. Only this week, the Guardian’s intrepid Sarah Boseley reported another retreat from the fats-are-bad campaign of recent decades. Good fats are good in sensible quantities and not as bad as Killer Sugar which food makers used as a comforting substitute.   So the problem is twofold. Experts get it wrong and are sometimes forced to change their minds. “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?” as John Maynard Keynes famously remarked. If some experts don’t like admitting fallibility how much harder is it for lay men and women who have embraced advice they are now told to discard? There’s much to be said for “common sense”, for learning from experience what may be right for you – or for your children or career – as it may not be for others. Expertise should be on tap, not on top, as we used to say. Passing the buck when things go wrong is a bad side-effect too, along with routinely trying to sue people who have done their best, doctors for example. Of course, there are issues and circumstances where the experts’ advice should be taken more seriously than on others. Climate change decisions or brain surgery matter more than Michael Billington’s advice on theatre or nice Jamie Oliver’s idea of a good pesto. It’s still no guarantee they’ll be right. Which takes us back to Europe – an issue on which the advice of most experts across most fields is that we should Remain. But the direct experience of many ordinary citizens points the other way, most notably in their varying encounters with immigration on its current scale, and the effects, good and bad, that it has.  There’s no point in “experts” telling them that immigration is good for the British economy as a whole, when they don’t live and work or send their kids to school in a whole; they do so in a specific place. It doesn’t make them racists or bigots to express concern, though some may be.  So mouthy Nigel Farage was surely correct in ITV’s election debate exchanges with David Cameron on Tuesday when he spoke of falling GDP per capita, ie per head, mattering more than rising overall GDP whose benefits may not be fairly shared (they aren’t). Cameron was wrong. Is he mostly wrong and opportunist, as Brexiteers suggest? In my judgment, no. Reading the experts with a pinch of salt – here’s InFacts – I tend to find their version of events more trustworthy than Vote Leave’s. Knowing Boris Johnson tolerably well over many years my jaw hits the floor whenever I read that the rascal is trusted on Europe – a man who was sacked by the Times for making up quotes and later sacked by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard, for being less than truthful about an affair. But there you are. Leave campaigners say that remain camp’s experts were wrong in urging Britain to join sterling to the eurozone. That’s not true either. Many experts – the Observer’s veteran economics pundit Bill Keegan is one – were vocal critics of the euro project (and of Schengen) but do not support Brexit.  The success of the Brexiteers is to have a better ear for discontent on the street, in the factory or supermarket and to pander better to popular resentments and prejudice. It is what Donald Trump is doing so well in the US. That success rests on perceived failures by elites and by decades of overconfidence built on postwar economic success that has now turned sour. The populists offer glib, popular answers. “It can’t be any worse, so let’s take a punt,” they say. “Yes, it can,” is the correct answer, but hardly an inspiring one. Surely it is no coincidence that both Brexit and Trump’s campaigns are full of climate change sceptics too. “Let’s take a punt, it’ll be fine.”  That’s quite a punt. Funny weather we’re having, eh?"
"When it comes to confronting climate change, the world’s cities are proving that there’s strength in unity. The historic climate agreement reached in Paris in December, which was approved by nearly all of the world’s nations, was made possible in part by the progress that cities have made by working together.  Today, the two biggest coalitions of cities in the world – the EU-based Covenant of Mayors and the UN-backed Compact of Mayors – are forming an alliance to link more than 600 million city dwellers in the fight against climate change.  Cities are key to solving the climate change challenge. They account for most of the world’s carbon emissions, and mayors often have control over the largest sources. Just as importantly, mayors have strong incentives to attack those sources because steps that reduce carbon also improve public health and strengthen local economies.  Clean air is increasingly a factor business leaders weigh when deciding where to invest. Cities can also act quickly to confront climate change, without the political and bureaucratic hurdles that often hold back national governments. By sharing smart strategies, cities of all sizes have led the way in addressing climate change, and as a result, the UN has given cities an official role in international climate diplomacy for the first time. In the European Union as well, cities are increasingly seen as crucial allies in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our new alliance, now called the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, will provide unprecedented support for city efforts and accelerate progress against climate change in a number of ways, including:  The Global Covenant will link more than 7,100 cities, representing more than 600 million people, in one unified effort to address the causes and impacts of climate change. Cities will speak with one clear, coordinated voice, sending a strong signal to national governments that they are committed to this fight and to assisting one another. It will also help us expand and recruit new members, with a focus on parts of the world where cities are growing most rapidly, including Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia. The Global Covenant will enable cities to collect and report climate data in a standardised, comparable way, allowing them to track their progress and hold one another accountable. It will also allow the UN to identify the contributions that cities are making toward the goals set in Paris, which will underscore how important cities are to meeting them. Modernising infrastructure networks can be costly, and city governments are increasingly turning to private investors to help finance such projects. But, especially in developing nations, many cities lack credit ratings and cannot access international capital markets. To help remedy this, the Global Covenant will feature an advisory group of financial institutions that will offer guidance to cities. The goal is to direct more capital to low-carbon urban infrastructure that will generate economic returns.  One of the best steps national governments can take to fight climate change is to empower their cities with the tools and autonomy they need to act. Some cities aren’t able to borrow money on their own. Others don’t have the authority to write their own building codes or energy efficiency regulations. Others lack control over mass transit. The more cities are given control over their own operations, the more progress nations will be able to make reducing emissions – which will incentivise more national governments to empower their cities. In the fight against climate change, cities are where the action is. The new Global Covenant of Mayors is a historic milestone for the global community of cities, and it will go a long way toward ensuring that the nations of the world are able to meet – and exceed – the goals they set in Paris."

"The Chinese government has outlined a plan to reduce its citizens’ meat consumption by 50%, in a move that climate campaigners hope will provide major heft in the effort to avoid runaway global warming. New dietary guidelines drawn up by China’s health ministry recommend that the nation’s 1.3 billion population should consume between 40g to 75g of meat per person each day. The measures, released once every 10 years, are designed to improve public health but could also provide a significant cut to greenhouse gas emissions.  The Chinese Communist party has found unusual allies among Hollywood celebrities, with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and director James Cameron involved in a series of new public information adverts encouraging Chinese people to consume less animal flesh to help the environment.  Should the new guidelines be followed, carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from China’s livestock industry would be reduced by 1bn tonnes by 2030, from a projected 1.8bn tonnes in that year.  Globally, 14.5% of planet-warming emissions emanate from the keeping and eating of cows, chickens, pigs and other animals – more than the emissions from the entire transport sector. Livestock emit methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas, while land clearing and fertilizers release large quantities of carbon.  “Through this kind of lifestyle change, it is expected that the livestock industry will transform and carbon emissions will be reduced,” said Li Junfeng, director general of China’s National Center on Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.  “Tackling climate change involves scientific judgement, political decisions, entrepreneurial support, but at last, it still relies on involvement of the general public to change the consumption behavior in China. Every single one of us has to believe in the low-carbon concept and slowly adapt to it.” Meat has gone from rare treat to a regular staple for many Chinese people. In 1982, the average Chinese person ate just 13kg of meat a year and beef was nicknamed “millionaire’s meat” due to its scarcity. The emergence of China as a global economic power has radically altered the diets of a newly wealthy population. The average Chinese person now eats 63kg of meat a year, with a further 30kg of meat per person expected to be added by 2030 if nothing is done to disrupt this trend. The new guidelines would reduce this to 14kg to 27kg a year.  China now consumes 28% of the world’s meat, including half of its pork. However, China still lags behind more than a dozen other countries in per capita meat consumption, with the average American or Australian consuming twice as much meat per person compared to China.  According to a new report by WildAid, the predicted increase in China’s meat consumption would add an extra 233m tonnes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere each year, as well as put increased strain on the country’s water supply, which is already blighted by polluted and denuded rivers and groundwater. The report warns that unchecked Chinese meat consumption will also degrade its arable land and worsen the country’s problems with obesity and diabetes. An estimated 100 million Chinese people have diabetes, more than any other country.  Research released by the thinktank Chatham House in 2014 forecast that China alone is expected to eat 20m tonnes more of meat and dairy a year by 2020 and warned that “dietary change is essential” if global warming is to not exceed the 2C limit eventually imposed at the climate accord in Paris last year.  A separate report by scientists at the Oxford Martin School this year found that the widespread adoption of vegetarianism around the world could bring down greenhouse gas emissions by nearly two-thirds. “China’s move to cut meat consumption in half would not only have a huge impact on public health, it is a massive leadership step towards drastically reducing carbon emissions and reaching the goals set out in the Paris agreement,” said James Cameron.  “Animal agriculture emits more than all transportation combined. Reducing demand for animal-based foods is essential if we are to limit global warming to 2C as agreed at COP21.” Despite the Chinese government’s new commitment to reducing meat consumption, it may be difficult to convince the country’s rising middle classes to cut down. There are also strong cultural traditions attached to the eating of many animals, especially pigs. The Chinese character for “home” depicts a pig underneath the roof of a house.  Recently, Chinese companies have been buying farms in the United States and Australia to provide feed for the country’s dairy and beef industries. In late 2013 a Chinese company, Shenghui, purchased the largest US pork producer, Smithfield Foods, to help keep up with demand. “China’s consumption of meat is skyrocketing,” said Jeremy Haft, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC and author of a 2015 book, “Unmade in China: The Hidden Truth about China’s Economic Miracle.” “China’s demand for meat will continue to grow and support hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US meat industry,” he added. “From a climate perspective, the methane will still be created, but will be shifted to the United States.”"
"Rich countries must ratify the climate change agreement reached in Paris last December, one of the world’s most at-risk nations has warned. Thoriq Ibrahim, environment and energy minister of the Maldives, told the Guardian that there was “no time to waste”, in ratifying the agreement that was reached more than six months ago, and that it should be a matter of urgency for industrialised countries.  So far, almost the only countries to have passed the accord into law are the small islands most at risk from rising sea levels, and other smaller developing nations. France became the first large industrialised nation to ratify the Paris agreement only earlier this month, although a ceremony was held in New York in April at which countries were supposed to affirm their commitment to the international agreement. At Paris, nearly 200 countries agreed to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.Most of the world’s biggest economies came forward with their own domestically-binding targets for cutting carbon in the next decade or longer. For the poorest nations, likely to be most affected by climate change, the ratification is an urgent matter, said Ibrahim.  “France’s ratification is not only another indication of how seriously the international community takes the Paris agreement, but it also brings us another step closer to having it take effect,” he said. “Small island states were the first 14 countries to ratify the agreement and deposit their instruments of approval with the UN. We encourage all countries, large and small, to do the same.” He added: “The faster we bring the climate agreement into force, the faster we can take the action required. And we have no time to waste.” One of the key issues for the Maldives is the damage being done to coral reefs, an issue recently highlighted by a major Guardian investigation into the plight of the world’s most famous corals, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The Maldives have also experienced a high degree of coral bleaching, a sign of the death of reefs that comes from warming waters, pollutants and other environmental problems. Ibrahim said: “Analysis of the most recent data from the government research station shows variable levels of coral bleaching. We are closely monitoring the situation through assessment of permanent [coral] sites. It is important that we understand the recovery process on a scientifically sound basis.” Coral reefs are a key attraction for tourists to the Maldives, where visitors are one of the key drivers of the local economy. The government is sensitive about the impacts of global warming on the islands’ reefs, fearing that people will stop coming if the reefs are in danger. Ibrahim said the government and the private sector were conducting research into reef health, with a view to helping the reefs recover from their bleaching. But the future survival of the reefs would be dependent on the world keeping to the limits on carbon agreed in Paris. “It is important that we keep anthropogenic impacts to a minimum at the critical time of recovery,” he said. “We intend to widen the scope of environmental impact assessments of developments on reefs so that project activities that impact corals and coral reef habitats will be minimised.”"

"If ever there was going to be a climate change election, surely this was going to be it. As May came and the election date was announced, the implications of the global Paris agreement between more than 190 countries just months earlier were still resonating – the world was moving away from fossil fuels and the challenge to keep global warming well below 2C was agreed. The globe had just had its hottest year on record. April was the 12th consecutive month to break global heat records. In Australia, we just had the warmest autumn on record.  Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, taken at Cape Grim in Tasmania, passed a symbolic 400 parts per million, driven by the burning of fossil fuels. Moves to cut climate research at the CSIRO made international headlines.  And then, of course, there was the worst global coral bleaching event on record, bookmarked by the worst known bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef, killing about a quarter of all corals mostly in the once “pristine” northern section.  This disaster coincided with the hottest sea surface temperatures on the reef in the Bureau of Meteorology’s records going back to 1900. So climate change and clean energy should have been the red-hot issue.  But instead, at least between the ALP and the Coalition, the reaction to these seismic events was, mostly, meh.  David Ritter, chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, says the reef’s plight should have been the “tragic starting gun” for an election where all parties pitched a vision “for how Australia can flourish in a world of new technologies, renewable energy and cleaned up political economy”. It is as if the onion eater may have gone, but the bad breath of climate denialism still lingers across the government Instead, the political response was “tragically inadequate”. “The political debate has lacked all sense of proportion,” he says, reserving particular disappointment that the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had turned away from his previous passionate advocacy for action. “It is as if the onion eater may have gone, but the bad breath of climate denialism still lingers across the government.”  I’ve spoken to several leaders in the climate and environment movement in the past couple of days and one message comes through consistently.  While poll after poll shows the Australian public wants action, there’s a distinct lack of leadership from the ALP and the Coalition.  Only the Greens have consistently shown leadership – which goes almost without saying. John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, says climate was “knocking on the door” but continued to be only a “tier two issue” for the main parties. Although the ALP had a “demonstrably stronger platform” for climate change and a transition to clean energy, there was a “credibility gulf” between both main parties, their leaders and the public. “The public just doesn’t believe them,” he says.  Connor believes that whichever party gains power, the Paris climate agreement will force the hand of the next government.  As part of the process, the UN will carry out a global stocktake of climate pledges from all countries in 2018. The Paris agreement also ensures that future pledges to cut emissions improve over time. “They’ve danced around it this time, but they will have to grapple with it very soon,” he says. “This is all a curtain raiser for the next 12 months and the parties’ credibility will be put to the test.” Could one reason for the lack of leadership and low profile for the issues be down to the funding that major parties get from the fossil fuel and mining industry and the close relationships which those industries have forged across the political spectrum? Blair Palese, chief executive of the climate campaign group 350.org Australia, thinks that is a big part of the story. Her group ran a Pollution Free Politics campaign trying to get candidates to sign a simple pledge: “I support a ban on donations from fossil-fuel companies and a ban on subsidies to fossil-fuel companies.” Palese says the campaign clearly touched a nerve with the Liberals who cited it six times in its “Greening of Labor” scare campaign. Not surprisingly, no Liberals signed the pledge, but there were some successes. All sitting Greens MPs and senators signed, as have 18 Greens candidates. Serving ALP member for Richmond, Justine Elliot, signed the pledge, as did three ALP candidates: Janelle Saffin (Page), David Atkins (Cook) and Steve Hegedus (Ryan). Other notable signatories include independents Andrew Wilkie (Denison), Rob Oakeshott (Cowper) and Rob Taber (New England). Palese says after the election her group will push harder for a reform of the opaque system of political donations and for a national corruption commission to be established. Palese, too, says there has been a lack of leadership, particularly on the need to prepare communities and workers for the unfolding transition away from coal to renewables. ‘There is a terrifying lack of leadership – at national and state level – and it means workers are being left high and dry,” she says. Announcing its election scorecard (links to others at the bottom of this post), WWF Australia’s chief executive, Dermot O’Gorman, said as the environment faced huge challenges “this generation of political leaders has not yet stepped up to reflect the concerns of the vast majority of Australians”. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, is similarly unimpressed with the political leadership. Only thanks to momentum from community groups and the tragic bleaching of the reef had the issues been pushed briefly into the limelight. “The Coalition just didn’t want to talk about it – their policies are quite weak,” she says. “The ALP has much stronger clean energy transition policies, but neither leader has led the charge.”  O’Shanassy believes one campaign from a coalition of environment groups, including ACF, WWF and The Wilderness Society, called Places You Love, has helped to push environmental law reform on to the ALP’s policy platform. “For a country with such a beautiful natural environment, we have such incredibly weak laws,” she says. The Coalition did make one major environmental announcement when Turnbull joining the environment minister, Greg Hunt, in Townsville to reveal a $1bn reef fund.  But campaign groups were quick to criticise the plan. Not only was it several billions short of what one group of scientists say is needed, but the announcement was just a shifting of existing cash from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation which the Coalition has been trying to shut down. “There’s no additional carbon reduction benefit from that,” says Imogen Zethoven, Great Barrier Reef campaign director at the Australian Marine Conservation Society. “We did send the Coalition a series of questions on that announcement, but we didn’t get any answers. It raises more questions than it answers.” She says one major win was a policy commitment from Labor to regulate pollution levels flowing into the reef. “That is not to be underestimated,” she says. “That would be a major step forward.” So who should you vote for if you want to improve the chances of survival for the reef and Australia’s unique habitats and help the country make the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels? To help with that decision, in recent days the Climate Institute, WWF, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Marine Conservation Society have all published assessments of the key parties on their environment and climate polices. You should read them and then go and vote."
"May was the 13th month in a row to break temperature records according to figures published this week that are the latest in 2016’s string of incredible climate records which scientists have described as a bombshell and an emergency.  The series of smashed global records, particularly the extraordinary heat in February and March, has provoked a stunned reaction from climate scientists, who are warning that climate change has reached unprecedented levels and is no longer only a threat for the future. Alongside the soaring temperatures, other records have tumbled around the world, from vanishing Arctic sea ice to a searing drought in India and the vast bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. The UK has experienced record flooding that has devastated communities across the country and scientists predict that the flash floods seen by parts of the country in recent days will increase in future.  “The impacts of human-caused climate change are no longer subtle – they are playing out, in real time, before us,” says Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University in the US. “They serve as a constant reminder now of how critical it is that we engage in the actions necessary to avert ever-more dangerous and potentially irreversible warming of the planet.” It was just last December when the world’s nations sealed a deal in Paris to defeat global warming but Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, says: “These [records] are very worrying signs and I think it shows we are on a crash course with the Paris targets unless we change course very, very fast. I hope people realise that global warming is not something down the road, but it is here now and it affecting us now.” “What is happening right now is we are catapulting ourselves out of the Holocene, which is the geological epoch that human civilisation has been able to develop in, because of the relatively stable climate,” says Rahmstorf. “It allowed us to invent agriculture, rather than living as nomads. It allowed a big population growth, it allowed the foundation of cities, all of which required a stable climate.” But the spikes in global surface temperatures in recent months have been anything but stable. They did not just break the records, they obliterated them. “The numbers are completely unprecedented,” says Adam Scaife, at the Met Office in the UK. “They really stick out like a sore thumb.”  The scorching temperatures mean 2016 is all but certain to be the hottest year ever recorded, beating the previous hottest year in 2015, which itself beat 2014. This run of three record years is also unprecedented and, without climate change, would be a one in a million chance. Scaife says: “Including this year so far, 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have been since 2000 – it’s a shocking statistic.” Thermometer records go back to 1880, but ice cores, tree rings and corals show global warming driven by humanity’s burning of fossil fuels and forests has left the planet at its hottest for at least 5,000 years. “If we are not above this [temperature] already, we will be in 10 or 20 years’ time and then you have to go back 120,000 years to find higher temperatures than present,” says Rahmstorf. Another shattered record is the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is on course to rise by a record amount this year, leaving the symbolic landmark of 400 parts per million to history. “We know from Antarctic ice cores that go back almost a million years that CO2 was never even remotely as high as this,” says Rahmstorf, and the rate at which humanity is emitting CO2 is the fastest for 66m years. Fast-rising CO2 levels are almost entirely the reason for the record-busting year. But the natural climate phenomenon called El Niño has played a part. Cyclical changes in ocean temperatures over decades lead to El Niños during which stored heat is released from the oceans, impacting temperatures and weather around the globe. Scientists agree about a fifth of the temperature rise seen in recent months is due to El Niño. However Scaife says: “I suspect some of the months would have still been records, even without the El Niño”. He points out that 1998 saw an ever bigger El Niño, resulting in a record hot year, but that this has now been far surpassed: “It is not even in the running anymore, falling way down the list.” El Niño is now waning into to its opposite phase, called La Niña. But that does not allay the scientists’ climate concerns: “The La Niña will not be as cool as the El Niño was warm. We are very, very sure of that,” says Scaife. “It probably means that 2017 will not be a record year, but compared to other La Niña years, it is likely to be much warmer than normal.” Furthermore, there may be more to the record-breaking series than meets the eye. “There is something more going on than the usual global warming trend and El Niño, because in the past El Niño has led to single years breaking records, but it has not caused several years in a row to break records,” says Rahmstorf. “There is some unexplained part to this and it is concerning, because we don’t understand it and it is hotter than expected,” he says. “I hope the data coming in the next six months or so will bring us some important clues.” The heat so far has already had major impacts, including a record temperature of 51C in India amid a serious drought and a record warm autumn in Australia, as well as many in the US. “It is in my view highly unlikely that we would be seeing record drought, like we’re seeing in California, record flooding in Texas, unprecedented wildfires in western North America, and the strongest recorded hurricanes in both the northern and southern hemisphere were it not for the impact of human-caused global warming,” says Mann. Killer heatwaves are increasing too, which is the clearest impact of global warming, says Rahmstorf: “Our analysis of monthly heat records around the globe shows they now occur five times as often. It is those monthly heat records that are representative of heatwaves that last for weeks on end and they are ones that take the highest death toll.” The UK has been affected too, with December breaking temperature and rainfall records.  “Climate change means more intense rainfall and therefore an increased risk of flooding,” says Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. “The government, which got caught out by two record wet winters in the last three, has suddenly woken up to the fact, which is why they have set up the National Flood Resilience Review. It is now something we are all going to have to come to terms with in the UK.” Ward says seeing the records broken may mean more people make the connection between action on to cut emissions, such as support for green energy, and the impacts of global warming. He says the global climate deal agreed in December shows every government already knows this is a problem that needs urgent action, but that the high temperatures already occurring will increase the emphasis on adapting to extreme weather events in addition to cutting carbon emissions. “The impacts we’re beginning to see are just the start and we know we are going to be facing a worsening situation for at least the next couple of decades even if we do cut emissions,” Ward says. “What’s worrying [about the record-breaking 2016] is that we are in unprecedented territory and we don’t really know what the consequences will be,” he says. “There are likely to be plenty of surprises, some of which will be nasty.”"
"In last week’s Brexit vote results, there was a tremendous divide between age groups. 73% of voters under the age of 25 voted to remain in the EU, while about 58% over the age of 45 voted to leave. How does Thursday's referendum vote break down? #Brexit #EURefResults https://t.co/ArbedCgHDr pic.twitter.com/XPIdg0s8HP   This generational gap is among the many parallels between Brexit and climate change. A 2014 poll found that 74% of Americans under the age of 30 support government policies to cut carbon pollution, as compared to just 58% of respondents over the age of 40, and 52% over the age of 65. The problem is of course that younger generations will have to live with the consequences of the decisions we make today for much longer than older generations. Older generations in developed countries prospered as a result of the burning of fossil fuels for seemingly cheap energy.  However, we’ve already reached the point where even contrarian economists agree, any further global warming we experience will be detrimental for the global economy. For poorer countries, we passed that point decades ago. A new paper examining climate costs and fossil fuel industry profits for the years 2008–2012 found: For all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their CO2 emissions was greater than their after‐tax profit, with the single exception of Exxon Mobil in 2008 For much of the time during which developed nations experienced strong economic growth as a result of fossil fuel consumption, we were unaware of the associated climate costs. We can no longer use ignorance as an excuse. And yet the older generations, who experienced the greatest net benefit from carbon pollution, are now the least supportive of taking responsibility to pay for it. The longer we delay, the more devastating the consequences will be for the younger generations. Similarly, today’s youth who are early in their career paths will face the harshest consequences of the Brexit vote that was dominated by older voters. As Jack Lennard put it: This is a final middle-fingered salute to the young from the baby boomer generation. Not content with racking up insurmountable debt, not content with destroying any hopes of sustainable property prices or stable career paths, not content with enjoying the benefits of free education and generous pension schemes before burning down the ladder they climbed up, the baby boomers have given one last turd on the doorstep of the younger generation. And as political journalist Nicholas Barrett said in a comment that subsequently went viral: the younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of the lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experiences we will be denied. Freedom of movement was taken away by our parents, uncles, and grandparents in a parting blow to a generation that was already drowning in the debts of our predecessors. Thirdly and perhaps most significantly, we now live in a post-factual democracy. As Barrett noted, during the Brexit campaign, facts seemed useless against the myths propagated by the Leave side. Indeed, Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing UK Independence Party and Leave campaign has already admitted the key claim that £350 million weekly saving in EU contributions could be spent on health services was utter nonsense – a “mistake,” as he put it. A “mistake” that was conveniently admitted just hours after Brexit votes had been cast and counted. When asked to name a single economist who backed Brexit, justice secretary and another top Leave campaigner Michael Gove said “people in this country have had enough of experts” and later likened those experts to Nazis. Climate denial is based on a similar strain of anti-intellectualism and preponderance of baseless myths. When faced with the reality of a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, many will deny that reality, propagate a number of associated myths, or like Gove, find an excuse to disregard expert opinion and evidence (e.g. by arguing that scientific consensus ‘has been wrong before’). Ultimately it boils down to ideological biases. When the facts and expert conclusions contradict our beliefs, people will often find an excuse to dismiss the evidence and experts. It’s perhaps unsurprising that as DeSmogUK revealed, Gove and many other Leave campaign backers are also climate contrarians. Experts warned of the dangerous consequences that would result from Brexit, but the majority of older voters chose to ignore those risks. Prudent risk management was trumped by ideology, and today’s youth will have to bear the brunt of the consequences. Climate change similarly poses tremendous long-term risks, particularly to younger generations. The UK has thus far been a leader in mitigating those risks, but with the EU exit and potential installment of right-wing climate-denying political leaders, that leadership may be in jeopardy, and the EU’s climate pledges may be compromised. Americans have similarly failed to adequately manage political and climate risks. One of the two dominant US political parties obstructs all efforts to curb carbon pollution, and has also nominated Donald Trump for president: the embodiment of risky behavior. It now falls to the US to do better than the UK. Risk management and the well-being of future generations must trump ideology and fear in the November elections. We simply can’t afford two of the world’s superpowers being dictated by populism and xenophobia at the expense of our youth’s future."

"An estimated 24 million passengers are expected to cruise the world’s oceans in more than 220 cruise ships this year, up from 19.1 million in 2010. But these giant floating playgrounds leave an enormous environmental impact.  Many large ocean liners run on giant diesel engines, which can stand at more than three stories tall and span the length of two school buses. This equipment, along with smaller auxiliary engines, can emit dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide. Curbing these emissions could prevent 14,000 premature, air pollution-related deaths and save the US $110bn by 2020.  According to a newly released Friends of the Earth’s (Foe) report card, cruise line companies are mostly doing a poor job at reducing air and water pollution. Foe’s report card, the sixth from the US nonprofit, assigned 17 cruise lines and their 171 ships a grade between A and F in four categories: sewage treatment, water quality, air pollution reduction and transparency. Some companies, like Disney Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line, earned an A in at least two categories. But most of them, such as Carnival Cruise Lines and Silversea Cruises, scored on the low end. Crystal Cruises and Costa Cruises received mostly Fs. “The industry represents itself as a benefactor for the ocean, but we think that’s not the case with all of these lines,” said Marcie Keever, oceans and vessels program director at Foe. “We want passengers to know they can make a change with their dollars.” Foe isn’t alone in criticizing the environmental impact of cruise ships. While international rules are in place to regulate pollution, advocacy groups say these efforts aren’t nearly enough. Residents in port cities, including London, have protested plans to accommodate more cruise ships. The 2016 report card is the first since a dispute emerged between Foe and the Cruise Line International Association (Clia), which represents cruise companies in North America, over how Foe analyzed data. In 2014, Clia announced that it would no longer work with Foe to produce the scorecard, and its members followed suit. That prompted Foe to add “transparency” to the 2014 scorecard and give every company an F. Since then, one company has had a change of heart. By supplying data to Foe, Disney Cruise Line is the only company that got an A for transparency in the 2016 scorecard. Disney didn’t respond to requests for comment. Clia hasn’t changed its stance since 2014. In a statement to the Guardian, Clia called the report card “unscientific” and contended that Foe used “outdated sources”. “Once again, it is regrettable that Foe has issued a report on the cruise industry that is misleading and inaccurate,” the industry organization said. Foe found much of its information for the report online, Keever said. The sources included contractors who have installed waste treatment technologies and air purifiers on the ships. Keever said many of the ships from its 2014 scorecard remain in the fleets, so the information Foe had collected in the past should still be valid. But she admits this method of information gathering has its drawbacks. “I’m sure this has mistakes,” she said. “Which is why we were hopeful [the cruise lines] would get back to us.” The new scorecard shows that companies have made the biggest improvement in reducing their air pollution by using newer technology. They made that switch in response to a recent international regulation, which requires all ships sailing within 200 nautical miles of the US and Canada coastline to use cleaner fuel or install technology that reduces the sulfur content in emissions. Clia said its members have invested $1bn in new technologies and cleaner fuels, as well as $8bn to build ships fueled by natural gas, which are more energy efficient and produce lower emissions. While Foe gave companies higher grades of Bs and Cs instead of Ds and Fs from previous years for pollution control, it maintains that more can be done. For example, a scrubber that is commonly used to remove sulfur dioxide from a ship’s smokestacks does not remove other particulates from the diesel engines, Keever said, adding that she would like to see cruise companies use filters that can do a better job of cleaning the exhaust. “We wanted to give them credit for installing technology that gets them part of the way, but they can be doing better,” she said. The companies demonstrated the least improvement in their sewage treatment systems, said Keever. An average cruise ship carrying 3,000 passengers and crew generates 21,000 gallons of sewage a day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Many cruise lines are using outdated systems to filter their sewage, resulting in minimally treated sewage being dumped into the water, according to Keever. However, Keever praised Royal Caribbean for installing advanced technologies in 24 of its 25 ships that essentially use more filters. But installing new technologies doesn’t mean cruise companies are using them, especially when they are further out in the sea and difficult to monitor, Keever noted. Foe hopes that pressure from advocacy groups and consumers will prompt cruise lines to provide more data and demonstrate improvements. “We’re hopeful that Disney’s willingness to respond to our information requests points to the beginnings of a sea change [by cruise companies to be] transparent about environmental responsibility,” Keever said."
"A mysterious and deadly kidney disease has been plaguing labourers in the sugar fields of Central America. In the past 20 years, some 20,000 workers have died of the disease, and the crisis has been growing worse.  At first the epidemic was thought to be caused by chemicals such as pesticides, but the disease only affected labourers in coastal areas – those working at higher altitude in hills were largely unaffected.  A recent study found that hard work in the hot climate of the lowlands left workers dehydrated, putting such a heavy strain on their kidneys that it fatally damaged them. “When it’s extremely hot, the risk for kidney damage really begins to become evident,” said Richard Johnson of the University of Colorado, Denver.  Similar epidemics of kidney disease were also found in farm workers in other hot climates, in Sri Lanka, Egypt and Andhra Pradesh in India. And as global temperatures rise and heat waves become more intense, so the new type of kidney disease is increasing, according to the study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Another impact of global warming is more cases of kidney stones. This painful condition results from salts crystallising in the kidneys, often caused by dehydration. In the US, around 50% more cases of kidney stones occur in the warm climate of southern regions than northern states.  And the number of cases has been rising since temperatures began to warm noticeably in the late 1970s, especially in the summer. As the climate warms further, the high-risk zone for kidney stones is expected to expand northwards, with many more new cases predicted.  "
"The climate system is a unifying ethical field that extends from the physical to the metaphysical and connects your actions to my well-being, and vice-versa, no matter how remote your life is from mine. The Golden Rule we have always treated as an abstract moral recommendation is now visibly playing out its logic in the physical world. This period in history must be about useful innovations that rescue Earth systems from collapse and dignify human beings everywhere. We must dare to imagine, explore, and remake the limits of our experience, together.  For centuries explorers have traveled the Earth in search of treasure, glory and, in the best cases, discovery. Exploration of our planet in the 21st Century has radically changed, as we now understand the basic science of how our shared planet functions. We can no longer afford to see ourselves as separate from one another, despite wide variations in geography and social organization. Conflict and war have become obsolete as means to resolve tensions in this new era, defined by the mandate that we become able and reliable stewards of natural systems. Discovery in our age means mapping hidden connections between business practices, political decisions, droughts, floods, the resilience of bee populations, and the reliability of institutions that support well-being at the human scale. The collective actions of billions of human beings are threatening the most basic systems which provide life to us all on our little blue planet. We have choices to make in how we collect, own and distribute the remaining natural resources that seemed endless just a century ago. Climate change is now integral to human experience and is already multiplying the threats that can lead humanity down the path of perpetual conflict. Climate disruption creates conditions where harm is more likely, and conditions where harm is more likely also make it more difficult for a society to respond to severe climate impacts. This exacerbates the risk of conflict, migration, and failed states. Such conditions attract criminal networks who prey on people pushed into extreme vulnerability. The climate challenge puts us in a state of conflict with our own future well-being. The best way to avoid conflict and devastation is to reach success without passing through conflict in the first place. Peace-building is a faster route to health, security and prosperity than conflict-building. Daring servants of humanity like Kailash Satyarthi—who has rescued 85,000 children from slavery and trafficking—recognize the need to commit to peace-building, education, mutual thriving, and to living with joy and imagination. Satyarthi’s courageous work draws people to it. This is why, at this writing, he is the beating heart of a first-of-its-kind peace congress organized around his work. In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, Satyarthi said:  There is no greater violence than to deny the dreams of our children ... I refuse to accept that the shackles of slavery can ever be stronger than the quest for freedom. There is a quiet daring that happens in the person who says “I refuse to accept” what is not right. Without that quiet moment of daring, the effort to confront the unacceptable cannot get started. The value of daring is that it infuses our first step into action with the knowledge that something better is possible. The resonance of that initial daring must be sustained throughout any effort to craft a better future. Human potential moves across networks of support and rivalry. We receive the unforeseen breakthrough, because many kinds of uncommon daring come together and go beyond ambition, daring the excellence that comes with collaboration. We need to be open to seeing these subtle sparks that show a mind is committed to imagining beyond hardship. There is no predetermined human type that is right for exploration, public office, pioneering research, or ending slavery. The greatest scientific mind of this century may belong to a 3-year-old girl, living in a village with zero access to clean water, surrounded by armed militants, in a remote area of Yemen. If she is forced to remain in obscurity by circumstance or by cruelty, we will all have less ready access to truth and discovery. Everyone will be poorer for that loss, and we don’t know by how much. We are now beginning to understand the many connections that bind human experience across the world, through Earth’s life-support systems. We must dare to embrace the complexity of this emerging fabric of knowledge, exploration, and innovation. We must dare to use our intelligence ethically and with grace, to serve the health and well-being of natural systems and of generations yet to come.

"In 2013, a team of citizen science volunteers who collaborate on the climate myth debunking website SkepticalScience.com published a paper finding a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming in peer-reviewed research. Over the past 3 years, that paper has been downloaded more than 500,000 times. For perspective, that’s 4 times more than the second-most downloaded paper in the Institute of Physics journals (which includes Environmental Research Letters, where the 97% consensus paper was published). The statistic reveals a remarkable level of interest for a peer-reviewed scientific paper. Over a three-year period, the study has been downloaded an average of 440 times per day, and the pace has hardly slowed. Over the past year, the download rate has remained high, at 415 per day.  The 97% study and other consensus research has been attacked and misrepresented, which led to a follow-up paper in which authors of seven previous climate consensus studies collaborated to settle the question once and for all. The two key conclusions from the paper were: 1) Depending on exactly how you measure the expert consensus, it’s somewhere between 90% and 100% that agree humans are responsible for climate change, with most of our studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists. 2) The greater the climate expertise among those surveyed, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming. That follow-up paper, published two months ago, has already been downloaded 45,000 times. Interestingly, the 2013 consensus paper has returned to the top spot as currently the most-read paper in Environmental Research Letters, with the 2016 follow-up study coming in second. Those who want to preserve the status quo have continued to deny and attack the expert consensus because it’s a “gateway belief”: when people are aware of the high level of scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, they’re more likely to accept that climate change is happening, that humans are causing it, and support policies to reduce carbon pollution. As Republican strategist Frank Luntz said in an infamous memo leaked in 2003: Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly.  Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate. Many contrarians have continued to follow this advice, and as a result, the public is still poorly misinformed about the magnitude of the expert consensus.  Social scientists have coined the term “consensus gap” to describe the large discrepancy between the actual 97% consensus, and the public perception that just half to two-thirds of experts agree on human-caused global warming. The consensus gap is likely a result of a concerted decades-long misinformation campaign by the fossil fuel industry, and false balance in media climate coverage. However, since the publication of our 2013 paper, the consensus gap has modestly shrunk, and media coverage of the subject has become increasingly accurate.  While only 11% of Americans realize the expert consensus is above 90%, the percentage who realize that global warming is happening and human-caused is on the rise over the past several years. The paper itself was not particularly novel. It was a follow-up to Naomi Oreskes’ 2004 study that similarly examined the expert consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed literature. In her sample of 928 such papers, Oreskes was unable to find any that explicitly rejected human-caused global warming. Two subsequent papers published in 2009 and 2010 found a 97% expert consensus on the subject. Nevertheless, nearly a decade after Oreskes’ study, climate contrarians were claiming that a ‘growing number’ of scientists and papers were rejecting the expert consensus. “There is no consensus” has been the fourth-most popular myth in the Skeptical Science database. Our team decided it would be worthwhile to expand upon and update Oreskes’ study to test these claims. We found that instead of a growing denial, the percentage of peer-reviewed papers rejecting or minimizing the human role in global warming has declined over the past 20 years. In 2011, the last year we examined, 98% of papers endorsed the consensus. The good news is that there’s a remarkable amount of public interest in the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and public awareness of the consensus has grown. However, with only 11% of Americans realizing that over 90% of experts agree on human-caused global warming, we still have a long way to go before the public becomes sufficiently aware of the magnitude of the consensus and urgency of the climate threat."
"German prosecutors have opened an investigation into the former Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn over allegations of market manipulation in relation to the company’s diesel emissions scandal.  According to the state prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig, there was “sufficient concrete evidence” that Volkswagen had deliberately delayed informing shareholders of last year’s emissions scandal and the potential financial damage it could cause.  The investigation into market manipulation, initiated by a complaint on behalf of the German federal financial supervisory agency BaFin, is focusing on two former VW executives, including Winterkorn, who resigned in September after eight years at the helm. Winterkorn has apologised and said he took full responsibility for the scandal, but so far denies any personal wrongdoing. While not disclosing the name of the second top executive, a statement on behalf of the Braunschweig prosecutor, Klaus Ziehe, clarified that the current chairman of the supervisory board, Hans Dieter Pötsch, VW’s finance chief at the time of the scandal, was not being investigated. Seventeen former VW employees, including lower-level managers, are being investigated on suspicion of fraud. Following accusations by the US environment protection agency (EPA), the German carmaker admitted on 22 September 2015 that 11m of its diesel cars were equipped with software that detected if the vehicle was being driven under lab test conditions, and adjusted itself to reduce emissions of harmful nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution. Under real-world conditions, the NOx emissions were considerably higher. The company has since admitted that Winterkorn was informed of the illegal emissions at least a year before, having been sent a memo detailing the cars’ higher nitrogen oxide emissions in May 2014. In addition, it was revealed on Monday that European commission experts issued warnings about potential emissions test cheating as far back as 2010. Companies registered on the stock exchange are obliged by law to inform investors of previously unknown events or circumstances that could considerably influence the price of shares. In its annual report, published on 28 April, VW said it had not understood the full impact of the emissions scandal until the summer. “According to the assessment at the time by the members of the board of management dealing with the matter, the scope of the costs expected as a result by the Volkswagen Group was basically not dissimilar to that of previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were involved, and therefore appeared to be controllable overall with a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group,” the report said. The latest allegations come before VW’s annual shareholder meeting in Hanover on Wednesday, where Winterkorn’s successor, Matthias Müller, former chief executive of VW-owned Porsche, faces scrutiny from investors. Having reported a net loss of €1.58bn for 2015, the carmaker still went on to pay its 120,000 staff bonuses of €3,950 per head – €474m in total – after pressure from its works committee and the metalworkers’ union. In the US, the department of justice has demanded up to $46bn for the violations – a fine so large that some have speculated it may drive VW out of the American market.       "
"How ambitious is the world? The Paris climate conference last December astounded many by pledging not just to keep warming “well below two degrees celsius,” but also to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C. That raised a hugely important question: What’s the difference between a two-degree world and a 1.5-degree world?  Given we are already at one degree above pre-industrial levels, halting at 1.5C would look to be at least twice as hard as the two-degree option.  So would it be worth it? And is it even remotely achievable? In Paris, delegates called on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to report on the implications of a 1.5C target. They want the job done by 2018, in time to inform renewed talks on toughening emissions targets beyond those agreed upon in Paris.  But the truth is that scientists are only now getting out of the blocks to address what a 1.5C world would look like, because until recently it sounded like a political and technological impossibility. As a commentary published online in Nature Climate Change last week warned, there is “a paucity of scientific analysis” about the consequences of pursuing a 1.5C target.  To remedy this, the paper’s researchers, led by Daniel Mitchell and others at Oxford University, called for a dedicated program of research to help inform what they described as “arguably one of the most momentous [decisions] to be made in the coming decade.” And they are on the case, with their own dedicated website and a major conference planned at Oxford in the fall.  So what is at stake? There are two issues to address. First, what would be gained by going the extra mile for 1.5? And second, what would it take to deliver?  First, the gains. According to available research, says the Oxford group, the biggest boost will not be measured in average temperatures. On its own, the difference between 1.5C and 2C is marginal. But it would have a much greater effect on the probability of extreme and destructive weather events like floods, droughts, storms, and heatwaves.  We know extreme weather is happening more often. A study last year by Erich Fischer of the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich found that the risk of what was “once in a 1,000 days” hot weather has already increased fivefold. His modelling suggests that it will double again at 1.5C and double once more as we go from 1.5 to 2C. The probability of even more extreme events increases even faster. The same will be true for droughts, says Carl-Friedrich Schleussner of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Last year, he reported that the extra half-degree would produce dramatic increases in the likely length of dry spells over wide areas of the globe, including the Mediterranean, Central America, the Amazon basin, and southern Africa, with resulting declines in river flows from a third to a half. Schleussner concluded that going from 1.5 to 2C “marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions.”  A few studies have tried to drill down to what the difference means for day-to-day lives. And the consequences for many will be stark. At two degrees, parts of southwest Asia, including well-populated regions of the Persian Gulf and Yemen, may become literally uninhabitable without permanent air conditioning.  Some researchers predict a massive decline in the viability of food crops critical for human survival. The extra half-degree could cut corn yields in parts of Africa by half, says Bruce Campbell of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. Schleussner found that even in the prairies of the US, the risk of poor corn yields would double.  Two degrees, says Johan Rockström, director of the Stockholm Resilience Center, “contains significant risks for societies everywhere; 1.5 looks much more scientifically justifiable.” Ecosystems would feel the difference too. Take tropical coral reefs, which already regularly come under stress because of high ocean temperatures, suffering “bleaching” especially during El Niño events – as happened on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia this year. Most can now recover when the waters cool again, but today’s exceptional temperature may soon become the new normal. “Virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards,” as warming slips past 1.5C , reports Schleussner. By some estimates, curbing warming at 1.5C could be sufficient to prevent the formation of an ice-free Arctic in summer, to save the Amazon rainforest, and to prevent the Siberian tundra from melting and releasing planet-warming methane from its frozen depths. It could also save many coastal regions and islands from permanent inundation by rising sea levels, particularly in the longer run.  In 2100, the difference in sea level rise between 1.5C and 2C would be relatively small: 40cm versus 50cm. But centuries later, as the impact of warmer air temperatures on the long-term stability of the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica takes hold, it would be far greater. Michiel Schaeffer of Climate Analytics, a Berlin-based think tank, calculates that by 2300, two degrees would deliver sea level rise of 2.7 meters, while 1.5 degrees would limit the rise to 1.5 meters. It looks like 1.5C matters a great deal. So how hard would it be to keep warming to that level? After all, last year was one degree above pre-industrial levels. And at various times in the past six months, global average temperatures have sometimes gone above 1.5C.  Most researchers agree that, short of some global economic meltdown, even decade-long averaged temperatures are destined to go above 1.5C of warming by mid-century. So delivering the target by the end of the century will require drawing down temperatures by using technologies and energy systems that can extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on a large scale.  For some, this would be nonsensical geoengineering. Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist at the University of Manchester in the UK, writing in Nature after the Paris conference, declared “the world has just gambled its future on the appearance, in a puff of smoke, of a carbon-sucking fairy godmother.”  But it could be done. The calculations are inexact. Nobody, even now, knows quite how sensitive global temperatures are to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But here is the task, as outlined by Joeri Rogelj, of the Austria-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in an article in Nature Climate Change in March. The planet’s primary thermostat is the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Pre-industrial levels were 280 parts per million. We just hit 400 ppm with warming at one degree and some more in the pipeline, due to time lags. The IPCC, in its most recent report, estimated that to stop at 1.5C will mean holding concentrations to around 430 ppm. Because much of our CO2 emissions stay in the atmosphere for centuries, that means bringing annual emissions to zero. Impossible? Maybe, but the good news is that greenhouse gas emissions actually fell in 2015 despite rising global economic activity, thanks to the growing use of renewable energy. If we could build on that and bring emissions to zero by 2050, then we might limit emissions from here on out to 800bn tons. If we could somehow find ways to extract 500bn tons from the atmosphere, Rogelj concluded, we would likely be able to have our wish of CO2 concentrations of 430 ppm and warming capped at 1.5C. The fairy godmother would have delivered. But how? While there are chemical processes for removing CO2 out of the air, they remain very expensive. More likely are biological methods — using plants to soak up CO2 and then preventing that CO2 from getting back into the atmosphere when the plants die or are burned. The trick that puts a glint in the eye of some technologists and climate scientists is known by the acronym BECCS, which stands for “biomass energy, carbon capture, and storage.” The idea is to convert the world’s power stations to burning biomass, such as trees or marine algae. The industrialized production of this biomass on such a scale would accelerate the natural drawdown of CO2 by plants during photosynthesis. If the CO2 created by burning the biomass could then be captured from the stacks and buried in geological strata — the prototype technology known as carbon capture and storage — then the net effect would be a permanent extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere. It would be the reverse of the current fossil-fuel energy system. And the more energy generated, the more CO2 would be drawn out of the air. There are huge questions about such a strategy. Wouldn’t such a vast new industry have its own absurdly high-energy requirements, putting us back at square one? Is there the land available to cultivate all that biomass? Would we end up chopping down forests to make room for growing the biomass, creating a massive new source of emissions? While there are back-of-the-envelope calculations, nobody has yet satisfactorily answered these questions.  Other geo-engineering options that have been proposed include fertilizing the oceans so that more algae can grow, sucking up CO2 as they do, or a terrestrial equivalent – burying charred biomass known as biochar into soils, where it could provide a kind of deep fertilizer that would turn soils into carbon-suckers over many centuries. But says IIASA’s Florian Kraxner, “Of all the ways of achieving negative emissions, BECCS seems to be the most promising.”  Is this all scientific pie in the sky? Some analysts argue that, whatever was said in Paris, there is little chance of hitting even two degrees, let alone anything tougher. David Victor, of the University of California at San Diego, for instance, wrote in Yale Environment 360 at the conclusion of the Paris agreement that “the world has dithered for too long and must now brace for the consequences. Even a realistic crash program to cut emissions will blow through 2C; 1.5C is ridiculous.”  Others say that even trying to paint a picture of what a 1.5C world would look like is a fool’s errand. Mike Hulme of King’s College London in England wrote recently that it could result in bad science, because predictions about future local climate come with such wide error bars. He wondered whether, even at the request of the Paris conference, science should be “corralled into servicing a tightly determined political agenda.”  But the Oxford team is not having such defeatism. “It is our job as scientists, first and foremost, to inform. Whether or not the information we provide makes a difference is ultimately up to others,” they say in their new paper. Moreover, they point out, “if additional research is not undertaken as a matter of urgency, there is a danger… that the 2018 special report will present all the negative economic constraints of achieving 1.5C” without reporting on the potential positive impacts of reduced extreme weather activity that such a scenario could bring.  Ultimately, this is a highly political issue about who should be in charge of setting targets: those most vulnerable nations, who led the call in Paris for a 1.5C target, or those less vulnerable nations in the rich world, who were ready to stick with two degrees? Them or us? As Petra Tschakert of Penn State University put it in a paper last year, “danger, risk, and harm would be utterly unacceptable in a 2C warmer world, largely for ‘them’ – the mollusks, and coral reefs, and the poor and marginalized populations, not only in poor countries – even if this danger has not quite hit home yet for ‘us’.”"
"Our security and prosperity depend on a successful response to climate change, the most urgent challenge of our time. So does any prospect of a transition to a way of living together that is just and sustainable. And if we fail on climate, we lose the very capacity to shape our destiny that makes sovereignty worth having.  Today’s European Union is, yes, tired, damaged and in need of reform. But without the EU the climate struggle would have been lost already. It was almost lost at Copenhagen in 2009. But European nations had the vision to stick to the commitments they had put on the table. Acting in concert they avoided a race to the bottom between member states. Europe’s example strengthened the hand of those in Asia, Africa and the Americas who wanted their own countries to do more. European diplomacy helped forge the global coalition that in Paris last year finally forced ajar the door to a post-fossil age. And throughout, European social movements have mobilised across borders to keep governments honest. The UK was at the forefront of these efforts. Far from undermining our sovereignty, our membership of the EU made it possible to secure our national interest. Paris was merely the end of the beginning. Those who cling to an energy future based on coal, oil and gas will now fight all the harder to protect the value of their assets. Just when we need a redoubling of effort, Brexit would gravely weaken Europe’s capacity to act on climate. And its consequences in the UK would be calamitous. Brexit would leave the field clear for those on the right who always hated the idea that by intervening in the economy for the public good we should build an energy system that is clean, efficient, decentralised and driven by the needs of households and communities, not overbearing private corporations. They would demand the repeal of the Climate Change Act, the dismantling of the Department of Energy and Climate Change, a new dash for gas with even more fracking than is currently in prospect, and the removal of any remaining measures to encourage renewables, energy efficiency and community energy. The record of the leading Brexiters, in whose image a post-referendum government would be shaped, offers no reassurance that they would resist any of this. This referendum may feel like a Hobson’s choice between rival factions of a self-absorbed establishment, each equally out of touch with how most of us live our lives. Neither faction has much to say about who we are, or about what kind of country we should be trying to build, let alone how to deal with climate change. But in reality the choice between remain or leave will be as momentous as any we will ever have to make. Those who say this is a choice about democracy are right. We have an electoral system that, far from bringing us together, now widens the divisions in a country too divided already. Our ruling Conservative party, catapulted into office to its own astonishment by fewer than a quarter of eligible voters, is busy dismantling our public realm, while doing its best to rein in our civil society, our trade unions, dissident local authorities and anyone else who might have the audacity to challenge their profoundly antidemocratic project. Even, irony of ironies, our unelected House of Lords. Our democracy is indeed broken. But it is we who have broken it, not the EU. Those who say this is a choice about sovereignty are right. The same establishment that talks down to us about the EU from its entrenchments across politics, the media and business fell in thrall long ago to the illusion that markets not people know best; that no public authority, only business, can be trusted to interpret the will of the market; and that the market should never be thwarted in pursuit of the public good. The market is like fire. It can serve us well if we control it. Otherwise it consumes everything in its path. The crash of 2008 was an invitation to build a better fireplace. But as soon as the fire was brought back under control, those who lead us have chosen instead to keep pouring petrol on it. Our sovereignty is indeed compromised. But it is we who have compromised it. We surrendered it not to the EU but to a market cult whose high priests are to be found not in Berlin, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Warsaw or Brussels but rather closer to home. We can win our democracy back. But to win it we must work with democratic forces across Europe, not cut ourselves off from them by leaving the EU. We can win our sovereignty back. But to win it we must escort the high priests of the market cult from their citadels here at home, not strengthen their hold by leaving the EU. We need to believe in our democracy and our sovereignty if we are to win the climate struggle. We need to play our part in building an unstoppable coalition of like-minded forces across our continent, as we have in halting (for now) the ill-conceived TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) trade deal. If we can do that we will inspire a new generation of Europeans, and reawaken a European project we all now need more than ever in a world more dangerous even than it was 60 years ago. We should opt for hope by voting to remain."

"It’s an ephemeral thing to build a campaign on – the assurance of stability and the accusation that your rival will cause inevitable chaos – hard to prove and easily rocked by unpredictable circumstance. And Malcolm Turnbull’s central campaign pitch was buffeted in every direction on Friday.  Coalition strategists are sure that Britain’s shock Brexit vote will lure disillusioned and distracted voters back to the party usually seen as more capable economic managers. Turnbull was quick to link it to his message. But Labor strategists see an opening too, urging voters to question who the Coalition would look after in a time of economic crisis. But even before the Brexit vote other factors were pressuring Turnbull’s stability v chaos message. Questions about the marriage equality plebiscite saw the differences between Turnbull and the Coalition conservatives, which were supposed to remain out of sight until after the election, edge into the political daylight. The camps reached a temporary truce after the leadership change last September, when Turnbull accepted (among other things) the marriage equality plebiscite he had so persuasively bagged and a deferral of any discussion about how to make the climate policy fit for purpose, and the conservatives retreated as his popularity initially soared and the government regrouped for re-election. It suited both sides to put off a more definitive reconciliation: Turnbull because he hoped a decisive victory and a more workable Senate would further boost his authority and the conservatives because open dissent in the lead-up to an election would diminish theirs. But now two things are putting that standoff under strain, exposing glimpses of the internal reckoning to come. A big, decisive Coalition victory is not assured, and a more workable Senate is highly unlikely. And as the policy cracks become visible, the voters are demanding answers.  Throughout the campaign, Turnbull had swerved around the marriage equality question by claiming a plebiscite wasn’t his idea but rather one he inherited, promising he would push hard for a yes vote and extolling his belief in the Australian people to conduct the debate in a civilised manner. But increasingly, the public isn’t buying that answer. Margaret Parkhill questioned the prime minister on Q&A, making the quite reasonable point that he was prime minister and should be able to decide to change a wasteful and potentially harmful process that he disagreed with. Penny Wong, in a powerful lecture, smashed the notion that the debate could avoid harm. “Not one straight politician advocating a plebiscite on marriage equality knows what that’s like. What it’s like to live with the casual and deliberate prejudice that some still harbour,” she said. And the public is absolutely right to be sceptical. Not of Turnbull’s desire to do all he can to ensure marriage equality happens – that’s entirely genuine. But of the tactics being planned, including within his own party, to try to stymie that outcome.  The conservatives have always seen a plebiscite as a means of avoiding or deferring marriage equality rather than enabling it. Turnbull simply asserts that the “yes” vote will prevail in the plebiscite, and that the parliament would then definitely vote for the change. “The consequence of a ‘yes’ vote in the plebiscite will be that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia”, he told parliament, as if saying it with conviction would actually make it happen. But he can’t guarantee that. He conceded on Friday that Coalition MPs would have a free vote in the parliament after a national plebiscite had succeeded. And crucial details, with a real bearing on that vote, have been so hotly disputed that the attorney general, George Brandis, shelved a final cabinet decision on the conduct of the plebiscite until after the election. One of the most contentious issues was whether the Australian Electoral Commission would report the results of the national vote on an electorate-by -electorate basis – something that would allow MPs to vote against a national “yes” vote if their own constituency had voted “no”.  And several have said this is exactly their intention. Andrew Hastie said so during the Canning byelection. Andrew Nikolic reportedly announced a similar intention at an election forum last week in Bass. Eric Abetz left open the possibility earlier in the year in an interview with Guardian Australia. Craig Kelly has also reserved the right to oppose same-sex marriage if his electorate voted against it. Cory Bernardi has said he won’t be voting yes under any circumstances.  It seems logical that a national yes vote would encourage many MPs to back marriage equality in the parliament. They’d be enacting the will of the people. But think what pressure anti-marriage equality campaigners could bring to bear on MPs who support the idea but turn out to have electorates that aren’t certain.  And then imagine what would happen to the authority of the prime minister, who has assured the nation that a civilised debate will lead to a yes vote, if in fact a bitter debate ends with a different outcome. And there’s a similar crunch coming on climate policy. The Climate Institute asserted in its policy “report card” this week that it was feeling encouraged because “the Coalition, Labor, Greens and Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) now all support emissions trading”. It says this is a fact because it is what all those with deep interest in the policy are being assured will occur.  But again, imagine if the prime minister who promised he would never lead a party that was not as committed to action on climate change as he was failed to deliver, if the conservatives were unwilling to allow the ramping up of the baseline and credit scheme that has always been embedded within Direct Action. Exactly these imaginings are rippling through the ranks of the Liberal conservatives as they grind their teeth listening to their leader agree that the settlement of Australia was an “invasion”, and openly admitting he never wanted a plebiscite. Last week the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, popped up to insert into the final weeks of an election campaign the helpful idea that Turnbull would come under pressure to reinstate Tony Abbott to his ministry. Turnbull slapped that notion down, saying his cabinet wouldn’t change. So then Abbott did an interview with his friend Andrew Bolt (who recently editorialised about the “awful choice” facing conservatives as they contemplated voting for the “leftwing” Turnbull). The former prime minister deftly walked the line between overt destabilisation and making his point. He was perfectly happy to serve as the member for Warringah, he insisted, but – when asked whether he would like to be defence minister, as has been widely reported, he replied “all sorts of things might happen in the future, but right now you’ve got to be content with serving your electorate”. “I didn’t hear a ‘no’ in there Tony,” Bolt noted, and they both laughed knowingly. Precisely because the polls are close, the truce will almost certainly hold until election day.  And until then Turnbull will run the line that the greatest threat to political and economic stability and certainty is a Labor government dependent on the votes of the Greens. But, unless the published polls are wildly inaccurate, a re-elected Turnbull government would be dependent on the Senate votes from the Nick Xenophon Team as well as a number of a difficult-to-predict bunch of Senate independents, possibly including Pauline Hanson, Jacqui Lambie, Derryn Hinch and Bob Day, which doesn’t exactly look like smooth sailing.  And, simultaneously, it will have to wrangle its own internal reconciliation with conservatives, emboldened by the likelihood that, while Turnbull might have delivered a victory that looked impossible under Abbott, he hadn’t turned out to be all that popular after all. Perhaps the uncertainty of the Brexit vote will convince voters that Turnbull really does offer predictability and stability. But the truth is, whatever his own intentions, they can’t really be sure that’s what he’ll deliver."
"The UK government won high praise six months ago for taking a leading role in the successful Paris climate change agreement, the first legally binding commitment on curbing carbon emissions by all 195 United Nations countries. With the vote to leave the EU, the UK’s future participation in that landmark accord is now in doubt.  More importantly, for the rest of the world, the Leave campaign’s victory provides a fillip globally for groups opposed to climate action, and if it causes delays to the Paris accord coming into effect, it could provide an opening for aspiring right-wing leaders - including Donald Trump - to try to unpick the pact. “There is a risk that this could kick EU ratification of the Paris agreement into the long grass,” Jonathan Grant, director of sustainability at PwC, told the Guardian. That would be a setback to the UN in itself, but also concerns participants because of the US presidential election this year. Donald Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement if elected. Proponents of the agreement are therefore hoping for a quick process of ratification by as many parties as possible, including EU member states, which would bring the agreement into immediate effect and make it much harder for countries to renege upon afterwards. As an EU member state, the UK negotiated on key issues such as greenhouse gas emissions limits as part of the bloc, and was expected to take on its own tally of emissions reductions based on an EU-wide “burden-sharing” agreement, yet to be worked out. But while the UK is also individually party to the agreement, as a sovereign nation, neither the government nor the EU has yet ratified the accord in law. This means a future, possibly Eurosceptic, prime minister will face the choice of whether to ratify, unless the current government, led by David Cameron for the next three months, decides to do so as a matter of urgency. France became the first EU member state to ratify the agreement individually earlier this month, so in theory Britain could follow suit quickly. But this would be an unusual step given the host of pressing issues following from the referendum, and would be likely to prompt an outcry from sections of the pro-Brexit right, prominent members of which are also climate change sceptics. Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, who was praised by many other countries for taking a leading role at Paris, has not yet revealed what the plans are likely to be. The UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said in advance of the referendum that Brexit would require a “recalibration” of some kind but it is not clear what that might entail. The UK would have to agree its own contribution to emissions cuts if it stays in the Paris accord. These would most likely be based on the Climate Change Act, which sets out long-term targets on greenhouse gases and five-yearly “carbon budgets” that governments must meet. To renege on the act’s commitments would require its repeal, as favoured by some Brexit campaigners, but this is unlikely in the short term as they lack broad enough support in parliament. Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser on climate change at WWF-UK, said: “The UK has signed up to the Paris agreement in its own right. Outside the European Union the UK can still play a leading role in fighting climate change. It should ratify the Paris agreement as soon as possible, pass the fifth carbon budget under our domestic Climate Change Act and turn this into an ambitious international pledge to cut emissions.” That will be largely an issue for the UK, which accounts for less than 2% of global emissions. What is of much wider concern is the signal the referendum vote to leave sends to the world.  Grant said: “Today’s outcome is a major setback for the type of collaboration needed to tackle global environmental issues such as climate change. The UK government has been a champion of climate action at home, within the EU, and in Paris. This leadership is at risk, with many supporters of Brexit also opposed to climate policies such as carbon taxes and efficiency standards.” The wider political implications, rather than the mechanics of the accord, will take time to work out, but it is already clear that the Brexit vote will be used as a rallying cry for an agenda that frequently includes climate scepticism among its tenets, alongside curbs to immigration and to government regulation. Many climate sceptics around the world will have been encouraged by the Brexit vote, as there is so much overlap between the two camps, and environmental and carbon goals under the EU were a key target of the Leave campaigners. For instance, Lord Lawson, one of the leaders of the Leave camp is also founder of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate sceptic thinktank. Trump hailed the referendum result in visiting the UK. Some of his supporters share his climate scepticism, and the common cause with Brexit campaigners will have given both sides a boost. The calls from right-wing parties for further breaks from the EU could also endanger climate consensus within the EU, which has been a key driver of actions on climate change within the UN and other international institutions. Without a unified EU, support for those actions could decline. Green campaigners were quick to call for the UK to maintain its commitments on climate change, irrespective of Brexit. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, told the Guardian: “Britain isn’t leaving the international community, and we’re certainly not leaving the planet. That means the Paris agreement is every bit as vital to our future as it was yesterday. In fact, sticking to our Paris promises is more important than ever: we are about to negotiate new trade deals, and the last thing we can afford to do is break the commitments we made to the world just six months ago. “Cameron’s successor has a chance to immediately reaffirm Britain’s relationship with the international community by ratifying the Paris deal.” Debbie Stockwell, managing director of Sandbag, a campaigning group focused on the EU’s carbon commitments, said: “The UK has agreed to contribute to the Paris agreement as part of the EU. Now that the country has voted to leave, both the UK and the EU will have to reconsider this arrangement. It is vital that the UK continue to work with the EU to deliver ambitious action to tackle climate change.” Nick Mabey, chief executive of E3G, predicted that the UK would hold true to its promises, and its national interests: “The Brexit vote does not end the climate crisis. The UK will still ratify and implement the Paris climate agreement as this protects Britons from the worst impacts of climate change.”"

"Hillary Clinton is her party’s presumptive nominee. Whether Sanders drops out tomorrow or the day he loses the roll-call vote at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, his campaign is over. But if ever there were a losing campaign that achieved some major wins, it’s Sanders’. Not only did he force Clinton to talk more about economic inequality, he pushed her to promise stronger action to fight climate change and rein in fossil fuel companies. If Hillary Clinton becomes president and keeps some of her more recent promises to restrict oil drilling and fracking, Sanders will deserve a share of the credit.  When Sanders first got into the race, it didn’t look like he would adopt climate change as a major issue. He was one of the strongest climate hawks in the US Senate, having sponsored bills to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and end fossil fuel subsidies. But for the first few months of his presidential campaign, he did little more than make passing mention of climate change and its importance to young voters. In September of last year, I even wrote a post entitled, “Why is Bernie Sanders neglecting climate change?” Then, gradually, Sanders started to focus on the issue and develop a strong climate agenda. In October, he said at a debate that climate change is the biggest threat to national security. In November, he cosponsored new Senate legislation, the Keep It in the Ground Act, that would have the federal government stop issuing leases for oil, gas, and coal extraction on public lands and in offshore areas. In December, Sanders rolled out a climate action plan that included the “keep it in the ground” proposal as well as a carbon tax, elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, and investments in renewables. He went on to talk more on the campaign trail about climate change and related issues such as reinvesting in mass transit and cities. By January, the Sanders campaign was using the climate issue to attack Clinton, going after her for the vague and incomplete nature of her climate plan. The two campaigns battled on Twitter over whose climate and clean energy platform was stronger. Clinton clearly felt the need to start competing with Sanders for the votes of climate hawks. Simultaneously, climate activists from groups such as Greenpeace and 350.org were stalking Clinton on the campaign trail and asking her questions about whether she would restrict fossil fuel extraction. The one-two punch of pressure from the green grassroots and pressure from Sanders pushed Clinton leftward on a number of energy issues. First, last fall, Clinton finally came out against the Keystone XL pipeline, shortly before Obama rejected it. She also declared that she was opposed to offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean. And she shifted her position on fossil fuel extraction on public land, from saying it was necessary to saying she wanted to move towards an eventual ban. As Sanders picked up steam, she gave still more ground to climate activists. In February, she voiced her opposition to offshore drilling in the Atlantic. She also moved to assuage concerns that she is pro-fracking, saying in a March debate that she wants more regulation of fracking, and that she opposes the practice in instances when the local community is against it, it causes air or water contamination, or it involves the use of secret chemicals. “By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,” she said. Clinton had, in fact, started to say some of these things more than a year earlier, but her language has grown stronger and clearer during the primaries. In fact, she’s gotten so forthright about her plans to crack down on fossil fuels that she damaged her standing in coal country when she said in March that her administration would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” Clinton even tried to get to Sanders’ left on climate and energy issues. During another debate in March, she accused Sanders of wanting to delay implementation of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which will curb pollution from coal-fired power plants. (Asked afterward to give a source for that odd claim, the Clinton camp pointed to an article I wrote about executive actions the Sanders campaign said he might take to crack down on fracking, which included potentially revising the Clean Power Plan. Some experts argue that such revisions would delay it. The Sanders team responded by saying their candidate would not do anything that would significantly delay the plan.) The Clinton campaign was also critical of Sanders’ proposal to swiftly phase out all nuclear power, noting that it would likely cause an increase in emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants. Finally, in April, the media recognised the salience of climate change to Democratic voters and let the candidates go at it over climate change in a debate. Thanks to Sanders, there was someone to push Clinton towards stronger stances as the two sparred over who would do a better job of saving the planet. Last month, in recognition of Sanders’ strong showing in the primaries, the Democratic national committee allowed him to appoint five members to the party’s Platform drafting committee, while Clinton got to appoint six. Among Sanders’ choices was Bill McKibben, the climate activist who founded 350.org, led the charge to block Keystone XL, and calls for dramatically reduced fossil fuel extraction. (McKibben is on Grist’s board of directors.) It may be hard now to remember how unstoppable Clinton seemed only a year ago, when she was expected to dominate in the Democratic primary race. She had nearly tied Obama in the 2008 primary and then gone on to serve as his secretary of state, enhancing her stature and approval ratings while reaching out to die-hard Obama supporters. Her name recognition and fundraising connections alone put her at an advantage so steep that other nationally known Democrats, even those being drafted to run by supporters such as Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, declined to challenge her. Sanders, though, jumped into the race and showed that there is a real appetite for an agenda that more aggressively tackles inequality and climate change, and stands up to corporate power, especially fossil fuel companies. Clinton has moved in his direction to woo his supporters, and the next Democratic presidential nominee will probably start from an even more progressive place on climate and energy. As Sanders said at a Monday night rally in San Francisco: “When we began our campaign, our ideas were considered a fringe campaign and fringe ideas. That is not the case today.” Sanders lost the primary race, but he has changed the Democratic party and the politics of climate change."

"A visit to a small hospital in northern Ghana changed Mahama Nyankamawu’s life forever. “It was dark, they had no electricity and the medicines they had had all gone bad,” recalled the 40-year-old, who went to the hospital after a car accident in 2014. The experience inspired Nyankamawu to create Volta, a company that builds solar power projects for health clinics, schools and farms across Ghana.  Volta’s customers pay for 25% of the capital costs upfront, and the rest via monthly payments over two years. None of Nyankamawu’s customers have ever missed a payment, Nyankamawu said. “Our model works best when it’s a substitute for people who are already using diesel generators,” he added. “They’re saving up to 45% on their costs by switching to solar.” I met Nyankamawu at the Clean Energy Ministerial in San Francisco earlier this month, an annual gathering of energy leaders from 23 countries and the European Union. The meeting marked the first time the ministers met since more than 170 countries signed the Paris climate agreement to limit the global temperature rise to under 2C, a goal that won’t be met without strong domestic policies that give the businesses incentives to invest in a low-carbon future. I often hear criticisms that businesses, which account for most of the manmade emissions that are causing global warming, aren’t doing their part to keep the rising temperatures in check. Surveys and anecdotal evidence show that many corporate leaders don’t see their role in this global effort. But that’s not what I have seen. A growing number of companies are turning to renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint. I am impressed with entrepreneurs like Nyankamawu and other business leaders who work on making renewable energy affordable and accessible. And they represent progress. Putting money in renewable energy, whether through power purchase agreements with big solar and wind farms in the US, or tiny household-sized solar projects in Africa, was a rarity even just five years ago. Many Fortune 500 companies recognize a direct connection between climate change and their financial wellbeing. Earlier this month, a half-dozen major companies, including TD Bank and Interface, joined RE100, a coalition of businesses that are switching to 100% renewable electricity. The shift has been especially strong in the US, where large corporate buyers contracted a record 3.2 gigawatts of renewable energy last year, nearly 20% of the 16.4 gigawatts of renewables added to the US electric grid overall. That means tens of thousands of workers rely on solar and wind power to do their jobs, and that number will only go up. One of the most impressive efforts I heard at the San Francisco meeting came from Lisa Jackson, who leads Apple’s environmental and social initiatives. Jackson talked about the company’s effort to use solar and wind energy to run its own global operations and the factories in China that make its iPhones and iPads, including a plan to bring online 2,000 megawatts of green energy there. The company would work with its suppliers there to build those projects. Some of the most compelling stories came from Africa. Home to the world’s fastest growing population, the continent is a key front in the Paris climate agreement’s quest. In Tanzania, Off-Grid Electric allows homes and small businesses to install solar systems and pay for them via mobile phone payments. Off-Grid says it’s currently installing more than 10,000 solar units every month in Tanzania and Rwanda, and recently raised $70m from San Francisco-based DBL Partners and other investors to help hire more staff and expand operations. More businesses will switch to renewable energy if they are able to finance it. We saw a record $329bn in global clean energy investment last year, but that falls short of the estimated $1tn that will be needed every year through 2050 to help achieve the 2C goal. A major emission producing country such as India, which aims to install 175 gigawatts of wind and solar power by 2022, will need an estimated $200bn to reach that milestone. The country attracted $10.9bn in clean energy investments last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. There is one group of investors who could help fill that gap, but they have yet to value renewable energy investments: institutional investors. They manage public pension, insurance and other funds that are worth trillions of dollars. These investors are dipping their toes in clean energy in US and Europe but remain on the sidelines in emerging markets, which they consider particularly risky. Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, likened the challenge of fighting climate change to climbing Mount Everest: “We’ve just reached base camp.”   No doubt, getting to the top of the mountain will require huge participation from the business community globally.  The window of time to summit is now – and they’ll need to move quickly."
"In the late 1970s, I literally underwent a sea change. After spending time as a deckhand on a mate’s boat I decided commercial fishing was the life for me. All my energy went into fishing so I could fund a carefree life of adventure – snorkelling and diving on the Great Barrier Reef. Life and work was good, but I figured out a way to make it even better. I spent a year building a fishing boat with long-range capability that was large enough to house myself, my wife and our first daughter. We could now spend months out at sea, eliminating the time and expense of a daily commute to fishing spots, as well as our living costs.  Before dawn each day I’d be up trolling for mackerel and trout. There would be a break to process the morning’s catch, before another opportunity to fish for, say, red emperor. When the weather was bad, we’d take refuge at one of the islands to repair equipment, catch bait, have a snorkel and enjoy the scenery. Every so often, we’d dock back in Port Douglas; population 400. Back then, it was northernmost town from which you could still buy ice and sell fish. It was also quiet enough that you could stop at any time of the day in the middle of the road for a leisurely chat.  There was no conversation about the health of the reef, because we took its health for granted. The fish were there and we could go out and catch them to our heart’s content. To me, fish were something pretty to look at underwater and delicious to eat. It was as simple as that. However, in the early 1980s I’d upgraded to an 18-metre commercial fishing boat that could also be chartered to take out guests. I secured such work for the fledgling Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, CSIRO and some of the earliest tourism charters. The more I spoke to researchers, the more I realised how little I knew about my workplace. Each scientist I spoke to was a fountain of knowledge on something I’d only ever given a cursory thought to. Each one would enthusiastically tell me why a particular sea creature behaved the way it did, what it ate and what ate it and how they fit into the bigger picture. All of a sudden, science and research was exciting because it provided an exclusive insight into the underwater world I immersed myself in when diving or snorkelling. It also made me aware of how many gaps there were in the research. It was difficult for researchers to get out in the field because travelling out to the reefs wasn’t cheap. Most scientists I spoke to were lucky to spend two weeks of their year in the water. The rest of their time was devoted to writing grant applications, teaching or in the office. This provided me with the inspiration for a new business venture. By now, I’d returned to land with my wife Linda and two young children. I was taking visitors out on fishing or diving tours but the boats weren’t always full. If I offered spots to researchers for free, those who were coming along to fish or dive would also get exclusive access to an expert guide on the wonders they were seeing – and the researchers would have all hands on deck to help with tagging sharks or photographing whales. It was win-win. It was around this time that we all started to notice changes. Those researchers were observing rapid changes in the coral and sea life of the reef. Meanwhile, fish became harder to catch, and as a diver I observed the first infestation of crown of thorns starfish. I started asking questions – and found out about run-off from farms and industry, water quality and fishing impacts. When the first mass coral bleaching event occurred in 1998, I saw first hand how the colour and beauty of the reef that my business had always banked on could be wiped away. Initially, this didn’t affect business. We redirected visitors to spots that weren’t affected, and over time the reefs recovered. Then it happened again. And again. This year, we’re experiencing the worst mass coral bleaching event in the reef’s history, which no one can ignore. Yet still there are tourism operators who worry that if they speak out, and express concern, then negative publicity could have a short-term impact on tourism numbers. I am worried too – but it’s the long-term health of the reef and the viability of our entire industry that keeps me up at night. Over time, I’ve become painfully aware that there are decisions being made outside of my community that are defining not only my business, but the entire reef tourism industry and our children’s future. The Great Barrier Reef is in danger. It can’t survive as we know it if ocean temperatures and acidity – driven by climate change – keep rising.  The viability of my business – and the livelihoods of 69,000 other Queenslanders – rely entirely on the health of the reef. In a tourist town like Port Douglas that’s 80% of our jobs. We’ve got so much skin in the game. If we can’t step up and protect the reef then the science shows we will lose it."

"On Friday, the US House of Representatives voted on a Resolution condemning a carbon tax. As The Hill reported: Lawmakers passed, by a 237-163 vote, a GOP-backed resolution listing pitfalls from a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and concluding that such a policy “would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.” Six Democrats voted with the GOP for the resolution. No Republicans dissented.  ExxonMobil officially supports a carbon tax, but the company did not comment on the House Resolution prior to the vote. Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, which is a key lobbying group of the oil industry, including ExxonMobil, publicly supported the anti-carbon tax resolution, as did Koch Companies Public Sector, LLC. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) suspects that the Resolution itself originated from the oil industry: And it’s not just a matter of lobbying by Big Oil and the Koch operation on how Republicans ought to vote; given their control over the Republican Party, it is very likely that the vote itself was brought up at their behest. Since 2009, ExxonMobil has contributed at least $1.7 million to members of Congress who voted in favor of the resolution, according to an analysis by ClimateTruth.org. There are some indications that GOP leadership pressured House Republicans to vote for the Resolution. They certainly succeeded: of the 8 Republicans who are members of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, whose purpose is to craft optimal climate change policies, 7 voted for the Resolution. Only Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) withstood the pressure, voting “Present.”  Ultimately, 231 of the 246 Republican members of the House (94%) expressed their unwillingness to consider a carbon tax by voting for the Resolution. It’s odd that not a single House Republican voted against the Resolution, because as long as the revenue is returned to taxpayers (also known as “revenue neutrality”), many conservatives support a carbon tax. This concept is supported by free market, libertarian, and conservative think tanks like the R Street Institute, the Niskanen Center, and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). AEI resident scholar Aparna Mathur said of the vote: It is worrying to me that the House would consider legislation to oppose a common-sense approach to addressing climate change. Instead of relying on dozens of federal and state regulations that themselves are costly, a carbon tax would be transparent and cost-effective. Polls show that about half of Republican voters support a carbon tax if revenues are rebated to taxpayers. It’s also supported by the non-partisan grassroots organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), whose advisory board includes Ronald Reagan’s former Secretary of State, George Shultz. CCL issued a point-by-point response to the carbon tax “pitfalls” listed in the House resolution.  For example, the Resolution noted that a carbon tax would cause energy prices to rise, which would particularly impact the poor, who spend a larger fraction of their income on energy. However, a study found that if the revenue were returned equally to individual taxpayers, rebate checks would more than offset increased energy prices for 58% of individuals, including 82% of low-income families. In other words, most poor households would actually benefit from this policy. British Columbia provides a real-world example of a revenue-neutral carbon tax (offset by cutting income taxes) that’s proven successful in cutting carbon pollution, while its economy has continued to grow faster than the province’s neighbors. 61% of British Columbia residents support the policy, and businesses think the tax should be even higher. In short, while a carbon tax could indeed have adverse economic impacts, these can be overcome by crafting smart policies that will instead benefit the economy while simultaneously tackling the risks posed by climate change.  Crafting that type of policy is purportedly the purpose of the Climate Solutions Caucus, 88% of whose Republican members voted for the anti-carbon tax Resolution. Either the Caucus isn’t serious, or the oil industry’s influence over the GOP is tremendously strong. In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide qualifies as pollution. As a result, legally the EPA must regulate carbon pollution, and is in the process of creating rules as part of the Clean Power Plan. While conservatives can take action to slow that process, they can’t stop it. That is, unless US Congress passes legislation to replace government regulations with some other process to cut carbon pollution, for example with a free market system like a carbon tax. In short, conservatives must choose between government regulation or a carbon tax, and thus a vote against a carbon tax is essentially a vote for EPA regulations. Despite the vote, CCL Legislative Director Danny Richter sees reason for optimism: The first Scalise Carbon tax amendment passed the House on Aug 2, 2013. It had 155 co-sponsors. Today’s Scalise amendment had only 82 co-sponsors, and rumor has it that the leadership was strongly going after its membership to vote with the party. The fact that the vote took place two days after originally scheduled may support that. So what I see is a recycled idea with less support and on which the party leadership is having to work harder to enforce the party line .... The language of Scalise, by completely ignoring the case of a revenue-neutral carbon fee, is easily countered by existing statements from conservative economists. In short, while annoying, I don’t see this vote as a problem we didn’t already have, nor do I see it as remotely insurmountable. Carbon tax proponents also see a silver lining, that support for a carbon tax has grown to a level where the oil industry and House Republicans feel the need to introduce this Resolution and pressure their members to vote for it.  They’re digging in their heels against a policy that’s seeing growing bipartisan support and increasingly appears inevitable, despite Friday’s vote. It’s becoming a question of how long the Republican Party can stand alone in denial, and how much longer they’ll sell out the future of their party and the climate to the oil industry."
"Ministers will this week approve a world-leading carbon emissions reduction target for the early 2030s, the Guardian understands. Fears had been raised by green groups and industry that the EU referendum would cause the UK government to miss a deadline on Thursday for accepting carbon targets from its statutory climate advisers.   But a Whitehall source has confirmed that the so-called fifth carbon budget – put forward by the Committee on Climate Change last November – will be agreed before the month is out, as legally required by the Climate Change Act.  The move commits the UK to a 57% cut in emissions by 2032, on 1990 levels. Although a tougher target than the EU one of a 40% emissions cut by 2030, environmentalists in January said they were disappointed that the committee had not made the target more ambitious after last December’s Paris climate deal. The commitment should allay anxieties in the green energy sector that last week’s leave vote would water down the UK’s leadership on climate change, or that the decision to approve the budget would be left to the next prime minister. Emma Pinchbeck, WWF-UK’s head of energy and climate change, said:“The UK’s Climate Change Act gives us, even outside the EU, a global leadership role on climate change. So it’s great that the government has ignored siren voices from the fringes, listened to the scientists, and set a new target which will help boost the green economy.” The question of whether to accept the last emissions target – the fourth carbon budget – sparked a battle in 2011 between factions in the coalition government, with David Cameron eventually intervening to approve the target. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, is scheduled to give a speech on climate change on Wednesday to business leaders in London, though she is not expected to use it to announce the acceptance of the fifth carbon budget Separately, the UN’s climate change chief has urged a post-Brexit Britain not to give up its leadership on global warming action. Christiana Figueres warned on Tuesday that should article 50 be triggered it would bring uncertainty for two years but cooperation on climate change could be one area of continuity between the UK and EU.  “Should that be the case [article 50 being triggered], there is going be quite a lot of uncertainty, transition, volatility for at least two years,” she told an audience in London.  Figueres, who played a key role in forging the Paris climate deal last December and is believed to be considering running for UN secretary general, riffed on the second world war poster “keep calm and carry on”.  “Over these next two years, my suggestion would be to use the proverbial UK [message]: ‘stay calm and transform on [to a low-carbon economy]’. It’s not ‘stay calm and do nothing’, it’s ‘stay calm and transform on’ because the UK and EU have had a very important leadership on climate change, there’s no reason to change that whatsoever.”  Asked if the vote to leave the EU would become an obstacle to action on climate change, she said: “No. Climate change action is by now unstoppable. It is global.”"
"Nearly 400 international scientists called on Barack Obama to rule out further expansion of oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters under US control. The letter, signed by prominent Arctic, marine and climate specialists – including a former member of Obama’s administration, urges the president to rule out any future hunting for oil in the waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.  “No new oil and gas leasing or exploration should be allowed in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in the foreseeable future, including in the next five-year leasing plan,” the scientists write in the letter. The letter follows a series of new heat and melting records in the Arctic, which have stunned scientists. Last week it was warmer in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, than in New York City. The Danish Meteorological Society said the 75F temperature was the second heat record since April, and followed a very early start to the ice melt season. In addition to putting the entire Beaufort and Chukchi seas off-limits for the next oil and gas leasing offer, from 2017 to 2022, the letter urged the administration to consult native Alaskan groups on any further Arctic developments.  The scientists said in the letter that expanding Arctic marine protection would help counter the effects of climate change. The letter commended Obama for putting 9.8m acres of Arctic waters off-limits to future drilling last year, and for entering into a joint initiative to protect the Arctic with Canada’s Justin Trudeau. But the scientists called for further protections to areas important to native Alaskan fishing and hunting – including migration routes for whales and seabirds. “I’ve witnessed some of the unprecedented changes underway in the Arctic,” Jane Lubchenco, who headed Noaa during Obama’s first term, said in a statement. “Conserving important marine areas is an essential step in sustaining the region’s resilience.” The letter comes at a time when oil companies are already ruing earlier decisions to hunt for oil in Arctic waters – given the enormous costs and current low global oil prices. Shell declared last month it was giving up all but one of its leases in the Chukchi Sea, after spending seven years and $7bn hunting for oil in Arctic waters. The company said it would take another look at its leases in the Beaufort Sea. Repsol, the Spanish firm, announced it was giving up 55 leases in the Chukchi Sea with immediate effect, and planned to drop 30 more next year.  Other oil drillers have also departed the US Arctic region. "

"BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy is a standard industry reference document. It’s a useful indicator of trends, if occasionally the victim of politics.   But the newest edition brings welcome news that the growth of global carbon emissions paused in 2015, partly to do with a shift to renewables, and partly the result of passing economic conditions, both notable in China.  But BP, the company that once promised to go “beyond petroleum”, is sticking firmly with oil and gas. Its get-out strategy from appearing over-fossilised in attitude, is to call for a “meaningful carbon price,” advocated by its chief economist, Spencer Dale. Superficially, that seems a safe, sensible and increasingly popular option. The idea of carbon pricing is widely supported across the political, campaign and expert spectrum. But there is reason to doubt either the sincerity or analytical rigour of BP’s faith in carbon pricing as the principal tool for tackling climate change. A curious by-product of the EU referendum has been an unprecedented level of scrutiny and scepticism given to economic models. Lurid claims by both sides about possible costs and benefits rely on them. An uncritical mantra of headline statistics about the economy is a staple of daily news. We are meant to just accept simple interpretations of a rise or fall in growth, the deficit, a movement in prices or the reaction of “markets”, however bizarre may be the presence or absence of various assumptions buried in the underlying models. To aid forecasting and hence the setting of interest rates, the Bank of England, for example, uses a general equilibrium model of the economy called Compass which, it is true but hard to believe, leaves out the role of banks. Staff have to estimate the impact of finance “pragmatically” by other means. Assumptions behind the theory explaining why markets are meant to be efficient, mean suspending disbelief that our tastes and habits are unchanging, there is full employment, all firms face identical cost conditions, there is perfect competition, perfect information, and perfect mobility of what you need to produce things between places and occupations.  In this market utopia it seems, as Voltaire almost said, “everything is perfect in the most perfect of all possible worlds”. The beating heart of theoretically efficient markets is the price mechanism. It is the supposed magic wand that through the forces of demand and supply efficiently allocates resources, variously rations consumption, incentivises behaviour and sends signals to producers and consumers.  It sounds perfectly suited to tackling climate change. Price environmentally damaging emissions, and they will go down while more alternative energy sources come on stream. But there are problems. First of all, actually existing markets are unsurprisingly, and often hilariously, divorced from their theoretical underpinnings. How they are set up matters absolutely. The European Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the most prominent carbon market. But it has been an almost complete failure. Polluter lobbying at the design stage meant the market wouldn’t work. More permits to pollute were issued than there were emissions, ensuring the price stayed low.  Estimates for an effective carbon price vary enormously. France is to set a “floor price” of €30/tonne ($33.95) in 2017. Academic estimates vary enormously from $32-$103 in the work of Simon Dietz and Nicholas Stern, to $220 in work published by Nature Climate Change.  But Prof Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University makes the point that, “price signals from even high estimates of carbon prices would not seem to be sufficient to produce the required effect.” This is the case because where some types of consumption are concerned, like flying for business, the price is said to be relatively “inelastic”. In other words, raising the price does not significantly change the amount people do it. Just tackling aviation, argues Anderson, would require prices well above €300/tonne. To put that into perspective, since its introduction the price of carbon in the ETS hit €30 for a time back in 2008, since then it has been stubbornly below €10, and recently between €7-8. The diplomatic success of the Paris climate accord was expected to drive the carbon price up – in fact it fell from €8.60 before the conference, to €7.60 after.  But, even when pricing works in practice, driving energy efficiency for example, the result may not be straightforward in terms of reducing consumption. The “Jevons” or so-called rebound effect can kick-in. Greater efficiency lowers costs, lower costs in turn leaves more to spend on higher consumption, losing much of the initial benefit – between 30% and 80% in the case of commercial vehicle fleets.  Relying heavily on pricing can be very socially regressive too, with the rich able to absorb high environmental prices and the poor disproportionately hurt. This explains why many argue for equal per capita quotas to be used where limited resources are concerned, as the only fair way to allocate them. The paradox of environmental economics is that we feel compelled to price nature to make its loss visible on the balance sheet, but in doing so we legitimise its commodification and validate its critical overconsumption in an unbounded market system. No carbon market is yet designed to work within a precautionary limit on global emissions. That means that currently it would be possible to pay to emit the notional extra tonne of carbon that might push us over the edge into irreversible climatic upheaval.  What price should that tonne of carbon carry? The more goods you pile onto a ship, the more likely it is to sink. You can price the relative risk of different levels of load, and insure it accordingly, and you can put a price on the economic cost of lost goods should the ship turn turtle. But if your life depends on keeping the boat afloat, pricing ultimately becomes irrelevant. The point is to stay on the surface. That is why the Plimsoll safety line on the side of ships was introduced to prevent overloading (easy to spot, it looks exactly like the London Underground symbol). There are many economic and scientific problems in pricing nature and the environment, such as around offsetting, and there are philosophical ones too. In deciding whether or not to build a new road through a community woodland, how is the value of the woodland arrived at in any cost benefit analysis done by planners? Asking how much the community is prepared to pay to keep it would be constrained by ability to pay, but ask what amount would be needed to compensate for its intrinsic worth might, in theory, yield an infinite price.  Fiona Reynolds, former chief of the National Trust, is the latest to argue that we need whole other ways to assess the value of the natural world. When the economist Dieter Helm, chair of the Natural Capital Committee, wrote that: “the environment is part of the economy and needs to be properly integrated into it so that growth opportunities will not be missed,” he both gave the game away about pricing as a hostage to fortune, and made a category error.  It is the economy that needs to be properly integrated into the environment so that its limits to growth can be understood.  Under a system which ultimately measures our wellbeing by how much we spend on goods and services – in other words the growth of the economy – more is always better. So even if the price mechanism applied to nature makes us more aware of nature’s potential financial worth, it does so in a market system that is geared to, and judges its success by rising consumption. In a world already transgressing planetary boundaries, it means we measure our success by our failure.  We may become more efficient in the use of resources, but we do so in circumstances where growth drowns out efficiency. Price ascribed to something is an expression of the values we allow to dominate, too often it proves perverse – giving the destructive, gambling banker more worth than the nurse. It needs to be done with extreme caution and awareness of limitations.  Like price, money itself isn’t innate, it’s a convenient, but artificial measuring system we use to make agreements. It’s what we agree to do that matters, not the measure itself. Instead of pounds, dollars or euros, we could as easily measure carbon in “Momme” (a unit of mass for measuring pearls in Japan – 1 momme = 10 fun), or “Cat” (an old American measure of the minimum fatal drug dose per kilo of cat). What is important is the amount of carbon we leave in the ground or put in the atmosphere.  The creation of money is theoretically infinite – its ability to pay to consume the natural world unconstrained by the biosphere’s limits. Price may a tool, but the language of natural capital somehow reinforces the notion of nature as a mere factor of production, as opposed to being the “parent company”, as ecological economist Herman Daly put it. The notion of fossil fuel companies sitting on “stranded assets” with regard to the coal, oil and gas that cannot be safely burned has recently grown. But the accounting profession has long had a term that could equally be applied – the idea of “non-distributable reserves”. To prevent levels of overexploitation that stand to pull the environmental rug from under our own feet, we need to ditch the economic models responsible, and fundamentally it is Plimsoll lines not dollar signs that we need to attach to nature."
"Glastonbury has suffered the worst rain and mud since the festival began 46 years ago, consuming the region’s entire supply of woodchip in the process. Founder Michael Eavis said he will not consider moving the festival to later in the summer to avoid the wet, and blamed the torrential rain that hit the site in the weeks before the gates opened on global warming. But he said he was amazed at how the 180,000 festivalgoers remained cheery despite the weather. “I drove round the whole site last night. It took right up until 4.30am and the sun was up and there was just thousands of happy people with smiles on their faces despite the adverse conditions. It is extraordinary. I do not know how they do it, but they love it so much,” he said. “Every single bit of woodchip in the south of England, all of it is here over 1,000 acres. I’ve never seen mud like it in the whole life. This is worse than 1997,” he said, referring to the previously crowned “year of the mud”. “In all 46 years, it hasn’t been as bad as this,” he said. The mud was adding 15 minutes or more to journeys between stages, but good humour reigned despite pathways resembling swamps and mud being knee-deep in places.  Among this year’s most surprising guests were Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who notably distanced himself from the party putsch back in HQ, partying the night away at the silent disco at 3.30am just before getting the first train back to London.  Celebrities spotted included Noel Gallagher, model Cara Delevingne, actor Bradley Cooper and Daisy Lowe. Eavis promised concerned festival organisers that Glastonbury would remain home of the festival and any move to Longleat safari park in Wiltshire would be temporary, to give Worthy Farm a fallow year to recover. Talks with Longleat are ongoing, but Eavis said it was not yet a firm plan. “We will be doing something hopefully in 2019, but they [Longleat] came this weekend to look and they are not that impressed,” he said. “This is the home of the festival as far as I’m concerned forever,” he added. It takes 400 to 500 volunteers to pick up the rubbish, including thousands of miniature laughing gas canisters, out of the grass. Eavis said: “All the churn of the ground. Over time it hardens in the sun, then we rotavate the land and pick up more rubbish, including these horrible metal canisters.” On his wishlist for future festivals is Fleetwood Mac, but they want too much money, he said. “Adele did it for less, Rolling Stones did it for a reasonable rate. We can’t afford to spend £4-5m on people to play. Mick Fleetwood said he would do it himself, but come on. I’d like the rest of the band and they all want to be paid a lot of money,” he said. Also on his wishlist are Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Eavis said tabloid reports that the band had been rejected in 2008 before singer Rick Wright died had “nothing to do with reality”. He said he would “work on getting Pink Floyd together again” at Glastonbury."
"A fundraising appeal to help preserve St Kilda, the acclaimed world heritage site off the west coast of Scotland, has begun after research showed catastrophic crashes in seabird numbers linked to climate change. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) is asking for donations to help fund the £270,000-a-year costs of conserving the once-populated archipelago, which sits in the Atlantic 41 miles west of the Outer Hebrides.  The trust, which last week celebrated the 30th anniversary of St Kilda’s designation as a world heritage site because of its globally significant seabird populations and natural heritage, estimates numbers of four seabird species there have plunged by between 50% and 90% since 1999. That includes a 56% decline in fulmars, down to 27,000 occupied sites; the loss of more than half the common guillemots found in 1999, with only 8,206 counted last year; and a 68% fall in the number of razorbills to 718 individuals. The latest data confirms figures disclosed by the Guardian in December, when the NTS said that only one kittiwake chick was born there last season. Since 1999, the number of kittiwakes has fallen by 89%, suggesting they are on the brink of local extinction. Conservationists believe that warming seas have caused a sharp fall in the availability of sandeels, one of the birds’ main food sources, while pushing other marine foods deeper into the water or further north. They also suspect fulmar numbers have suffered after reforms to the common fisheries policy led to the outlawing of fish discards by passing trawlers. Around 600,000 seabirds, including puffins, manx shearwaters and gannets, nest each year on St Kilda’s seven islands, which are famous for their steep, gale-battered sea cliffs, sea stacks and exposed peaks. The appeal is to help fund NTS monitoring work: the trust believes the fate of birds there will be a significant bellwether for the impacts of climate change. Hirta, the main island, was also home for centuries to a community of St Kildan islanders, who were evacuated to the UK mainland in 1930 after growing weary of their isolation, population decline and poverty. The last surviving St Kildan, Rachel Johnson, died earlier this year aged 93. She was eight when the last 39 islanders were evacuated.  The NTS, which has gone through substantial recent cost-savings and some property sales to revive its finances, said it also needed donations to help with the continual conservation and repairs to the islanders’ homes in Village Bay, their church, the factor’s house and 1,400 “cliets”, conical stone structures used to keep seabirds and stores, as well as the miles of animal enclosures. St Kilda is the UK’s first and only double world heritage site, and one of only 32 worldwide, after its designation was extended in 2005 to include that cultural heritage.  Its extreme isolation means other unique species have survived there, including the St Kilda wren, the St Kilda mouse and Pankhurst’s dandelion, as well as the Soay sheep, a type of domesticated sheep from the Neolithic period. In 2004, its natural heritage designation was extended to include the surrounding seabed and subsurface marine life. Marine biologists discovered in the 1990s that the submerged rocks and seamounts, which were remnants of the same volcano that makes up the islands above the surface, were home to thriving sealife.  Sir Moir Lockhead, the trust’s chairman, said: “Anyone who cares about our seabirds and the wider health of our oceans will appreciate the work we carry out here year on year at St Kilda. Our seabird survey from St Kilda is providing us with vital information that appears to shows major impacts on sea conditions and the species that depend on the marine environment.”"

"The solar power industry says it has seen the loss of more than half its 35,000 jobs due to recent changes in government energy policy, just at a time when solar power has eclipsed coal as a major generator of Britain’s electricity. Experts believe ministers had cut subsidies too far and too fast, praising the “seismic”, record-breaking growth of solar in recent years.  This month the Solar Cloth Company became the latest to be put into administration, following the liquidation and 170 job losses at Solarlec two weeks ago. The biggest single collapse was late last year when the Mark Group went into administration with almost 1,000 redundancies.  The Solar Trade Association (STA), which represents the industry, said it was collecting exact statistics to be published soon but experts believe up to 18,000 jobs have gone in less than 12 months. Jonathan Selwyn, chairman of the STA, said companies had been “very hard hit” and many were trying to change their business models or concentrate on overseas markets. He contrasted ministers’ enthusiasm for slashing subsidies for solar with their professed concern for other struggling industrial sectors such as steelmaking. “This [solar] must be the only industrial sector where the government is congratulating itself for causing thousands of job losses,” he said. But the government said it had a duty to balance jobs with household bills. “Our priority is to keep energy bills as low as possible for families and businesses whilst supporting low-carbon technologies that represent value for money,” said a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. “The cost of solar has steadily declined over the last 10 years and it is right that as this comes down so should the consumer-funded support,” he added. Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London, said it was too soon to say whether the solar sector would settle into slower growth or drop away completely. “Solar has benefited from extraordinarily generous subsidies and no one – including me – expected to see such incredible growth rates. It has been quite seismic for a country that was getting a smidgen of power from renewables only a few years ago. But the cutbacks [in subsidies] have been dramatic and quick.” The new importance of solar has been underlined by recent research by analysts at Carbon Brief showing solar panels produced more electricity than coal in May. Deployment of renewable energy is moving even faster on the continent, with Portugal running its entire electricity network for four days in May entirely on solar, wind and hydropower. The increasing use of these technologies across the world was one of the reasons the oil group BP, in its annual statistical review published on Wednesday, reported global CO2 emissions showed no growth in 2015 for the first time in 10 years. Britain has in recent years installed up to 10 gigawatts of solar power – enough to power more than 3m homes, or 65% of the power promised from the planned new reactors at the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant. Photovoltaic panels on household roofs and in larger industrial arrays produced 1,336 gigawatt hours (GWh) last month compared with 893 GWh from coal, which is being burned less and less as old plants such as Ferrybridge in Yorkshire and Longannet in Scotland are retired. Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, has promised to close all coal-fired power stations by 2025 as part of a plan to reduce carbon emissions and tackle global warming.  Scottish Power, the owner of Longannet, once owned half a dozen coal-fired power stations but is now dependent on gas and wind farms for generating electricity. It has six new onshore windfarms under construction. Wind has been at the forefront of the low-carbon revolution in Britain, but the government has also removed all subsidies from onshore turbines saying developers no longer need financial incentives. There is already 8.8GW of wind power onshore and another 5.1GW offshore, according to the lobby group Renewables UK. Ministers are committed to helping windfarms out at sea which have received much less opposition from residents but are much more expensive to develop. Growing investor enthusiasm for low-carbon energy in the aftermath of commitments made at the Paris climate change talks were underlined this week with the £10bn flotation of Dong Energy. The Danish company has already spent £6bn on UK wind farms such as the London Array project and plans to inject a further £6bn by 2020 on projects such as Hornsea 1 off the coast of Yorkshire.  Dong is an energy company that is in transition from an oil and gas producer to leading wind power developer. The larger pure oil companies such as Total of France, Shell and Statoil have also started to invest recently in low-carbon activities. They are under pressure from some of their own shareholders but are also aware that tougher regulations on carbon emissions must be on their way if governments are to tackle global warming and meet their climate change commitments. Total has just spent $1bn (£700m) buying a battery storage business, Saft, that could play a key role in beating the problem of intermittency in electricity generated by solar and wind power. Shell has just established a new energies division, though it admits the scale of investment will be small at first, while Norway’s Statoil has just been granted a seabed lease that will allow it to build the world’s largest floating windfarm, Hywind, off the coast of Scotland. Critics question whether the newfound interest in renewables by traditional oil companies is genuine or just an attempt to take the heat off themselves as they come under increasing fire from environmentalists who accuse them of stoking climate change. • This article was amended on 11 June 2016 to clarify the sourcing for the figure of 18,000 jobs."

"President François Hollande on Wednesday finalised ratification of the Paris climate accord reached in December 2015, making France the first industrialised country to do so. “Signing is good, ratifying is better,” Hollande quipped at the Élysée Palace ceremony, flanked by environment minister Ségolène Royal, foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and other top officials. He noted that the deal will not come into force unless at least 55 countries responsible for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions ratify it. So far 17 states – mainly small island and low-lying coastal countries that are especially vulnerable to the sea-level rise – have ratified the deal. Hollande called on other European countries to follow France’s lead by the end of the year. At the December COP21 gathering in Paris, 195 governments reached the historic agreement setting a target of limiting global warming to “well below” 2C compared with pre-industrial levels. The French hosts of the meeting, held just weeks after the devastating November terror attacks on Paris, were showered with praise for its success, notably Hollande and then foreign minister Laurent Fabius.  The 32-page deal also calls on rich nations to muster at least $100bn (£70bn) a year in climate aid from 2020. Just how that will happen has yet to be worked out. COP21 is the acronym for the 21st conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the arena set up under the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio."

"The streak continues: May was record warm for the globe, according to NASA data released Monday. It’s now even more likely that 2016 will be the hottest year ever recorded, despite the demise of one of the strongest El Niños on record.  NASA put May at 1.67°F (0.93°C) warmer than the 1951-1980 average for the month, the first month since October 2015 to be less than 1.8°F (1°C) above average in their dataset, which extends back to 1880. So far this year every month has been record warm. February and March actually set consecutive records for the most anomalously warm month, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). February retained that record by NASA’s reckoning. NOAA will release its global temperature data on Friday. If it also rates May as record warm, it will be the 13th month in a row to reach that mark in its records. NASA and NOAA use slightly different methods to process the temperature data and use different baseline periods for comparison (NOAA uses the 20th century average). Even without May’s record heat, there was a 99 percent chance that 2016 was going to best 2015 as the warmest year on record. Whether that happens depends on how the remainder of the year plays out. A La Niña — which tends to depress global temperatures — is expected to form by fall, but La Niña’s biggest effects will likely come in 2017. And though El Niño provided a small boost to those temperatures, the main driver is the excess heat that has been trapped by decades of unabated emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In fact, La Niña years now are hotter than El Niño years of several decades ago. To show how much the average temperature of the planet has warmed since preindustrial times, Climate Central reanalyzed both datasets, averaging together the NOAA and NASA temperatures and comparing them to those from the period 1881-1910. Through April, the global average temperature was 2.6°F (1.45°C) above the average from that earlier period. Nations have agreed to limit carbon dioxide emissions to keep warming under 2°C (4°F) by the end of the century, but have discussed trying to achieve an even more ambitious target of 1.5°C (3°F)."
"It was the smell that really got to diver Richard Vevers. The smell of death on the reef. “I can’t even tell you how bad I smelt after the dive – the smell of millions of rotting animals.” Vevers is a former advertising executive and is now the chief executive of the Ocean Agency, a not-for-profit company he founded to raise awareness of environmental problems. After diving for 30 years in his spare time, he was compelled to combine his work and hobby when he was struck by the calamities faced by oceans around the world. Chief among them was coral bleaching, caused by climate change. His job these days is rather morbid. He travels the world documenting dead and dying coral reefs, sometimes gathering photographs just ahead of their death, too. With the world now in the midst of the longest and probably worst global coral bleaching event in history, it’s boom time for Vevers. Even with all that experience, he’d never seen anything like the devastation he saw last month around Lizard Island in the northern third of Australia’s spectacular Great Barrier Reef. As part of a project documenting the global bleaching event, he had surveyed Lizard Island, which sits about 90km north of Cooktown in far north Queensland, when it was in full glorious health; then just as it started bleaching this year; then finally a few weeks after the bleaching began. “It was one of the most disgusting sights I’ve ever seen,” he says. “The hard corals were dead and covered in algae, looking like they’ve been dead for years. The soft corals were still dying and the flesh of the animals was decomposing and dripping off the reef structure.” It’s the sort of description that would be hard to believe, if it wasn’t captured in photographs. In images shared exclusively with the Guardian, the catastrophic nature of the current mass bleaching event on previously pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef can now be revealed. Coral bleaches when the water it’s in is too warm for too long. The coral polyps gets stressed and spit out the algae that live in inside them. Without the colourful algae, the coral flesh becomes transparent, revealing the stark white skeleton beneath. And because the algae provides the coral with 90% of its energy, it begins to starve. Unless the temperatures quickly return to normal, the coral dies and gets taken over by a blanket of seaweed. Once that happens it can take a decade for the coral to recover – and even then that recovery depends on the reef not being hit by other stressors such as water pollution. Vevers’ images show how the once brilliant coral first turned white and then became covered in seaweed. While the hard corals are still holding their structure under the seaweed blanket, the soft corals are dying; dripping off the dead coral skeletons. The thick seaweed is a sign of extreme ecosystem meltdown. Fish can no longer use the coral structure as shelter – blocked by the plants – and before long the coral structures themselves are likely to collapse, leaving little chance of full recovery within the next 10 years. When the coral dies, the entire ecosystem around it transforms. Fish that feed on the coral, use it as shelter, or nibble on the algae that grows among it die or move away. The bigger fish that feed on those fish disappear too. But the cascading effects don’t stop there. Birds that eat fish lose their energy source, and island plants that thrive on bird droppings can be depleted. And, of course, people who rely on reefs for food, income or shelter from waves – some half a billion people worldwide – lose their vital resource.   Justin Marshall, a biologist at the University of Queensland who spends a lot of his time studying the reef ecosystem around Lizard Island, says: “What happens is the colony dies, the polyps disintegrate. The algae use that as fertiliser and grow very quickly over the coral head. And at that point it’s doomed. It’s going to break up. “It’s like a forest where plants compete for light. On the reef you’ve got this continuous competition between the seaweed and the coral. And, in the conditions we’ve got at the moment, the seaweed tends to win because it’s warm and it’s got lots of rotting stuff around to fertilise it.” Marshall says the thing that struck him about the bleaching event this year was not just the severity but the rapidity of the death. “I was just blown away by that.” Once the seaweed has taken hold, and the structure of the reef is broken up and lost, studies have shown that recovery is slower. Reefs can be lost forever. What’s at stake here is the largest living structure in the world, and by far the largest coral reef system. The oft-repeated cliche is that it can be seen from space, which is not surprising given it stretches more than 2,300km in length and, between its almost 3,000 individual reefs, covers an area about the size of Germany. It is an underwater world of unimaginable scale. But it is up close that the Great Barrier Reef truly astounds. Among its waters live a dizzying array of colourful plants and animals. With 1,600 species of fish, 130 types of sharks and rays, and more than 30 species of whales and dolphins, it is one of the most complex ecosystems on the planet. It begins in the subtropical waters of Hervey Bay in Queensland, about 200km north of Brisbane. From there it stretches the rest of the way up the eastern coast of Australia, stopping just off the coast of Papua New Guinea. About 2 million people visit it each year and together they contribute almost $6bn to the Australian economy. Going back for millennia, Indigenous Australians have relied on the Great Barrier Reef. As the world emerged from the last ice age about 20,000 years ago and sea levels began to rise, Indigenous Australians moved off the area that was once a floodplain and would have watched as today’s Great Barrier Reef formed. Today there are more than 70 Indigenous groups with a connection to the reef, many of whom depend on it for their livelihoods. Perhaps most disturbingly, what Marshall and Vevers have witnessed on Lizard Island is in no way unique. In the upper third of the 2,300km reef it’s estimated that about half the coral is dead. Surveys have revealed that 93% of the almost 3,000 individual reefs have been touched by bleaching, and almost a quarter – 22% – of coral over the entire Great Barrier Reef has been killed by this bleaching event. On many reefs around Lizard Island and further north, there is utter devastation. Further south, the bleaching is less severe. Since tourists usually go diving and snorkelling in the middle and southern sections, there are plenty of spectacular corals for them to see there. But they shouldn’t be fooled by that – the reef is in the midst of a major environmental catastrophe. Many scientists are now saying it is almost too late to save it. Strong and immediate action is required to alleviate water pollution and stop the underlying cause: climate change. Australians are being wooed by politicians for an upcoming federal election, most of whom support policies that will guarantee the reef’s destruction. This is the story of the impending death of the world’s largest living structure – whose hand it is dying by, who is staging a cover-up, and how it could be saved. Let’s be completely clear. This is no natural death. And there’s no question about who is to blame. Although bleaching has probably always happened in small patches here and there during unusually warm and calm weather, it used to be extremely rare. The first recorded bleaching was in 1911 on Bird Key Reef in the Florida Keys. It happened during a period of calm, hot weather. Something similar was reported on the Great Barrier Reef in 1929. Then there was not much to speak of for decades. There were a smattering of reports – maybe two or three over the next half century – until the year 1979. That year, everything changed. A new phenomenon of “mass bleaching” was seen for the first time, where bleaching would smash large regions, rather than just isolated stretches of coral. In 1979 widespread bleaching was seen stretching throughout the Caribbean and the Florida Keys.  And from then there was no turning back. Every year since then, bleaching has been reported somewhere in the world, often on a regional scale. Something that had rarely been seen before was being seen literally every year. Then it was time to go global. Coral reefs right around the world experienced bleaching during the first extreme El Niño recorded in 1982 and 1983.  El Niño is a splurge of warm water that spreads across the Pacific Ocean on irregular intervals, with an average frequency of once every five years. When it does that, it warms the world. An extreme El Niño wreaks havoc on weather patterns around the globe. That splurge of warm water bleached coral on the Great Barrier Reef, through Indonesia, Japan and over to the Caribbean. Then just five years later, during another El Niño, another bleaching event stretched its way around the globe. By then, it was already clear what was causing all this. A paper in 1990 warned these events were being caused by climate change and bleaching “will probably continue and increase until coral-dominated reefs no longer exist”. At that time the 1982 event was described as “the most widespread coral bleaching and mortality in recorded history” but today there is debate about whether it and the 1987 events’ severity was bad enough to count as a true “global bleaching event”. That hardly matters now. In an age of climate change, records don’t last long. In 1997-98, the world was hit by a second extreme El Niño – the strongest seen to date. Figures of how much coral died that year are hard to confirm but it is thought 16% of the world’s reefs were destroyed in a matter of months. About half of those might have been lost forever. Mass bleachings – some global, some not – have continued ever since but until this year 1998 held on to the record for the worst yet. That was probably a result of an extended La Niña-like phase that suppressed temperatures until now. During that time, warm water was being buried in the Pacific Ocean, suppressing surface temperatures, and keeping bleachings in check. Yes, maybe it’s too late. But I’m not going to sit back and buy a Hummer and just let it all slide The year 2016 looks set to blow 1998 out of the water. By some measures it’s the longest global bleaching event in history and, on the Great Barrier Reef, it’s definitely the worst. The reef has been hit by at least three significant mass bleachings in recorded history. The first coincided with the global bleaching in 1998, then it got hit in 2002, and then again this year. A Guardian analysis of the three events, based on data from aerial surveys, shows the increasing severity of each event, and how they smashed different parts of the reef. The mechanism behind this incredible new trend is obvious and well understood. As Bloomberg Businessweek famously said on its cover after Hurricane Sandy, “It’s global warming, stupid.” Since 1950 more than 90% of the excess heat our carbon emissions have trapped in the atmosphere has gone into the oceans. As a result their surface temperature has increased by 1C in just the past 35 years. That puts the water much closer to the limit of what coral can bear. Then, when a surge of even warmer water comes through – often as a result of the irregular El Niño cycle – corals over large stretches get stressed, bleach and die. So well understood is the mechanism that satellite data on water temperature is a good proxy for coral bleaching. Using that understanding, the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration looks at satellite data and produces “bleaching alerts” that represent a predicted stress response from coral. In data produced exclusively for the Guardian by Mark Eakin, head of Coral Reef Watch at Noaa, we can now reveal exactly how stressful ocean temperatures have been increasing on the Great Barrier Reef over the 34 years that satellite data has been available. Since 1982, just after mass bleachings were seen for the first time, the data shows that the average proportion of the Great Barrier Reef exposed to temperatures where bleaching or death is likely has increased from about 11% a year to about 27% a year. Eakin says looking at that data revealed a clear trend that hadn’t been quantified before. “In seeing that what it immediately showed was that there was a real background pattern of increasing levels of thermal stress.” Combined with other stressors hitting the reef, this is having a devastating impact. Over that period, half the coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef has been lost – and that’s before the mass bleaching this year is taken into account. That data has limitations – it’s not direct bleaching, but stress inferred from temperature readings. And it lumps extreme levels of stress – like what is being seen around Lizard Island now – with anything that is expected to cause mortality. Despite that, it reveals the way global warming is leading to more regular bleaching and mortality. “While there was a considerable amount of variability – from El Niños and other things – there was an obvious upward trend in the data,” Eakin says. “So you’re looking at the background warming, which is having a major effect on the corals.”  And just looking at the surface temperature of water around the Great Barrier Reef over the past 100 years leaves little doubt about the role of climate change. Adding to this correlational data, researchers have examined exactly how much more likely the warm conditions on the Great Barrier Reef were as a result of carbon emissions. They ran climate models thousands of times, and simulated a world with human CO2 emissions and a world without them. They found that in a world without humans and their carbon emissions, the conditions on the Great Barrier Reef that caused the current bleaching would have been virtually impossible. Today they’re still unusual, but have been made at least 175 times more likely as a result of our carbon emissions. “In a world without humans, it’s not quite impossible that you’d get March sea surface temperatures as warm as this year, but it’s extremely unlikely,” Andrew King, a lead author of the study from the University of Melbourne, told the Guardian in April. But what was even more concerning was how quickly things are predicted to get worse. “In the current climate it’s unusual but not exceptional. By the mid 2030s it will be average. And beyond that it will be cooler than normal if it was as warm as this year.” That means the Great Barrier Reef is likely to be hit with conditions like this, on average, every second year in fewer than 20 years. Many reef biologists approached by the Guardian have said this could mean it’s too late for the Great Barrier Reef. We may have already made its death inevitable. But since there’s still a chance it’s not too late, they all said it was imperative to keep fighting. “Yes, maybe it’s too late,” Marshall told the Guardian. But he said that was no reason to not try to save it. “I’m not going to sit back and buy a Hummer and just let it all slide.” And there have been signs that coral is more resilient than biologists used to think – it might be able to adapt and evolve and, while the weaker corals are probably doomed, maybe the stronger corals will be able to spread and take over. In some places, maybe reefs will even migrate further from the equator. These tiny signs of hope are all biologists and conservationists can cling to. “With biology there are always things around the corner that we don’t know,” Marshall says. “These things are fantastically resilient and biologically programmed for survival.”  But hope requires action. And there are some powerful forces who don’t want to see light shone on on this particular murder.  And murder it is: we’ve known for decades that we’re to blame. “It’s the great white lie,” Col McKenzie, the chief executive of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, told a Queensland newspaper in April. “It’s not dead, white and dying. It’s under stress but it will bounce back.” He tells the Guardian he’s furious at the media and at the scientists who have been making a big deal out of the bleaching event: “What I’m seeing is that my industry is being held out for ransom and is the whipping boy for the Greenies who want to be anti-coalmining. And, frankly, I think that’s bloody disgusting.” He represents an industry that, as he puts, is “tied by the hip pocket to the health of the reef”. In 2011-12 it was estimated tourism centred on the Great Barrier Reef generated $5.7bn for the economy and created 69,000 jobs. Many tourism operators … don’t want people not to come to the reef, so they’ve been reluctant to speak out McKenzie says the media coverage of the bleaching is a bigger risk to the industry than the bleaching itself. He says people are less likely visit the reef now that they think it’s in worse condition. Jumping on this concern, the Australian government looks to be doing everything it can to downplay the bleaching. In May the Guardian revealed the Australian department of environment had intervened to have every mention of the Great Barrier Reef – and indeed every mention of the country – scrubbed from the final version of a UN report on climate change and world heritage sites. As a result, Australia was the only continent on the planet not mentioned. When confronted with the revelation, the government told the Guardian it did it because: “Recent experience in Australia had shown that negative commentary about the status of world heritage properties impacted on tourism.” The revelation came shortly after Australia’s environment minister, Greg Hunt, told a Queensland newspaper after seeing a David Attenborough documentary about the Great Barrier Reef: “The key point that I had from seeing the first of the three parts is that clearly, the world’s Great Barrier Reef is still the world’s Great Barrier Reef.” The article ran with the headline: “Reports of reef’s death greatly exaggerated: Attenborough.” In fact, Attenborough said that “the Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger”. And later: “The twin perils brought by climate change – an increase in the temperature of the ocean and in its acidity – threaten its very existence.” Then in May and June, these concerns caused a split in the national coral bleaching taskforce, which was set up to monitor the bleaching event. It’s made up of 10 Australian institutions, some of them government agencies, and others university research centres and is led by Terry Hughes from James Cook University. The group was about to release the results of its coral mortality surveys when two leading government agencies pulled out of the announcement. Hughes and his university colleagues released the results anyway, on Monday 30 May, but with only part of the data. They announced that “35% of the corals are now dead or dying” in the “northern and central sections of the Great Barrier Reef”. On Thursday of that week, Col McKenzie went on the attack, saying the results were “utter rubbish”. “It seems that some marine scientists have decided to use the bleaching event to highlight their personal political beliefs and lobby for increased funding in an election year,” he said in a media release. The results of surveys from the government agency the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority told a different story, he said. A day later the rest of the results were released by the government agencies. Attached to these was a long media release that aimed to dispel perceived exaggerations of the damage and highlight corals’ ability to recover. Russell Reichelt, the marine park authority’s chairman and chief executive, told the Australian newspaper the agency had split from the group release because it wasn’t telling the whole story. He was quoted as saying that the maps illustrating the coral mortality exaggerated the impact, and that the exaggeration “suits the purpose” of the people sending it out. The story ran on the front page of Australia’s only national newspaper declaring that “activist scientists” were distorting the data. “Marine park head denies coral bleaching crisis,” it screamed. But the authority’s actual data, which revealed a striking 22% of coral on the Great Barrier Reef had been killed, was entirely consistent with the figures released earlier that week from the university partners – something Reichelt later acknowledged on social media. It’s clear that a cabal of climate change deniers, worried tourism operators, and a conservative government have tried to whitewash the environmental disaster unfolding over the Great Barrier Reef. McKenzie is no climate change denier and is quick to agree that climate change has caused the bleaching. But he has taken signs of coral’s adaptability to heart and is sure that the coral will adapt to higher temperatures under climate change. He thinks the reef will be fine. He says the scientists who are making a lot of noise about the bleaching have overstepped a line. “The scientists decided to make some fairly strong statements about the health of the reef – and some fairly outrageous ones at that. I don’t think that’s what science is about. I believe scientists should be reporting the facts as they are, not sensationalising the issue.” The fear that the media spotlight on the bleaching will stop people wanting to visit the reef runs deep in the tourism industry. So much so that tour operators have reportedly been routinely refusing to take conservationists, media and politicians to bleached parts of the reef. But that alliance may be breaking down, with some tourism operators on the reef getting worried about its long-term health. “Many tourism operators, they don’t want people not to come to the reef, so they’ve been reluctant to speak out,” says John Rumney, who has run diving and fishing tours on the Great Barrier Reef for the past four decades. “They are worried it will have a negative impact on the short-term cash flow.” Rumney says that’s short-sighted since unless people speak up now there will be no reef in the future, and the industry won’t exist. He and other operators have broken away from the crowd and are speaking out. (McKenzie describes them as “the fringe dwellers of the industry”.) In May the Guardian revealed that a group of more than 170 individuals and businesses in the tourism industry had written an open letter, published in a north Queensland newspaper, urging people to recognise the severity of the bleaching, and begging the government to take stronger action to save the reef. “We are proud of our stewardship of this incredible resource,” they wrote. “We understand its value lies in looking after it. We hope the majority of the reef can recover but Australia must start doing everything it can to tackle the root cause of the coral bleaching, which is global warming.” And, speaking to other tourism operators, it doesn’t appear these people are industry outsiders as McKenzie suggests.  Paul Crocombe is the manager of Adrenalin Dive, a business based in Townsville that takes tourists out to see the reef. He has been diving on the reef for more than 30 years and has been working in tourism for more than 20. He’s concerned that the media reporting about the bleaching will impact tourist numbers but he acknowledges that it’s important to get the information out. Crocombe says when tourists hear that 93% of the reef has been impacted by bleaching they expect to come and see that it’s all dead. Of course that’s not true. In most of the places tourists go, only about 5% of the coral is likely to die, meaning they’ll hardly see any difference. In 2016 there is no reason for tourists to avoid most areas of the reef. (Tourism operators were lucky – after Cyclone Winston devastated Fiji, it weakened and brought clouds and rain over the southern two-thirds of the reef, cooling the water there and protecting the majority of tourist destinations.) “We were really fortunate this time with the coral bleaching that the majority of the mortality is a long way north of here,” Crocombe says. He’s very aware that if the sort of bleaching that hit Lizard Island and other areas was seen near Townsville or Port Douglas, tourism would have had a major, long-term problem. “With the reporting on the threats to the reef, it has, again, a double-edged sword. I think it’s really important that people do understand that the reef is in danger and that if we don’t do something then, yes, we are going to have a significant impact on the reef. “I think it’s really important that people do understand there are threats to the reef. Currently it is in reasonably good condition but I don’t think it will take a lot to tip it over the edge.” So with more moderate tourism operators speaking out, efforts to hide the reef’s impending death might be failing. As that happens, and the world confronts reality, can the reef be saved? “You either do it properly or you give up on the reef, I think. It’s that bad,” says Jon Brodie from James Cook University. Since 1975 he has studied how to give coral reefs their best chance of surviving the various things thrown at them. The solution to climate change itself is well-rehearsed. It’s not a scientific or technological problem but a political one. And a global one. We need to transition away from fossil fuels. That’s a sentiment that chimes with the Guardian’s “Keep it in the ground” campaign. Climate change is the greatest threat facing the Great Barrier Reef and other coral reefs around the world. According to the UN report on climate change that Australia had itself deleted from, and a paper in Nature it cites, a 2C rise in global surface temperatures will result in the loss of more than 95% of coral around the world. If the world limits warming to 1.5C, we might save 10%. If we want to save 50% of what’s around right now, we need to limit warming to just 1.2C – and we’re already more than 80% of the way there. Climate change is coming on much quicker and stronger than we thought The Australian government has committed to reductions in carbon emissions that aren’t even consistent with limiting warming to 2C. Worse still, the policies in place at the moment are widely acknowledged to be unable meet even those targets. But to give the Great Barrier Reef a fighting chance of survival in current or future temperatures, it needs to be protected from an array of other assaults it is being hit with. Scientists refer to this as building reef resilience. Nick Graham from James Cook University showed last year that almost 60% of reefs in the Seychelles recovered after they lost 90% of their coral following the 1998 global bleaching event. The reefs that recovered were those that were not being hit with pollution, weren’t being overfished, and when the reef managed to maintain a complex structure. When it comes to the Great Barrier Reef, the biggest threat to resilience is water pollution. It is being increasingly smothered with suspended sediment that blocks light; smeared with fertilisers that cause outbreaks of seaweed and coral-eating crown of thorns starfish; and poisoned with herbicides that kill the coral’s symbiotic algae. Compared with what was happening before the 20th century, today there is almost three times as much sediment, about twice as much fertiliser and 17,000 extra kilograms of herbicide washing over the reef each year. Brodie says this needs to be fixed immediately. And the bleaching this year is proof of that. “Climate change is coming on much quicker and stronger than we thought,” he says. “We used to think 2035 was soon enough to fix up water quality but we’ve had to revise that.” Now, he says, if it’s not under control by 2025, it’s game over for the reef. With an election campaign under way in Australia, which will deliver a government for at least three years, many are saying that this election is the last chance to squeeze commitments from politicians that could deliver the resilience the reef needs to survive. So far the current Coalition government of Liberals and Nationals has committed $210m to improve water quality on the reef, and a further $6m to control crown of thorns starfish, if they win the election. The Labor opposition has promised slightly more, with $500m to improve water quality. The Greens, who could hold the balance of power in the next parliament, have so far focused their attention on climate change policies, with a seven-point plan aimed at transitioning Australia away from fossil fuels. According to the best science, none of this is enough. Brodie has written hundreds of papers and technical reports on the issue, and in May published a paper estimating what would be required to get the water to an adequate state by 2025. He said it would take $1bn a year between now and then. As it stands, the major parties have committed to what amounts to tinkering around the edges, he says. A few hundred million here, a few million there. “We know how to do it,” Brodie says. “In fact right now we’re spending a little bit of money doing some of it and we have made a little bit of progress with that little bit of money but we just need a lot more.” He adds: “This is the last chance to do it, I think. If we don’t do it soon then we probably shouldn’t bother, really. It’s as bad as that now.” Graphics by Nick Evershed and Ri Liu. Videos by Josh Wall.

"Global food prices will remain stable for the year ahead, suggest recent UN forecasts, but in the longer term we can expect much more volatility.  That’s because the food sector is unable to cope with a double whammy of rising demand for food and risks including water scarcity, land degradation and climate change, a recent analysis [pdf] concludes. In a twist of fate, the countries and people who will be worst affected will be the ones that tend to contribute least to such environmental risks. Here are five charts that help explain the story. Although food prices have fallen in recent years, the volatility in prices – as seen in the price spikes in 2007-08 and 2011 – will be repeated as the food industry is vulnerable to risks such as climate change and water scarcity, says the UN. Rising global population and incomes are expected to create a growing imbalance between supply and demand, it adds. Wealthy countries such as Australia, the US and the UK tend to contribute most to the environmental risks that make food prices higher and more volatile, says the UN, as they consume the most natural resources (land, water, carbon emissions etc).  The ecological footprint attempts to measure in hectares the natural resources a country requires on a per capita basis to produce all the food, water and non-food commodities it consumes, or absorb the waste it generates. Nepal, Madagascar and Benin all hover near the bottom, well below the level (1.7 hectares) necessary for us to live within the resources of the planet. By contrast, Qatar, Australia and the US use more than four times the resources and waste that the planet can regenerate and absorb in the atmosphere. In the long term this means depleted groundwater, deforestation, collapsed fisheries and the accumulation of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. The countries that have the lowest ecological footprint tend to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea level rises and water scarcity. The Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN) measures a country’s exposure and capacity to adapt to climate change and gives each country a score. Benin, Mozambique and Nepal are all more than twice as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change as the UK or the US. A failure to tackle problems including water scarcity, land degradation and climate change is making the food sector more vulnerable, says the recent UN analysis. The result, it says, is a higher risk of price shocks. A sudden surge in the price of food commodities such as wheat, maize and soybean will mean more income and higher GDP for major exporters like Australia and the US. But for major food importers like India, if there were another doubling in food prices as seen in 2007-08, it will mean a reduction in GDP of an estimated $50bn, according to the UN. Any rises in the price of food will have the biggest effects on those households spending the highest proportion of their income on food. On a global level that means countries such as Benin, Mozambique or Nepal.  If we look at the look at the gains and losses in proportion to a country’s total GDP, India sees a comparatively small loss. In contrast, Benin, Mozambique and Nepal will see a significant loss. Benin, for example, will see an estimated reduction in GDP of 9% if food prices double as they did in 2007-08."
"If the rest of the world could vote in next month’s Australian election, there would almost certainly be one issue that would be raised to the top of the country’s political agenda: saving the Great Barrier Reef. Scientists say this year 93% of its reefs experienced some bleaching, and 22% of all of the reef’s coral was killed by unusually warm waters. Unheard of just three decades ago, large-scale bleaching has become a regular occurrence. Within 20 years the conditions that drove this year’s bleaching in Australia will occur every second year. A Guardian report illustrates in vivid detail the scale of the devastation unfolding beneath the surface. Over the past 34 years the average proportion of the Great Barrier Reef exposed to temperatures where bleaching or even death is likely has increased from about 11% a year to about 27% a year. It is a constant struggle to motivate most people most of the time about climate change. The evidence accumulates slowly; despite being an emergency, it often feels very distant. But in Australia, and on other coral reefs around the world, we can see the sudden and devastating effects of climate change playing out before us. The Great Barrier Reef is under severe threat. Emergency action is needed on a much more ambitious scale than is now being planned. According to a Unesco report on climate change and world heritage sites, if we want to save even 10% of coral reefs around the world, the world needs to limit warming to 1.5C. And to save half of them, the world needs to limit warming to 1.2C – a tall order, when the world has already warmed by 1C. Polling from conservation groups suggests measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef could be a vote-changer in Australia; 44% of those polled say it would influence their vote. And the major parties have at least got policy programmes of sorts in their manifestos. The ruling coalition of Liberals and Nationals reshuffled some money in the country’s budget in May, putting A$171m towards improving water quality – essential if the reef is to have a chance of recovery from the bleaching. They also announced $6m to help curb the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish. The opposition Labor party, the alternative government in a two-horse race, went further, promising $500m for research and action improving water quality. Not nearly enough, say the experts. They want $1bn a year, for 10 years. And they say to give the reef even a fighting chance, that needs to start immediately. Meanwhile the Coalition has dismantled Labor’s emissions trading scheme and pledged to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030 under a contentious Direct Action scheme. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who once lost his job as Liberal leader because of his support for Labor’s policy, has done little since he was restored to the role to alleviate a scepticism about climate change that is all too prevalent in his party. Labor under Bill Shorten has promised to introduce a new emissions trading scheme and increase the renewable energy target to 50% by 2030. The Greens have urged even stronger action and targets and have a leader, Richard Di Natale, who has put the reef at the heart of his campaign, even snorkelling amid the coral bleaching. Nonetheless, this is a story that the institutions of government are keener to submerge than float. The campaign is mostly about tax, spending, pensions education, health and – in Australia as in the UK last year – refugees and immigration. It was instructive that, as the Guardian revealed last month, officials intervened to have the Great Barrier Reef – and indeed all mentions of Australia – removed from that Unesco report. Less exciting than America, less lurid than Trump – but Australia’s election, as the fate of the reef reminds us, has global consequences too."

"Malcolm Turnbull ruled out a change to penalty rates in the next term of government and Bill Shorten called on the prime minister to lead on marriage equality regardless of who was elected in the third and final leaders’ debate. Fewer than 13,000 of more than 23 million Australians streamed the final leaders’ debate on Facebook, though it was aired on the ABC and Sky. Of the 30 audience members, only seven felt Turnbull won the debate while 17 voted for Shorten. The questions from the audience members and online ranged from marriage equality, corporate tax cuts, regional jobs and the national broadband network to mental health, climate change and education.  Penalty rates were raised by a shift worker who described her “sacrifice” missing Christmas, birthdays, funerals and weekends. For the first time, Turnbull promised no changes to penalty rates.  “Not only do we have no plans, we will not,” said Turnbull. “I give you my understanding. We will not make changes to penalty rates. It is a matter for the independent umpire, the Fair Work Commission.” Asked if the promise applied to the next full term of government, Turnbull said “all three years of it”. Asked about marriage equality, Turnbull said he would vote for it in the promised plebiscite and was confident it would pass. Shorten urged Turnbull to dump the plebiscite.  “This is an opportunity for him and I to lead,” the Labor leader said. “Tonight, I ask Malcolm Turnbull, regardless of who’s elected on July 2 – please, let’s just vote for marriage equality in the parliament. We’ll have the numbers.” By the 20-minute mark, the biggest Facebook reaction was anger but that changed when Shorten urged people to press “like” if they supported Labor’s original NBN policy for fibre to the home rather than Turnbull’s policy of fibre to the node. Turnbull accused Labor of a “failed” policy. “We have connected more people to the NBN, paying customers, in the last month than Labor did in six years, 2.6 million Australians can get access to it,” he said. Shorten said: “I’m interested to see what Facebook users – who have bad connections and delays and buffering – Malcolm Turnbull says everything’s fine. Let’s press ‘like’ if you prefer fibre to copper.” Voter disillusionment was reflected in the debate’s opening question: “Given the number of changes of prime minister in the last five years or so, and the number of lies and backflipping by both major parties, why is that the Australian people should trust anything a politician says? Why should I vote for either Labor or Liberal and not an independent?” Turnbull said he was opposed to churning prime ministers. “I’m very committed to the prime minister being the same after the election as it is now,” Turnbull said. Shorten said: “The Labor party learnt it lesson, the truth of the matter is that Australians want to choose their prime ministers and they don’t want political parties to overturn them mid-term.”  To a question on housing affordability, Turnbull promised to bring together local and state governments under his cities policy while Shorten promised to work with the states to free up land supply.  The prime minister, who as opposition leader in 2009 lost the Liberal leadership over climate change, said he was confident the government’s emissions reduction fund – a policy he once described as “bullshit” – would help Australia meet its emissions targets.  Shorten said he was lucky to lead a party that did not dispute the science of climate change.  A voter asked what evidence Turnbull had to prove the Coalition’s $50bn corporate tax cuts would lead to mass employment. “If you cut company tax, what you do is you improve the return on investment … therefore you get more investment, you get more employment, you get more employment, you obviously grow the economy and that does ultimately result in higher tax revenues,” he replied. But Shorten described the government’s tax cuts as a plan to reward big banks and mining companies to improve profits, for investments they’ve already made. The leaders were also asked why voters should have their superannuation concessions cut when politicians had a very generous scheme. Shorten said while he was minister he had lifted contributions for workers from 9% to 12%.  Turnbull said the government had only “slowed the trajectory” and workers would get to 12% “a few years later”. “It is a real cost on business, it comes out of employees’ pay packets one way or another, and so what we’re endeavouring is to get the balance right.”"

"Boring is beautiful when you’re studying a calamity, especially one as spectacular as the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. That’s because exciting sediments, full of variations and gaps, make it hard to disentangle the extinction signal from the noise of natural variability. So you could say that James Witts, of the University of Leeds in the UK, lucked-out with an especially boring batch of sediments in Seymour Island on the Antarctic Peninsula (the part on the map that points up to South America). His study, recently published in the journal Nature Communications, catches the extinction of marine life in one of the most detailed records ever published for the end-Cretaceous. As Witts describes it:   The sedimentology is consistently, remarkably boring. More than 1,000 meters of sandy silt and silty sand!  It took about 4 million years to deposit that sand in a sea bed over the crucial time before, during, and after the mass extinction. In all that time fossils accumulated steadily – mollusks, sharks, corals, crustaceans, marine reptiles – until suddenly they all stopped. The sediments continued steadily accumulating, but all the Cretaceous fossils disappeared within a few meters of each other. Rare fossils disappeared sooner, common fossils disappeared later, but there’s a fossil-free gap right below the layer that marks the end of the Cretaceous. It doesn’t look like the environmental setting over the extinction itself changed significantly, so we can discount any rapid changes in water depth having an effect on the pattern of extinction we see from the fossil record. Then there is a layer of dead fish. The remarkable thing about these fish is that they are mostly whole and un-scavenged, either because the usual scavengers were extinct, or because of low oxygen conditions triggered by microbe blooms in an ocean whose food web was unbalanced by the extinction:  The anoxia story was a surprise to us. In such a shallow setting it appears unusual. I imagine a scenario like parts of the Gulf of Mexico today, with input of material from rivers driving changes in ocean oxygen on a rapid (maybe seasonal?) scale. A final fossil find is very unlikely to be the last individual of that species that ever lived on Earth, so it’s likely that a species lived on for some time after its last fossil was preserved. Witts used statistics on how frequently fossils of a given species show up in the sediments, to predict the likely gap between fossils if the species was still alive. He found that, in all likelihood, all the last Cretaceous species continued to live until within about 30,000 to 70,000 years of the end of the Cretaceous, and plausibly even less than that. This shows that the mass extinction was geologically “fast,” rather than a drawn-out attrition of species over hundreds of thousands of years. Ultimately, one of the problems with studies on the end-Cretaceous extinction is that we are pushing the limits of the resolution of many fossil records, as well as the proxies for environmental change. Recent rock dating has put the Chicxulub asteroid impact at the same time as massive eruptions in India, and shows that the main eruptions were also geologically rapid. So even though Witts’ study used a combination of magnetic field reversals, strontium isotope values, and fossil population changes to tie down the dates for his sediments, each of those has an uncertainty too big for a precise match to either the impact or the eruptions.  Also, the iridium measurements at Seymour Island used to mark the time of the asteroid impact date back to 1994, and come from a different location than Witts’ study, which may add further date uncertainty. But dates aside, Witts’ catalogue of over 6,000 fossils shows no hint of increasing environmental stress before the extinction, despite an episode of climate warming that lasted over a million years, before cooling at the end of the Cretaceous. This is in contrast to studies elsewhere, which found signs of a deteriorating environment for a few hundred thousand years before the extinction; in Antarctica, life seems to have been boringly oblivious until the end. In the ongoing debate over the ultimate killer of Cretaceous life, these findings support a geologically rapid cause (anything from tens of millennia to instant), rather than slowly building environmental stress: The fact that the fossil disappearances occur directly below the interval containing the iridium anomaly suggests the link between impact and extinction is still the key to understanding the pattern we see in the fossil record. I would also argue that we still simply don’t know enough about whether the eruptions could have produced environmental change significant enough to cause the extinction. Further twists in the dinosaur extinction story are likely as scientists analyze samples from the just-completed Chicxulub Crater Drilling Project, while others have discovered traces of volcanic mercury that link the eruptions to the extinction. Scientists are going to need more boring sediments to sort all of that out. Howard Lee is a geologist and science writer who focuses on past climate changes."

"The Bramble Cay melomys has become more famous in extinction than it ever was in life. A mouse-like rodent, the melomys amazingly survived on a 3.6 hectare grass-covered cay (a low-lying island in a coral reef) in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef like a ratty Robinson Crusoe for thousands of years. There, it thrived off just a few plant species until human-caused climate change—in the form of rising sea levels and increasing inundations of sea water on the low-lying island—wiped it off the planet.  But, while the extinction has been reported widely, articles have missed an important point: the scientists who uncovered the rodent’s fate had planned to capture individuals and bring them back to the Australian mainland to start a captive breeding programme. They were just too late.  “My colleagues and I were devastated,” Ian Gynther, a Senior Conservation Officer in Queensland’s Department of Environment and Heritage Protection who led the failed rescue mission, said.  “As each day of our comprehensive survey passed without revealing any trace of the animal, we became more and more depressed,” he added. Short surveys in both 2011 and early 2014 failed to find a single Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), but Gynther said the team was still optimistic when the left in August of 2014 believing that the failure of the two most recent surveys “was due to the limited trapping effort.”  Instead, they found the cay totally empty of its sole mammal, which was believed to have evolved in isolation from its nearest relative for nearly a million years and was considered the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal.  If they had found any survivors, Gynther said the plan was to create a captive population as “an emergency insurance measure” against extinction. Indeed, the team spent five months obtaining the necessary permissions for captive breeding from Australia’s governmental agencies and various stakeholders as well as creating a plan to hold the species at University of Queensland’s Gatton campus.  Gynther said scientists were cautious about placing the species in captivity, even though the Bramble Cay melomys had been listed by the IUCN Red List as critically endangered since 1996 and not seen by humans since 2009. “Captive breeding is an expensive undertaking, requiring a significant commitment of staff, resources and time by the parties involved,” he explained. “This is particularly true for a program that is likely to be required for an indefinite period, as would have been the case for the Bramble Cay melomys.”  But the impacts of climate change on the cay, including repeated storm surges that killed off the melomys’ food sources like the common purslane (Portulaca oleracea), happened quicker than conservationists ever anticipated. And the last Bramble Cay melomy may have been simply swept off the island and drowned in the sea.  “By the time it was apparent that a captive breeding program was required as an urgent conservation action, it was already too late,” Gynther said.  The Bramble Cay melomys was simply gone, washed away by rising seas which now threaten the island’s seabird rookeries and sea turtle nesting beaches The genetics of the Bramble Cay melomys may be wholly lost as well. Tissue samples were taken of 42 individuals in 1998, but the whereabouts of these samples are currently unknown, though, Gynther and his team are trying to track them down.  The loss of this little island survivor is tragically irreversible, but it could provide a number of lessons for conservationists going forward. Given that many climate change impacts are happening far quicker than scientists anticipated, conservationists may need to consider moving more speedily and aggressively to protect an increasing number of climate-vulnerable species. “[The extinction] highlights that conservation recovery actions need to be highly responsive, especially where climate change impacts are involved,” Gynther said. He added that controversial actions, such as assisted migration for species, must be considered as climate change continues to batter animals and ecosystems.  Of course, in an age of rising seas, more extreme weather, worsening droughts and polar ice melt, conservationists may also need to become even more vocal about dealing with the underlying cause of climate changes: burning fossil fuels. The longer global society goes without transforming itself, the more extinctions will become inevitable.  And if the loss of the Bramble Cay melomys proves anything, it’s that we may not have as much time as we think. "
"Britain must continue to be a world leader when it comes to acting on global warming despite the EU referendum result last week, the UN’s climate chief has urged. Christiana Figueres warned that should article 50 be triggered it would bring uncertainty for two years but cooperation on climate change could be one area of continuity between the UK and EU.  “Should that be the case [article 50 being triggered], there is going be quite a lot of uncertainty, transition, volatility for at least two years,” she told an audience of business leaders in London on Tuesday. “However, let us remember that the Brexit vote was not about climate change, it was not about should the UK continue to modernise its industry and its manufacturing, and it was certainly not a vote about innovation, which is fundamentally the opportunity that we have by acting on climate change,” said the outgoing executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Figueres, who played a key role in forging the Paris climate deal last December and is believed to be considering running for UN secretary general, riffed on the world war two poster “keep calm and carry on”. “Over these next two years, my suggestion would be to use the proverbial UK [message]: ‘stay calm and transform on [to a low-carbon economy]’. It’s not ‘stay calm and do nothing’, it’s ‘stay calm and transform on’ because the UK and EU have had a very important leadership on climate change, there’s no reason to change that whatsoever.” Asked if the Brexit vote would become an obstacle to action on climate change, she said: “No. Climate change action is by now unstoppable. It is global.” A pre-referendum poll found that leave voters were more likely to be climate sceptics than remain voters, and green groups have raised fears that the Brexit vote could lead to “the climate change-denying wing of the Conservative party” being strengthened. However, carbon targets are enshrined in UK law under the Climate Change Act, which was passed in 2008 with just five MPs voting against it, and requires steeper emissions cuts than EU targets. Figueres said that if the UK were to go ahead with leaving the EU, action on climate change could be a much-needed track of stability and continuity between the two. “Continuing and being very consistent with the UK/EU policy and steps on climate change, could actually be the thread of continuity that takes us through the next two years. Because there’s no reason to do a huge jump to distress or upset the apple cart on this.” She added that a Brexit may force the EU to revisit the emissions plan it submitted to the Paris summit last year. Figueres’s comments were echoed by Ed Miliband on Monday, who stressed the need to fight for a vision of a “new relationship with Europe which has environmental protection at its heart”. Speaking at a panel discussion in London hosted by the Environmental Defense Fund Europe, the former Labour leader, who was climate and energy secretary under Gordon Brown, said that Britain could continue to negotiate alongside the EU on climate and energy matters: “we’re stronger negotiating with them than we would be on our own.” Miliband also argued that it is crucial that Britain maintains the “progress that was made through Europe on a whole range of environmental protections and other issues”. “I do think it’s very very important that we don’t leave the debate about this - no pun intended - to those who wanted to come out of Europe,” he added, “because they wanted a race to the bottom ... they didn’t believe in climate change and all of that”. “The debate cannot be left to them, with the Remain part of the argument being ‘we’d like to reverse the decision, thank you very much,’ because then that will leave the field clear for those who have a horrible agenda on this.”"
"The UK should close all its coal-fired power stations two years earlier than the government’s pledge of 2025, according to green Conservatives including former energy minister Lord Greg Barker.  The move would not cause the lights to go out, would cut both carbon emissions and air pollution and would boost cleaner energy projects, according to a report from Bright Blue, a thinktank of Tory modernisers.  The report also concludes that if the troubled Hinkley C nuclear plant is cancelled it could be replaced by renewable energy.  Overall, the report found that encouraging renewable energy, energy efficiency, storage and electricity interconnectors to other countries would benefit energy bills and security of supply, as well as tackling climate change. Energy secretary Amber Rudd pledged in November to phase out unabated coal burning by 2025, a move that was widely praised. But the government has also cut solar power subsidies, blocked onshore wind farms, cut support for energy efficiency and cancelled a £1bn carbon capture and storage project. “Thanks to a Conservative government, the UK is now committed to taking dirty, polluting coal out of our energy mix completely,” said Barker. “So we should take maximum advantage of this bold move. The government should give investors [building greener energy projects] even greater certainty and with that, put UK plc firmly at the forefront of the global drive for clean and smart energy technologies.” The new report includes analysis by Aurora Energy Research of how closing coal plants early might affect the nation’s security of supply. This included a “high stress” scenario in which the expansion of renewables is slow, Hinkley C is cancelled and coal power stations close early. “Despite what some exaggerated claims suggest, a coal phase out even under a ‘high stress’ scenario, will not result in the lights going out,” said Ben Caldecott, author of the report and associate fellow of Bright Blue. “Our analysis shows the significant benefits for pollution and system security of further encouraging renewables, interconnection, storage, demand side response and energy efficiency.”  The report said there is “plenty of time” under each scenario to commission any new gas power stations needed to keep the lights on. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate change said: “The government is absolutely committed to phasing out power production from unabated coal and we are the first country to set an end date for doing so. We will consult on how we plan to do this in the coming months.” The report said: “The UK should [take] the lead in promoting coal phase-out internationally. The UK has significant technical and moral leadership it can deploy to encourage other countries to agree to a coordinated phased approach for closing down coal-fired power stations. The world’s climate future really does hinge on what other countries do with their coal fleets.” On Hinkley, the report said: “The future of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station appears to be highly uncertain. Should the project not materialise, renewables can easily fill the capacity gap in the late 2020s. This should be ‘Plan B’.” It noted the fast build time and rapidly falling cost of renewable energy and said: “The ability of these technologies to deliver this capacity is already impressive and will be even more so in the mid to late 2020s.”"
"While the ordinary voters of Wentworth sheltered from the rain on Sunday afternoon, a small group of activists set out on a stealthy campaign against their local member, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. Dubbed the “guerilla street nannas” by GetUp climate campaign director, Sam Regester, the group, mostly comprised of women in their 60s, braved the weather to check on their latest endeavour: a set of corflute signs showing the torso of a man in a business suit crossing his fingers.   More than 200 of the signs have been hung around the electorate below the smiling face of Turnbull’s own campaign posters, to make it appear he is crossing his fingers above the slogan “trust me on climate change”. The posters were hung early Saturday morning, and GetUp senior campaigner, Miriam Lyons, told Guardian Australia the group had a stack in reserve to replace those inevitably removed by the Liberal party. “We’ve got a group of very committed to members willing to put them back up if any are taken down,” Lyons said. Lyons said the signs were made to show disappointment in Turnbull’s failure to strengthen the Coalition’s policy on climate change, despite once saying he would not lead a party that was not as committed to dealing with climate change as he was. “A lot of Wentworth residents are waiting for the change in policy to match the change of face,” she said. “These older GetUp members who have been helping to put up these corflutes are pretty frustrated and running out of time for him to change his mind.” GetUp has also worked with the artist behind the “fizza” election posters to promote a climate change “fizza” rally to be held in Wentworth next Sunday, at the same time as the Liberal Party’s official campaign launch. Climate change #fizza #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/aFMrRLMPC1 Turnbull pledged not to change the substance of the Coalition’s climate change policy before being sworn in as prime minister in September. At the leadership debate on Friday night he said he was “absolutely committed to achieving a global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to ward off unsafe global warming,” and said he was “satisfied” Australia could achieve its target of a 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 “with our existing set of policies”. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Labor would increase the target to 45% and accused Turnbull of softening on climate change since taking the Liberal party leadership.  “Now all of a sudden, Tony Abbott’s his climate adviser,” Shorten said. Turnbull’s office declined to comment on the corflutes, but the Labor candidate for Wentworth, art dealer Evan Hughes, gleefully shared the signs on social media and requested that GetUp slim him down if they intended to do the same trick on his posters. Bravo @GetUp if you finish mine I wouldn't mind you maybe taking off about 10 kgs..#imissmalcolm pic.twitter.com/RjYGqNT6GE Andrew Woodward, the Labor candidate for Tony Abbott’s seat of Warringah, also took a minute to promote the signs on his way to Hughes’s campaign launch at the Bondi Pavilion on Saturday. Great to be in #Wentworth for the @evanevanhughes Labor launch. Tony has Malcolm handcuffed on #climatechange pic.twitter.com/mUT8e3A185 A ReachTel poll of Wentworth, commissioned by Hughes in May, reportedly suggested Turnbull’s primary vote had fallen 10 percentage points from 63% to 53% but that he would still win the seat comfortably with a two party preferred vote of 58-42.  According to Fairfax Media, the poll also found that 53% of the 626 respondents felt Turnbull had failed to live up to their expectations."
"Alaska just can’t seem to shake the fever it has been running. This spring was easily the hottest the state has ever recorded and it contributed to a year-to-date temperature that is more than 10°F (5.5°C) above average, according to data released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The Lower 48, meanwhile, had its warmest spring since the record-breaking scorcher of 2012.  While May as a whole was only slightly above average – thanks in part to whiplashing weather from the beginning of the month to the end – every state in the contiguous US had warmer-than-normal temperatures for the spring as a whole. The main area of relative cool in May was in the central and southern plains, where considerable rains fell during the month. Storm systems generally tend to drag in cooler air and cloudy days help to keep a lid on temperatures. “In addition, when soils are waterlogged it prevents afternoon temperatures from rising as high as they would if soils were dry,” Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch of Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said in an email. The contiguous US is having its fourth warmest year to date; May’s milder weather brought that trend down a bit from April when 2016 was in the number two slot. The clear standout of above-average temperatures for the Lower 48 – both in May and spring as a whole – was the coastal Pacific north-west. Seattle had its fourth-hottest May and several spots in Washington, including Seattle-Tacoma airport, were having their hottest year-to-date. Alaska, for first time in modern records, had a spring average temperature of 32°F (0°C) – that may sound cold, but warmth is a relative term. That temperature handily beat the previous record hot spring of 1998 by 2°F (1°C), according to Noaa. Several spots in Alaska, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau, recorded their hottest springs. Several others, including Barrow, the northernmost city in the US, had their second-warmest spring. For the year-to-date, the state is running 10.3F above the 1925-2000 average of 26.1°F (-3.3°C) and 2.4°F (1.3°C) higher than the previous mark of 23.7°F (-4.6°C) set in 1981. In fact, the past three January-May periods are among the four warmest in Alaska’s records. Rick Thoman, climate science and services manager for the NWS’s Alaska region, said that several factors had converged to keep Alaska so relatively toasty, including persistent high pressure systems over the region and warm waters off the coast. Early snowmelt has also exacerbated the spring heat. The effects of the elevated temperatures are readily apparent, Thoman said, with berries ripening weeks earlier than usual, very early “last frosts” and an early start to construction projects. Temperatures in Alaska have also steadily risen — like the planet as a whole, and the Arctic in particular — thanks to the excess heat trapped by human emissions of greenhouse gases. There is a 99% chance that 2016 will be the hottest year on record globally, mainly due to that excess heat. Noaa forecasters expect the odds this summer to continue to favor above-average temperatures across Alaska, and there’s a good chance that 2016 as a whole could be record-hot for the state as well. But that depends on how the rest of the year plays out. “Certainly, the combination of five months already in the books and the outlook for continued warmth raises the chances for the warmest year on record,” Arndt said. “But it would just take one or two really cold months to change the scenario from ‘warmest year’ to ‘one of the warmest years.’”"

"The Paris floods, that saw extreme rainfall swell the river Seine to its highest level in decades, were made almost twice as likely because of the manmade emissions driving global warming, scientists have found. A three-day period of heavy rain at the end of May saw tens of thousands of people evacuated across France, and the capital’s normally busy river closed to traffic because the water levels were so high under bridges. As artworks in the Louvre were moved to safety and Paris’s cobbled walkways were submerged, the French president, François Hollande, blamed the floods on climate change.  Now a preliminary analysis by a group of scientists, including the Dutch weather agency and the University of Oxford, has concluded the risk of the flooding event in Paris was almost doubled – multiplied by a factor of 1.8 – by humanity’s influence on the climate. “Hollande was right to say climate change is playing a role but at the same time it’s important to say that this event could’ve happened without climate change,” said Prof Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford.  “But it means what was a 1 in 200 year event is more like a 1 in 100-something year event. Is that a big change? In terms of weather events, that’s not nearly as big an increase in risk as we’ve seen in heatwave events, where we often come up with a factor of 10. But for precipitation this is kind of what we’re seeing.” The climate science community is speeding up its efforts to draw the links – the attribution – between extreme weather events and climate change, while such events are fresh in the public and politician’s minds. Previous quick turnaround research has shown flooding in England and heatwaves in Europe were made more likely because of global warming. “The crucial thing is decisions... they get made in the aftermath of these events, when minds are focused on the impacts,” said Allen. “Getting this information out while people are still thinking about the event is useful. Also, it guards against the risk of over-attribution [overegging climate change’s role in an extreme weather event].” Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an environmental thinktank, said: “The ability to analyse scientifically whether man-made climate change has played a role in specific extreme weather events is advancing at a startling pace. Until very recently, scientists weren’t able to make this sort of judgement, but that’s changing fast.”  The analysis by the World Weather Attribution project published this week used a variety of approaches to look at how much the risk of the rainfall on 29-31 May had been increased by global warming, including statistical analysis of the historical temperature model, trends in climate models and “the results of thousands of simulations of possible weather with a regional climate model”. All the approaches agreed climate change had made the heavy rains in the Seine and Loire river basins more likely. However, the link between global warming and rainfall in Germany at the same time, which saw intense thunder storms, proved inconclusive.  While the work has not yet been peer-reviewed it is based on peer-reviewed methods, and Allen said it would be submitted in a week to a journal for peer review and publication, as similar past research has been by the group. Almost all previous floods on the Seine and Loire have occurred during winter, the researchers said, making the summer timing very unusual. The rains saw the Seine peak at 6.1 metres above its normal height on 3 June, a 34-year high. Its record peak was in 1910, when an eight-metre rise caused the catastrophic ‘Great Flood of Paris’."
"Janet Russell asks the right question (Letters, May 30). What has happened to the report on shale gas by the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC)? When Professor Cowern and I gave evidence in February, we were assured that the report would be published no later than May. We have also been told unofficially that the CCC has accepted our data on fugitive emissions of methane and that shale gas is two times worse than coal from a climate change perspective. We also submitted a further paper towards the end of March, indicating that over half of the rise in atmospheric levels of methane seen globally since 2007 is due to oil and gas, notably shale extraction in the US, and that this is obscuring the rise in methane emissions from the Arctic. I suppose it would be highly embarrassing for the government if its “dash for gas” was found to be incompatible with our climate change commitments, agreed by the UN but implemented via EU legislation. Embarrassing unless the government accepted the scientific case and announced it was going to abandon fracking and invest in renewables.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com "
"In late November 2015, as corals across the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef started to bleach white, the game was finally up. For years, Australians had been told the country’s jewel in the ocean’s crown was on the mend. Only months earlier the Coalition government had won a two-year fight to keep the reef off a United Nations list of world heritage sites in danger.  The stakes were high. International reputations and tourist dollars were at stake. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the trade minister, Andrew Robb, had even attacked Barack Obama, who feared for the reef’s future.  The reef was not in danger, Bishop insisted. The president was misinformed, claimed Robb. Conservative commentators hanging around News Corp media have said the dangers to the reef were overblown.  The mining industry cast the views of environmentalists as green propaganda, ignoring how for the most part, conservationists were echoing the findings of the government’s own scientists.  Now, about half the corals bleached in the once pristine northern section are dead or dying.  Then, just two weeks ago, Guardian Australia revealed the government’s scandalous but successful censoring of a Unesco climate report, where all references to the reef and the country were deleted. If the intention was to keep negative commentary from harming tourism, then it backfired badly, as media outlets including the BBC and the New York Times followed the story.  Now these once glorious and vivid animals are suffering the ignominy of a slime green coating after their death.  So that’s the poetic opening over with.  Unfortunately, only by getting into some detail is it possible to understand the Machiavellian tendencies of those who have worked to underplay the reef’s plight.  For a decade or so, government and university scientists have outlined two key tasks to secure the reef’s future – cut fossil fuel emissions and reduce pollution running into catchments.  Fossil fuel emissions have pushed ocean temperatures higher, causing three severe coral bleaching events since 1998. Increasing amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere also make the oceans become more acidic, making it harder for coral to grow. Several government agencies have repeatedly outlined how climate change is the main threat to the reef’s future.  But almost all of the hundreds of millions of dollars invested by state and federal governments of both colours have gone towards improving water quality – cutting the pollutants running into the reef’s catchments chiefly from sugar cane growing and cattle grazing. Pollutants damage habitats, kill corals or slow their growth and could be linked to outbreaks of attacks from coral-eating crown of thorns starfish. They also make it harder for corals to recover from storm damage and global warming-driven bleaching.  But has all this investment on water quality worked?  Greg Hunt, the Australian environment minister, will tell you that it has, just like he told the UN world heritage committee that it had, despite knowing of a Queensland auditor general report saying in June 2015 that there was “significant uncertainty” about the water data. But in April 2016, government scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science published a detailed assessment of the state and federal government policies to date to improve water quality.  Put simply, AIMS scientists concluded that progress had been slow and while pollution targets were ambitious, they were unlikely to be met.  Key habitats showed “severe declines in abundance and condition”, populations of species such as sharks, rays and dugongs were falling and water quality was declining. Hardly a glowing endorsement of what Hunt says is the “best-managed marine ecosystem in the world”.  A key problem was that programs targeting farmers were voluntary and only half the land used for cane growing and 10% of grazing land was accredited under the voluntary programs. Globally, the scientists wrote, the only time that significant reductions in coastal pollution had been achieved anywhere was when governments forced action through legislation. One key victory for campaigners has been to force governments to legislate against the dumping of dredge materials in reef waters. Dredging, a process that on its own is damaging regardless of where you drop the spoil is still planned to make way for more coal and gas exports. And here lies the big rub.  Governments – both state and federal, and Labor and Liberal – continue to support the expansion of Australia’s coal export industry, the same industry that is the chief protagonist of global warming that drove the devastating bleaching this year. Terry Hughes, a professor at James Cook University and convenor of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, says: “Water quality is important, but only for the bottom two-thirds of the reef. The part that’s bleached to blazes was the most pristine part with no coastal development – that’s the part Australia used to argue to the UN that the whole reef should be kept off the danger list. Now it’s wrecked – from Port Douglas to New Guinea.” Hughes says there’s a mismatch between Australia’s support for coalmining, the country’s endorsement of a UN target to keep warming “well below 2C” and apparent concern for the reef.  “Clearly if only 1C of warming is enough for three bleaching events then we are kidding ourselves if we think 2C is safe,” says Hughes. But there’s also been another form of pollution damaging the reef in the form of partisan propaganda that has left some people confused about the true state of the natural icon.  This is where an army of invective language has been filled with an infantry of strawmen arguments. Queensland’s main newspaper, the Courier-Mail (I worked at the newspaper for four years, leaving in 2010) has published several pieces underplaying the significance of the bleaching, often failing to mention the role of human-caused global warming in the disaster. The newspaper has been accused of underplaying the recent bleaching – an accusation the newspaper rejects. Some scientists were so frustrated by the muted coverage from the Courier-Mail they took out an advertisement in its pages to get their message across. The Courier-Mail, together with other News Corp columnists, were also caught misrepresenting the views of Sir David Attenborough, who, despite the claims, had not said that report’s of the reef’s demise had been “exaggerated”.  Over at the Australian, the newspaper last year published a column from Canadian climate science denier Patrick Moore claiming the science linking ocean acidification and coral damage to fossil fuel use was all bunk. Coral experts said the column was “highly misleading” and “very, very wrong”. Even in the Times in Britain, a scientist accused the newspaper of “cherry-picking” an interview that had led to the headline: “Scientists are ‘exaggerating carbon threat to reefs and marine life.” The story also made its way into the Australian. The coalmining industry has also polluted the public space with disingenuous arguments and misrepresentations.  At one stage, the Queensland Resources Council ran television advertisements claiming a government-funded study proved the industry and port development were not harming the reef. The study itself said the opposite. The apparent objective with many of these actions – the berating of Obama, the lobbying, the censorship and the creative interpretation of scientific findings – is to try and control the narrative around the reef by denying what’s clearly evident to everyone else.  The Great Barrier Reef – a unique wonder of the natural world – is collapsing under the strain of pollution, propaganda and policy failures.  • This article was amended on 9 June 2016. The story in The Times on ocean acidification did not appear on page one of the newspaper as the article originally said, but on page 19."
"Norway’s parliament has approved a radical goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, two decades earlier than planned. On Tuesday night MPs voted for an accelerated programme of CO2 cuts and carbon trading to offset emissions from sectors such as Norway’s oil and gas industries, which are unlikely to be phased out in the near future.  The minority government’s ruling Progress and Conservative parties withdrew their support for the motion at the last minute. But their argument, that ambitious emissions reductions now could interfere with future climate negotiations, was roundly defeated. Rasmus Hansson, the leader of the Norwegian Green party in parliament, said: “This is a direct response to the commitments Norway took on by ratifying the Paris agreement and means that we will have to step up our climate action dramatically. ‘2050’ is science fiction. ‘2030’ is closer to us now than the year 2000.” The high profile climate motion followed a zero deforestation parliamentary vote earlier this month, which made Norway the first nation to ban public procurements that contribute to rainforest destruction. Norway emits around 53m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year and the climate minister, Vidar Helgesen, told parliament that he wanted to offset this, by paying other nations to cut their emissions under carbon trading schemes which expire in 2020. “It is incumbent on me to underline that this proposal from parliament is really about carbon offsets,” Helgesen told the Guardian. “It is not about national emissions reductions beyond what we will contribute, through the EU process.” Although Norway is outside the EU, it still participates in the EU’s emissions trading system. The wording of the parliamentary motion was left deliberately vague, calling for a smorgasbord of measures to achieve carbon neutrality, with no percentages for how much each should contribute. It said that “climate neutrality can be achieved through the EU emissions trading market, international cooperation on emissions reductions, emissions trading and project-based cooperation.” Helgesen said: “The reason why we’re not comfortable with this proposal is frankly that the [emissions reduction] methods parliament is pointing to are currently not available and the only one that is available right now, won’t be after 2020.” The government argues that more quid pro-quo commitments can be won if climate neutrality is used as a bargaining chip after a review of the Paris agreement in 2018. This would also prevent any double-counting of Norwegian emissions cuts in the UN and EU systems. The government plans to return to parliament on the question of how the proposal could be achieved. But the Greens and left groups in parliament say they will mount an “ongoing political battle” to ensure that the measures adopted go beyond carbon offsets alone.  “Our climate neutrality position could mean nothing if it is done that way,” Hansson said. “Norway cannot claim to be a contributor to the [non-binding] 1.5C target [agreed at Paris], if we continue to push for more oil and gas activity.” A Norwegian decision in January to up its fossil fuel production in some of the region’s riskiest and most environmentally fragile areas raised eyebrows in the wake of the Paris agreement. “This is a totally separate issue, as the climate neutrality goalposts are all about offsets by 2030,” Helgesen said. “After 2030, it is going to get tougher, and beyond that, even tougher.” "
"Readers may have noticed that it’s been about a month since my last article. In recent weeks I presented guest articles in place of my own pieces. The reason for my absence was due to the adoption I was finalizing in the USA (my second successful adoption!). Anyone who has adopted a child can attest to the time and travel requirements. I intend that this article marks my return to near weekly posting and I thank my readers for their patience. Coral reefs are important for the health of the ocean biosystem; they support and harbor a high density of diverse organisms. While there are reefs located in many locations around the world, people often think first about the Great Barrier Reef off the Australian coast. It is known for its size and beauty; it brings travelers close to nature.   Scientists have investigated how reefs will fare in a changing world. The changing climate, poor management, pollution, overfishing, careless divers, and other factors may bring real risks to the health of reefs. Just a few days ago, a world-leading organization released the results of a long-term study on the health of the Great Barrier Reef that may tell us about the health of reefs around the world. The organization ARC Centre of Excellence Coral Reef Studies found that a recent mass bleaching has killed 35% of corals on the northern and central Great Barrier Reef.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains coral bleaching as events that cause the coral to expel algae that live in their tissues. Following the expelling, the corals whiten in color (which is why the term bleaching is used). The coral and the algae live in a symbiotic relationship; the algae provide nutrients for the coral. Without the algae, coral can be more susceptible to disease and death. It’s important to know that the coral can recover from a bleaching, but recovery depends on the extent and duration of the event and the general health of the coral. This year’s incredible bleaching is not a one-time event. In fact, there have been many significant regional bleaching events and three global events over the past 18 years. In the current event, the extent of bleaching depends on location. The Great Barrier Reef extends over 2000 km. In the northern sector, almost all reefs experienced bleaching. The further south one travels, the less extensive the event because the warming was not as severe. I asked coral-reef expert John Bruno about this new study and he provided some excellent insights. He told me that this bleaching event is getting a lot of attention because it is the Great Barrier Reef – an iconic place that is close to pristine. It has also escaped the fate of most of the world’s reefs. But, within the scientific community, this bleaching isn’t a surprise. Dr. Bruno told me: We’ve been witnessing this sort of event for over 30 years. In fact, the Australians have been warning the rest of the world that if we managed our reefs better, we wouldn’t see so many bleaching events.  A very influential paper published in Science in 2003 hypothesized that mass coral mortality events and subsequent population decline only happen where and when fishes have been over-harvested and pollution has weakened the corals and encouraged seaweed growth. Dr. Bruno told me that this study generated the paradigm of “managed resilience” in coral reef ecology. The central theme is that better management of fishing and pollution makes reefs more resilient to bleaching and allows reefs to more easily recover if an event occurs. But the foundation of this paradigm has been challenged by the fact that nearly every critical test has shown it ineffective. So, the connections of warming oceans, pollution, management, fishing to bleachings are still being investigated. He further told me: Beyond demonstrating once again that emissions and ocean warming are causing massive coral loss, this study demonstrates that even remote, well-managed, and barely impacted reefs are susceptible to bleaching and ocean warming. The intact food webs, large predatory fish, and lack of pollution have clearly not made the northern Great Barrier Reef more resistant to ocean warming than reefs near large cities. In fact, this finding is concordant with numerous past studies that have found reefs with higher coral cover (such as reefs in Marine Protected Areas) are more vulnerable to climate change, simply because they tend to be dominated by coral species that are very sensitive to anomalously high ocean temperatures.  What I didn’t realize is that there are also mass bleachings in the Indian Ocean and central Pacific which are getting much less attention. In fact, according to Bruno, we really have the Australian scientific community to thank. It is hard to imagine another government-supported agency with the funds and commitment to bring this important issue to the world’s attention. It’s ironic that this comes on the heels of draconian funding cuts to the ocean-science organization CSIRO in Australia and the firing of some of their top scientists (such as Dr. John Church). I wrote about the disaster of budget cuts to ocean sciences in Australia and I hope that these cuts will not limit our future knowledge of coral reef health. People may wonder why we care, but reefs are important for a number of reasons. They form a crucial backbone to the biology of the ocean, and the fish and ocean life that we rely on as a human society. Problems in the ocean will not stay under the water."
"Human-caused climate change appears to have driven the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal species into the history books, with the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lives on a tiny island in the eastern Torres Strait, being completely wiped-out from its only known location. It is also the first recorded extinction of a mammal anywhere in the world thought to be primarily due to human-caused climate change.  An expert says this extinction is likely just the tip of the iceberg, with climate change exerting increasing pressures on species everywhere. The rodent, also called the mosaic-tailed rat, was only known to live on Bramble Cay a small coral cay, just 340m long and 150m wide off the north coast of Queensland, Australia, which sits at most 3m above sea level. It had the most isolated and restricted range of any Australian mammal, and was considered the only mammal species endemic to the Great Barrier Reef. When its existence was first recorded by Europeans in 1845, it was seen in high density on the island, with sailors reporting they shot the “large rats” with bows and arrows. In 1978, it was estimated there were several hundred on the small island. But the melomys were last seen in 2009, and after an extensive search for the animal in 2014, a report has recommended its status be changed from “endangered” to “extinct”. Led by Ian Gynther from Queensland’s Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, and in partnership with the University of Queensland, the survey laid 150 traps on the island for six nights, and involved extensive measurements of the island and its vegetation. In their report, co-authored by Natalie Waller and Luke Leung from the University of Queensland, the researchers concluded the “root cause” of the extinction was sea-level rise. As a result of rising seas, the island was inundated on multiple occasions, they said, killing the animals and also destroying their habitat. It was estimated the area of the cay above high tide has decreased from 4ha in 1998 to 2.5ha in 2014. And worse for the melomys, they lost 97% of their habitat in just 10 years, with vegetation cover declining from 2.2ha in 2004 to just 0.065ha in 2014. “For low-lying islands like Bramble Cay, the destructive effects of extreme water levels resulting from severe meteorological events are compounded by the impacts from anthropogenic climate change-driven sea-level rise,” the authors said in their report. Globally, averaged sea level has risen by almost 20cm between 1901 and 2010, a rate unparalleled in any period during the last 6,000 years. But around the Torres Strait, sea level appears to have risen at almost twice the global average rate between 1993 and 2014. “Significantly, this probably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change,” the researchers said in their report, quietly published on the Queensland government’s website last week. As a result, the Queensland government website now recommends suggested recovery actions not be taken. “Because the Bramble Cay melomys is now confirmed to have been lost from Bramble Cay, no recovery actions for this population can be implemented,” it says. Although small, the island is significant for many people and animals. It is the most important breeding ground for green turtles and a number of seabirds in the Torres Strait, the researchers said, and has long been visited by its traditional custodians, the Darnley Islanders, who caught fish, turtles and birds.  The authors said the IUCN lists one other mammal that was driven to extinction, partly by extreme weather – the Little Swan Island hutia – but introduced cats on the island were considered the main driver of extinction. In contrast, the researchers say the melomys was driven to extinction due “solely (or primarily) to anthropogenic climate change”. The one hope for the species, the authors say, is that there might be an undiscovered population in Papua New Guinea. They say the melomys might have arrived on Brambles Cay on rafting debris from the Fly River region of Papua New Guinea. If that is true, then either the Brambles Cay melomys, or a close relative, may still live undiscovered there. The authors recommend targeted surveys in Papua New Guinea be carried out, to see if they are there. John White, an ecologist from Deakin University in Australia, who was not involved in the study, said this extinction is the tip of the iceberg. “I am of absolutely no doubt we will lose species due to the increasing pressures being exerted by climate change,” he said. “Species restricted to small, low lying islands, or those with very tight environmental requirements are likely to be the first to go.” A report in 2015 found one sixth of the world’s species face extinction due to climate change, and scientists have warned that the world is on the edge of the sixth mass extinction. “Certainly, extinction and climatic change has gone hand in hand throughout the history of the world,” he said. “So, if this is one of the first, it is more than likely not going to be the last.”"

"Scotland’s climate emissions have broken through a landmark reductions target six years early after a warm winter helped drive down energy use.  The Scottish climate change secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said she was delighted that the country’s emissions had fallen by nearly 46% between 1990 and 2014, surpassing the government’s 2020 target of a 42% cut far earlier than expected.  She said it was “outstanding progress”, with Scottish emissions falling faster than the rest of the UK, and would be followed by tougher, more ambitious targets in legislation later in this parliament. Climate campaigners welcomed the progress but were sceptical about the Scottish government’s role in it. The annual target for emissions was met in 2014 for the first time since yearly targets were introduced by Holyrood in 2009.  Jim Densham, a spokesman for Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said it was great news that the “symbolic” goal had been met early, since it showed that greenhouse gases could be cut without harming living standards and the economy. But he said much of that fall was due to factors outside Scottish government control, including a much warmer winter than usual in 2014. “Apart from the electricity and waste sectors, it’s hard to see a bold fingerprint of Scottish government policy driving the transition to a zero-carbon economy,” he said. “This target has been met because of the loss of heavy industry, warmer winter weather, our changing share of European emissions credits and some government policies. “Individual action is important but Scottish government needs to lead with the big policies for major emission reductions. The challenge ahead is to tackle the sectors where there’s been little change to date, like transport, where our emissions remain stalled at 1990 levels, and housing, where emissions have reduced only 1% since the Scottish Climate Change Act was passed.”  Cunningham said Scotland had exceeded the UK’s achievements, since total UK emissions had fallen by 33% since 1990.  “The reduction in residential emissions in 2014 may have been due to people turning down their heating. This underlines that small individual actions, if repeated on a large scale, can have a big impact in tackling climate change,” she said. “This is an especially important time for climate change, in light of the international agreement reached in Paris last December, and it is great news that Scotland continues to show ambition and demonstrate the progress that can be made.” Mark Ruskell, the Scottish Green party’s Holyrood climate spokesman, said that if Scottish ministers wanted to set more challenging targets for 2020, they would need far more ambitious domestic policies on transport, home energy efficiency and fuel poverty.  He said ministerial plans to cut air passenger duty by half would add 60,000 tonnes to Scotland’s growing emissions from aviation.  “The real test of action on climate change isn’t how figures get fudged from year to year; it’s whether people across Scotland have real choices to live in warm, efficient homes or a transport system fit for the 21st century. That requires funding and action from the Scottish government,” Ruskin said."

"Currently, about 40% of Americans support Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and about 40% of Americans are not worried about global warming. While short of a majority, this is a substantial fraction of the American public failing to grasp the risks associated with a Donald Trump presidency and potentially catastrophic climate change impacts. In Business Insider, Josh Barro recently wrote about the former:   Trump calls for a huge risk premium because, while he probably wouldn’t be a disastrous president, the low-probability disasters that he might cause would be immensely costly. Some of them involve nuclear weapons and global mass deaths. Pricing those risks in properly should push his share price comfortably below Clinton’s, even if you think she is very bad. In most cases, Americans are good at managing risks. We buy insurance for our homes, cars, and health. We wear seat belts in cars, and far fewer Americans smoke today than just a few decades ago. The smoking analogy is particularly apt. In the mid-20th century, scientists were just beginning to make the connection between smoking and lung cancer, and over 40% of Americans smoked cigarettes in the 1960s. Today, Americans are aware of the risks associated with smoking, and the number has dropped below 17%. The structures of the risks themselves are similar. Each time we smoke, we slightly increase the risks of a catastrophic outcome (developing lung cancer). Each time we burn fossil fuels, we slightly increase the risks of irreversible and potentially catastrophic climate change impacts. To mitigate those risks, we need to smoke as little and burn as little fossil fuels as possible. Americans have been successful in the former case, but we’re struggling with the latter. Our carbon pollution has started to decline, and the Obama Administration has made great progress in tackling climate change. But Donald Trump has explicitly threatened to reverse that progress, and 40% of Americans don’t seem to care. The threat of catastrophic climate change isn’t as tangible as a burning house, car accident, or lung cancer. Americans tend to view climate threats as distant in both time and space. According to research by scientists from Yale and Utah State University, 55% believe that global warming won’t harm them personally, and just 51% think that it will harm Americans. 61% believe that global warming will harm future generations. In other words, Americans don’t think global warming is a problem now, and not much of a threat where they live. The good news is that Americans do support solutions to the climate problem. 74% favor regulating carbon as a pollutant, as the Obama Administration is trying to do. The bad news is that because they see it as a distant threat, they view these solutions as a low priority, and hence politicians like Donald Trump can threaten to obstruct them without losing voter support. It’s a challenge – Americans support policies to mitigate climate change risks, but not strongly enough to vote for politicians who will implement those policies; at least for the 40%. As Barro put it: People are failing to price in the small risk that a Trump presidency could cause us to lose everything we value, and that scares the hell out of me. Replace the words “a Trump presidency” with “climate change” and the statement is equally valid. We can only hope that the fraction of Americans failing to grasp the immense risks associated with a Donald Trump presidency and unabated global warming don’t grow to become a majority within the next 5 months."
"The former Liberal leader John Hewson addressed an estimated 2000 people protesting in the Sydney suburb of Double Bay – minutes from Malcolm Turnbull’s harbourside mansion – calling on the prime minister to take stronger action on climate change. Speaking at the same time as Turnbull addressed the party faithful at the Coalition’s campaign launch, Hewson told protesters the Coalition’s lack of action on climate change was a “national disgrace”. “I think climate change should be the dominant issue of this campaign – it should have been for quite some time,” said Hewson, who was once the local member for the seat of Wentworth, which includes Double Bay. He said “short-term politicking” from both sides left targets that were inadequate and policies that were not going to meet those targets. “The one thing that hasn’t failed is people like yourselves,” he said. “The community is way ahead of the political leaders and the business leaders on this issue.” He urged the crowd to push political leaders for a bipartisan approach to climate change. “Enough is enough, it’s time to act,” Hewson said. A spokesperson from GetUp, which organised the protest in coalition with three other environment groups, estimated there were about 2000 people in the crowd. Protesters were given placards in the shape of coral, which were coloured on one side, and white on the other, which symbolised the devastating bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. They turned them around for the cameras, while chanting “Choose the reef, not coal”. Robert Shelly, who lives in Vaucluse, attended the protest with his two-year-old daughter, Ariella, and her dog. “We come from a family with a big environmental conscience. It’s a very important issue and it’s been completely ignored by the mainstream,” he said. Paula Brook, who lives in Woollahra, said she was motivated to come to the protest after seeing the Australian Conservation Foundation’s scorecard, which said the Coalition’s environmental policies were “woefully inadequate”. “The Coalition was really far down, and this is Malcolm Turnbull’s electorate and so it was important to show him that people care about environmental issues,” she said. A sizable crowd in @TurnbullMalcolm's electorate calling for stronger action on climate change. @murpharoo pic.twitter.com/KYR58Mtp7W The crowd was also addressed by Dr Kate Charlesworth, who was until recently a Wentworth resident and previously worked at the sustainable development unit at the National Health Service in the UK. She said although climate change was a great risk to human health, and a health emergency, actions that would mitigate climate change had the potential to be a great boost to human health. “Things like active transport – walking and cycling – improved diets with more plant based foods; looking at the causes of air pollution; reducing traffic congestion; healthier cities with more green space and tree cover. All these things will have tremendous benefits to human health,” she said. Michael Borgas, a climate scientist at the CSIRO also addressed the crowd, calling on the government to fund climate science, following the news that the CSIRO was making significant cuts to its climate research. Tony Fontes, a Great Barrier Reef diving instructor, also spoke, calling for stronger climate action to protect the reef. “We’ve just seen the greatest, most devastating bleaching event in the history of the reef and we’re going to see more.” Lyndon Schneiders, the national director for the Wilderness Society, which helped organise the protest, said: “Malcolm Turnbull must do more to address climate change. The Great Barrier Reef is dying on Mr Turnbull’s watch and yet his government sticks to its inadequate Direct Action policy.” Nikola Casule from Greenpeace – another organiser of the protest – said Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were growing and forecast to increase until 2030. “The science is clear – the world needs to stop emitting greenhouse gases but our emissions are going in the other direction.” Protesters turn their coral around to symbolize its bleaching. ""Choose the reef not coal,"" they chant in Double Bay. pic.twitter.com/iAhUuM4RZj The protest caps three days of protesting in Turnbull’s electorate. On Friday Greenpeace activists hung a banner from Turnbull’s electorate office in Edgecliff, saying: “Turnbull’s Legacy: bleaching – brought to you by Malcolm’s mates in the coal industry.” And on Saturday, a group of 50 pacific islanders kayaked from Blues Point to Lady Martin’s beach, mere metres from Turnbull’s harbourside mansion, raising awareness of climate change and sea level rise."
"One morning in the summer of 2014, I found myself in the city of Tacloban in the Philippines. The city and surrounding area had been devastated less than a year earlier by Super Typhoon Yolanda. Thousands had been killed; bodies were found for months afterwards.  As part of an international research collaboration, I was interviewing government officials and others throughout the Philippines to assess how to improve preparedness for and response to climate-related disasters. I had already interviewed survivors in cities and villages across the country about the impacts of extreme weather. (And, incidentally, a few weeks later, I would contract dengue and chikungunya—two mosquito-borne diseases aided by climate change in their ongoing spread.) With my prior experience, I thought I was prepared for what I would hear that morning, but I wasn’t.  As I prepared for the day’s interviews, I spoke with a man of about fifty who was helping us to navigate. He described the impact of the storm, the thousands of bodies lying about, his attempts to somehow help despite the overwhelming magnitude of the destruction and death. His own son had gone missing, but there was no time to search; the need for attention to those around him was too immediate and great. The destruction’s scale made the attempted cleanup a kind of futile, obligatory madness—but one that seemed necessary by the standards of human decency.  The madness, the decency, the inhuman work of cleaning a mountain of death and sadness continued for weeks, until someone informed him that they had found his son. He was miles away, his body in a mangrove patch, decomposing. The father collected his son’s remains, like so many others did, and then returned to the never-ending work. There was too much to do. And as the father spoke to me, some half a year later, there was still too much to do. The coastline had been reoccupied with shanties. Another typhoon season was coming. The father looked at me, and I could see his eyes. I cannot forget what I saw: trauma, grief, fear…all unprocessed, all repressed and pushed aside for months because there was no time to grieve, no time to come to peace, because there was too much to do; too much to do just to survive, just to live. The next spring, I was in Massachusetts, on Harvard’s campus. People were awakening to the dangers of climate change. Massive demonstrations were occurring on campus to protest Harvard’s considerable investments in the fossil fuel sector (which constituted one-third of Harvard’s disclosed investments at the end of 2014). Student and alumni protestors had set up camp around the central administrative building. To avoid the protestors, the administration had moved operations to Loeb House, a small mansion on campus, which was surrounded by barricades and police to prevent protestors from approaching. The former Harvard professor Cornel West whipped up the crowd with a characteristically fiery speech and led a march to Loeb House to deliver a letter to the administration. Hundreds, including myself, participated. As we approached, I could see administrative staff peering out at us past the velvet curtains.  When we got to the barricades, the police informed us that no one was in the building. Despite the human-looking figures inside poking their heads above the corners of windows to sneak a peak at the rabble outside, the police insisted the building was empty. I remember feeling confused—to be lied to blatantly is more disorienting than to be lied to subtly—and the crowd began to chant, calling for someone to come outside. As hundreds stayed and chanted for ten, then twenty minutes—calling to the individuals they could see through the windows—individuals who were looking right back while the police insisted that no one was inside—I thought of the father in the Philippines. He did not choose to be surrounded by death; he did not choose to be tasked with the retrieval of his own son’s remains. He was not afforded even the basic privilege of time and space to grieve. He was afforded no choice but to repress his trauma and continue. And I thought of his son, who did not choose death. And yet in that moment I saw those who did have the luxury of choice, those who live lives of comfort, looking down from the windows of a mansion at a crowd whose request was to deliver a letter for the sake of human decency.  And yet, for the people in that house, to come outside to accept such a letter was below them—while hiding from their own students, and lying boldly to them, was not.  Finally—after it was clear that the protestors would not be leaving—someone did emerge from the empty house, accepting the contentious piece of paper and taking it inside. The protestors wanted Harvard to stand up to powerful interests by moving away from its fossil fuel stakes, yet its management was unwilling to accept a simple piece of paper—an arguably much easier task—without a theatre of the absurd. It was in that moment that I realized that if our children look back to how we failed them, it will not have been for lack of scientific understanding or even technological prowess; it will have been due, fundamentally, to cowardice. A profound cowardice among those who actually do have a choice in this matter, a cowardice that confuses arrogance with intelligence, pettiness with importance, and, most fatally, comfort with necessity.  Essentially all of the climate change controversy at Harvard has revolved around divestment. The idea of reducing investments in fossil fuels as a matter of policy began as an audacious suggestion designed to shock people into seeing the contradiction between our words and our actions on climate. After institutions began adopting the idea, it became a method to call attention to the obstructionism and denial propagated by fossil fuel companies. Institutions that were afraid of making enemies in industry—like Harvard and MIT—were, rather predictably, reluctant to take a public stand. But since the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the idea of divestment has evolved into something much more fundamental and unignorable.  In polite society—at least the kind that self-identifies with science—the Paris agreement is applauded, in essence, universally. Yet the implications of the agreement for investments are beginning to be reckoned with, and they are stark: by the IPCC’s most recent estimate, $100 billion per year needs to be disinvested from the fossil fuel extraction industry for the next twenty years. And when it comes to infrastructure, a recent study has found that no new fossil-fuel-using power plants can be built after next year (unless they are decommissioned prematurely—making them a bad investment). In other words, if we are serious about the Paris agreement, then there needs to be a deliberate shift of investments out of fossil fuels and into clean replacements at this moment. This is, technically speaking, the definition of divestment.  The catch, though, is that this is something that Harvard’s administration has vowed never to do. To analyze why is an exercise in theorizing—it may be due to the logic of economic Darwinism that underlies Harvard’s culture and wealth, a psychology of indignant authoritarianism among Harvard’s governing board, pervasive conflicts of interest (Harvard trustee Ted Wells is currently legal counsel for Exxon Mobil, for example), or nothing more than simple bureaucratic group-think—but regardless of the reason, the fact that the richest private university in the world openly defies the Paris agreement with its investment policies—while praising the agreement with words—is troubling.  And this brings us to an uncomfortable but unavoidable question: does Harvard actually wantto fix climate change, or does it merely want to look like it wants to fix it? And perhaps more troublingly: do we actually want to fix climate change, or are we just going through the motions to save face, to avoid admitting to ourselves that, deep down, we aren’t who we thought we were, that we actually don’t care that much what happens to our children—or what happens to the world? What does it look like to pretend to care? Harvard has announced that “green is the new crimson” and, to much fanfare, spends a special $1 million per year on climate research. But in the face of a civilizational crisis—and for an institution whose research spending is on the order of a billion dollars per year already—what is the intended purpose of this much-publicized $1 million? Harvard spends the same to pay its president (more than the president of the US)—and fifty times more just to pay half a dozen of its money managers. Meanwhile, Harvard likely has hundreds of millions—or more—invested in fossil fuels. If we look past the fanfare and see the world’s richest private university spending $1 million per year to address a civilizational crisis, congratulating itself while investing hundreds of times more in the root cause of that crisis, are we supposed to feel reassured? Or can this only be interpreted as the most illuminating kind of satire of all—that is, the kind that is real? It might be suggested that universities are places of discourse, not action. Yet when confronted with its stake in and connections to the fossil fuel industry, the discourse at Harvard rapidly morphs into non-sequiturs and censorship. Harvard’s president suggested to me that if we were to move investments out of fossil fuels, then we might have to do the same for sugar, because sugar is harmful, too. Is this real? For those dying around the world, for those living in cities or societies that face destruction from climate change, how is this anything other than a modern-day “let them eat cake”?  When faced with calls for divestment, another Harvard trustee suggested that we should instead be thanking oil companies like BP for investing in renewable energy—which is awkward, because there’s not a lot of that going on. At what point does “daddy knows best” become “I think daddy might be losing touch with reality”? Have we arrived? In court, Harvard has formally argued that students’ desire for reduced investments in fossil fuels is as trivial and arbitrary as the desire for a new academic calendar or different housing options. Again, does Harvard truly believe that the existence of species, the stability of societies, and the lives of the vulnerable around the world are choices on the same level as whether to start classes on a Wednesday or a Thursday? When we play dumb, are we being clever and bluffing—or are we fools telling the truth? Which is more terrifying to the future of human society? Harvard staff members have told me they are prohibited from discussing the issue of fossil fuel divestment at all—even outside of work. Imagine if staff were prohibited from talking about greenhouse gas reductions. When the future depends on our actions today, why is a university suppressing discussion? At a research staff meeting at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, my colleagues and I were instructed by our research director not to speak to journalists who inquire about our funding from the fossil fuel industry. At this moment in history, doesn’t the public deserve to know? And perhaps the atmosphere of censorship is best summarized by a senior professor in environmental economics who told me that he was willing to discuss any topic under the sun (even “the ballet”)—with the single exception of fossil fuel divestment. I love ballet, too, but don’t we owe the next generation some—any—duty of care? Why is it that reducing emissions is blasé, but reducing investments is taboo? The crucial thing I’ve learned from working on climate at Harvard is that when it comes to climate change, we—even those who profess to care—are not doing everything we can—far from it. While people die around the world, those with the privilege of choice confuse comfort with necessity in order to justify inaction when it serves them. This is our central cowardice, from individuals to institutions. And at Harvard, it has assumed forms of absurdist logic and suppressed discussion. Divestment—though central to fixing climate change conceptually and perhaps practically—is one issue of many. Yet it has revealed the tip of an iceberg, demonstrating that words of concern on climate only go so far—that when educated and privileged institutions like Harvard are asked to make a sacrifice or take a risk, they too cower behind any rationalization they can find for the status quo—one that loads risk onto the next generation and especially the poor. This indicates that the struggle to fix climate change is not simply partisan but is a deeper test of who we are; it is to be found within even our most enlightened institutions—and within ourselves. In a sense, there is an absurd irony—a real-life satire—to Harvard’s insistence on investing in a product that will, through sea level rise, ultimately destroy much of its campus, as well as the proud and historic city of Boston. In our enlightened age, our best minds apply themselves mightily—debating the differences between fossil fuels and sugar and academic calendars—simply to achieve mismanagement. If today’s youth wish to save themselves, they will have to rebel against both the powerful and the respectable.  Ultimately, in the history of climate change, Harvard and its kind—privileged, insulated, and foolishly clever—may not matter other than to embody a cautionary tale. But insofar as Harvard does matter, I implore it to change. It can align itself with the Paris agreement instead of defying it. It can accept difficult discussions instead of suppressing them. It can face climate change with the directness and sobriety—the courage—the world dearly needs. Yet it may choose not to. Either way, we can bear witness. And either way, today’s youth must keep fighting to save their generation from the last.

"Arctic sea ice fell to its lowest ever May extent, prompting fears that this year could beat 2012 for the record of worst ever summer sea ice melt. Data published by the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) this week showed average sea ice extent for last month was more than 500,000 sq km (193,000 sq miles) smaller than May 2012.  The extent of sea ice in the Arctic is one of the key indicators of global warming, and the new findings have been greeted with concern by scientists. Although it is too early to say whether this summer’s ice extent will be the lowest recorded, if current projections follow the course of previous years then it will be at least one of the lowest ever. Snow cover in the northern hemisphere was the lowest in 50 years in April, the NSIDC said, and Antarctic sea ice was below average for the time of year.  Warm air from Siberia and northern Europe were blamed for the decline in Arctic sea ice, which is consistent with predictions of climate change. The Arctic has warmed much faster than other regions, and the loss of sea ice is viewed as a measure of how much we are affecting the world’s climate. Melting sea ice does not raise sea levels, because the ice is floating, but has a strong effect on the earth’s albedo – the reflectivity of the poles and other snow and ice covered areas. Ice and snow reflect some of the sun’s heat back into space, but when they retreat the dark areas remaining absorb more heat. This exacerbates existing warming effects, such as the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition, melting sea ice in the Arctic is often a good indicator that land ice and snow – such as that which covers Greenland – is also melting, and land-based ice does contribute to sea level rises. The NSIDC cautioned that current sea ice estimates were “tentative”, but added that they were “supported by other data sources”. The extent of sea ice will be closely watched this summer, as the lowest point of the year comes in September as the Arctic summer draws to a close. Jonathan Bamber, professor of physical geography at Bristol University, told the Guardian: “We have already seen an unusually early start to melting around the margins of Greenland in 2016 and the new findings from NSIDC of exceptionally low sea ice extent for May and the lowest northern hemisphere snow cover for 50 years is in line with the longer term decadal trends for the Arctic as a whole. The region is undergoing warming at around twice the global average, and the ice is responding accordingly.” Temperatures in the Arctic last winter were up to 10C above the average for 1981 to 2010, said Chris Rapley, professor of climate science at University College London. He also highlighted the reduction in thickness of the ice, which is another key indicator of climate change. “The impacts on the Arctic ocean and land systems are transformational, creating huge problems for [people who live there] who on the basis of their traditional knowledge confirm that the climate system has already shifted well outside the bounds they have previously experienced. The situation is [also] changing the circulation patterns and behaviours of the atmosphere and oceans,” he said The reduced extent of this summer’s ice is also a hangover from last winter, when sea ice was unusually slow to form because of higher temperatures in the surrounding oceans, according to Dr Finlo Cottier, senior lecturer in polar oceanography at the Scottish Association for Marine Science. “This [slow formation of winter ice] leads to thinner ice that can break up more easily,” said Cottier. “The results also highlight the increasing significance of wind in deforming and breaking the sea ice cover.” Sea ice extent in the last winter was at its smallest extent for winter since records began in 1979, data published in March showed. Research by the campaigning group Greenpeace, published this week, suggests that melting ice in the Arctic may also alter weather patterns in the northern hemisphere, contributing to wetter summers in some areas and colder, stormy winters."
"Coral reefs have almost always been studied up close, by scientists in the water looking at small portions of larger reefs to gather data and knowledge about the larger ecosystems. But Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is taking a step back and getting a wider view, from about 23,000 ft above. Nasa and top scientists from around the world are launching a three-year campaign on Thursday to gather new data on coral reefs like never before.  Using specially-designed instruments mounted on high-flying aircraft, the scientists plan to map large swaths of coral around the world in hopes of better understanding how environmental changes are impacting these delicate and important ecosystems. The researchers hope to discover how environmental forces including global warming, acidification and pollution impact coral reefs in different locations by creating detailed images of entire reef ecosystems. “CORAL (Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory) is an airborne mission to survey reefs at select locations across the Pacific,” Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences’ Eric Hochberg, who is principal investigator for the project, told the Associated Press. “The idea is to get a new perspective on coral reefs from above, to study them at a larger scale than we have been able to before, and then relate reef condition to the environment.” Hochberg and the project’s lead Nasa scientist Michelle Gierach were in Oahu, Hawaii’s Kaneohe Bay to gather baseline data in the water. While the primary science will be conducted using instruments that map the sea floor from above, the team must also take baseline measurements in the ocean to validate the data they get from the air, Gierach said. Her main role in the project is to decipher the data gathered from the aircraft. “PRISM, the instrument that we’re using ... is the state-of-the-art instrument for addressing coastal and in-water science questions,” Gierach said. “CORAL wouldn’t be possible without an instrument like PRISM, it’s really the heart and soul of the project.” Coral reefs drive many tourist economies around the world, but they provide much more than pretty places to dive and snorkel, Gierach said. Reefs are critical habitat for the majority of the fish humans consume and also protect shorelines from dangerous storm surges and rising ocean levels. Recently scientists have developed pharmaceutical applications from coral reefs, including pain killers that aren’t habit forming, Hochberg said. “Just realizing that though you may not see a coral, that you may not have your backyard be within this beautiful environment that we’re in right now, corals are impacting you, they are globally important,” Gierach said. “We have to understand how they’re changing so we can make some managed decisions about their future.” Reefs are among the first ecosystems to be dramatically and directly impacted by global warming, according to the researchers. The International Society for Reef Studies Consensus Statement, published in 2015, said that over the past few decades, up to 50% of coral reefs have been “largely or completely degraded by a combination of local factors and global climate change.” Julia Baum, assistant professor of biology at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, has done extensive research on coral reefs and said that the data gathered from this kind of project could prove highly valuable for international reef scientists and the conservation community. “I’m a huge proponent of open source data,” Baum said. “To me, the application of this technology to coral reefs holds great promise, but to fulfill that promise the data has to be made openly available to the scientific community.” The CORAL researchers said all data will be publicly available and will take about six months to process once captured. Baum acknowledged that a lot of coral reef science has been limited by the lack of broad data sets like this project plans to provide. “As scientific divers we’re limited by the depth we can work at and the amount of bottom time that we have while we’re diving, so much of underwater marine science, especially on coral reefs is a painstakingly slow process,” Baum said. “This Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory can’t replace scientists in the water, but it can provide a very high-level, complementary type of data.” The CORAL team will study the reefs of Hawaii, Palau, the Mariana Islands, and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef over the next three years."

"One of the oldest human illusions is that culture is a conquest of, or an escape from, nature. It is an illusion we need to abandon fast.  We might nurture some desperate dream that, as the benign post-ice age climate that has made civilisation possible is destroyed by our own folly and greed, our own creations will survive. That in some no longer distant future the Mona Lisa and the Arnolfini portrait, the works of Shakespeare and the scores of Beethoven’s operas will still be safe in museums and archives and great libraries. In short, that civilisation’s treasures will survive the flood. Some hope. As the river Seine has risen in Paris in recent days, no less a museum than the Louvre has had to close its doors (along with the Musee d’Orsay) so that staff can save its artistic masterpieces from floodwater. This is not just a bizarre consequence of a bit of bad weather. It is a stark warning that civilisation can only survive in harmony with nature. If we destroy our planet, we destroy not just our current way of life but the human heritage itself – the high points of civilisation will be forgotten, drowned, ruined, effaced. It is scarily symbolic to see the Louvre menaced by flooding, as the world’s weather becomes ever less predictable and the signs of climate change impossible to ignore. No other museum so grandly preserves the finest achievements of our species. The Louvre was self-consciously created as a treasure house of world history. After it was founded in 1793 during the French revolution, initially to display paintings seized from French royal palaces (including the Mona Lisa), its horizons rapidly expanded under Napoleon. Scientists, artists and archaeologists accompanied Napoleon on his invasion of Egypt, which resulted in the mammoth collaborative study Description of Egypt and cosmopolitan new treasures for the Louvre. Napoleon claimed that “all men of genius are French” and looted masterpieces for the Louvre wherever his armies went.  Twenty-first century visitors to this encyclopedic museum still feel the power and glory of its Napoleonic ambitions as we wander its four vast wings (one of which is named after Napoleon’s chief artistic adviser, Denon) beholding masterpiece after masterpiece. Michelangelo? The Louvre has two of his greatest statues, the Rebellious Slave and the Dying Slave. Jan van Eyck? It has his glowing miniaturist marvel The Madonna of Chancellor Rolin. Ancient Greece? It’s got the Victory of Samothrace and, oh yes, the Venus de Milo. Is that all a bit too European? The Louvre also owns one of the most beautiful of all Mesopotamian sculptures, the delicate and moving statue of Ebih-Il. If any museum sums up the best of human creativity through millennia, it is the Louvre. Now that it has been forced to close its doors, to take emergency measures against another of those weather events in which only the most foolhardy or corrupt refuse to see human-induced climate change, we can glimpse how our destructive side will wreck our best hopes if we don’t change.  Some environmentalists, of course, would say the fate of nature matters more than the fate of civilisation: that we humans have proved a pretty nasty little species. That is wrong. The great art that fills the Louvre proves it is wrong. The most apocalyptic masterpiece in the Louvre is Géricault’s The Raft of the Medusa. As they cling to a raft on a savage sea, the last survivors of catastrophe have apparently been driven to cannibalism. Civilisation has died. Bare survival is all they have. Is that enough? "
"Despite being an issue that knows no borders, affects all and is of vital interest to future generations, the environment was low on the agenda ahead of the UK’s historic vote to leave the European Union. The short answer to what happens next with pollution, wildlife, farming, green energy, climate change and more is we don’t know – we are in uncharted territory. But all the indications – from the “red-tape” slashing desires of the Brexiters to the judgment of environmental professionals – are that the protections for our environment will get weaker.  There is one immediate impact though, right here, right now: the crashing financial markets will damage the huge investments needed to create a cleaner and safer environment and will dent the nation’s fast-growing green economy, one economic sector where the UK could lead. From the air we breathe to the food we eat to the climate we live in, how we protect and enhance the environment underpins the healthy and happy lives we all aspire to, now and for generations to come. The 75% of 18-24-year-old Britons who voted to remain in the EU must be feeling betrayed by older generations today. Why? Because the UK’s membership of the EU has been a virtually unalloyed good for the environment.  The Brexit vote leaves it highly uncertain which protections will remain in place and the prospect of improving them seems remote. Ukip’s Nigel Farage, the politician who did more than anyone to force the EU referendum, doesn’t even think climate change is a problem and wants to scrap pollution limits on power stations.  With 400,000 early deaths a year from air pollution – 40,000 in the UK – the EU saw things differently and set new legal limits in 2010. Many UK cities and towns remain above those limits today and campaigners have used EU rules to successfully sue the UK government. But UK ministers are even now fighting new EU rules to reduce early deaths. Pollution does not stop in its tracks at national borders, and 88% of environment professionals in the UK think an EU-wide policy is needed.  Earlier legal action from the EU forced the UK to clean up its sewage-strewn beaches, while many of the protections for nature and wildlife across the nation stem from EU rules. Here again, the people whose job it is to safeguard these wonderful places and reverse the damage of the past think leaving the EU is a mistake: 66% say there will be a lower level of legal protection for wildlife and habitats against 30% who think it will improve. The EU has also driven a revolution in recycling and waste. What will happen to that, according to the people who made it happen on the ground? Two-thirds of the professionals think it will go into reverse, with 30% saying it will stay the same and just 4% thinking it will improve. One major EU policy – its vast subsidy regime for farmers – has not been good for wildlife by encouraging damaging intensive agriculture: there are 421m fewer birds in Europe than 30 years ago. But the Common Agricultural Policy was improving its approach to the environment and supports the farmers who put food on our tables every day. They are now in an agonising limbo. Fisherman may hope to get larger quotas now the UK is leaving the EU but for how long? There will not, without strong protections, be plenty more fish in the sea for long.  The National Farmers Union (NFU) may get one wish from Brexit: the scrapping of a ban on pesticides that harm bees and other crucial pollinators. The NFU and UK ministers fought the ban, but the collective will of the EU saw it put in place. The collective will of the EU has also been vital in climate change, both on the international stage and at home in the UK. The UK’s targets for renewable energy were agreed in Brussels but leaving the EU puts them into limbo too.  However, despite the current government hacking back support for clean energy, the UK does have strong domestic legislation which sets deep cuts in carbon emissions into law. But Boris Johnson, now a leading contender to be the UK’s next prime minister, is a climate change sceptic: will he act on his conviction that all this global warming malarkey is piffle? James Thornton, the chief executive of Client Earth, the lawyers who forced the government to improve its air pollution plans, said Brexit “leaves me shocked, disappointed and extremely concerned about the future of environmental protections in the UK.” Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth, said the leave vote was a “red alert” for the environment. Farage’s reaction to Brexit was unsurprisingly different: “I couldn’t be more delighted.”"
"Carbon emissions stopped growing in 2015 for the first time in 10 years as the world turned its back on coal and embraced energy efficiency and renewable power with increased vigour, according to a new set of statistics. China led the way in driving down emissions but the latest figures from oil company BP come with a warning that the progress may not last.  With the exception of a drop in global emissions around the time of the 2009 financial crisis, which heavily depressed overall business activity, the BP figure of 0.1% growth in CO2 is the lowest for 25 years. Wind power capacity grew by 17.4% and solar by 32.6% last year with China overtaking Germany and the US as the largest generator of solar. America’s overall renewable energy capacity increased by 19.7%, Germany’s by 10.9% and Britain’s by only 4.8%. “There are good reasons for thinking that some of this (CO2) slowdown reflects structural forces (pushing for low carbon power) that are likely to persist and grow in importance,” said Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist. “But some probably reflects cyclical factors, particularly the contraction of China’s most energy-intensive sectors, which are unlikely to keep being repeated and may well unwind in future years,” he added. The pledges and determination shown by world governments at the Paris climate change talks in Paris meant there would likely be “further policies aimed at shifting the fuel-mix towards cleaner, lower-carbon fuels, with renewable energy, along with natural gas, the main beneficiary,” said Dale. He defended his own company’s business model of concentrating investment largely on oil and gas, saying BP was gradually moving from oil to favouring gas, which results in lower emissions, as a “bridge” fuel to a low carbon economy. He also said BP had invested in Brazilian biofuels and US wind power. But asked at a briefing to unveil the BP annual statistical review of world energy whether his employer should do more, he said: “We need governments to lead on this... and set a meaningful carbon price.” The International Energy Agency reported flat CO2 emissions in 2014 and 2015 but BP said it did not take into account numbers that became available later on with regard to Chinese carbon output related to higher grade coal it had been burning. Coal consumption fell worldwide by 1.8% last year even as the price slumped by 20%, the latest BP statistics show. Much of the decline was a result of the US switching from its own coal supplies to shale gas for generating electricity at power stations. Oil demand grew by 1.9m barrels a day in 2015, heavily influenced by the collapse in crude prices. Dale believed the cost of Brent blend oil – since recovered from a low of $28 per barrel to around $52 – would continue to move upwards in the second half of this year. But the chances of a major, sustained bounceback in the short term would be undermined by a major stock “overhang” ."

"If the federal government wants Australians to ignore the Great Barrier Reef as it dies beside us, it has done a masterful job by scrubbing all mentions of the reef from the latest UN climate change report. The government’s actions have been described as Soviet in style and intent but the political thuggery pales compared to the activation of a subtler and more powerful effect known as psychological distance.  Psychological distance is a construct that measures the “distance” of an event or object in terms of geography, time, cultural similarity and factual certainty. If something is nearby, likely to occur soon, involves people like you, and the facts are certain, that “something” is considered psychologically close. The closer it is, the more likely you are to perceive it as concrete and be willing and able to act on it. Work by our environmental psychology research group at the University of New England shows that alternatively, as psychological distance increases, an object is perceived more abstractly and is less likely to be acted on. Saving for retirement is a classic example. In our 20s, the facts of retirement are uncertain: it will occur in the distant future, and possibly in a different location and cultural context. Other more concrete concerns capture our attention. By the time we reach our 50s the abstract has become concrete. We likely know when we’ll be retiring, where to and with who, all with relative certainty. As a result, we’re more likely to save every spare dollar. But of course with retirement savings – like climate change and coral bleaching – we can’t wait until the last minute to act. To that end, our research indicates that psychological distance is a significant predictor of climate change concern and intention to act in ways such as reducing household energy use. We’ve also found that we can increase or decrease psychological distance by framing climate change messages in different ways. When we presented messages designed to increase psychological distance, our participants became less concerned about climate change and more disengaged. When we reduced psychological distance, our participants became more concerned and more willing to take action. Which brings us back to the federal government’s “bleaching” of UN documents. By requesting that references to reef damage be removed from the Unesco report, the government is, intentionally or otherwise, increasing the psychological distance of climate-related threats to the reef. Geographic and cultural distances are increased: climate change might be killing coral but there’s no indication that it’s happening in Australia. Therefore it must be happening elsewhere to people who are different to us. The perception of time, as it relates to psychological distance, is also stretched. Many Australians have heard that climate change will affect our reef, but it’s not happening yet, apparently. Finally, the release of an authoritative climate change report that doesn’t mention the Great Barrier Reef contrasts with other reports that do mention it. This type of inconsistency creates a level of factual uncertainty that only further increases psychological distance. Of course we’ve learned that nearly a quarter of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef is now dead, according to two government agencies. How is it possible for almost a quarter of our reef to die without it triggering unprecedented, national concern and debate?  Sadly, those of us who work with the psychology of climate change don’t find this surprising in the least. Psychological distance is one of the many “dragons of inaction” that we wrestle with, psychological barriers that hinder environmental action. But we also have cause for optimism. Our research suggests that reports of environmental damage that include graphic images can decrease psychological distance, and be an effective mechanism for increasing public concern and engagement. However, for that to occur people must read the articles and see the pictures. And so it becomes apparent that the government’s very own bleaching event is truly masterful, if the goal is to prevent meaningful action on climate change. The dying of the Great Barrier Reef is a national tragedy. In a democracy it is mandatory that the electorate be informed about matters of national significance. In this case the opposite has occurred, and the psychological damage done may already be more profound than most realise."
"Rumbles of thunder have been performing multiple symphonies in the skies recently. Already the UK has clocked up more than its average quota of thunderstorms for a whole year. Normally, the most thunder-prone region – London and the south-east – would expect to have 15 to 19 days when thunder is heard, but by mid-June that number had already been exceeded. However, recognising the sound of thunder isn’t always easy. For more than 100 years, meteorologists across the UK have noted the days on which they hear a rumble of thunder. These “thunder days” make an invaluable contribution to understanding global warming and changes in the weather. But sometimes observers can be conned into thinking they heard thunder, when in fact the rumble was a jet plane passing over, or a firework exploding. With this in mind, Mathew Owens, from the University of Reading, decided to analyse the thunder-days data, to see how good we are at recognising the sound of thunder. He reasoned that an anomalous spike in thunder-days might be expected around Bonfire night or New Years Eve, when fireworks fill the skies. In fact he found the opposite – since the 1980s there has been a dip in reported thunder-days around 5 November – suggesting that observers are assuming fireworks are creating the cacophony, because it is Bonfire night.  “Observers are playing it too safe and should trust more in their ability to discriminate between thunder and fireworks,” writes Owens in the journal Weather. But in an increasingly noisy world, it is hard to distinguish one rumble from the next.  "
"1) Arctic sea ice is melting at a rate that by September could see it beat the record low set in 2012. The maximum extent of sea ice in winter was at a record low, and the extent in May was the lowest for that month ever, by more than 500,000 sq km.  2) Every month this year has been the hottest on record globally for that month. May, data published this week by Nasa revealed, was no exception. Nasa’s dataset, one of three main global surface temperature records, shows February recorded the highest anomaly against long term average temperatures. 3) India recorded its hottest day ever on 19 May. The mercury in Phalodi, in the desert state of Rajasthan, rose to 51C, as a nationwide drought that has affected more than 300 million people marched on, leaving armed guards at dams, and reservoirs well below their usual levels. 4) Alaska, along with the rest of the Arctic, has experienced record-breaking heat. Spring was the warmest on record in the state, with an average temperature of 0C, and the average year-to-date temperature has been 5.5C above the long term average. 5) Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have been breaking records every year for decades, but the size of the margin by which the record is forecast to break the annual record in 2016 is striking and itself a record. The increase for 2016 is expected to be 3.1 parts per million, up from an annual average of 2.1. 6) Australia, no stranger to record-breaking heat, just clocked up its hottest autumn yet. Average temperatures were 1.86C above the average, beating the previous record of 1.64C above average, set in 2005. 7) The Great Barrier Reef, a natural wonder and world heritage site, experienced its worst ever coral bleaching event, as a blob of warm water made its way around the world. An aerial study found that just 7% of the reef escaped bleaching, which can lead to the coral permanently dying."

"Support for strong action on climate change is at its highest level since 2008, with much sought after uncommitted voters showing the strongest support, according to Galaxy polling commissioned by the Climate Institute. Despite that, voters were dissatisfied with both Labor and Coalition policies, with only 17% saying the Coalition had a credible climate plan and only 20% saying Labor did.  Those findings fitted with an assessment of the main parties’ policies conducted by the Climate Institute, which concluded the Coalition plan was “currently inadequate” and Labor’s merely had “pathways to credibility”. They found the Greens’ and Glenn Lazarus Team’s policies on climate change were the strongest and most credible. Concern about climate change rose significantly since the last federal election, from 53% in 2013 to 72% in 2016. Concern among Coalition voters jumped the most, from 41% in 2013 to 62% now. But uncommitted voters were the most likely to be concerned about climate change, with 76% of them either “fairly” or “very” concerned, according to the national polling of 1,100 people. Almost two-thirds of respondents agreed Australia should be a world leader in finding solutions to climate change, up from 52% in 2012. Only 23% thought Australia should wait for other countries before strengthening its post-2020 emissions targets. And 60% of voters thought delaying action would cause shocks to jobs and energy supplies. The Climate Institute also assessed what they described as the “credibility” of the parties contesting government or they thought were likely to be re-elected to the Senate. Each of the six parties was assessed on the basis of their 2030 emissions reduction targets and their timeframe for achieving net zero emissions. The Climate Institute also looked at the implications for global warming if all countries matched that party’s targets and how Australia would rank on per capita emissions among the G20 if that party’s policies were adopted. The Greens and the Glenn Lazarus Team came out as being ranked equally among G20 nations, with their policies putting Australia eighth among G20 nations and causing a temperature rise of between 1.5C and 2C. The Coalition was at the bottom of parties that had a climate policy, putting Australia at 18th spot among G20 nations and resulting in temperature rises of between 3C and 4C. Labor performed better but wasn’t consistent with keeping warming under 2C and left Australia at 15th among G20 nations. The Nick Xenophon Team came out in the middle, doing better than Labor but not as well as the Greens. The Jacqui Lambie Network was the worst, unable to be properly assessed since they don’t have any targets. John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute, said the polling and assessments showed there was a clear opportunity for government develop constructive climate change and energy policies. “Our research shows that all our political parties need to do more to develop policies that not only build credibility but also build community and investor confidence,” he said. “This is a critical finding, given that both major parties are promising key reviews next year amid greater domestic and international scrutiny.” The Climate Institute called for three policy steps: • Pre 2050 net zero emission objectives, with credible emission reduction pathways and regular independent processes of review. • Economic and community strategies to manage the transition to decarbonisation. • Integration of climate risks and opportunity assessments into core decision making. “After 10 turbulent years, Australian business and the voting public have tapped into international trends about the economic and environmental benefits of climate action,” Connor said. “Our main political parties urgently need to catch up.”"
"On a beautiful barren stretch of the Scottish Highlands, just south of Inverness, spin 20 brand new 3,300-kilowatt wind turbines. The second these industrial-scale turbines came on stream last month, all Mars UK’s factories and offices became immediately zero carbon.  The US confectionary giant negotiated with the UK arm of Eneco, the Dutch utility behind the Moy Wind Farm, to buy 85% of the turbines’ output over the next 10 years. The move follows similar steps in the US, where Mars says its operations are carbon neutral thanks to a deal to buy power from a large-scale wind farm in Mesquite Creek, Texas.   The two deals – known generically as renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) – represent a new trend in the drive by big business to go green. Adobe, BT Group, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, Nestlé, Novo Nordisk, Salesforce, and Unilever are just a handful of the large corporations now using the mechanism to meet their ambitions of going fully renewable.  On the face of it, such deals appear all upside. The buyer gets to boast about their green credentials, while the developer locks in a high-profile, reliable corporate customer for 10 years or more.  So are these deals as good as they look? Or should customers and the public take corporate claims to carbon neutrality with a pinch of salt?  Emily Farnworth of the non-profit Climate Group is quick to defend both the business and environmental rationale behind long-term purchase agreements. That’s not entirely surprising: it’s her job. She is campaign director for RE100, an initiative launched 18 months ago to encourage multinational companies to commit to using 100% renewable energy. PPAs represent the “simplest route” to doing so, as one RE100 signatory concedes. The green credentials of PPAs appear relatively robust. Unlike carbon credits, where companies essentially pay to offset their ongoing use of dirty energy, renewable PPAs genuinely result in a switch to the clean stuff. Companies still buy from the conventional grid, but they receive green certificates that prove that the electricity they take from the grid equates to the zero-carbon energy put in by the likes of Eneco.  So far RE100 has 65 signatories to the 100% renewable campaign, with more to be announced at the end of this month. But if PPAs offer such a winning formula, why aren’t more companies jumping on the bandwagon? Farnworth says it a case of raising awareness and overcoming historical misconceptions about the high cost of renewables.  It’s not quite as straightforward as that, however. On the environment side, there are persistent question marks over double counting. How can consumers be sure that the clean power put into the grid isn’t being “used” by more than one buyer? There are now rules in place “which help clarify where energy comes from and therefore make it easier to claim carbon neutrality,” says Myles McCarthy, director of implementation at the London-based Carbon Trust, a low-carbon advisory group.  A more serious issue is what happens when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind stops blowing? While McCarthy says that power storage is evolving significantly, he concedes that there remains a “slight discrepancy” in the event of such shortfalls.  For multinational companies, supply constraints make a global commitment to going 100% renewable problematic. In some regions of the world, the infrastructure for low-carbon power generation doesn’t yet exist at the required scale. Hence Mars’ carbon-neutral claims are still only on a country-by-country basis. That will need to change if it’s to meet its 2040 goal of 100% renewable energy across its entire operations.  In other, more developed markets, a surge in demand for PPAs could feasibly saturate existing clean energy supply and potentially push up clean energy prices. The competitiveness of renewables could also wobble as governments reduce their support for the renewables sector, such as the UK’s decision to abolish the Renewables Obligation in April next year.  Arguably, the biggest issue is not around the technicalities of PPAs but the ambition that underpins them. Not all PPAs suppose a 100% conversion to renewables. Indeed, many of the early movers set themselves fairly modest targets, says Gordon Edge, director of policy at the trade association RenewablesUK. As a consequence, some corporates find that they are achieving their renewable targets well ahead of time.  Last month, for instance, Dow Chemicals nearly doubled its 2025 renewables goal to 750MW after hitting its initial 400 MW target in just one year. The quick success follows an agreement by the US chemicals giant with power producer NRG Energy to purchase output from two of its wind farms in Texas. Because PPAs potentially enable companies to become 100% renewable at the stroke of a pen, there’s a theoretical danger that they might slow down on energy efficiency measures too.  One sign of true ambition would be to build renewable facilities on-site, rather than outsourcing the responsibility. Lego, Ford and Ikea are among the few experimenting with this approach. The benefit of doing so is that corporations – as clean power producers themselves – can help their key suppliers and even consumers to begin to cut their own power-related carbon footprint.  So while 100% renewable is certainly a laudable objective and while PPAs can help companies get there, both are interim steps to what should be a wider corporate commitment to greening the world’s energy consumption.

"India will try to join the Paris climate agreement by the end of this year, the Obama administration said Tuesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Barack Obama at the White House, and the two leaders played up their efforts to cooperate on issues of global concern. Stressing their “strong bonds”, Obama said the world’s two largest democracies had “joined forces” to bring about the landmark climate agreement that was reached in Paris last December.  “We discussed how we can as quickly as possible bring the Paris agreement into place, how we can make sure that climate financing that’s necessary for India to be able to embark on its bold vision for solar energy and clean energy that Prime Minister Modi has laid out can be accomplished,” Obama said, alongside Modi after their meeting in the Oval Office. Modi said that the US and India have been cooperating on issues of global concern, including nuclear security, climate change and terrorism. He referred to Obama as “my close friend” and said the two nations would continue working “shoulder to shoulder”. India is the world’s third-largest carbon emitter among nations, after China and the US. The Paris agreement aims to keep the global temperature rise below 2C (3.6F) compared with preindustrial times. The agreement enters into force once 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions have joined it. In a joint statement with the US, India said it would seek to join the climate deal “as soon as possible this year” and had started its domestic process to ratify it. The US, India and dozens of other countries have already signed the deal, the first hurdle in a two-step process, but Modi has been coy about whether India would formally join this year. The US is eager for countries to join quickly because the deal’s carbon-cutting requirements only kick in once a critical mass of polluting nations join. The US, China, Canada, Mexico and Australia have all said they intend to join the agreement within this year. Other joint announcements, though, seemed to illustrate the major challenges in securing concrete progress on climate. Though the two countries said engineering and site development work was starting on six nuclear reactors that US-based Westinghouse Electric Co wants to build in India, there was no agreement about the major unresolved issue: cost and financing. Instead, the countries said only that they had agreed to finish the contractual arrangements by June 2017. The US and India also said they’d agreed to try to use a decades-old ozone-protection treaty to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, refrigerants that are potent greenhouse gases, through an amendment that would also provide funds to help poorer countries implement it. But officials said an actual deal to phase out HFCs wouldn’t come until the parties to the treaty meet in October in Rwanda. This is Modi’s fourth visit to the US since he took office two years ago, and his seventh meeting with Obama. On Wednesday, the Indian leader addresses a joint meeting of Congress. Modi and Obama seem to have forged a bond. When Obama visited India last year, Modi pulled the president into a bear hug as he stepped off Air Force One, and the two leaders have publicly praised each other. India has long felt slighted by the global powers, seeing itself as a powerful, highly educated country that is all-too-often dismissed for its poverty, dirty streets and the lingering power of its caste system. The respect is particularly sweet in Washington. Modi was denied a visa to visit the US in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the western state of Gujarat, where he was then the top official. American officials largely avoided contact with him over suspicions that he was involved in the rioting or did not do enough to stop them, until he became prime minister in the 2014 landslide elections. Modi is on a five-nation tour that has also taken him to Switzerland, Afghanistan and Qatar. After the US, he will visit Mexico."
"After trying in vain to dismantle the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Coalition is now using Labor’s $10bn financing scheme as an election slush fund, throwing its money at the Great Barrier Reef, at “smart cities” and even at the steel industry in South Australia. These announcements left some clean energy sector experts crying foul, saying the government was trying to squeeze the CEFC for every last drop, and defund it by stealth.  That might be the case but the truth could be more mundane. The announcements probably amount to little, leaving the spending pledges bereft of substance – but equally doing little to harm the CEFC. By anyone’s reckoning, the CEFC has been a success. According to its 2015 annual report, it invested $1.4bn, financing projects worth a total of $3.5bn, which would reduce 4.2m tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions annually. And it did all that while making a profit. But under the Tony Abbott, who called the CEFC “Bob Brown’s bank”, the Coalition tried unsuccessfully to abolish it, tried unlawfully to stop it operating, and tried – also possibly unlawfully – to stop it investing in windfarms and small-scale solar. When Turnbull became prime minister he conceded the government had failed to abolish the CEFC but stopped short of giving it his backing. “We do not support government banks performing roles that can be performed by the private sector … yes it has done some good work, the question is whether it is an appropriate use of government money,” he said in question time in October, refusing to concede it played a “crucial” part in Australia’s emissions reduction. But now it is certainly playing a crucial role in Turnbull’s re-election campaign. So far, more than $2bn of the CEFC’s money has been leveraged as election commitments. First Turnbull suggested up to $100m from the CEFC and EFIC (a similar organisation that finances export ventures) could be used to provide a loan for South Australia’s steel industry. Then last week $1bn was carved off for a so-called “reef fund”. And on Monday another $1bn of the CEFC’s money was used to fund Turnbull’s “smart cities” policy. Together with Turnbull’s earlier move to defund the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and take $1bn from the CEFC to make a new Clean Energy Innovation Fund in its place, John Grimes from the Solar Council – Australia’s peak solar industry body – is convinced this is all part of a covert plan to abolish the CEFC. “Their agenda has been very clear all along, to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation,” Grimes said. “What Malcolm Turnbull is doing it is abolishing it by other means.  “He’s making a series of announcements where he’s trying to get kudos … but actually what he’s doing is taking the funding that is essential to push forward the renewable energy projects and help transition the economy, and using them for other purposes.” But without a change to the CEFC Act – which the government hasn’t flagged any intention to pursue – no government decision can stop the CEFC from doing its best to “facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector”. Grimes said that was no comfort, since the Coalition hadn’t promised not to amend the act if it had the numbers after the election. Ariane Wilkinson from Environment Justice Australia said that limiting the scope of what the CEFC could invest in by too much could fall foul of the law – as was suggested could have been the case when the Coalition government tried to stop the CEFC from investing in windfarms. But assuming it stays within the law, and doesn’t try to change the legislation, what do these policy announcements amount to? Probably not much, in the end. Take last week’s reef announcement. The policy was that the CEFC would be directed to invest $1bn into projects that tackled both climate change and water quality issues on the Great Barrier Reef. Jon Brodie is one of Australia’s leading experts on water quality and coral reefs. He’s been involved in writing hundreds of technical reports on the matter and authored a plan for how to improve water quality on the reef. Guardian Australia asked him which of those recommendations could be assisted by money loaned to clean energy projects. “Well, I wouldn’t have thought any of them,” he said. Stuart Bunn is director of the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University. Asked what sorts of projects could be funded with CEFC loans, he replied: “The odd thing is that nothing really leaps to mind.” He said that even if there were water quality projects that could be funded with loans for clean energy projects, they would be futile, since there were very particular locations and farmers that needed to be targeted, and incentive schemes like low-interest loans were unlikely to target those precise spots. Cane farmers – the main target for water quality projects – have also said they’re unsure how the financing could be used. What’s more, it’s probably not really a $1bn fund, in any meaningful sense. A spokesman for the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the fund would provide “up to” $1bn. And we can be sure that, as with all CEFC money, it won’t be spent unless the projects stack up. What’s more, the Coalition has said the fund will be used to fight both climate change and water quality. But despite being asked several times, Hunt’s office has so far refused to answer questions about whether any percentage of the fund will be required to be spent on projects with water-quality co-benefits. In response to that questioning, Hunt’s office said climate change was the biggest long-term threat facing the Great Barrier Reef. But if it was including funding for climate change mitigation as part of a “reef fund”, it might as well claim the full $10bn in the CEFC as part of it. Putting all that together, it looks like the policy isn’t going to drag money out of effective clean energy projects, but equally, it’s unlikely to do anything for the Great Barrier Reef either. The “smart cities” policy funding looks similar. The CEFC already spends money on “smart cities” projects. Financing commercial buildings already happens. In fact commercial buildings are the second biggest sector to receive loans from the CEFC. In 2014 the chief excecutive of the CEFC, Oliver Yates, delivered a detailed presentation on how the CEFC was working to “making cities liveable”. “The CEFC has been playing a role in this space to date,” says Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council. “I’m not sure if this changes things substantially.” But Thornton thinks the directive from the government to focus on clean energy projects in cities will give the CEFC some renewed focus on that sector. “There will be more opportunities and more scope for cities, local councils, building managers etcetera to go down the clean energy path.” And overall, Thornton said the CEFC had so much money to throw around that these limitations on where it could lend its money can spend its money weren’t going to negatively impact the industry. “I think it would be an issue if the CEFC only had a small amount of resources at its disposal but it does have a significant pool of funds to invest and these sorts of directives are within its scope, and I think it helps to give it some focus rather than depleting its funds.” But that is exactly what other groups have picked up as the key problem with the announcement. “This is another politically driven, piecemeal policy that sees us yet again responding to a political need rather than building a decent plan for our future energy needs,” said Claire O’Rourke, national director of Solar Citizens, a group that represents households with rooftop solar. She said these moves distracted from what the CEFC was really designed to do. “The global transition to renewables is already under way. Australia needs a national plan to harness the multibillion-dollar renewables boom and manage the orderly transition to 100% clean renewable power,” she said. “Australia stands to gain an $800bn slice of the global renewable energy investment boom, and we will miss out on jobs, growth and investment if we don’t get on with it now – this is what the CEFC is really for.” The plundering of CEFC funds – using it as an election slush fund – isn’t likely to hurt the clean energy industry much, but it is unlikely to do any good either."
"A group of business and academic leaders have bemoaned the “huge gap” between what experts say ought to be done to decarbonise Australia’s economy and the public’s willingness to accept such a policy. They want Australia’s leaders to restart a conversation after the federal election about the need to transition the economy towards renewable and cleaner energy.  They also say the public may not realise it but a carbon price has already been built into Australia’s economy with the Turnbull government’s decision, at the Paris climate conference last year, to reduce emissions to 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. The Coalition and Labor must stick to that target, they say, so businesses can make the long-term investment decisions that will eventually see coal phased out of Australia’s energy mix. The Australian National University’s leadership forum, held over Monday and Tuesday, convened talks on a range of topics, including the rise of mega-corporations, employment prospects in modern capitalism, and the likelihood of political reform in China. But a session on energy and climate change heard policy experts venting frustration about the state of Australia’s climate change debate. The conversation was led by: Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia; Grant King, the managing director of Origin Energy; Frank Jotzo, the director of Climate Economics; Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies. The session also heard from economists David Gruen and Warwick McKibbin, the chair of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Jillian Broadbent, and the managing director of Australian Ethical Investment, Phil Vernon. They agreed Australia would inevitably decarbonise its economy and it was in everyone’s interest to do so sooner rather than later. There was frustration about the gap between what they knew had to be done, and the public’s willingness to accept certain instruments of climate change policy. They said the public had been too easily spooked by politicians or the media rebranding the discussion of a carbon price – which the public says it wants – as a discussion about a carbon tax.  “Last time we had this discussion with the community, people were bewildered by this,” Westacott said. “So 60% of people said were saying they wanted a price on carbon until someone calls it something else, and then they don’t like it. “So how do we ... cross this divide?” Jotzo said Australia’s experts had failed to convince voters about the need to adapt to climate change because they were using technocratic language. The discussion should start focusing on the reality of what adaptation would mean, he said, starting with an admission that Australia was taking the Paris agreement seriously which means “no more coal in the electricity sector”. “That’s a major transition, and that is the debate that needs to be had with the Australian public,” Jotzo said.  “It’s not about the precise instruments – leave that to the technocrats. It’s about the transition.” King said if the 26% to 28% target from Paris was bedded down, Australia would have a carbon price built into its economy whether the public knew it or not. He hoped this would happen because it would start to phase out coal-fired power stations from the energy mix, a situation he was preparing for. “No one’s set a carbon price but they have set a carbon target,” he said. “We just back-solve [from that] and say what’s the cost of achieving that target? That’s the implied carbon price. “We are permitting and contracting and building utility-scale solar, because we think it’s a very safe decision given all the costs ... [But] our risk is a political risk that the target doesn’t stick. “If we solve the 26 to 28% target and that sticks, if they have bipartisan political commitment at a minimum ... if we solve and we run forward our market-based models against that decision, coal will come out.  “And it has to come out because you cannot hit that 26-28% [target] without substitution of low-emission, effectively renewable [energy]. And when that happens coal economics deteriorate.” Ken Baldwin, director of ANU’s Energy Change Institute, said there were “clear points of difference” between the climate change policies of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens. “However, we’re not hearing anything about it on the airwaves,” he said. “It’s ceased to be a point of discussion.”"
"We’re officially living in a new world. Carbon dioxide has been steadily rising since the start of the Industrial Revolution, setting a new high year after year. There’s a notable new entry to the record books. The last station on Earth without a 400 parts per million (ppm) reading has reached it. A little 400 ppm history. Three years ago, the world’s gold standard carbon dioxide observatory passed the symbolic threshold of 400 ppm. Other observing stations have steadily reached that threshold as carbon dioxide spreads across the planet’s atmosphere at various points since then. Collectively, the world passed the threshold for a month last year. In the remote reaches of Antarctica, the South Pole Observatory carbon dioxide observing station cleared 400 ppm on May 23, according to an announcement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Wednesday. That’s the first time it’s passed that level in 4 million years (no, that’s not a typo). There’s a lag in how carbon dioxide moves around the atmosphere. Most carbon pollution originates in the northern hemisphere because that’s where most of the world’s population lives. That’s in part why carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit the 400 ppm milestone earlier in the northern reaches of the world. But the most remote continent on earth has caught up with its more populated counterparts. “The increase of carbon dioxide is everywhere, even as far away as you can get from civilization,” Pieter Tans, a carbon-monitoring scientist at the Environmental Science Research Laboratory, said. “If you emit carbon dioxide in New York, some fraction of it will be in the South Pole next year.” It’s possible the South Pole Observatory could see readings dip below 400 ppm, but new research published earlier this week shows that the planet as a whole has likely crossed the 400 ppm threshold permanently (at least in our lifetimes). Passing the 400 ppm milestone in is a symbolic but nonetheless important reminder that human activities continue to reshape our planet in profound ways. We’ve seen sea levels rise about a foot in the past 120 years and temperatures go up about 1.8°F (1°C) globally. Arctic sea ice has dwindled 13.4 percent per decade since the 1970s, extreme heat has become more common and oceans are headed for their most acidic levels in millions of years. Recently heat hascooked corals and global warming has contributed in various ways to extreme events around the world. The Paris Agreement is a good starting point to slow carbon dioxide emissions, but the world will have to have a full about face to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change. Even slowing down emissions still means we’re dumping record-high amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. That’s why monitoring carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa, the South Pole and other locations around the world continues to be an important activity. It can gauge how successful the efforts under the Paris Agreement (and other agreements) have been and if the world is meeting its goals. “Just because we have an agreement doesn’t mean the problem (of climate change) is solved,” Tans said."
"“Universal support” is needed from businesses across the world to tackle global warming, the United Nations climate chief says. Business leaders and politicians are meeting in London to discuss how to implement the first comprehensive climate agreement, secured at UN talks in Paris in December, to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid dangerous temperature rises.  The two-day Business and Climate Summit will look at how companies can continue with leadership that has already seen firms take steps such as pledging to source 100% clean energy to transforming their supply chains. In her final speech as the head of the UN’s climate change convention body, Christiana Figueres, will say that in the run-up to the Paris talks an extraordinary alliance of business and investors committed to “ambitious” action on driving down emissions. But she will also warn that “a universal climate agreement of nations also needs universal support from the private sector beyond Europe and North America”, and urge businesses to reach out to those in Africa, Asia and Latin America to build action. Ségolène Royal, French environment minister and president of the talks in Paris, will say that wide-scale use of a price on carbon pollution will help encourage the move towards a clean economy. “Businesses are key for the implementation of the Paris agreement. Many advocate carbon pricing in order to give the right signal to investors and drive the transition towards a low carbon economy, which is very encouraging,” she will say."
" Australia’s coal-fired power stations will face early closure to meet 2030 emissions reduction commitments, according to assumptions made by a government agency that runs the national electricity grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) also found such closures would push wholesale energy prices up, but that would be offset by reduced energy consumption and greater energy efficiency, leaving consumers’ energy bills relatively unaffected.  The findings come from the Aemo’s annual 20-year forecast for the country’s electricity consumption, released on Thursday. Since the last version of the report in 2015, Australia signed an agreement in Paris, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to up to 28% below 2005 levels. According to the latest report, the Council of Australian Governments (Coag), which created Aemo, decided the energy sector needed to be consistent with those targets.  But in modelling future energy use, Aemo found the Coalition’s current Direct Action policies would not achieve those reductions, and so made further assumptions about carbon abatement policy required in the electricity sector. The report said “detailed policy measures are yet to be announced”, and so it “assumed the achievement of this target will be supported by energy efficiency trends, electricity pricing trends, and coal-fired generator retirements”. Many environmentalists, thinktanks, academics and even energy giant AGL – which operates some of the country’s biggest coal-fired power plants – have been urging the government to design policy that would force the early closure of coal power stations. Neither the Coalition nor Labor has a policy of early closure, although Labor said it would initiate an “electricity modernisation review” after the election to ensure an orderly transition to renewable energy. The Greens policy is to incrementally close coal power plants, starting with the most polluting ones. According to AGL and other groups, the constant cheap supply of coal power, in addition to being Australia’s biggest producer of carbon emissions, had created an oversupply of electricity, making it hard for renewable energy to enter the market. A Climate Institute report from April found the regulated and orderly closure of coal power plants was needed to avoid major economic disruption in 2030, when the country would need to rush to meet its international commitments. Olivia Kember from the Climate Institute said the assumption was revealing. “It’s a recognition that if you’re going to reduce electricity emissions by that amount, there are only so many ways you can do it,” she said. Kember said it was interesting the market operator had to make such significant assumptions about future policy. “What this points to is a need for more clarity for what kind of changes in the policies and the regulatory framework are going to be necessary to manage the emissions reduction and growth of clean energy in a way that works for everybody,” she said.  The report also found that partly as a result of carbon abatement commitments, energy use would remain roughly stable for the next 20 years, despite a growing population, a growing economy and increasing use of electrical appliances. There would be a slight increase to 2020 due to the liquified natural gas boom in Queensland, where vast amounts of electricity would be used to compress and chill gas, but as rooftop solar and energy efficiency improvements accelerate, electricity use would flatten after that. The Aemo chief executive, Matt Zema, said new and improved appliances were replacing energy-intensive appliances such as halogen lights, plasma televisions, desktop computers and stereos. “Maximum demand is forecast to remain flat across the outlook period, despite increased use and capacity of heating and air conditioning as growth is offset by energy efficiency and rooftop PV.  “Projected energy efficiency savings by the year 2035–36 are expected to total around 27,000 GWh. This translates to an equivalent of close to 15% of current grid-supplied electricity use.”  "
"Barack Obama warned on Saturday that climate change could ravage many of America’s vaunted national parks, criticizing political opponents who “pay lip service” to areas of natural beauty while opposing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. During a visit to Yosemite national park, Obama said climate change was “no longer a threat, it’s a reality”. The first sitting president to visit Yosemite since John F Kennedy in 1962 said the famed glacial valley was already experiencing changes due to rising temperatures. “Here in Yosemite, meadows are drying up, bird ranges are shifting farther northward, mammals are being forced further upslope,” Obama said. “Yosemite’s famous glacier, once a mile wide, is almost gone. We are also facing longer, more expensive wildfire seasons. “Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier national park, no more Joshua trees in Joshua Tree national park. Rising seas can destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and at some point could even threaten icons like the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. That’s not the America I want to pass on to the next generation.” According to the National Parks Service, which marks its centenary in August, many fragile ecosystems are “in danger of disappearing forever”. The service said glaciers could be completely gone from Glacier national park by 2020, park facilities in Alaska are sinking due to thawing permafrost and archaeological sites are under threat from sea level rise. Obama said America’s protected landscapes are “the envy of the world”. But the president also hit out at the climate change position of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has said he is in favour of clean air but has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord and has disparaged mainstream climate science as a “hoax invented by the Chinese”. Obama said: “We can’t treat it like it’s someone else’s problem, it shouldn’t lead to careless suggestions that we don’t get serious about carbon emissions or that we scrap an international treaty that we spent years putting together to deal with this. “This park belongs to all of us, this planet belongs to all of us. It’s the only one we’ve got. We can’t pay lip service to that notion and then oppose the things required to protect it. We’ve got to do a lot more. There is such a thing as being too late.” Obama’s visit to Yosemite via helicopter caused major congestion in a park already heaving with summer visitors. Yosemite advised people to enter the park either before 8am or after 6pm to avoid the worst of the disruption. All parking, trails and climbing routes in the Lower Yosemite Falls area were shut down to allow Obama, wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia to do some hiking. The trip was greeted mostly with excitement by visitors, however, several holding up signs welcoming the Obamas and one person even pinning an invite on a bulletin board to the first family to enjoy s’mores by the campfire. French tourist Pauline Richard said: “It’s quite a good surprise. We are pretty excited. He’s quite popular [in France]. I would say he’s more popular than our president.” Yosemite has reported visitor numbers that are 20% up on last year’s record total, amid an effort by the federal government to get more people into national parks. Fourth-graders are now given free passes but Obama said more needed to be done to connect Americans to the natural world. “We’ve got kids all across the country who never see a park,” he said. “There are kids who live miles from here who never see this. We’ve got to change that.  “I remember being an 11-year-old kid, I remember the first time I saw a moose in a lake. The first time I saw a bear and her cub. That changes you, you’re not the same after that.” Obama also mentioned that his administration has protected 265m acres of land – more than any other presidency. The unilateral declaration of national monuments has generally proved popular among the public but is controversial with some Republicans, who claim that more land needs to be opened up for mining and agriculture, rather than economic development through outdoor pursuits."
"The Victorian government has revealed renewable energy targets that would see 25% of the state’s electricity generated by renewable energy by 2020, saying investors have “lost faith” in the national target. Ernst and Young and the Climate Council released a report on Wednesday that said 50% renewable electricity by 2030 would boost employment by almost 50% more than the current trajectory towards 34% renewables by 2030.  Currently, about 14% of Victoria’s electricity comes from renewable sources. Victoria’s minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the target would be raised to 40% by 2025, as she made the announcement at the Ararat windfarm on Wednesday. She said it was anticipated that by 2025 up to 5400 megawatts of new large-scale renewable energy capacity would have been built in Victoria, representing an estimated $2.5bn of investment. About 4,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector would be created during the expected peak year of construction in 2024, she said, and there would be a roughly 12% reduction in electricity sector greenhouse emissions by 2034-35. “Investors have lost faith in the national target but we are restoring the confidence needed to invest,” D’Ambrosio said. The premier, Daniel Andrews, said that the world was shifting to renewable energy and that Victorians expected their government to do the same. “It creates jobs, drives growth and protects our environment, and Victorians want to be at the forefront of that,” he said. Andrews also announced an auctions scheme under which project developers would compete to be the lowest cost provider and successful bidders would be given long-term contracts to support their projects, providing certainty for investors. Separate auctions will be held for large-scale solar projects and will begin in early 2017. The chief executive of Environment Victoria, Mark Wakeham, said the ACT government successfully ran similar auctions to guarantee the construction of renewable energy projects. “Across the whole country, the renewable energy industry was damaged by the [Coalition] government’s slashing of the federal renewable energy target,” he said.  “This is the kick-start we need for new projects and job creation across Victoria.” The targets will be enforced in legislation expected to be introduced into parliament later this year and form a key part of Victoria’s renewable energy action plan, also to be released later this year. The national coordinator of the Australian Wind Alliance, Andrew Bray, said a single windfarm project could “regenerate an entire region”. “Windfarms create jobs and attract new investment in the parts of our country that need them most,” he said. “Workers lost their jobs, and businesses were harmed by attacks under the Abbott government. The industry is finally turning a corner, and communities around Australia are impatient to see new projects get up in their region.”"

"If the bleaching continues on the Great Barrier Reef, tourists say they will pack their bags and go elsewhere, taking with them an estimated $1bn a year and costing 10,000 jobs in regional Queensland, according to a new poll. The majority of Chinese tourists, and about a third of UK and US tourists, said if severe bleaching continues, and “some of the reef dies completely,” they would be more likely to visit somewhere other than Australia, according to the online polling of more than 4,000 people commissioned by the Australia Institute If they did visit Australia, 63% of Chinese, 42% of US and 37% of UK tourists said they’d visit somewhere other than the Great Barrier Reef. Similarly, 37% of Australian tourists said the same thing. Among the international tourists, 63% said they had heard about the bleaching but most still thought the reef was in good shape. While 53% of Australians thought the reef was in poor or very poor condition, only 14% of Chinese tourists did. Meanwhile, 33% of US and 43% of UK tourists thought the reef was in poor or very poor condition. If bleaching continued, and the surveys accurately reflected what tourists would do, the Australia Institute calculated it would mean the regions adjacent to the reef would miss out on more than one million tourists a year – almost a third of the total numbers. This could mean losses of $931m, leading to 10,0000 job losses, the report authors found. “While there has been lots of talk about the potential tourism impacts of coral bleaching, this is the first time anyone has gone to our key tourism markets and asked them what they might do if we aren’t able to better protect the reef,” said the executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist. “The Chinese market is particularly sensitive, with 55% more likely to visit another country. Among Chinese people who travel regularly, this rate is even higher, up to 65%. Chinese tourists are attracted by Australia’s relatively clean environment, so they respond strongly to changes in that perception.” In 2016, 93% of individual reefs along the Great Barrier Reef experienced bleaching and 22% of the coral died. It was the worst bleaching event in the reef’s history. Scientists found it was virtually impossible without climate change, and the conditions that caused it would be average within 20 years. The Guardian revealed in May that the Australian government was so concerned about how climate change’s impact the reef could hit tourism that it intervened to have every mention of Australia and the reef scrubbed from a Unesco report. Similarly, when the government agencies revealed that 22% of the reef had died, they released the figures with a press release that focused on dispelling perceived exaggerations of the damage, and on the ability of coral to recover, rather than on the magnitude of the environmental disaster. Oquist said the government needed to take serious action on climate change and stop new coalmines if it want to protect the reef. “Fortunately, the Queensland economy is modern and diverse,” Oquist said. “Four in five people work in service industries, while only 1% work in the coal industry. Policies such as a moratorium on new coalmines can be implemented with a minimal effect on the Queensland economy.”"

"British people backing a leave vote in the EU referendum are almost twice as likely to believe that climate change does not have a human cause, according to a new poll. Brexiters are more likely to think the media exaggerates how settled climate science is; distrust scientists; have sympathy with creationism; oppose onshore windfarms and support fracking. The findings come in a ComRes poll of 1,618 people evenly split between those intending to vote out and in. Many prominent leave campaigners are either openly opposed to action on climate change or have cast doubt on man’s role in it, including former chancellor Nigel Lawson, former environment secretary Owen Paterson and columnist Matthew Ridley.  Boris Johnson once penned a column suggesting snow on his windowsill means we should consider believing climate sceptics over governments and leading scientists across the world, but has not openly denied manmade climate change. In the ComRes poll published on Thursday, 18% of leave voters and 10% of remain votes disagreed with the statement: “human activity is causing climate change.” Some 3% of leave voters said they didn’t know, versus 1% of remain voters. The world’s top authority on climate science, the UN’s IPCC, says it is 95% certain that humans are responsible for global warming in recent decades. Among leave voters, 68% agreed that “the media exaggerates the level of scientific agreement there is on human activity causing climate change”, compared to 52% of remain voters. But several studies have shown around 97% of climate scientists agree climate change is manmade. The polling also found 44% of leavers thought scientists had too much influence on British politics against 25% of remainers, and 46% of leavers agreed that people who question the theory of evolution “have a point” compared to 36% of remainers. On energy, leave voters were more likely to oppose onshore windfarms in rural areas (36% versus 21% of remain voters), and more likely to support increasing the use of fracking to extract shale gas (40% versus for 35%). “It’s disheartening to see that so many people still refuse to acknowledge clear scientific knowledge, thereby undercutting the efforts of Britain’s world-leading scientists,” said Assaad Razzouk, CEO of cleantech firm Sindicatum Sustainable Resources, who commissioned the poll. “Climate change denialism and anti-evolutionism are obvious hindrances to productive discussions about the future of Britain, Europe and indeed the world.”  "
"Climate change is disrupting the seasonal behaviour of Britain’s plants and animals, with rising temperatures having an impact on species at different levels of the food chain, new research shows. The result could be widespread “desynchronisation” between species and their phenological events – seasonal biological cycles such as breeding and migration – that could affect the functioning of entire ecosystems, according to the large-scale study published this week in the journal Nature.  It also warns of changes in the key seasonal interactions between species that could disrupt relationships between predators and prey and affect their breeding success and survival.  The study, led by Dr Stephen Thackeray from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in collaboration with 17 other organisations, analysed 10,003 long term phenological data sets of 812 of the UK’s marine, freshwater and land-based plant and animal species collected between 1960-2012 on everything from fish spawning to plant flowering. The data was split into three levels of the food chain and spatially matched with local temperature and rainfall data, and models of seasonal timing and climatic variables, to show the variation in which species at different “trophic” levels are sensitive climate change. “This is the largest study of the climatic sensitivity of UK plant and animal seasonal behaviour to date. Our results show the potential for climate change to disrupt the relationships between plants and animals, and now it is crucially important that we try to understand the consequences of these changes,” Thackeray said. He said the findings highlighted the importance of managing ecosystems within a “safe operating space” that considered the likely impacts of projected climate change. The study shows that seasonal events - including flowers blooming, leaves falling or animals hibernating - are generally more sensitive to temperature rises brought about by climate change than to changes in precipitation or snowfall. But the “direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity” varies significantly among species in different groups or levels of the food chain, the study showed. Secondary consumers (such as predatory birds, fish and mammals) were consistently less sensitive to climate variations than species at the base of the chain (such as seed-eating birds and herbivorous insects), which were twice as sensitive to temperature.   Using estimates, the study predicted that by 2050, these primary consumers will have shifted their seasonal timing by more than twice as much as species at other levels of the food chain — an average of 6.2 days earlier compared to 2.5­­–2.9 days earlier. Many long-term ecological changes have been attributed to climate change, and shifts in the seasonal timing of reproduction and migration have been well-documented. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that in recent decades, many plant and animal species have moved their range, changed numbers or shifted their seasonal activities as a result of warmer temperatures. The UK has a rich history of biological recording by scientists and “citizen scientists”, with data stretching to 1736 when Robert Marsham, the “founding father of phenology”, began recording the first signs of spring. Almost 50,000 people across the UK are now involved with the annual Nature’s Calendar survey, coordinated by the Woodland Trust, which provided the data the new study analysed. Co-author Dr Deborah Hemming, from the Met Office, said: “By quantifying the relationships between these phenological records and climate data across the UK, we identify many phenological events that are extremely sensitive to climate variations. These provide ideal early indicators, or sentinels, for monitoring and responding to the impacts of climate variability and change on nature.” Co-author Sian Atkinson, senior conservation advisor with the Woodland Trust, said: “This piece of research demonstrates how very valuable such records are in helping us to build a picture of the likely impacts of climate change for our wildlife.” Early spider orchids and solitary miner beesThe solitary miner bee (Andrena nigroaenea) has been found to be more affected by climate change than the early spider orchid that it pollinates. Although both orchids and bees are both affected by temperature rises, they have a greater impact on the bees, the females of which emerge earlier, meaning that the males are less likely visit the orchids for pseudocopulation. Oak buds and winter mothsResearch has shown that an increase in spring temperatures without a decrease in the incidences of freezing spells in winter leads to poor synchronicity between the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) caterpillars and the oak tree (Quercus robur) buds on which they feed. Cuckoos and their host speciesWhile the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) has only advanced its migration slightly in response to earlier springs, many of its host species (the nests of which the cuckoo lays its eggs in) have begun to migrate much earlier, and are arriving at the breeding grounds well before the cuckoos."
"Few papal proclamations have reverberated more strongly throughout the world than Pope Francis’s encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si’. The anniversary of this clarion call to protect the environment comes as Australia’s election is in full swing and, in terms of its message, the contrast could not be greater. Released exactly a year ago, the encyclical was part of a deluge of statements from the major faith traditions in the leadup to the Paris climate agreement.   Today diverse Australian religious leaders note that Australia was a signatory to that historic agreement, but they ask: where are the policies to match?  In an open letter, they say the tragic bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef should be a wake-up call, yet new coalmines were approved within weeks of the Paris agreement. The harsh reality is that both sides of politics are committed to the continuation of coal and gas mining. The realities of global warming are being felt more painfully by the year. Polls show there is strong electoral support for climate action and now Australia has international obligations. In the meantime, our national emissions keep rising and climate policy scarcely rates a mention in election debates. We know why. Both sides of politics have overly close relationships with the fossil fuel industry, and this has a profoundly distorting effect on our democracy. The common good is being sacrificed for political self-interest.  We have a stark choice before us concerning the future of the planet and its peoples. On one side there are civil society, innovators in low-carbon technologies and socially responsible investors. These are working for a transformation of our economies which will protect our life-sustaining ecosystems.  On the other side is sheer inertia, our collective addiction to fossil fuels and industries which are fixated on continuing as usual, regardless of the long-term costs to people and the environment. They have used their wealth to gain political influence and fund climate skepticism and denialism. As Pope Francis says in paragraph 54, “There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected.”  At the coming election, the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change calls on political leaders to rise above self-interest, and voters to let their voices be heard for the well-being of the planet and future generations. The protection of the global commons must be our highest priority. The need for action can no longer be postponed. Australia needs to urgently transition the economy away from fossil fuels to one which is broadly based, innovative and sustainable. We need to declare a moratorium on any new coal, oil or gas mining and expansions of existing mines. It is time to end subsidies and assistance to fossil fuel industries.  We need commitments to large scale renewables projects and incentives for citizens to rapidly escalate the take-up of renewable energy. A rapid transition would not only meet our environmental responsibilities, it would also contribute to a stronger economy now that mining is in structural decline. Renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and they create many more jobs.  We need restructuring plans to ensure mining communities are not left behind as Australia transitions from a fossil fuel-based economy to one powered by renewable energy.  Finally, Australia should restore trust internationally by contributing new money, not money from the overseas aid budget, to Climate Finance for developing countries. We are a relatively wealthy nation so we have the capacity.  Pope Francis drew the world’s attention to the “urgent challenge to protect our common home” (para. 13). Leaders of the various faith traditions are speaking with one voice: now is the time to act!  The Rt Rev Prof Stephen Pickard, executive director of Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture, Charles Sturt University Thea Ormerod, president of Australian Religious Response to Climate Change"
