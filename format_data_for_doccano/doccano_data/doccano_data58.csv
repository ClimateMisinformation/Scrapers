"Donald Trump has said the United States could re-enter the Paris climate change agreement – and that he would have taken a “tougher stand” in Brexit negotiations than Theresa May. The US president said his country could join the international accord if it had a “completely different deal” but called the existing agreement a “terrible deal” and a “disaster” for the US. In remarks on Brexit that will add to the pressure on the prime minister, Trump said he “would have negotiated it differently” and that he had “a lot of problems” with the European Union, warning of a trade battle between the US and the bloc. He also said that the US would look to strike a “great” trade deal with the UK as soon as EU restrictions ended and the UK could open talks on new trading agreements. Trump made the comments in an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV, which was broadcast on Sunday night. In a preview of the interview released on Friday,  showed Trump said he was prepared to apologise for retweeting inflammatory videos posted by the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First. He also told Morgan he had “tremendous respect for women”; often posted on social media from his bed; and had not received an invitation to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. He said he was happy for the couple – despite Morgan noting that Markle had described Trump as a divisive misogynist. The US president met with global condemnation when he announced in June 2017 that the US was pulling out of the climate agreement. The landmark treaty was signed by 195 nations after intense negotiations in 2015, with countries making voluntary pledges to cut carbon emissions in an attempt to restrict an increase in global temperatures to less than 2C this century. Trump said in the ITV interview that he was a “believer in clean air and clean water” but the Paris agreement would have been a disaster for the US. However, despite initially saying he was “completely out” of the accord, Trump said there could be a way back for the US. “First of all, it was a terrible deal for the US. If they made a good deal there’s always a chance we’d get back. But it was a terrible deal for the US. It was unfair to the US,” he said. “I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful … I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, with that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal. “As usual, they took advantage of the US. We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I’d go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel [Macron]. I would love to, but it’s got to be a good deal for the US.” Asked if he believed in climate change, Trump said: “There is a cooling, and there’s a heating. I mean look, it used to not be climate change, it used to be global warming. That wasn’t working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records. They’re at a record level.” Trump’s comments about Brexit will add to the pressure on May amid growing rumours of discontent in the Conservative party over her approach. “Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn’t negotiate it the way it’s negotiated,” Trump said. “But I have a lot of respect for your prime minister, and I think they’re doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude. “I think I would have said that the EU is not cracked up to what it’s supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out. I have a lot of problems with the EU.” The US president described the relationship between his country and the EU as a “very unfair situation”, adding: “We cannot get our product in. It’s very, very tough. Yet, they send their product to us – no taxes, very little taxes. It’s very unfair. I’ve had a lot of problems with EU, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint.” Trump was also asked in the interview to speak out in defence of women and clarify previous remarks that have provoked a backlash against the president. “Well, I think we have to evolve,” he said. “If we don’t evolve, there’s something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women.” Asked if he was a feminist, Trump said: “I wouldn’t say I’m a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I’m for women, I’m for men, I’m for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it, and they have to win. Women are doing great, and I’m happy about that.” Trump told Morgan that he wrote his own tweets, sometimes when lying in bed. “Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, and perhaps sometimes at breakfast, or lunch, or whatever. But generally speaking, during the early morning or during the evening, I can do that. But if I’m very busy during the day … and I’ll sometimes just dictate out something really quickly, and I’ll give it to one of my people to put it on.”"
"Over the past decade, coal has been increasingly replaced by cheaper, cleaner energy sources. US coal power production has dropped by 44% (866 terawatt-hours [TWh]). It’s been replaced by natural gas (up 45%, or 400 TWh), renewables (up 260%, or 200 TWh), and increased efficiency (the US uses 9%, or 371 TWh less electricity than a decade ago).  In other words, of the 866 TWh of lost coal power production, 46% was picked up by natural gas, 43% by increased efficiency, and 23% by renewables.  While the shift away from coal is a positive development in slowing global warming by cutting carbon pollution, as Joe Romm has detailed for Climate Progress, research indicates that shifting to natural gas squanders most of those gains. For example, a 2014 study published in Environmental Research Letters found that when natural gas production is abundant, it crowds out both coal and renewables, resulting in little if any climate benefit. Part of the problem is significant methane leakage from natural gas drilling. ...abundant gas consistently results in both less coal and renewable energy use […] the quantity of methane leaked may ultimately determine whether the overall effect is to slightly reduce or actually increase cumulative emissions […] only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future emissions from US electricity generation … We conclude that increased natural gas use for electricity will not substantially reduce US GHG emissions, and by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies, may actually exacerbate the climate change problem in the long term. Similarly, another 2014 study found that based on the latest estimates of methane leakage rates from natural gas drilling, replacing coal with natural gas provides little in the way of climate benefits. Though it’s been touted as a ‘bridge fuel’ to span the gap between coal and renewables, this research suggests natural gas isn’t significantly better than coal in terms of global warming effects, and thus may not be suitable for that purpose. The ‘bridge’ doesn’t appear to achieve its goal of steadily cutting our greenhouse gas emissions. California has been a national leader in clean energy. The state generates very little of its electricity from coal, but natural gas does supply more than a third of the state’s power. A quarter is generated by renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal plants, and another 10% comes from hydroelectric dams, on average. In 2017, renewables’ share increased by about 10%, displacing natural gas in the process. In fact, California has an excess of natural gas power generation capabilities. Some natural gas plants are still essential for ensuring local grid reliability, but in many cases, clean energy resources like a combination of solar and storage can meet reliability needs. In one recent example, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ordered Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to procure energy storage (batteries) or “preferred resources” (renewables or increased efficiency and conservation) to meet a local reliability need in northern California. The order stemmed from an issue with a “peaker” natural gas plant (so-called because they switch on to meet high, peak electricity demand) operated in northern California. The operator (Calpine) was concerned that the plant was no longer economical, because it’s too infrequently used due largely to an abundance of renewable power. The contract they could receive for providing generation capacity to ensure grid reliability would not be high enough to cover costs to maintain the plant.  Instead of bidding their plant into the program overseen by the CPUC to ensure local reliability, Calpine went directly to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and requested a “reliability must-run resource” contract, which is a much higher payment than they would have received through the CPUC program. CPUC decided instead to require PG&E to fill the local reliability need with cleaner alternatives. The costs of renewable energy and battery storage have fallen so fast that the clean alternatives might now be cheaper than gas.  In another example, a proposed natural gas peaker plant in Oxnard, California was rejected when it was shown that the CAISO was using outdated battery storage costs from 2014. Given how quickly those prices have fallen, they could now potentially be competitive with natural gas peaker costs. The redundancy and potential replacement of natural gas with cleaner alternatives extends far beyond these examples. Most electrical service providers in California are now required to develop integrated resource plans. These are electric grid planning documents that outline how the utilities will meet a number of California’s goals, including a 40% reduction in carbon pollution below 1990 levels and 50% electricity production from renewable sources by 2030. Meeting these goals will require replacing non-critical natural gas plants with renewable power. And California is already installing battery storage systems at record pace. Tesla, AES Energy Storage, and Greensmith Energy Partners have all installed large battery storage facilities in California within the past year. Within 4 years, batteries are projected to be as cheap as natural gas “peakers,” and consistently cheaper with 10 years.  It’s important to bear in mind that power plants built today can continue to operate for decades to come. The decisions we make for today’s grid are long-lasting. That’s why there are similar pushes from groups in Michigan, Oregon, Connecticut, North Carolina, and South Carolina for utilities to scrap plans for new natural gas plants and instead consider cleaner and potentially cheaper renewable alternatives. Renewables also don’t face the uncertainty associated with fluctuating natural gas prices. Of course, were there a national price on carbon pollution, renewables and battery storage would win in the marketplace even sooner. As it stands, natural gas prices don’t reflect the costs that we incur from the climate change caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, as Union of Concerned Scientists senior energy analyst Laura Wisland put it,  Fortunately, rapidly falling costs are already making renewables and battery storage cost-competitive with natural gas, and cheaper than coal. If we’re going to succeed in avoiding the most dangerous climate change consequences, that transition away from all fossil fuels and towards clean energy can’t happen soon enough."
"As humans continue to emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, the world continues to warm. We see that warming everywhere – in the atmosphere, in the oceans, with rising sea levels, and melting ice. But while we know conclusively that humans are causing the warming, an equally important question is, “so what?” Really, we want to know the consequences of warming so that we can make informed decisions about what to do about it. We really have only three choices: mitigate, adapt, or ignore and suffer the consequences. A very new study was just published that helps answer this question of “so what?” The research was conducted by lead author Lorenzo Alfieri (European Commission – Joint Research Centre, Italy), Richard Betts (University of Exeter and Met Office, UK), and their colleagues.  In the study, the authors used what are called Impact Models to assess the risks of large-scale flooding. They focused their attention on Europe partly because there is a lot of hydrological information there, flood reporting is easily available, and predictions of future climate there are plentiful. The authors compared estimates of flood risk in Europe from three recent case studies; their comparison incorporated changes to future climate, expected damage, and population that will be affected in the flooding zones.  I think of this as a three-part study. First, the authors obtained climate projections for Europe using state-of-the-art climate models. Next, they input the future climate into calculations that quantify flood risk and the impacts. Last, they compared the results that they obtained from their different damage calculation algorithms. The authors looked for areas where the calculations agreed or disagreed with each other. At the end of the day, they wanted to answer two key questions: 1. Is it possible to identify trends that are consistent among the models to help Europe prepare for changes to flood risk? 2. Are there differences in the models and if so, why? I communicated with Professor Betts who told me: Our results give the clearest picture yet of climate change increasing the risk of flooding. We did two new sets of model calculations and compared them with a third set from previous work. With all three methods, the result is higher flood risk in Western and Central Europe under a warmer climate, even at just 1.5 degrees C global warming.  Lead author, Lorenzo added,  In support to Richard’s statements, the strength of our results comes from the variety of climate projections, methods and models included in this comparison work. The three studies we have considered cover a wide range of variability in projections of flood impacts, thanks to the use of 11 independent climate scenarios, 11 hydrological models, 3 inundation models and 2 impact models. Nevertheless, they all agree on a significant increase in flood risk in most European countries, at all global warming levels.  So where did the models agree and where did they disagree? The answer is shown in the figure below from the paper. Red colors signify agreement between the models on an increasing flood risk, and green indicates agreement on a reduction of flood risk. Light colors and white indicate disagreement on future projections. The left-most column corresponds to temperature increases of 1.5°C, the middle column is for 2°C temperature increases, and the right is for 3°C increases. In summary, the models all agree that flood risk is increasing and will increase for Western and Central Europe.  This means the researchers are quite certain regarding increased risks in the central and western parts of Europe but less certain about what will happen in the east. But the authors went a step further; they calculated the expected economic damage from future flooding for the three different temperature increases. They found that regardless of which model was used, there will be significant economic damage (in the range of tens to hundreds of billions of Euros per year) in the warming future. They also showed that the population affected in Europe by future flooding will grow significantly in the future. Roughly estimated, 500,000 to 1 million people are expected to be affected by flooding in the future climate. What I like about this study is it tries to tackle the problem of quantifying a cost of climate change. We know humans are warming the planet. What we really want to know is what the effect is. Only by comparing costs of action to costs of inaction can we make wise decisions. So far, the research is telling us that it is much wiser to take action now to reduce warming (mitigation) than just ignore greenhouse gases and try to adapt to a harsh future climate.  Studies like this give lie to people who claim that it is too expensive to take action on climate change. What this study shows is it may be too expensive to do nothing."
"The Edinburgh to Glasgow railway line and five others in Scotland have been affected by landslides and flooding, leading to delays and cancellations. Landslides took place on Wednesday along two commuter lines, including the main route between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh, plus Glasgow Central to Carlisle and the Newcastle line via Dumfries. The latest landslip led to the closure of the heavily used Edinburgh to Glasgow line near Winchburgh in West Lothian, forcing ScotRail to lay on replacement buses. The incidents followed the closure of the West Highland line north of Fort William, after a train to Mallaig became stuck in a heavy landslide on Monday. Trains from Glasgow Central to Carlisle and Newcastle via Dumfries were delayed on Wednesday morning after a landslide affected services and the A76 near Kirkconnel, south-east of Kilmarnock.  Flooding near Edinburgh earlier in the day had already delayed trains to and from Glasgow Queen Street, as well as services from Edinburgh to Dunblane and Stirling, while flooding and debris affected signals for trains near Livingston North, affecting services to Helensburgh and Glasgow Central. The problems led to delays during the morning commute. The Scottish Green party said it highlighted the urgent need to prepare for worsening weather brought by climate change. John Finnie, the Scottish Green MSP for the Highlands, said: “Without action, climate change will continue to bring increased risks of this sort, not just to rail lines but also to other infrastructure.” Network Rail, which maintains infrastructure, said it was spending £25m-£30m a year in Scotland on reinforcing hillsides and rock faces, bolstering bridges and strengthening tracks to prepare for extreme weather. Meanwhile, high wind warnings have been extended as Storm Georgina batters the UK, with gusts of up to 90mph (145km/h) possible around the Western Isles.  Met Office yellow warnings for high winds across northern Scotland were extended to 5pm.  A gust of 85mph was recorded on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides on Wednesday morning, while there were 75mph winds at The Needles on the Isle of Wight and on Anglesey.  Forecasters said gusts of 70mph-80mph were likely in northern and western parts of the Highlands."
"Donald Trump has decimated all presidential norms to such a degree that it’s now difficult to feel alarmed or outraged when he inevitably breaks another. It was difficult to raise an eyebrow when the story broke that Trump paid off a porn star to remain silent about their affair, which happened just after his third wife had given birth to his fifth child, because it’s Donald Trump – of course he did. Likewise, when Trump made a number of grossly ignorant and wrong comments about climate change in an interview with Piers Morgan last week, my first reaction was ‘it’s Donald Trump – of course he did.’  But that’s not okay. Donald Trump is the leader of the country most culpable for the existential threat that we’ve created by rapidly changing Earth’s climate. His administration is alone in the world in declaring that we need not worry about that existential threat. We need to hold him to account for his ignorance on this critically important issue and demand better. Trump’s climate comments in the interview were so ridiculously misinformed that even late night comedians were able to debunk them: They’re claims you might expect from a YouTube troll, not the leader of the country that produces some of the best climate science research and data in the world. It would be easy to laugh them off as Trump’s usual buffoonery, but he should be held to a presidential standard. So, to briefly debunk each of these myths: In his State of the Union speech this week, Trump didn’t even mention climate change. His only related comment was that “we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal.” It’s another completely nonsensical statement. There was arguably a ‘war on coal’ (which coal lost), but there’s near-universal support for ‘clean coal’ technologies (those which reduce and capture coal’s various pollutants, most notably carbon dioxide). Does Trump understand the difference? It’s Donald Trump – of course he doesn’t. Trump’s misinformed comments in the Morgan interview extended beyond climate science into the realm of climate policy: I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful … I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, with that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal. Trump may “believe in” clean air and water, but his EPA has taken countless steps to weaken regulations of air and water pollutants. Regardless of what he believes, his administration’s actions are creating dirtier air and water. As for the Paris accord, it could not have been a better deal for America. In the agreement, the US committed to reduce its carbon pollution at approximately the same rate it was already declining. To meet that pledge would simply have required following through with existing American climate policies. Instead, Trump and his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt decided to take every possible step to undo those climate policies. Not only did they repeal the Clean Power Plan – America’s most robust effort to tackle climate change – but they even went so far as to erect posters at EPA buildings gloating about it: EPA has put these posters up at agency buildings. Celebrating regulatory rollbacks pic.twitter.com/vwGHy54oq9 However, even if Trump and Pruitt succeed in increasing American carbon pollution, there would have been no penalties for missing the Paris targets. The agreement was non-binding. In short, America could easily have met its pledges had the Trump administration so desired, but failing to do so carried no concrete consequences. How can a deal get any better than that? The answer is that Paris was a great deal, but Trump campaigned on bluster that every deal entered by the Obama administration was the worst in world history (also see the Iran deal), and thus essentially forced himself to withdraw from those deals. Trump’s claims that he may re-enter the Paris agreement if America gets ‘a better deal’ are nonsensical. While this is all behavior that we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump, that doesn’t make it okay. He may be America’s worst-ever president, but he’s still the leader of one of the world’s most powerful countries, with some of the world’s best scientific resources at his disposal. That his science advisor is effectively Fox News, as Andrew Freedman put it, is unacceptable and dangerous. Americans clearly made a terrible mistake in electing him president (though 61% of voters did realize Trump is unqualified for the job), but it’s a mistake they won’t be able to remedy until 2020. Congress could act as a co-equal branch and pass climate legislation, but Americans put Republicans in charge of that institution as well, and with the exception of the party’s 34 Climate Solutions Caucus members, they’re also content to ignore the existential threat of climate change. However, Americans will have the opportunity to remedy that mistake this November."
"In view of the appalling revelations that the UK has been shipping vast quantities of plastic to China for many years (Editorial, 8 January), would it not be a good idea to have the UK lead once more in something and have genuine recycling plants set up here in the country? I mean genuine plants to process plastic from the UK and the rest of Europe, not just depots for onward reselling as seems to have been the case.  There are initiatives to use such waste plastic in innovative ways. For example there is a small startup company in Scotland, MacRebur, developing ways to reduce the amount of toxic bitumen in asphalt by substituting a proportion of waste plastic into the mix. Surely we should urge government and private industry to build and develop plants to deal with the problem now, before we are knee-deep in bottles?Ian PaulYork  • China’s huge expansion of domestic renewables and $8bn in solar technology exports last year alone is stunning (China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says, theguardian.com, 10 January). I wish we had the same level of vision and drive in the UK government and parliament to follow a similar model. While there has been welcome expansion in offshore wind, solar and onshore wind are stalling as the impact of deep subsidy cuts bite. The vacillation over tidal energy is evidence of another renewable revolution being spurned, allowing our competitors to steal a march on us. This compares markedly with an attitude of bending over backwards to assist overseas operators with billions of pounds in effective subsidy support for new nuclear projects. It is an illogical and irrational energy policy which could drive energy bills up rather than down. Last year was a record one for renewable energy in the UK, with solar and wind combined producing more electricity generation than coal for 315 days of the year, but will it continue as these negative policies begin to bite?   With the urgent need to decarbonise heat, and transport offering other benefits to the economy, let’s see some Chinese-type ambition in all sectors of our low-carbon renewable energy industry to drive an alternative energy revolution.Feargal DaltonConvener, Nuclear Free Local Authorities Secretariat Scotland • We are currently in Veganuary, where people are encouraged to abandon their carnivorous ways and eat a vegan diet for the month of January.

"In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said, The climate is changing. That’s not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100?  Pruitt’s goal is to sow doubt on behalf of his oil industry allies in order to weaken and delay climate policies. Shifting the ‘debate’ toward ‘the ideal surface temperature’ achieves that goal by creating the perception that we don’t know what temperature we should aim for. It’s in line with his boss’ recent ignorant tweet suggesting that “Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.”  I spoke with a number of climate scientists who agreed that to minimize the risks associated with rapid human-caused climate change, from a practical standpoint the ‘ideal temperature’ is as close to the current one as possible. Stefan Rahmstorf, Head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research pointed out that we’re not concerned about specific temperatures; it’s rapid temperature changes that cause problems: Pruitt of course is trying to have a strawman debate, distracting from the fact that not a certain temperature as such is better or worse, but that a change from what we are adapted to is a problem, especially a very rapid change - in either direction, cooling or warming, this causes big disruption.  We should not stray too far away from what we and the currently existing ecosystems have evolved for. That is the optimum, simply because it is what we’re highly adapted to, and any major change is going to be very painful. Texas Tech’s Katharine Hayhoe agreed, noting that human civilization has developed in the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years. There is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that’s the temperature we’ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it’s risen by nearly 1°C and counting.Why do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions. Two-thirds of the world’s largest cities are located within a metre of sea level. What happens when sea level rises a metre or more, as it’s likely to this century? We can’t pick up Shanghai or London or New York and move them. Most of our arable land is already carefully allocated and farmed.  What happens when we can no longer grow the crops we used to, as climate shifts and water becomes more scarce in many subtropical areas? We can’t just take over new land: someone else already owns it. What happens when our water resources diminish or even run out? We can’t take over someone else’s water rights without a war.We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the risks we face today, and threatens the resources we depend on for our future. In fact, Hayhoe specifically answered this question in one of her ‘Global Weirding’ videos for PBS: Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State also pointed out that we’re approaching some critical temperature thresholds. For example, his research has shown that at warmer temperatures, reproduction of malaria-transmitting parasites increases rapidly. There are some absolute temperature thresholds that are important when it comes to agriculture (particularly in tropics), coral bleaching, infectious disease, and heat stress (e.g. the tropics becoming essentially unlivable). So while it’s difficult to say what the “ideal temperature” is, there clearly is a range of temperatures suitable for human civilization and there is a real danger that we’re pushing toward the upper limit of that range. Naomi Oreskes, Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard similarly noted that according to the peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts, we’re already headed into dangerous territory: Of course, there is no ‘ideal’ temperature so we should not accept that framing. We have strong scientific evidence that anything above 2°C is likely to be deeply problematic. Even the roughly 1°C change we have already seen is having measurable, adverse effects. That’s why with the Paris climate accords, every country in the world except the USA has agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably closer to 1.5°C. The targets would be even more aggressive if possible, but as Oreskes noted, we’ve already caused 1°C of global warming, and transitioning away from fossil fuels will take time. From a practical standpoint, 2°C is the best we can plausibly achieve. When speaking with the scientific experts it quickly becomes clear that the ideal response to climate change involves a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Global temperatures are already warming at a rate more than 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. It’s that rapid rate of global warming that poses an existential threat. Species can only adapt so quickly. The longer we wait to slow that dangerously fast climate change, the worse the consequences will be. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration is doing everything it can to delay and weaken efforts to cut carbon pollution. Pruitt isn’t interested in these scientific answers to his question; he’s interested in helping his fossil fuel industry benefactors. He’s one of Oreskes’ Merchants of Doubt, but his time in power will be as finite as Donald Trump’s."
"Nearly half of US military sites are threatened by wild weather linked to climate change, according to a new Pentagon study whose findings run contrary to White House views on global warming.  Drought, wind and flooding that occurs due to reasons other than storms topped the list of natural disasters that endanger 1,700 military sites worldwide, from large bases to outposts, said the US Department of Defense (DoD).   “Changes in climate can potentially shape the environment in which we operate and the missions we are required to do,” said the DoD in a report accompanying the survey.  “If extreme weather makes our critical facilities unusable or necessitates costly or manpower-intensive workarounds, that is an unacceptable impact.” The findings put the military at odds with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on mainstream scientific findings about climate change, including this week during an interview on British television.  Trump has also pulled the United States out of the global 2015 Paris accord to fight climate change.  The Pentagon survey investigated the effects of “a changing climate” on all US military installations worldwide, which it said numbered more than 3,500.  Assets most often damaged include airfields, energy infrastructure and water systems, according to military personnel at each site, who responded to the DoD questionnaire.  John Conger, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Climate and Security in Washington, said the report’s commissioning by Congress showed a growing interest by lawmakers into the risks that climate change poses to national security.  The study was published late last week and brought to public attention this week by the Center for Climate and Security. "
"A major coal power station in Yorkshire will close at the end of September after it failed to secure a government subsidy to provide backup power next winter. Losing out on a capacity market contract sounded the death knell for Eggborough, which supplies power to 2m homes and employs around 170 people, about 130 of whom are expected to be laid off. About 40 will be kept on for decommissioning and demolition. “Already on the ropes, Eggborough missing out on a capacity market contract was the final straw for this once-great power station,” said Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU thinktank. The plant is run by Czech power firm EPH, which bought two of British Gas owner Centrica’s large gas plants last year, and also owns an old power coal plant in Northumberland which it is converting to burn wood.  The firm said Eggborough was no longer economically viable without the support from the scheme, the government’s key insurance policy for keeping the lights on. Adam Booth, managing director at Eggborough Power Ltd, said: “With the age of the plant and the current government’s policy that all UK coal-fired power generation must cease by 2025, Eggborough has been under threat of closure for the past few years.” Prospect union, which has members at the plant, said it was deeply disappointed at the decision. Eggborough has been generating electricity for more than half a century. After it shuts, there will be just six coal plants left in the UK, as Northern Ireland’s last coal plant is also due to close in May after it failed to win a contract in Ireland’s new capacity market. The economics of coal have become increasingly untenable because of a government carbon tax and the relatively low price of gas, causing three plants to shut in 2015.  The government, which has committed to phasing out coal by 2025 to cut carbon emissions, had predicted at least one coal power station would shut this year. The fossil fuel is rapidly dwindling as a source of electricity, providing a third of the UK’s power in January as it did for January 2017. Eggborough’s owners said they are still committed to their aspiration of building a gas plant on the site, which would be capable of powering 2m homes. But one green group said it would be crazy to swap one fossil fuel for another. “Curtains for coal must not be a free pass to switch these plants to giant gas units,” said Dominique Doyle at environmental law firm ClientEarth. The capacity market is crucial for the economics of coal and gas plants, and this week’s auction saw £34.7m of contracts awarded to operators for next winter.  Three quarters of those winners were for gas plants, including big-six firm SSE’s Peterhead, which is Scotland’s last fossil fuel power station. It had been threatened with closure last year after missing out on a contract but will now continue operations."
"Suganshi Ropia, 21, is a law student from Pune, India I try to keep in touch with news related to climate change, and am particularly interested in environmental law. My compulsion to do something positive about climate change was one of the reasons I decided to study law. When I read the opinion piece Civil disobedience is the only way left to fight climate change, by Kara Moses, in spring 2016, it crystallised my feelings about the responsibility we have as a community of humans to do more.  The article made me realise that having a legal framework in place is not the only solution to a problem this complex. More than ever, we need to be proactive in our resistance, whether that takes the form of a quiet or a very vocal protest.  This piece was written days after 1,000 people successfully closed the world’s largest coal-exporting port in Newcastle, Australia and just two weeks after the Paris Climate Accord was signed.  It was written mainly from a British perspective, but really resonated with me. In India, where I live, smog pollution is a major problem. Moses discusses how this problem also affects those living in Beijing, and explains the double-edged benefit to employing people in jobs that improve the state of our environment as well as the quality of life for the majority of people on the planet. “The choice between clean, safe, democratic and sustainable energy/jobs or dirty, dangerous and undemocratic energy/jobs is a no-brainer,” she writes.  Moses implores us not to wait for treaties to be drawn up and politicians to agree on changes they would like to implement, but to work from the ground up, in small ways. She asks us to “take it upon ourselves to do more if we really want climate justice” and “support rather than denounce those willing to put themselves on the line, since we all benefit from their actions”.  I found her words urgent, clarifying and emboldening. I shared the article with friends, many of whom were similarly moved by it, and when we were asked to complete an internship as part of our course, I chose to work at a law firm that has an environmental focus. When I graduate I hope to work in this field and become someone bringing about positive change both professionally and personally. "
"The Church Investors Group has warned some of Britain’s biggest companies it intends to take a hard line over failings on executive pay, gender diversity and climate change in the forthcoming annual meeting season. The group, which represents church organisations with combined investment assets of about £17bn, has told companies listed on the FTSE 350 index it will refuse to re-elect directors at firms failing to make sufficient progress in key areas. “The best companies contribute to the common good through their products and services and the way they treat their employees,” said the Rev Canon Edward Carter, chair of the CIG.  “Their directors understand that if they are not doing something about fairness and about the risks facing us today, they are part of the problem and risk losing the confidence of the public and ultimately their licence to operate.” The group’s members have invested in companies including Tesco, Royal Dutch Shell, AstraZenca and HSBC. It backs investment policies based on Christian ethical principles and represents institutional investors from mainstream Christian church denominations and charities, including the main investment bodies of the Church of England and the Methodist church. Outlining its new voting policy, the CIG said its members would vote against executive pay packages where pay ratios are not disclosed, excessive pensions for chief executives or where financial services or pharmaceutical companies do not pay the living wage.  It will also scrutinise a company’s record on gender diversity, voting against the re-election of nomination committee chairs if women make up less than a third of the board. If the proportion of women drops below 25%, CIG members will vote against all directors on the committee. According to the latest figures published by the government-backed Hampton-Alexander review – which aims to increase the number of women on FTSE boards – there were 301 firms in the FTSE 350 at the end of June 2017 where the proportion of women on the board was less than 33%.  A total of 170 firms would have failed the CIG’s test of having female board representation equivalent to less than 25%, including BP, Barclays, Prudential and Just Eat. The proportion of women on boards falls to just 9% at the pub and restaurants group Mitchells & Butlers, and there are no women at all on the board of Sports Direct, the retailer founded and run by Mike Ashley. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, welcomed the new voting policy adopted by the CIG, and said the group was “putting some teeth into the issues, which is necessary”. Climate change is the third key area for the CIG, which said its members would vote against the re-election of the chair if a company is making little progress on the transition to a low-carbon world. “Church investors have long sought to address excessive executive pay and encourage the adoption of the living wage,” said Stephen Beer, chief investment officer of the central finance board of the Methodist church.  “Our new policy will enable us to send a clear signal to companies that we expect them to consider fairness when setting executive pay levels. We encourage the wider investment community to hold directors accountable and ensure more responsible stewardship on this critical subject.” The 2018 annual meeting season gets into full swing in spring, and last year the CIG did not support 60% of remuneration reports put forward by FTSE 350 companies. It recommended against 37% of nomination committee chairs."
"Tackling climate change and achieving the world’s sustainable development goals will require publicly funded and private sector banks and institutions to be far more willing to join forces to provide “blended” finance to projects, according to a new study. Blended finance is the term given to the use of public or philanthropic capital to spur private sector investment in projects aimed at achieving the sustainable development goals. Already, this market is worth about $50bn globally, but experts said on Tuesday this sum could double within the next three to four years.  In a report to be presented on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission found that private sector investors could take advantage of blended finance to gain access to rapidly growing markets in the developing world. The commission has set up a taskforce specifically to consider blended finance and how to encourage growth in the sector. In its report, the taskforce found that there was great fragmentation across the market and called for public and private investors to pool their resources to create more giant funds, worth more than £1bn each, to take over from the smaller funds, of about $100m in size, which currently dominate the blended finance landscape. There would still be a place for smaller funds, the taskforce said, but the creation of very large finance vehicles would facilitate bigger projects than are currently possible. Lord Malloch-Brown, the former UK diplomat who chairs the commission, said: “Action is needed end-to-end across the whole investment system to scale up the use of blended finance, if we are serious about closing the funding gap for the sustainable development goals.” He said gaining more private capital would be essential to achieving the sustainable development goals, especially regarding infrastructure in emerging economies. The commission found that the market for blended finance had already doubled in size in the last five years, and that countries in the developing world wishing to take advantage of the funds available should prioritise investment in infrastructure that would increase resilience to climate change and provide environmentally sound economic development. The group estimated that about $6tn a year would be needed to meet the sustainable development goals fully, and that a large proportion of this could be met by blended finance, if the market for the latter is spurred on by governments and companies. Jeremy Oppenheim, founder of Systemiq, a financial institution focusing on sustainable development, and programme director at the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said private sector banks and other financial institutions could benefit by pooling their resources with organisations from the public sector, such as development banks. “There is a window of opportunity for institutional investors to increase their exposure to emerging markets infrastructure by taking advantage of the risk mitigation offered by blended finance,” said Oppenheim. “Momentum is growing – it is possible that the blended finance market could double again in the next three to four years.” The paper produced by the taskforce, entitled Better Finance, Better World, is now open to consultation, which will be completed by the middle of March. After that, a report taking the responses to the consultation into account will be produced at the April meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission was set up to further the sustainable development goals, and is funded by public sector organisations including the UN and World Bank, philanthropic bodies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and private sector companies including Unilever. The sustainable development goals were adopted in 2015 by the UN, and include goals on ending poverty, protecting the planet and its resources, and ensure the long-term prosperity of humanity. All of the goals included in the package are supposed to be met by 2030."

"The ozone layer that protects people from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation is not recovering over most highly populated regions, scientists warned on Tuesday. The greatest losses in ozone occurred over Antarctica but the hole there has been closing since the chemicals causing the problem were banned by the Montreal protocol. But the ozone layer wraps the entire Earth and new research has revealed it is thinning in the lower stratosphere over the non-polar areas.   Reduced protection from cancer-causing UV rays is especially concerning towards the equator, where sunlight is stronger and billions of people live. The reason for the falling ozone at lower latitudes is not known, though scientists suspect a chemical used in paint stripper and a change in atmospheric circulation caused by climate change. “The study is in lower to mid latitudes, where the sunshine is more intense, so that is not a good signal for skin cancer,” said Prof Joanna Haigh at Imperial College London, a member of the international research team. “It is a worry. Although the Montreal protocol has done what we wanted it to do in the upper stratosphere, there are other things going on that we don’t understand.” Anna Jones, an atmospheric chemist at the British Antarctic Survey and not involved in the new study, said: “To identify what action might be needed to prevent further decreases, it is extremely important to understand what is causing the observed downward trend.” Scientists say budget threats to US satellite monitoring programmes must be reversed. The new research, published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, carefully combined measurements of atmospheric ozone from 11 different datasets to produce a record of the last 30 years. It looked at ozone levels between the 60th parallels, an area that ranges from Scandinavia, Russia and Alaska in the north to the tip of South America. (London is 51 deg N, Sydney is 34 deg S and New York city is at 41 deg N.) The stratosphere stretches from 10km above the Earth to 50km and ozone is slowly rising in the upper stratosphere, back towards the levels seen before CFC chemicals caused their damage. But in the lower stratosphere, when there is the most ozone, levels are falling. Overall, the effects balance out but this means the ozone layer over the area studied is remaining in its depleted state.  The cause of the decline is unknown but might be the result of global warming. Ozone is produced by chemical reactions in the atmosphere over the tropics and then distributed towards the poles world by large air circulation currents. But warming trends could be strengthening these currents, moving more ozone to the poles and leaving less at lower latitudes. Another suspect is so-called “very short lived substances” (VSLS) - industrial chemicals that destroy ozone. It was thought they broke down too quickly to reach the stratosphere, but that may need to be re-examined.  Research published in July by Ryan Hossaini, at Lancaster University, UK, and colleagues showed that levels of a key VSLS, called dicholoromethane and used in paint stripper and aerosol sprays, have doubled in the last decade. It is not banned by the Montreal protocol and little is known about where it is leaking from or why emissions have risen so rapidly.  William Ball, an atmospheric scientist at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland, who led the new research, said: “The finding of declining low-latitude ozone is surprising, since our current best atmospheric circulation models do not predict this effect. Very short-lived substances could be the missing factor in these models.” Hossaini welcomed the “important” new study, but he argues that the current concentrations of VSLS in the atmosphere are too low to explain the falling ozone in the lower stratosphere.  “This work clearly highlights there are still unanswered questions regarding the drivers of long-term changes in stratospheric ozone,” he said. “The implications of the downward ozone trend from the perspective of surface UV and health need to be evaluated as a pressing matter.”"
"Dozens of Scotland’s most famous historic sites are at very high risk of being badly damaged by climate change and need urgent protection, an expert survey has found. Historic Environment Scotland (HES), the agency which oversees nearly 340 of the country’s most important castles, abbeys, Neolithic sites and ruins, has for the first time issued red warnings for nearly a fifth of its sites and put amber, high risk warnings against another 70%. Of those, 28 sites are identified as at the greatest risk because they are not yet properly protected. Those include Fort George , a vast fortress built near Inverness after the battle of Culloden, 800-year-old Inchcolm abbey and Inchcolm island on the Firth of Forth, and the Brough of Birsay, a Pictish and Viking-settled island in Orkney’s world heritage site, threatened by sea level rises and storms. The agency says those 28 places, already made fragile by their age and weathering, are at an “unacceptable level of risk exposure that requires immediate mitigating action”. Among the 70% of its sites given an amber warning is Holyrood Park in Edinburgh which includes Arthur’s Seat and Salisbury Crags, and borders the Queen’s official home in Scotland, Holyrood Palace, as well as the Scottish parliament.  The park is at very high risk of being damaged by landslides and flooding, which justify red warnings in four categories, but those threats are reduced because the park is maintained by HES’s ranger service, so under the new risk register published on Monday it gets an amber . Edinburgh Castle has red warnings for the risk of landslide and groundwater flooding, but as it too is under constant supervision by HES, it also gets an amber rating . Three other world famous sites, Glasgow cathedral, the Neolithic village of Skara Brae and the Maeshowe chambered cairn on Orkney, and the Viking village of Jarlshof on the southern most tip of mainland Shetland, are also given red risk ratings.  They too are under constant supervision, lowering the threat level to amber, but HES officials warn that even so, protected sites could still be damaged by the far more severe weather events now being forecast. The study, the first of its kind, has combined climatic data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, geological information from the British Geological Survey, and the agency’s own site surveys to draw up a detailed assessment of every site.  Combined into a single database, the surveys have confirmed evidence from numerous places that already fragile or exposed historic sites are at even greater risk from heavier flooding, coastal erosion driven by stronger storms and rising sea levels, increased winter rainfall or much drier summers. Its publication will increase pressure on other conservation bodies such as the National Trust of Scotland, which owns numerous sites at risk of extreme climate events, to step up their research.  The database will be constantly updated and refined, said Ewan Hyslop, the agency’s head of technical research and science, particularly after far more detailed and updated UK-wide projections of climate risks are published in several months. HES has increased the priority it gives to climate mitigation under legislation driven through by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, which requires public bodies to factor climate change into their activities. But even so, HES faces an 8% cut in its grant under the Scottish government’s draft budget. The budget of Sepa, the Scottish agency responsible for monitoring climate change, will also be cut again. The research draws on forecasts from Sepa that sea levels around Scotland will increase by between 16.5 and 28 centimetres by 2050, threatening coastal sites such as Skara Brae. Average temperatures will rise by 2.8C in summer and 2.2C in winter, while average rainfall will jump by 16% in winter and fall by 13% in summer, increasing the risks of grassland and forest fires at historic sites.  The report notes: “Water is the most destructive agent of decay. On a large scale, heavy and intense rainfall can directly lead to flooding in a short timeframe, which has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to all elements of the historic environment within reach of these potential flood zones.” "

"Global temperatures could break through the internationally agreed upper 1.5C limit within the next five years, according to a forecast by British scientists that raises fresh questions about the world’s efforts to tackle climate change. The Met Office forecasting service said that in the period from 2018 to 2022, annual global average temperatures are likely to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels and could top the 1.5C threshold set as an aspiration by the global Paris climate change deal in 2015.  “It is now possible that continued warming from greenhouse gases along with natural variability could combine so we temporarily exceed 1.5C in the next five years,” said Stephen Belcher, the chief scientist at the Met Office. Global temperatures have been steadily rising over the past 20 years, and in each of the last three years averages have topped the 1C threshold. Last year was the second hottest on record, and the hottest not to have been given an additional boost by the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set at Paris as an ambitious target because scientists fear that a world warmer than that would be susceptible to ever wilder climactic events that in turn would precipitate greater drought, habitat loss, food insecurity and mass migration. Some predictions had forecast that the threshold would not be breached until the 2040s. Met Office scientists said that a single-year blip above 1.5C was not the same thing as a sustained period of warmer temperatures above the threshold. The majority of scientists believe human behaviour is contributing to global warming and climate change. "
"Mankind has made the world warmer, but we’ve also made it stormier. In a study conducted over the Amazon rainforest, scientists have shown that tiny particles – smaller than one-thousandth of the width of a human hair – cause storms to intensify, and potentially have knock-on effects for weather around the world. Jiwen Fan, from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory studied storm formation near the Brazilian city of Manaus. Its 2 million people make Manaus the largest city in the Amazon, and the busy streets and smokey chimneys produce a near permanent pollution plume.   Fan and her colleagues were able to show that the tiniest particles in this plume spawn massive droplets, leading to heat release, followed by powerful updrafts and super-charged storms.  Previously, these tiny particles were thought to be too small to aid droplet formation. In pristine areas (such as the Amazon and over oceans) tiny particles could be having a significant effect.  “The results suggest that, from pre-industrial to the present day, human activity may have changed storms in these regions in powerful ways,” says Fan, whose findings are published in Science.

"Roughly every two years we’re treated to headlines repeating the myth that Earth is headed for an imminent “mini ice age.” It happened in 2013, 2015, and again just recently at the tail end of 2017. This time around, the myth appears to have been sparked by a Sky News interview with Northumbria University mathematics professor Valentina Zharkova. The story was quickly echoed by the Daily Mail, International Business Times, Sputnik News, Metro, Tru News, and others. Zharkova was also behind the ‘mini ice age’ stories in 2015, based on her research predicting that the sun will soon enter a quiet phase.  The most important takeaway point is that the scientific research is clear – were one to occur, a grand solar minimum would temporarily reduce global temperatures by less than 0.3°C, while humans are already causing 0.2°C warming per decade.  So the sun could only offset at most 15 years’ worth of human-caused global warming, and once its quiet phase ended, the sun would then help accelerate global warming once again. The myth ultimately stems from a period climate scientists have coined “The Little Ice Age” (LIA). This was a modestly cool period running from about the year 1300 to 1850. It was particularly cold in the UK, where the River Thames sometimes froze over, and ‘frost fairs’ were held.  A team led by University of Reading physicist and solar expert Mike Lockwood wrote a paper reviewing the science behind frost fairs, sunspots, and the LIA. It included the figure below showing northern hemisphere temperatures along with sunspot number and the level of volcanic particles in the atmosphere over the past millennium: During full blown ice ages, temperatures have generally been 4–8°C colder than in modern times. As this figure shows, during the LIA, temperatures were at most only about 0.5°C cooler than the early 20th century. Thus, Lockwood calls the Little Ice Age “a total misnomer.” As the authors put it: Compared to the changes in the proper ice ages, the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA) is a very short-lived and puny climate and social perturbation. For comparison, temperatures have risen by a full 1°C over the past 120 years, and 0.7°C over just the past 40 years. The Maunder Minimum was a period of quiet solar activity between about 1645 and 1715. It’s often referred to interchangeably with ‘Little Ice Age,’ but the latter lasted centuries longer. In fact, three separate solar minima occurred during the LIA, which also included periods of relatively higher solar activity. Other factors like volcanic eruptions and human activities also contributed to the cool temperatures. In fact, a 2017 paper led by the University of Reading’s Mathew Owens concluded: Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use [by humans]. Several studies have investigated the potential climate impact of a future grand solar minimum. In every case, they have concluded that such a quiet solar period would cause less than 0.3°C cooling, which as previously noted, would temporarily offset no more than a decade and a half’s worth of human-caused global warming. These model-based estimates are consistent with the amount of cooling that occurred during the solar minima in the LIA. Although it would have a relatively small impact on the climate, it’s still an interesting question to ask whether we’re headed for another quiet solar period. Zharkova thinks so. Her team created a model that tries to predict solar activity, and suggests another solar minimum will occur from 2020 to 2055. However, other solar scientists have criticized the model as being too simple, created based on just 35 years of data, and failing to accurately reproduce past solar activity. Ilya Usoskin, head of the Oulu Cosmic Ray Station and Vice-Director of the ReSoLVE Center of Excellence in Research, published a critique of Zharkova’s solar model making those points. Most importantly, the model fails in reproducing past known solar activity because Zharkova’s team treats the sun as a simple, predictable system like a pendulum. In reality, the sun has more random and unpredictable (in scientific terms, “stochastic”) behavior: For example, a perfect pendulum – if you saw a few cycles of the pendulum, you can predict its behavior. However, solar activity is known to be non-stationary process, which principally cannot be predicted (the prediction horizon for solar activity is known to be 10-15 years). Deterministic prediction cannot be made because of the essential stochastic component.  Just imagine a very turbulent flow of water in a river rapid, and you throw a small wooden stick into water and trace it. Then you do it second time and third time ... each time the stick will end up in very different positions after the same time period. Its movement is unpredictable because of the turbulent stochastic component. This is exactly the situation with solar activity. Lockwood agrees that we don’t yet have a proven predictive theory of solar behavior. He has published research examining the range of possible solar evolutions based on past periods when the Sun was in a similar state to today, but as he puts it, “that is the best that I think we can do at the present time!” Solar physicist Paul Charbonneau at the University of Montreal also concurred with Usoskin. He told me that while scientists are working to simulate solar activity, including using simplified models like Zharkova’s,  on the standards of contemporary dynamo models theirs is extremely simple —in fact borderlining simplistic ... To extrapolate such a model outside its calibration window, you need an extra, very strong hypothesis: that the physical systems underlying the magnetic field generation retain their coherence (Phase, amplitude, etc.). As my colleague Ilya Usoskin has already explained, this is very unlikely to be the case in the case of the solar activity cycle. Zharkova believes her solar model is correct, but at best it can only try to predict when the next quiet solar period will occur. Its influence on Earth’s climate is outside her expertise, and the peer-reviewed research is clear that it would be a minimal impact. Zharkova disagrees – I contacted her, and she told me that she believes a grand solar minimum would have a much bigger cooling effect. However, she also referenced long-debunked myths about global warming on Mars and Jupiter, and made a comment about “the preachers of global warming.” She’s clearly passionate about her research, and has the credibility that comes with publishing peer-reviewed studies on solar activity. Perhaps these factors motivate journalists to write these frequent ‘mini ice age’ stories.  But Zharkova’s climate science beliefs are irrelevant. While she has created a model predicting an imminent period of quiet solar activity, other scientists have identified serious flaws in the model, and in any case, research has shown that another solar minimum would only have a small and temporary impact on Earth’s climate."
"BP will add rapid charging points for electric cars at its UK petrol stations within the next two months, in the latest sign of an oil giant adapting to the dramatic growth of battery-powered cars. The British oil firm’s venture arm has invested $5m (£3.5m) in the US firm Freewire Technologies, which will provide motorbike-sized charging units at forecourts to top up cars in half an hour. The move follows a bigger move by BP’s Anglo-Dutch rival Shell, which has been on a buying spree of electric car infrastructure companies and has already opened charging points at its service stations.  While BP would not put a number on how many forecourts would see the chargers, it confirmed the trial would start in the UK during February and March before expanding to European locations later in the year. Tufan Erginbilgic, the chief executive of BP Downstream, said: “EV charging will undoubtedly become an important part of our business, but customer demand and the technologies available are still evolving.” The oil firm recently returned to solar power with the $200m investment in a solar developer, and is due to announce its first overarching carbon target soon, as it plays catch-up with other oil majors such as Shell.  But today marks the company’s first step into electric cars, which it expects to rise a hundredfold by 2035 but not to seriously affect oil demand. There are around 130,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the UK, but Britain’s biggest charging point firm predicts that number will grow rapidly.  Chargemaster Plc told an audience in London on Tuesday that it projected the nearly 50,000 plug-in car registrations in 2017 would jump to 70,000 new cars sold in 2018, which it said was a conservative estimate. Charging infrastructure falls into three categories: slow (less than 7KW, up to 8 hours to charge a car), fast (7-22KW, 3-4 hours) and rapid (50KW and above, typically 30 minutes or less).  Tom Callow, director of strategy at the group, said the sort of rapid chargers that BP plans to install will be a niche market in the UK.  “Fast charging is absolutely dominating ... [there is] a smaller circle of people who need rapid charging. The idea you need rapid chargers everywhere, all over the UK, is simply a fallacy... You then have a much much smaller circle of people who need super-rapid charging [350KW],” he said. However, National Grid, which runs the UK’s electricity transmission network, said that it was in talks with BP, Shell, Ford, BMW, Tesla and other companies about building infrastructure for super rapid chargers at motorway service stations. Graeme Cooper, the project director of electric vehicles, said that the company had mapped traffic, population and roads and identified 50 sites to ensure most people are in reach of such chargers. “Fifty strategic locations means to an extent that 96% of UK drivers would be able to drive in any direction from any location in the UK and be in 50 miles of an ultra rapid small charger … To an extent we can probably allay range anxiety,” he said.  The grid infrastructure for such a plan would cost £0.5-1bn, or around 60p a driver per year if all motorists shouldered the cost, Cooper said. He was dismissive of “doom-mongers” who suggest the UK energy system cannot cope with the cars. Nissan, whose new longer range Leaf electric car arrives on UK roads in coming months, said on Tuesday that it would fit 1,000 charging points for a trial to test how plug-in cars’ batteries can help power grids, by returning electricity at times of need."
"In what is described as a landmark case, a New South Wales court will be asked to overturn a decision to extend the life of a coalmine on the grounds the state government failed to properly consider the impact on the climate. The case is brought by a community group from the tiny Hunter Valley village of Wollar, which it says has been devastated by the development and gradual expansion of the Wilpinjong coalmine over the past decade.   Mine owner Peabody Energy won approval last April to further expand the mine, which sits between the towns of Mudgee and Denman, to extend its life by seven years to 2033. In a case starting on Thursday, the Wollar Progress Association will argue the decision was unlawful as it did not properly consider the impact of the increased greenhouse gas emissions, including “downstream” emissions when the coal is burned in NSW and overseas power plants. It says the state also did not look at whether the extension was in step with state and national climate change policies and targets, including Australia’s commitment under the 2015 Paris agreement to keep warming below 2C.  Lawyer David Morris, from the Environmental Defenders Office NSW, said the association would argue 2007 legislation covering extractive industries was explicitly designed to ensure these two points were considered before decisions were made on whether projects could go ahead.  “What is the point of commitments and targets if they are not factored into and reflected in decisions about projects which contribute to emissions?” he said.  “We say it is a landmark case. When you think about a coalmine in 2017, it is difficult to think of a more important consideration than its contribution to climate change.” The secretary of the Wollar Progress Association, Bev Smiles, said the mine had gradually grown from approval in 2006 to mine 9.5m tonnes a year to the current 13m tonnes. She said the proposed expansion would bring it to within 1.5 kilometres of the village. She said many landholders had sold to the company, and the population had fallen from about 300 to 70. “The impact from noise, dust and blasting has been extreme,” she said. “What happens under government processes is we are left to our own devices up against people who have a lot more resources than we have, and the treatment of people over time by this company has been quite disgraceful.”  A spokeswoman for Peabody Energy said the company had been through a comprehensive process and the case related to the approval process by the state’s Planning Assessment Commission, not the merits of the extension project. She said the mine generated jobs and invested in the Mudgee region, employing 413 people.  Peabody Energy is also applying for an exploration licence over more than 1,600 hectares of land east of Wollar.  The case starts in the land and environment court on Thursday. The planning minister, Anthony Roberts, declined to comment while the issue was before the court.  Separately, Smiles and two others will be in Mudgee local court on Friday facing charges relating to a protest at the mine last April. While the case is believed to be the first time a mine approval has been been contested over its climate impact under the 2007 NSW law, at least one decision has been challenged on similar grounds under federal legislation. In 2016, the federal court dismissed a case brought by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) against the federal government’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael mega-coalmine. The ACF argued the mine’s approval was inconsistent with the country’s obligations to protect the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. The court found the then environment minister Greg Hunt had considered the impact of the emissions from burning the coal on the reef, and that Australia had latitude under the World Heritage Convention as to how it carried out its obligations.

"Australian researchers growing trees in climate change conditions have found the leaves “sweat” to survive extreme heatwaves. The year-long experiment showed that trees continue to release water through their leaves as an evaporative cooling system during periods of extreme heat, despite the carbon-fixing process of photosynthesis grinding to a halt.  Previously, scientists believed that photosynthesis and transpiration – the process of releasing water – were linked, meaning one would not occur without the other. Prof Mark Tjoelker from the University of Western Sydney’s Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment is one of the authors of the study, which was published in Global Change Biology this month. Tjoelker said the findings had significant implications for climate change because they showed that trees stopped capturing carbon during extreme heatwaves, which are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future. “If heatwaves occur over a large surface area … clearly the trees and native forests in that area would take up less carbon,” he said. “And if there is an increased frequency of heatwaves that obviously impacts their ability to serve as carbon sinks.”  New South Wales and Queensland had their hottest year on record in 2017, while Australia as a whole recorded its third-hottest. Seven of the 10 hottest years recorded in Australia have occurred since 2005. The study also showed that trees grown in conditions that mimic a predicted 3C average warming were not better able to cope with extreme heat. The experiment was conducted at the Hawkesbury forest experiment and Yarramundi site at Richmond, near Sydney. It involved the use of 12 “whole-tree capsules”. The nine-metre capsules are temperature and climate-controlled pods that look like a cross between a greenhouse and a spaceship, and are referred to by locals as “the Coke bottles”. Each capsule was planted with a 60cm Eucalyptus parramattensis or Parramatta red gum seedling in December 2015. The species is endemic to the area and listed as vulnerable. Six of the capsules were set to reflect the ambient temperature, while the other six were set to reflect a predicted 3C increase in mean annual temperatures, which is the modelled climate change outcome for Australia before the end of the century. The trees in the warmer pods grew 30% faster and reached a height of six metres in two years.  Twelve months in, researchers began inflicting artificially induced four-day heatwaves across all 12 capsules, bringing the afternoon temperature up to 43C. The trees were starved of water for a month leading up to each heatwave to mimic natural heatwave conditions. “It didn’t matter whether the trees were grown under current climate conditions or the 3C increase of the future, they responded equally well,” Tjoelker said. “On each of those days when peak afternoon heatwave temperatures were high, we noticed the photosynthesis went to zero, so they weren’t taking up any carbon any more but they maintained their water loss.” The effect was a cooling system “akin to humans sweating”, he said. Tjoelker said the results would be fed back to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to help provide more accurate modelling. “We can just provide the nuts and bolts, the biology, that helps improve the reliability of these simulations,” he said. Further studies will be conducted to see if the response is consistent across tree types, whether trees are able to use this cooling method to survive longer heatwaves and what happens if they run out of water. That could result in some deaths among the pod trees. “Trees will be sacrificed for science, in some cases,” Tjoelker said.  The test centre was designed to be replanted every few years. This crop of parramattensis is due to be pulled up and replaced with a new species for a new round of experiments. The project is partly funded by a $315,000 ARC discovery project grant."
"There’s a new scientific journal you might not have heard of called the International Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences. It says it “supports scientist who sweats for the real innovation & discovery”. If that’s a little too sweaty for you, then how about another new journal, also called the International Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences?  Or, if you’re a discerning (and sweaty) scientist looking for a publisher that “endeavours to provide a notable and discern forum to publish” then maybe the International Journal of Research in Earth and Environmental Sciences is the notable forum for you? No? Just one more. There’s also the International Journal of Environmental Sciences which “expecpt high quality research articles” that are free from plagiarism, but maybe not typos.  These journals, and hundreds more like them, are mostly based in the Indian subcontinent or China and are part of a ballooning online industry offering to give academics a place to publish their work in return for a fee and minimal, if any, quality control. Some have been identified as “predatory” because of the way they target academics, often through spam emails, without properly disclosing fees or claiming to provide a peer review service that would give their research the scrutiny needed.  Journals that are “open access” make their money by charging academics or institutions a fee for peer reviewing and checking submitted academic manuscripts, and then publishing them. There are many reputable publishers working this way. But this murky world has a predator of its own – climate science deniers looking to take advantage of the questionable quality controls in return for getting their work published in what the publishers claim are “peer-reviewed journals” but that, in reality, are not. One climate science denier has targeted at least six journals for his research claiming that sea levels around Fiji and other Pacific islands are not rising.  The author of the research, Dr Nils-Axel Mörner, has acknowledged that the work was paid for by the CO2 Coalition, a climate science denial group that has links to the US president Donald Trump’s administration (coalition member Kathleen Hartnett-White is Trump’s pick to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality and a director, Prof Will Happer, has been touted as a potential chief science adviser to the president).  According to Prof Kurt Lambeck, a geophysicist and sea level expert at the Australian National University, none of the research “would have passed the reviewing process for more reputable journals”. One journal targeted by Mörner was the Bangalore-based International Journal of Earth & Environmental Sciences which describes its mission thus: “We encourage authors, who always have shown more interest to publish his work in the prestigious journals, and avail them the freely to the scientific community.” Another of the publishers used by Mörner, known as Juniper Publishers, was one of those to be caught in a hoax in 2017 when it accepted a “Dr Doll” on to its editorial board. Dr Doll was a fake veterinary surgeon created by Curtin University’s Prof Mike Daube with a profile based on his dog, a Staffordshire terrier. Daube told the Huffington Post he had orchestrated the hoax “to expose shams of this kind, which prey on the gullible, especially young or naive academics and those from developing countries”. The US government’s Federal Trade Commission has brought deception charges against one of the world’s biggest “open access” publishers, Omics International. The FTC has accused the Hyderabad-based Omics Group of what amounts to deceptive marketing practices among the more than 700 “open access” journals it publishes and the 3,000 “conferences” it organises. Among the accusations, the FTC alleges that Omics fails to carry out genuine peer review, uses the names of academics without their consent and uses other academics names to promote conferences when those academics have not agreed to appear. Omics has denied all charges.  Omics also took on a climate science denier to be the editor-in-chief of its journal Environment Pollution and Climate Change, which published a handful of odd papers arguing that climate change wasn’t being caused by humans. Prof Steve Sherwood, director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, described one of the papers as “laughable”. Dr Arthur Viterito, a retired college geography professor, is also a policy adviser to the notorious Heartland Institute – famed for its billboard campaign comparing people who accepted human-caused global warming to a serial killer. To be fair, it did issue an important qualifier that, “of course, not all global warming alarmists are murderers or tyrants”. Viterito told me via email earlier this month that he had “agreed to assume the role as editor-in-chief for one year and my year was up” and that he would now go on to concentrating on his research.  Omics and its associated companies also organise hundreds of meetings and conferences each year.  Mörner managed to organise one meeting, through Omics, in Rome in October 2017, and then load the program with fellow climate science deniers. One email sent to several Australian climate scientists by Omics company ConferenceSeries LLC was designed to entice them to attend the Rome conference. Here is the how that irresistible word salad read:  Climate Change 2017 is specifically premeditated with a unifying axiom providing pulpit to widen the imminent scientific creations. The main theme of the conference is ‘Today’s Progress and Tomorrow’s Climate Challenges’ which covers a broad array of vitally key sessions. While all the serious Australia climate scientists seemed bemused by this “unifying axiom” the meeting did go ahead and, according to the estimates of two people who attended, there were between 80 and 100 people in the room at the start (somewhere short of the “more than 500” that Omics had said in its marketing that it expected). In an interview posted on YouTube, Mörner said the conference had been a great success and expressed his delight at being able to expose junior academics to the views of deniers. “Everybody left happy,” he said. Prof Joseph Tomain, a law professor from the University of Cincinatti, didn’t leave happy. He left shortly after the first tea break. Tomain was the second speaker at the meeting but accepted he should have checked the credentials of the organisers more carefully before agreeing to travel. “I was appalled by the first speaker, who was indeed a climate denier, much to my surprise,” Tomain told me via email. “At the break, I spoke with other attendees who were clearly in the same camp. Quite honestly, it was not my cup of tea and after that break I decided to enjoy Rome rather than stay stuck at a Holiday Inn on its outskirts.” Dr John Hunter, a sea level expert at the University of Tasmania, told me there was a “systemic problem” in academia where younger scientists were being pushed to publish more papers which had “lowered the standards of submitted papers”. “There has been an explosion of online journals, and also the ability to publish hardcopy journals far cheaper than previously. As well as producing good journals, this has led to a proliferation of ‘predatory’ and ‘vanity’ journals with poor reviewing standards.”  But the effort to target these journals is also a neat way to sidestep the legitimate and valid criticism levelled at deniers that many have little to no history of publishing research in peer-reviewed journals. Now, anyone can publish anything in a journal with a name that sounds official but in fact offers none of the checks and balances of legitimate journals. That’s how a paper with the title Get Me Off Your Fucking Mailing List can be accepted for publication in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology, or the Urology & Nephrology Open Access Journal published by MedCrave (another publisher targeted by Mörner) can be easily hoaxed with a paper about a non-existent condition based on a 1991 episode of Seinfeld and written by Dr Martin van Nostrand (let’s Google that for them). That’s also how papers that dismiss the well-established science linking between fossil fuel burning to dangerous climate change can get published in an “international” and “peer-reviewed” journal."
"Queensland and New South Wales experienced their warmest years on record in 2017 as the trend of warmer than average temperatures across Australia continued, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The bureau’s annual climate statement released on Wednesday revealed 2017 was Australia’s third-hottest year on record, with the annual national mean temperature 0.95C above the average.   It meant the 11-year mean temperature between 2007 and 2017 was now the highest on record, and seven of Australia’s 10 warmest years had occurred since 2005. “Despite the lack of an El Niño – which is normally associated with our hottest years – 2017 was still characterised by very warm temperatures,” the agency’s head of climate monitoring, Karl Braganza, said. The national mean temperature of 22.76C – or 0.95C above the long-term average – was the third-highest since records began in 1910.  The bureau said background warming associated with climate change had seen Australian annual mean temperatures increase by about 1.1C since 1910, and most of that warming had occurred since 1950. Will Steffen, a climate change expert from the Climate Council, said the exceptionally warm year included “some of the worst impacts of climate change seen in Australia to date”, including severe heatwaves and devastating coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. “Another year has passed and we have another set of records driven by intensifying climate change,” he said.  “In recent days Australians have felt the impact of a disruptive climate, with a severe heatwave across the south-east. Parts of the Hume Highway melted in the heat and on Sunday the temperature at Penrith hit 47.3 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest place on Earth during that 24-hour period.” Both day and night-time temperatures were warmer than average, with the maximum for the year the second-highest on record. Prolonged high sea surface temperatures led to the first instance of back-to-back years of mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef. “Australia has been looking at an increased frequency of heatwaves and other extremes that have been positively associated with climate change,” Braganza said. Australia’s above average temperatures coincided with what the bureau called an “exceptionally warm” year globally, part of a continuing trend.  The estimated global mean temperature for 2017 was 0.09C above the 1961 to 1990 average, and the bureau said it was “likely 2017 will be the second or third-warmest year on record since 1850”.  The warmest two years were 2016 and 2015, records that were assisted by a strong El Niño, making 2017 the hottest year so far without the assistance of the weather pattern.  Global temperatures increased by just over 1C since the pre-industrial period, and all of the 10 warmest years on record occurred between 1998 and the present. In the United States, 2017 was typified by climate-related disasters: California’s hottest-ever summer helped contribute to the state’s record wildfire season, while researchers believe global warming helped boost Hurricane Harvey’s record rainfall. But the year was also dominated by climate denial, particularly in the US where the president, Donald Trump, led a dramatic withdrawal from efforts to curb global warming. In June he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, confirming the fears around the world of scientists and politicians about the US’s repositioning on climate change."
"New York City is seeking to lead the assault on climate change and the Trump administration with a plan to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and sue the world’s most powerful oil companies over their contribution to dangerous global warming. City officials have set a goal of divesting New York’s $189bn pension funds from fossil fuel companies within five years in what they say would be “among the most significant divestment efforts in the world to date”. Currently, New York City’s five pension funds have about $5bn in fossil fuel investments. New York state has already announced it is exploring how to divest from fossil fuels.   “New York City is standing up for future generations by becoming the first major US city to divest our pension funds from fossil fuels,” said Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor. “At the same time, we’re bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits. As climate change continues to worsen, it’s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.” De Blasio said that the city is taking the five fossil fuel firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell – to federal court due to their contribution to climate change. Court documents state that New York has suffered from flooding and erosion due to climate change and because of looming future threats it is seeking to “shift the costs of protecting the city from climate change impacts back on to the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat”. The court filing claims that just 100 fossil fuel producers are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, with the five targeted companies the largest contributors. The case will also point to evidence that firms such as Exxon knew of the impact of climate change for decades, only to downplay and even deny this in public. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is investigating Exxon over this alleged deception. Divestment is the opposite of investment. It's the shifting of stocks, bonds or funds from certain businesses or sectors. Individual people invest in various ways to generate money, but large institutions such as cities, universities and religious organizations do this on a huge scale. Traditionally, fund managers put together investment portfolios that will provide the best returns for these institutions, regardless of where the money is invested. The divestment movement, primarily consisting of climate activists, is urging private and public institutions to rid their portfolios of all oil, gas and coal stocks to send a financial and ethical message that fossil fuels are harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. So far, it's estimated that funds totalling $6tn have committed to divesting from fossil fuels. Activists hope this momentum will deprive fossil fuels of a social license, similar to tobacco, and help accelerate the deployment of cleaner energy, such as wind and solar.  New York was badly rattled by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and faces costs escalating into the tens of billions of dollars in order to protect low-lying areas such as lower Manhattan and the area around JFK airport from being inundated by further severe storms fueled by rising sea levels and atmospheric warming. De Blasio’s office said climate change is “perhaps the toughest challenge New York City will face in the coming decades”.  New York’s lawsuit echoes a similar effort on the west coast, where two California counties and a city are suing 37 fossil fuel companies for knowingly emitting dangerous levels of greenhouse gases. One of those firms, Exxon, has complained that it has been targeted by a “collection of special interests and opportunistic politicians” as part of a “conspiracy” to force the company to comply with various political objectives.  The legal action and the divestment draw perhaps the starkest dividing line yet between New York and the Trump administration on climate change. Under Trump, the federal government has attempted the withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords, tear up Barack Obama’s signature climate policies and open up vast areas of America’s land and waters to coal, oil and gas interests. De Blasio and the city comptroller, Scott Stringer, have come under pressure for several years from activists to rid New York’s pension funds of any link to fossil fuels, with some environmentalists claiming the city has been too slow to use its clout to tackle climate change. Stringer admitted the divestment will be “complex” and will take some time but said the city’s pension funds could promote sustainability while also protecting the retirement of teachers, police officers and other city workers. “New York City today becomes a capital of the fight against climate change on this planet,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group 350.org. “With its communities exceptionally vulnerable to a rising sea, the city is showing the spirit for which it’s famous – it’s not pretending that working with the fossil fuel companies will somehow save the day, but instead standing up to them, in the financial markets and in court.”  Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and architect of the Paris climate agreement, added: “The exponential transition toward a fossil-fuel-free economy is unstoppable and local governments have a critical role to play. There is no time to lose. “It’s therefore extremely encouraging to see NYC step up today.” New York joins cities such as Washington DC and Cape Town in divesting, along with universities such as Stanford in California and Oxford in the UK. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, notable for its links to the past oil wealth of John D Rockefeller, has also sought to divest."
"Last week, a Las Vegas news station interviewed Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. The interviewer brought up the topic of climate change, and virtually everything Pruitt said in response was wrong, and was often refuted on his own agency’s website, until he started deleting it.  To begin, Pruitt claimed that we don’t know ‘with precision’ what’s causing global warming.  Our activity contributes to the climate changing to a certain degree. Now measuring that with precision, Gerard, I think is more challenging than is let on at times. Here’s what the EPA website said about that a year ago, before Pruitt got a hold of it as part of the Trump Administration’s systematic deletion of government climate change websites: Research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20th century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming. To support this statement, the EPA referenced the latest IPCC report. The IPCC concluded with 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming since 1950, with a best estimate that humans are responsible for all of the global warming during that time. That’s what the scientific research has overwhelmingly concluded:  Similarly, the EPA’s Student’s Guide to Climate Change (which has survived the Trump purge) says: The Earth is getting warmer because people are adding heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, mainly by burning fossil fuels … People are causing these changes, which are bigger and happening faster than any climate changes that modern society has ever seen before. Analysis: Why scientists think 100% of global warming is due to humans | @hausfath @_rospearce https://t.co/9DqrYVMnBj pic.twitter.com/oGN5J8a1PO Pruitt later shifted gears to repeat the third most popular climate myth: I think there’s assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing. This is not a matter of assumptions – it’s a conclusion supported by a vast body of scientific research. The EPA website likewise tackled this one, until Pruitt got his hands on it: Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change. And the EPA’s Student’s Guide to Climate Change addresses it: The negative impacts of global climate change will be less severe overall if people reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we’re putting into the atmosphere and worse if we continue producing these gases at current or faster rates. The EPA’s Climate Change Indicators page likewise lists a number of dangerous climate change consequences. Quite simply, more intense droughts, floods, and hurricanes, and coastal inundation from sea level rise are all very bad outcomes. And even the rosiest analyses conclude that any further global warming will be bad for the economy. In fact, not only did Pruitt suggest the consequences of global warming won’t be bad, he seemed to think they’ll be good and humans will “flourish.” Is it an existential threat - is it something that is unsustainable, or what kind of effect or harm is this going to have? We know that humans have most flourished during times of, what, warming trends? … Do we know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100 or year 2018? It’s fairly arrogant for us to think we know exactly what it should be in 2100. I asked climate scientists to answer this ‘ideal temperature’ question last month. They all agreed that the ideal climate is a stable one. Pruitt is wrong to say humans flourished during warming trends – we flourished during times of relatively flat temperatures without rapid trends. Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe explained: There is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that’s the temperature we’ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it’s risen by nearly 1°C and counting. Why do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions… Pruitt’s goal with these answers is clearly to manufacture doubt – to make people think that we needn’t take urgent action to slow global warming because the outcome might not be so bad. But that argument ignores the vast body of scientific evidence that clearly shows the net consequences of continued rapid climate change will fall somewhere in the range of bad to catastrophic. I summarized some of those consequences in this Denial101x lecture: Toward the end of the interview, Pruitt let slip his allegiance to the fossil fuel industry: Renewables need to be part of our energy mix, but to think that’s going to be the dominant fuel, or dominant energy source on how we generate electricity, I think is simply fanciful … There was a declared war on coal. The EPA was weaponized against certain sectors of our economy – fossil fuels generally - and that’s not the role of a regulator. First of all, under the Obama administration, the EPA regulated carbon pollution because it was legally required to do so under the Clean Air Act, according to the Supreme Court. That’s not being ‘weaponized’ against fossil fuels, it’s called enforcing the law to protect Americans’ health. Second, there is no reason why renewables couldn’t be the dominant fuel in our energy mix. In fact, several states have renewable portfolio standards and goals to make that happen. For example, Hawaii aims for 100% renewable energy by 2045, and California and New York have targets of 50% renewables by 2030. California is even ahead of schedule, on track to meet that goal a decade early, by 2020. As if his misinformation about climate science and clean energy weren’t bad enough, Pruitt really laid it on thick when asked about the Paris climate accords. [Paris] was a bad business deal for this country … it was not about CO2 reduction. If it was about CO2 reduction, they would not have let China and India take until 2030 to reduce their CO2 footprint. In reality, the Paris agreement couldn’t have been a better deal. America needed only to follow through on existing climate policies to meet its Paris targets, and because the agreement is non-binding, there would be no consequence to missing the targets anyway. Moreover, because China and India are rapidly developing countries, cutting carbon pollution is much more difficult than in a developed country like the US. In fact, China pledged much more aggressive climate action than America in the Paris agreement. And it should go without saying that claiming the Paris climate agreement is “not about CO2 reduction” is utterly absurd nonsense. It bears remembering that Pruitt heads the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s easy to forget, since he seems to think it’s his job to undo as many regulations protecting the environment and public health as possible, and to maximize fossil fuel industry profits. That’s clear from his constant peddling of climate myths and misinformation. As climate scientist Michael Mann told The Guardian, “There is no consistency at all to their various arguments other than that we should continue to burn fossil fuels.” Pruitt isn’t in charge of the labor department or the pollution council or Koch Industries. His job is to protect human and environmental health, and it’s hard to imagine anyone doing the job any worse."
"The most telling item in Donald Trump’s State of the Union address may have been what wasn’t there: any mention of climate change, the greatest problem the world faces. And just as telling was the fact that official Washington seemed barely to notice. Understandably preoccupied with his vile attacks on immigrants (or cheering his ability to actually stay with one task for one hour), press, pundits, and other politicians treated the omission as not even worthy of note. The Democratic response from Representative Joe Kennedy didn’t touch on global warming, either, though it did avoid Trump’s oddly intimate ode to “beautiful clean coal”. This means many things, but for climate campaigners one of them should be patently clear: if we’re going to make progress on climate change it’s not going to come through Washington DC – not any time soon.  Even if Democrats manage to take back the House and Senate in the midterm elections, they wouldn’t be able to get meaningful legislation past Trump – and there’s nothing much to suggest they’d try very hard.  Winning those elections is crucial in other ways – it will help the effort to play defense on issues including the environment – but since global warming is an immediate battle with enormous consequences, we dare not wait for Washington to return to sanity.  And happily, we don’t have to.  The strategy that’s been evolving for US climate action – and for action in many other parts of the planet – bypasses the central governments as much as possible. That’s because the oil industry is strongest in national capitols – that’s where its money is most toxically powerful. But if frontal attack is therefore hard, its flanks are wide open.  Consider what happened in mid-January, for instance, when New York City declared war on the oil industry, pledging to divest its $200bn pension funds of fossil fuel stocks and announcing that it would sue the five biggest energy majors for the damage they knowingly inflicted by not ’fessing up to their knowledge of climate change.  This fight is going aggressively local, and fast New York City is not as big as the federal government, but it’s big enough: it’s got lawyers aplenty, and the resources to do real damage. And it won’t be alone. We’ve just launched a huge Fossil Free US campaign, designed to make sure there are a thousand New Yorks working on a thousand fronts.  It has three main components. The first – joining in work pioneered by groups like the Sierra Club – is to persuade towns, cities, counties, and states to pledge to make the transition to 100% renewable energy. This is now easy and affordable enough that it doesn’t scare politicians – cities from San Diego to Atlanta have joined in, and they will help maintain the momentum towards clean energy that the Trump administration is trying so hard to blunt.  Job two is to block new fossil fuel infrastructure. In some places, that will be by law: Portland, Oregon, recently passed a bill banning new pipes and such, over the strenuous objections of the industry. In other places it will take bodies – tens of thousands have already pledged to journey to the upper midwest if and when TransCanada decides to build out the Keystone XL pipeline that Trump has permitted.  And third is to cut off the money that fuels this industry – by divestment, which has now begun to take a real and telling toll ($6tn worth of endowments and portfolios have joined the fight, and studies show it is cutting the capital companies need to keep exploring for oil we don’t), and by the kinds of lawsuits that New York, San Francisco and a host of other cities have already filed.  Those actions keep the industry off balance, affecting its future plans and weakening its balance sheet even as solar and wind get cheaper all the time. If you want a shorthand version: Sun, Sit (in) and Sell/Sue.  Yes, it would be easier if the country, and the planet, were acting together – if Washington were leading the fight the way the planet’s superpower obviously should. But since it isn’t, the pressure will find other outlets.  This fight is going aggressively local, and fast. "
"In order to meet its share of the carbon pollution cuts needed to achieve the 2°C Paris international climate target, America’s policies are rated as “critically insufficient” by the Climate Action Tracker. The Trump Administration has taken every possible step to undo the Obama Administration’s climate policies, including announcing that America will be the only world country to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and trying to repeal the Clean Power Plan. In 2020, the next American president will have to make up the lost ground and come up with a plan to rapidly accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuels. Currently, transportation and power generation each account for about 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions, so those sectors represent the prime targets for pollution cuts.   But the power sector is already rapidly decarbonizing because coal can’t compete in the marketplace. In some regions, new wind and solar with battery storage have already become cheaper than continuing to operate existing coal plants, and the International Renewable Energy Agency has concluded that by 2020, “all the renewable power generation technologies that are now in commercial use are expected to fall within the fossil fuel-fired cost range.” American power sector carbon emissions had exceeded those from transportation from 1979 until 2016. But because coal power plants have rapidly been replaced by natural gas and renewables, US power sector emissions have fallen rapidly since 2007, and are now below 1989 levels. US carbon pollution from transportation, on the other hand, has been on the rise since 2012. It remains higher than in 2000, nearly 20% higher than 1989 levels, and has surpassed power sector emissions. The transportation sector thus represents a prime target for cutting American carbon pollution, with light-duty (passenger) vehicles accounting for 60% of those emissions and medium- and heavy-duty trucks accounting for a further 23%. These emissions can be significantly reduced by transitioning from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs). Comparing carbon pollution between gasoline- and diesel-powered cars to those of electric vehicles can be tricky, because it depends on the source of the electricity generation, which varies from place to place. However, based on the average US power grid mix, the Department of Energy estimates that EV carbon pollution is 60% lower than that of gasoline-powered cars. In a clean energy state like California, it’s 80% lower. And even in a state like Wyoming, which gets 96% of its electricity from coal, EV carbon emissions are still 17% lower than gasoline-powered cars (although they’re 50% higher than hybrids). Moreover, EV carbon emissions will only decline as clean energy continues to expand due to its aforementioned rapidly-falling costs and widespread adoption. At some point, the US will inevitably implement climate legislation that includes a price on carbon pollution, which will accelerate clean energy deployment faster yet. Cost and battery range have been the two barriers to widespread EV adoption. However, both have rapidly improved over the past several years. In 1996, the GM EV1 was the first modern mass-produced EV. It had a range of approximately 100 miles (160 km) per charge at an estimated price of $34,000 ($50,000 in 2016 dollars), which amounts to $500 per mile of range. Tesla produced its first car – the Roadster – starting in 2008, with a range of 244 miles (393 km) at a price of around $100,000 ($410 per mile). Nissan first sold its electric Leaf in 2011 for $33,600 with an 84-mile (135 km) range ($400 per mile). All three companies have since dramatically improved their EV prices per mile of range. The 2018 Nissan Leaf sells for $30,000 with a 150-mile (240 km) range ($200 per mile). The Tesla Model 3 will sell for $35,000 with a 220-mile (354 km) range or $44,000 with a 310-mile (500 km) range ($140–160 per mile). The Chevy Bolt sells for $36,620 with a 238-mile (383 km) range ($154 per mile).  The price per mile of range has fallen by about 60% in less than a decade, excluding tax credits (which survived the recent tax bill) and additional state incentives that make EVs more affordable to consumers. Crucially, with the introduction of the Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3, ranges of reasonably affordable EVs have more than doubled over the past few years. These trends will continue – carmakers have invested $90 billion in batteries and EVs, and most of the major auto companies plan to roll out numerous new EV and hybrid models over the next few years. EVs also have the benefit of lower fuel and maintenance costs. In the US, fueling a 30 mpg sedan costs twice as much as charging a comparable EV, on average. For the average American driver (13,500 miles per year), the switch would amount to about $600 in fuel savings per year. And EVs have fewer fluids to change and moving parts to break; maintenance rarely amounts to more than rotating tires and changing air filters. American power generation is already rapidly decarbonizing. To fulfill its responsibility for helping the world stay below the 2°C temperature guardrail, the transportation sector is America’s next clear big target. It’s an area where the country’s carbon pollution hasn’t improved since the turn of the century, and where rapidly improving technology can make a big difference. All major automakers recognize that the shift from fossil-fueled cars to EV is inevitable, and are investing accordingly. A price on carbon pollution would accelerate the transition. US gasoline prices remain low at around $2.50 per gallon, which leads to more Americans buying cars with low fuel efficiency. 97% of US car sales are still purely gasoline-powered. The transition to EVs is proceeding slowly, but it’s coming, and it will be a big part of any future American efforts to meet climate targets."
"Repeated large-scale coral bleaching events are the new normal thanks to global warming, a team of international scientists has found. In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers revealed a “dramatic shortening” of the time between bleaching events was “threatening the future existence of these iconic ecosystems and the livelihoods of many millions of people”.  The study examined 100 tropical reef locations across the world, analysing existing data on coral bleaching events as well as new field research conducted on the Great Barrier Reef after the longest and worst case of bleaching caused by climate change killed almost 25% of the coral. “Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions,” said lead author Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. “Now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise.” The study found that time between bleaching events had diminished five-fold in the past 30 to 40 years, and was now too short to allow for a full recovery and was approaching unsustainable levels. While mass bleaching events used to occur about once every 27 years, by 2016 the median time between them had shrunk to 5.9 years. Only six of the 100 sites had escaped bleaching. “Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale,” the paper said. Globally, the annual risk of severe and moderate bleaching had increased by almost 4% a year since the 1980s, from an expected 8% of locations to 31% in 2016.  The Western Atlantic remained at highest risk but Australasia and the Middle East saw the strongest increases in risk of bleaching. Hughes said he hoped the “stark results” would prompt stronger action on reducing greenhouse gases. In May scientists warned that the central goal of the Australian government’s protection plan was no longer feasible because of the dramatic impact of climate change. Friday’s paper also determined the link between El Niño and mass bleaching events has diminished as global warming continues. Prior to the 1980s mass coral bleaching on a regional scale was “exceedingly rare or absent” and occurred in localised areas stretching tens of kilometres, not the hundreds of kilometres affected in recent times, the paper said. These local bleaching events were largely caused by small-scale stressors like unusually hot or cold weather, freshwater inundation or sedimentation. Then global warming increased the thermal stress of strong El Niño events, the paper said, widening the impact of individual bleaching events. Now, they are occurring at any time. “Back in the 80s it was only during El Niño events that waters became hot enough to damage corals and induce them to bleach,” co-author Andrew Baird, a professor at James Cook University, told Guardian Australia. “But now it’s 30, 40 years later and we’re seeing those temperatures in normal years.” Baird said it was difficult to know if the current conditions were reversible but “the window to address it is diminishing”. “It’s impossible to know if this is the end of coral reefs but it might be,” he said. “We really need to get on top of climate change as soon as possible.” There have been several large-scale and devastating mass bleaching events in recent years. The 2015-16 event affected 75% of the reefs studied by the researchers, who said it was comparable to the then unprecedented mass bleaching of 1997-98, when 74% were affected. “Interestingly one of the first papers that effectively drew attention to the issue – back in 1999 – suggested that by 2016, 2017, 2020, we would be seeing bleaching annually,” Baird said. “That’s pretty close to what’s happening unfortunately. “Some of these earlier works were quite prescient in their prediction and unfortunately we didn’t pay enough attention back then.” The study follows a discovery late last year that 3% of the Great Barrier Reef could facilitate recovery after bleaching – a finding the researchers at the time suggested was akin to a life-support system but small enough not to be taken for granted. On Friday scientists announced that a major outbreak of coral-eating crown of thorns starfish had been found munching the Great Barrier Reef in December, prompting the Australian government to begin culling the spiky marine animals.  The predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue.  “Each starfish eats about its body diameter a night, and so over time that mounts up very significantly,” Hugh Sweatman, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science told ABC radio. “A lot of coral will be lost,” he said.  The crown of thorns were found in plague proportions in the Swains reefs, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, by researchers from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The authority already killed some starfish at Swains reefs in December and said it would mount another mission in January. There have been four major crown of thorns outbreaks since the 1960s in the Great Barrier Reef but it recovered each time because there were always healthy populations of herbivorous fish. The outbreaks are usually triggered by extra nutrients in the water but the reason for the current outbreak was unclear, Sweatman said.   Additional reporting by Reuters "
"Some of the most common avatars of climate change – hulking power stations and billowing smokestacks – may need a slight update. For the first time in more than 40 years, the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the US isn’t electricity production but transport – cars, trucks, planes, trains and shipping.  Emissions data has placed transport as the new king of climate-warming pollution at a time when the Trump administration is reviewing or tearing up regulations that would set tougher emissions standards for car and truck companies. Republicans in Congress are also pushing new fuel economy rules they say will lower costs for American drivers but could also weaken emissions standards.   Opponents of the administration fret this agenda will imperil public health and hinder the effort to address climate change.   “This Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t seem to have met an air regulation that it likes,” said Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and a former EPA assistant administrator. “I’ve not seen any evidence that this administration knows anything about the auto industry, they just seem to be against anything the Obama administration did. “Vehicle emissions are going up, so clearly not enough is being done on that front. The Trump administration is halting further progress at a critical point when we really need to get a grip on this problem.” The 1970 Clean Air Act, signed by Richard Nixon, set standards for a cocktail of different pollutants emitted from new vehicles. New cars and trucks, which account for more than 80% of transport emissions, now have to meet fuel efficiency standards and display this information to consumers. This approach has helped cleanse previously smog-laden American cities and tamp down greenhouse gas emissions.  But in 2016, about 1.9bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions were emitted from transportation, up nearly 2% on the previous year, according to the Energy Information Administration. This increase means that transport has overtaken power generation as the most polluting sector in the country, and it’s likely to stay that way.   Cheap gasoline prices have led to a recent uptick in vehicle emissions, despite the fuel standards, at the same time that coal is being rapidly displaced by an abundance of cheap natural gas and the steady rise of renewable energy, driving a sharp decline in CO2 emissions from the power grid.   While coalminers have lost their jobs to technological advancement and environmental protesters have thrown their bodies in the path of oil pipelines, there has been far less to disrupt the basic emissions-emitting models of cars, trucks and planes.  Americans are buying larger cars and taking more flights – domestic aviation emissions grew 10% between 2012 and 2016 – and face little opposition in doing so.  “The change in power generation has been very impressive over the past 10 to 15 years,” said Brett Smith, assistant director of the Center for Automotive Research.  “In the automotive sector, there isn’t the same push. There are certainly Americans concerned about global warming but people are driving bigger and bigger vehicles each year. It’s not a priority for them. The cost of fuel is pretty cheap and at the moment there isn’t a better option out there than the internal combustion engine.”  Transport accounts for about a quarter of all US planet-warming emissions but also poses a direct health threat to about 45 million Americans who live, work or attend school within 300ft of roads that are shrouded in high air pollution levels.   This pollution can stunt lung growth, trigger asthma attacks, exacerbate heart disease and cause developmental problems. The EPA estimates 17,000 schools across the US are located next to roads with heavy traffic, with children from low-income and minority groups disproportionately put at risk. California is the only state in the US to ban the construction of a school on the cheap land found beside major highways.   US cities haven’t emulated the likes of London and Stockholm by charging drivers a congestion fee to coax them on to public transport, cycling or walking; nor does the US feature the comparatively high rates of fuel tax seen in Europe. France’s move to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 would be politically unthinkable in the States. But the air is much cleaner in American cities than it was in the 1970s, and a world away from the fug that now envelops Beijing and Delhi, in part due to vehicle emissions standards that have progressively been ratcheted up by the EPA.   That trajectory has been cast in doubt by the Trump presidency. In March, the EPA scrapped a deal struck between Barack Obama’s administration and automakers that would require new cars to run 54.4 miles per gallon of fuel, up from 27.5 miles per gallon, by 2025.   The White House said the new rules had been “shoved down the throats” of car makers, with the main industry lobby group pointing out that consumers overwhelmingly prioritize safety, driving performance and value for money over fuel efficiency. There are more than 70 car models on sale that achieve 40 miles per gallon and they account for just 1% of total new vehicle sales.   Then, last month, the EPA cited “regulatory overreach” by the previous administration for its decision to waive clean truck standards that would have phased out “glider” vehicles that produce 55 times more diesel soot than new trucks. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA, said his predecessors had “attempted to bend the rule of law and expand the reach of the federal government in a way that threatened to put an entire industry of specialized truck manufacturers out of business”.  These rollbacks from the executive branch have dovetailed with an effort by Republicans in the Senate and the House to revamp fuel efficiency rules by replacing state and federal requirements with a single standard. Environmental groups and previous administration officials fear this will lead to a further weakening of emissions standards.  “America’s clean car standards have dramatically improved the fuel efficiency of vehicles, saving consumers billions of dollars and cutting pollution in the process,” said Carol Browner, a former administrator of the EPA.  “Instead of rolling back commonsense, successful and popular clean cars standards, we should focus on innovation and technology that will continue the auto industry’s growth and the pollution reductions we’ve achieved since these standards were first established.”  In the short term, this new approach risks a flashpoint between the federal government and California, which has a long-held waiver to enact vehicle pollution standards in excess of the national requirements. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, follow California’s standards, an alliance that covers more than 130 million residents and about a third of the US vehicle market.   Nichols said she had been disturbed by signals coming from Pruitt and other EPA officials that she said show the federal government is looking to end California’s waiver.   “We are very concerned because these standards are the bedrock of our whole climate change platform,” she said. “Scott Pruitt has made threatening noises about the Californian waiver, saying that we are trying to run the country. It feels like this is going to be the next shoe to drop. If it does, we will litigate and fight for our rights in the political arena with other states and consumer advocates.”  With federal regulation set to be pared back, technological advances in electric and gas-powered cars, as well as consumer preferences, are likely to play an increasingly important role in whether vehicle emissions are forced back down.   A flurry of recent optimistic studies have forecast that, by 2040, as much as 90% of all cars in the US will be electric. But the current conundrum is that petroleum-fueled vehicles are cheaper and seen as more reliable than their electric counterparts by most new buyers. Affordable gasoline is competing with electric recharging stations that are considered too sparse by many drivers to risk running out of puff, no matter the benefit to the environment.  “It’s a challenging position for automotive companies because they are touting electric vehicles but ultimately they have to sell more cars,” said Smith. “Consumers in the US aren’t pushing for electric vehicles to the extent they are in Europe and unless we take a very different approach as a country, that doesn’t look like it will change soon.  “You will need to see a major change in battery technology to make it viable. People are becoming more aware and concerned about global warming, but we aren’t there yet. And when you look at the vehicles being put out by the major car companies, you could argue it’s not an issue for them, either.”"
"A long winding road climbs into a gathering dusk, coming to an abrupt dead end in front of a house. Here, a solitary flickering flame casts out a warm glow, illuminating the nearby ridge line of the Malvern Hills.  Below the light sits a mysterious green contraption resembling a cross between a giant washing machine and a weather station. This is the UK’s first dog poo-powered street lamp, and it is generating light in more ways than one. The idea seems simple enough: dog walkers deposit the product of a hearty walk into a hatch and turn a handle. The contents are then broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digester, producing methane to fuel the light, and fertiliser. Brian Harper, who started work on the machine three years ago after becoming fed up of seeing plump little bags hanging in trees and on grass verges, reckons that 10 bags will power the light for two hours each evening. “The gas light captures people’s imagination and shows them dog poo has a value,” says Harper, who developed the system with funding from the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. “As a result, we get it [poo] off the ground, into a receptacle, and producing something useful.” The next step is to try to interest managers of urban parks in the technology. Humans have used animal dung as fuel since the neolithic period, and have known how to get flammable gas from decaying organic matter since the 17th century. Small-scale anaerobic digesters are commonplace in many developing countries, while larger plants producing heat and electricity from animal manure and human sewage have long been used in the west. Yet the energy in most excrement still goes to waste. Greater exploitation of this most plentiful resource has been held back by the availability of artificially cheap fossil fuel. But now Harper is at the vanguard of a new movement of innovators finding ingenious, sustainable ways of harnessing the power of excrement. Local politicians in Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, are thinking along similar lines to tackle a different problem. Dog walkers who use three parks in the city are being asked to drop their pet’s poo into concrete storage units. These are periodically emptied by trucks that take it to a large central plant where it is broken down along with other forms of organic waste to produce methane and then electricity. The fertiliser byproduct is sold to farmers.  Analysis of the first five months of an 18-month trial suggests that at the current rate, the scheme would generate enough electricity to power 13 homes and remove 630kg of CO2 from the atmosphere. Modest returns perhaps – but not the main goals of the project.   “Collecting dog waste separately prevents it contaminating our recycling streams, allowing us to divert both away from our landfill sites,” says Jeff Silcox-Childs, Waterloo’s director of environment and parks.  In India, the use of small household biodigesters to get gas for fuel from cow manure is common. One social enterprise is deploying the technology on a larger scale as part of a major initiative to end open defecation in the country by 2019.   Sanitation and Health Rights in India (SHRI) turned to biodigestion as a way to keep public toilets clean – a major issue with existing communal facilities. At an initial cost of $30,000, SHRI builds blocks of 16 free-to-use toilets, half for men and half for women. The resulting sewage is broken down in a biodigester to produce methane, which powers a groundwater pump. The water is filtered, bottled and sold for half a rupee (half a pence) per litre, to pay for approximately half of the maintenance costs.  “We are using existing technologies in ways they haven’t been connected before to help people in India get the safe, well-maintained and hygienic toilets they deserve,” says SHRI’s cofounder Anoop Jain. The group opened its first community toilet block in 2014 and is currently building its seventh.  Back in the UK, the Bristol-based GENeco, a subsidiary of Wessex Water, ran its famous Bio-Bug trial in which a VW Beetle was converted to run on methane extracted from human waste. The use of biomethane from sewage plants to power cars is more widespread in other countries, such as Sweden.  In 2014 GENeco launched its Bio-Bus, the UK’s first bus powered by gas generated from sewage and food waste. Capable of running for 300km on a full tank, it produces significantly less carbon dioxide and air pollution than fossil fuel-powered equivalents. It ran in trials between Bath and Bristol Airport and then, naturally, on Bristol’s “Number 2” bus route.  GENeco also runs a facility that processes human sewage and food waste to generate enriched biomethane that is injected into the grid, providing fuel for some 5,000-6,000 homes. Severn Trent also opened an anaerobic digestion plant for sewage at Minworth near Birmingham in 2014.  “Our facility is no longer a traditional sewage treatment works but a factory, taking inputs including sewage and food waste and turning them into products including gas for cooking or transport and nitrogen- and phosphate-rich fertiliser,” says Mohammed Saddiq, managing director of GENeco. “People talk about the circular economy, but what we are doing is putting that vision into practice.”  While GENeco’s gas-to-grid operation is certainly greener than traditional facilities, there is another input that muddies the water. It, and others like it, receive subsidies under the government’s renewable heat incentive. Moreover some argue that large-scale operations involving transporting biomass to a central location are not necessarily the best of solutions. This was the starting point for SEaB Energy, a Southampton-based company assembling modular, automated, odour-free anaerobic digesters in shipping containers. So far it has mainly sold units designed to process food waste, but it is currently assembling its first commercial Muckbuster units, due for installation in Japan and in Brazil in 2018.  Sandra Sassow, CEO and cofounder of SEaB, warns that some facilities that turn biomass, including excrement, into energy may not be as green as they appear, if, for example, they use fuel to transport waste a long way before it is turned into an energy source.  Right now, waste is collected, trucked, moved and processed, often ending up in landfill at worst or having some energy extracted from it at best, says Sassow.  “We want to disrupt that completely to incorporate decentralised, distributed, on-site appliances into farms and buildings around the world. A lot of things have been tried, but it’s a case of finding a technology that produces an energy benefit over the full life cycle, not just an apparent energy benefit.”"
"In the week before Christmas the government yet again released its latest data on greenhouse gas emissions in the hope they would be missed amid other news and the nearing festivities. As we start the new year let us revisit the data and highlight just how terrible the government’s record on emission reduction has been. The news that the temperature in Penrith reached 47.3C on Sunday naturally had people talking of climate change. And while noting that a very hot day is evidence of climate change is not as stupid as the very stable genius, Donald Trump, suggesting that the cold snap in the east of the USA meant climate change was fake, we should remember that weather – even if it is hot – is still not climate. Fortunately we do have data that shows the average temperatures for the entire planet over a year, and not just for a day, in a particular part of Australia. Less fortunate however, the data shows that things are very bad. 2017 will be the second warmest year on record and easily the warmest ever for a year not affected by El Nino: It means that 2017 will be first time in six years that the calendar year has not been warmer than the one which preceded it. But that is small comfort, given it is warmer than every single year that did precede it but one. All this fits appropriately with the news of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. I should of course note that the news is a bit old – although you might have missed it. In 2016, the government released its emissions data on the Thursday before Christmas Day. Last year they were a bit better – they did it on the Tuesday before Christmas. Rather coincidentally it was also the day Malcolm Turnbull announced the reshuffle of his ministry and the government released its energy policy review. I know the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, would be disappointed if you had missed the release amid all that news, so let me give you a recap: short version – they are terrible; long version – they are terrible, and there is little hope that they will get better. In the 12 months to September 2016, Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions rose to a record level of 550.2 Mt CO2-e if you include the rather dodgy emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors. The government’s report sought to paint a nice picture, noting that this was just 0.7% above the previous year and was “0.8% below emissions in 2000 and 9.1% below emissions in 2005”. But we can all cherry pick dates. For example, while it might be below 2000 and 2005 levels the latest emissions are around 4% above where they were in June 2014. The government likes to include LULUCF emissions when comparing with 2000 and 2005, because back then we had a lot of such emissions, due to tree clearing and the like: If we include such emissions in our overall count it means we can reduce our emissions by simply planting trees, or not clearing land (or promising to do so). That is why both in the Kyoto protocol and in the 2005 Paris agreement, Australian governments have made sure such emissions are counted. Unfortunately this has been a long practice. The release of the latest cabinet papers from the final years of the Keating government showed the then ALP government sought a “no regrets” policy on climate change which essentially meant doing nothing that would increase electricity prices and trying to achieve reductions through limiting land clearing and planting trees. The exclusion of LULUCF emissions shows just how greatly this affects our goal of reducing emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030: Including LULULCF has us currently 9.1% below 2005 levels, but if you exclude them, Australia’s emissions are nearly 6% higher than they were in 2005. The reality is “no regrets” and other climate change cons such as a “green army” or direct action do not work. And the latest emissions data shows this clearly. Since the removal of the carbon price in June 2014, annual emissions have grown every quarter: And you don’t need to be a Rhodes scholar presiding over a party room full of climate change deniers to know why. Putting a price on carbon provided an incentive for firms to use less of it. Removing that price removed the incentive. It’s fortunate for the government that there is some good news – though this good news occurred in spite of its policies rather than due to them. Annual electricity emissions have fallen – down 3.7% in the last year. But mostly this is due to a fall in demand for electricity and the reduction in the use of brown coal generated electricity due to the closure of the Hazelwood power station: The problem for the government is that while the inclusion of LULUCF emissions and slowing electricity demand do help their path towards a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, they remain a very long way from achieving that aim. The government also released its latest emissions projection figures. And while the projections are lower than they were a year ago, they still predict Australia’s emissions by 2030 will be just 5% below 2005 levels: The government’s energy policy – even if it allows a quasi price on carbon through buying of international permits – will not do anywhere near enough to reach the goal (no matter how much it annoys Tony Abbott). The problem is that even if electricity emissions were to fall by 26% below 2005 levels, Australia’s overall emissions would still be just 9% below 2005 levels (and 4% above if you exclude LULUCF emissions). The time has come for our politicians to quit pretending we can reduce emissions painlessly. If that was actually possible it would have already been done by every government on the planet. Climate change isn’t a problem because the solution is easy. Time is running out. Yes, Australia only has a small percentage of the global land mass and emissions but either we are part of the global solution or we stand complicit with the ignorant and the charlatans who would say it is all a hoax. The aim is to stop temperatures from rising to more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. We are already around 1.1C above those levels. Even using a very conservative liner trend of the past 50 years (something that is close to a best case scenario) we will reach 2C by 2071 – just 53 years time. If that sounds a long time away, note that according the latest life expectancy figures all Australia males under 28 and all females under 32 can expect to live till then. That means 41% of Australians will likely live to experience such temperatures, unless action is taken. But while we have a government with climate change deniers in key cabinet positions and which hides emissions data under the cover of Christmas holidays and a news dump I have little faith Australia will be part of any such action."
"Camille Parmesan, a biologist at the universities of Texas and Plymouth, is one of the world’s most influential climate change scientists, having shown how butterflies and other species are affected by it across all continents. She is one of 18 US scientists moving to France to take up President Macron’s invitation of refuge after Donald Trump’s decision to cut science funding and withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement. What has made you leave the US?The impact of Trump on climate science has been far greater than what the public believe it has. He has not only slashed funding, but he’s gone on the attack in any way he can with his powers as the president. University researchers are buffered from this, but scientists working at government agencies have really felt the blow. They have been muffled and not allowed to speak freely with the press, they have had their reports altered to remove “climate change” from the text, and are being told to leave climate change out of future reports and funding proposals. This degrades the entire climate science community. Scientists are fighting back, but Congress needs to exercise its constitutional powers and keep the executive branch in check. This is not a partisan issue – this is about the future of America.  Are you angry?None of us expected Trump to win. It was a real shock. It was horrifying to have him as a candidate. He was so extreme. Frankly, I am not just angry at the far right, extreme Republican groups but also with [some] liberals who bought the Russian propaganda and who are not taking responsibility. And with people who didn’t vote. Good lord. You need to vote! It was a bit like Brexit. Many young people did not vote. I understand they did not want a mainstream candidate but they got Trump and Brexit. Why go to France?I came to the UK for family reasons seven years ago. But I was not happy with my department at the University of Texas. Research funding has gone down so much in the US. I had a big collaborative grant and I wanted to continue it, but it looked like funding was not there. Then Brexit happened, Trump got elected and President Macron made his offer [to fund climate research]. It was perfect timing. His initiative brings me to France, which allows me to apply for EU money. You are now in a select club?None of us knew each other until we met before Christmas in Paris. We were like giddy little teenagers, saying “Isn’t this great!” I was happy to take five years out but some of the others have retained dual positions. I will be moving to a small field station in the foothills of the Pyrenees. It has fabulous facilities. It’s torture, isn’t it? What will be your research?It will be on the impact of climate change on wild species. To date, I have done mainly meta-analyses of species movements, like to the poles or up mountains. It has been important from a policy perspective. Policymakers need big-picture numbers, like half or two thirds of species are moving. I don’t want to do meta-analyses now. That’s done. Now I am going to do a series of different projects, all looking at the effect of climate change on species, and the vulnerability of systems, such as the high Alps and mountain tops. I will be documenting the impacts because they are relatively understudied and looking at animals carrying diseases which may come to Europe. I did a small project linking leishmaniasis and climate change. Is there any difference between public attitudes to climate change in the US and UK?Average citizens in the UK are much better informed about issues, more science-knowledgeable and more likely to want to see policies based on the best science available than is the average US public. This was not always the case. Science historically has played a strong role in US policies and there was a bipartisan respect of scientific findings. I’ve seen this erode over the past 30 years, and really don’t know why this has happened. What has changed in climate research in the last few years?We are now seeing the impacts of climate change everywhere. None of us thought that we would find huge changes taking place in the oceans, which have been largely ignored. But the range shifts [migration of plants and animals] there are 10 times that of land. Also, we are seeing diseases coming from ocean systems, like outbreaks of vibrio poisoning [bacteria that occur naturally in warm coastal areas]. We think of these as being tropical but we are now seeing outbreaks in colder waters like the Baltic and Alaska. Are you surprised?I am shocked at the ubiquitousness of climate change. We are seeing change in every country and every ocean. That is what surprises biologists. All regions studied are being impacted. Every group of animal and plant, from the oak tree to birds, is being impacted. All groups are showing change. We would expect to find some regions or groups which are stable, but to date we are not. We are seeing change happen much faster than I thought it would 10 years ago. What is the present state of climate science?The science of climate change, and its impacts, is at a very strong place. Conclusions that were tentative 15-20 years ago have been firmed up and are now well supported. Numbers that used to be presented as rough estimates are now being given with high confidence and low error. So our conclusions are being stated with higher and higher confidence, and stronger wording, because all of the research we’ve been doing has backed up nearly all of the trends and patterns we saw many years ago. We are now sure of what we only suspected many years ago. This is great news for the public and policymakers, because it gives them the support to take strong action. Policy needs to catch up with science. When do you expect the major impacts to take place?Things will shift to the extremely negative in the next 50 years. Climate scientists are doing decadal projects and it starts really shifting about 2070-2090. That is in my children’s lifetimes. They will have to deal with it. That’s what makes me angry. Policymakers are mostly in their 50s and they will be dead by then. The worst impacts will hit their grandchildren. That’s what annoys me about young people not voting. They will be the most severely impacted. Look back on 2017 and forward to 2018?2017 was quite hopeful. Trump’s extremism on climate change has invigorated the populace in both Europe and the US to take action. The world refused to let Trump derail the Paris agreement and said it would move with more vigour. Trump has brought people together. The US withdrawal from Paris energised groups like the mayors who are now saying “we need to get this moving”. Both governor Jerry Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger before him in California have been very committed. The rest of the US will follow. Then you have Michael Bloomberg, Bill Gates and other multi-billionaires saying business will do it on its own. That has been fabulous. Developing countries, too, are rejecting the idea of going dirty and are going green. We’re seeing new and wonderful groups being formed at all levels and across all sectors to take action. I think we’ll see projects for carbon-cutting and green energy at the local and state levels that will overwhelm anything the White House tries to do. I think the shocks we’ll see in 2018 will be positive ones. What about the deniers?People like believing in fiction in the face of reality. We’ve had many climate disasters and they haven’t woken up the minority who are still living in a fictional universe. People want to believe this lie and I don’t know how to get through to them. But hurricanes like Harvey and Katrina have woken up middle-of-the-road people. It’s not that they were denying climate change, but it was unimportant to them. These people are beginning to understand it is impacting whole countries and regions. As a lepidopterist, is there any truth in the saying that a butterfly beating its wings in one part of the world can set off a tornado in another?Metaphorically, yes. My 1996 Nature study on Edith’s checkerspot butterflies was one of the first to document impacts of climate change on wildlife. It was viewed by many ecologists as the first “clear” evidence for climate change impacts because of its very large geographic extent. It may be said to have started a storm."
"BP has declared it is looking to acquire more green energy firms, as the British oil giant pledged to set carbon targets for its operations. However, while the chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the industry was in a period of major change, he made clear that hydrocarbons would remain the core of BP’s business. “It’s not a race to renewables, it’s a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. As fast as renewables and clean energy can grow, faster than any fuel in history, the world is going to require oil and gas for some decades to come,” he said. The company reported on Tuesday that higher oil prices and growing crude production had pushed up profits 139% in 2017 to $6.2bn (£4.5bn) on an underlying replacement cost basis, the company’s preferred measure.  Dudley said the firm had enjoyed its most successful year for exploration since 2004. The company said it would start six new oil and gas projects this year, up from five previously, as it outlined a plan to return to growth into the next decade. But much of the company’s strategy update focused on clean energy, which BP said would amount to around $0.5bn of its $15bn-$16bn capital expenditure programme. The carbon targets, including one for methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, will be announced by BP in the next two months. Discussing the shift to green energy, Lamar McKay, the deputy chief executive, said: “Our industry is changing faster than any of us can remember, certainly in my career.” BP recently bought a $200m stake in Europe’s biggest solar developer, returning to solar power six years after it quit the sector, and is reportedly eyeing other bigger solar investments.  The oil company is not the only one active in diversifying its business. In the last three months of 2017, its Anglo-Dutch peer, Shell, bought a Dutch car-charging network, partnered with the electric car charging firm Ionity and bought First Utility, one of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers. One of the most eye-catching energy innovations of the last year – the deployment of the world’s first floating windfarm – was undertaken not by a renewables developer but Norway’s state-owned oil company, Statoil. Meanwhile, France’s Total took a 23% stake in the renewable energy firm Eren for €237.5m (£211m). Big oil has flagged a switch to greener energy before. In the early 2000s, spurred by investor pressure, the international oil companies appeared to be pivoting to move their businesses away from crude.  BP memorably tried to reinvent itself in 2000, promising that in the future its initials would stand for Beyond Petroleum, as the chairman, Sir John Browne, told the world: “We are not an oil company.” Shell also moved heavily into renewables. But not long after the financial crash, Shell stopped investment in wind and solar, and BP shut its alternative energy HQ. Later, around 2016, the oil giants began to take baby steps back into the world of renewables, and take greater notice of the rapid growth of electric cars.  Valentina Kretzschmar, the director of research at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said although activity had intensified in recent months, it was still small-scale. “It’s buzzing, but the amount of money spent is still peanuts compared to their core business,” she said. Shell is seen by many industry watchers as the leader in this transition. The chief executive, Ben van Beurden, last week defended the company’s $1bn-$2bn spend on clean energy as modest but “not a pittance”. “Ultimately, the only thing that matters to society is the carbon intensity of energy. How much we invest in aspects of our portfolio is only a secondary concern,” he said, in a message similar to BP’s. Investor pressure, consumer attitudes and governments’ climate change policies are all driving big oil’s transformation. But increasingly it is the economics of renewables and electric cars that are key. “For many of them, when they started diversifying it was because of investor pressure … but I think now it’s the market forces that are making them look into diversification,” said Kretzschmar. However, she noted that returns for renewables were still lower than for oil and gas. Irene Rummelhoff, the head of Statoil’s low carbon unit, agreed that returns were lower but were often fixed at a set level, so diversifying made a “huge difference” to cutting risk from volatile oil prices. “That’s one of the advantages we are seeing in the renewable world; the risk profile is very different,” she said. But the rate of change is slow. Big oil companies own less than 1% of solar and wind capacity globally, according to Wood Mackenzie. Jeremy Leggett, a former petroleum geologist turned solar entrepreneur, said: “All this is beyond greenwash, but far short of retreat consistent with the Paris [climate] agreement. The oil and gas companies and are essentially taking out hedge bets.” Still, observers think that big oil might really be serious about moving beyond petroleum this time round, for existential reasons. “It is different this time around,” said Kretzschmar. “This [the rise of renewables, electric cars and other clean technologies] is for the first time starting to pose a threat to their oil and gas businesses. That wasn’t the case in the early noughties.”"
"Gamagori city in Japan was put on alert this week after toxic fish went on sale in a local supermarket. Pufferfish are considered a delicacy in Japan, often eaten raw as sashimi or cooked in soups. But if the fish are not carefully prepared they can be deadly.  The supermarket in Gamagori failed to remove the liver from the fish before putting them on sale, and unfortunately the liver is one of the organs that can harbour the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. In an effort to recall the potentially poisonous fish sold, loudspeakers across the city have been warning citizens of the danger; at the time of writing, three of the five packs of fish sold had been traced. The risks of eating pufferfish are widely known in Japan and the preparation and sale of the fish is tightly regulated. Nevertheless, poisonings happen every year but, because the symptoms are recognised, effective treatment can be very successful and fatalities are rare.  However, pufferfish are widely distributed in tropical waters – and those consumers and those fishing outside Asian countries aren’t always aware of the dangers. The fish has also invaded new territories in recent years posing new problems, especially for fishermen not familiar with the species. Relatively recently, the fish have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean.  The Suez Canal when it opened in 1869 brought dramatic changes to world trade. It also brought with it invasive species from the Red Sea: 925 non-native species have been recorded in the eastern Mediterranean since the opening of the canal. Migration of species in the opposite direction is relatively rare because the Red Sea is comparatively saltier and nutrient poor. One of the invading species, the silver-cheeked toadfish (Lagocephalus sceleratus), is a type of pufferfish most usually found in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The toadfish appears to be thriving off the Turkish coast and is of particular concern for several reasons. The main cause for concern is its economic impact. The silver-cheeked toadfish has strong teeth that it can use to bite through fishing lines and nets to get to the trapped fish. The damage to fishing gear is one thing, but the toadfish will then go on to feast on the abundance of food it finds inside the nets, meaning several kilos of the catch are often unsaleable. The financial losses to fishermen, who are already often on very low incomes, have been increasing in recent years.  The other concern is the toxicity of the fish. Tetrodotoxin is found in several of the silver-cheeked toadfish organs, including the ovaries and liver. This powerful neurotoxin, when pure, can kill an adult human at a dosage of as little as two milligrams. It is far more potent a poison than arsenic or cyanide. In the body, tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels that enable nerves to fire. It kills because nerves no longer trigger muscle movement controlling breathing and the victim suffocates. The toxin can also induce heart failure. There is no antidote and treatment is to support breathing artificially until the body excretes the toxin naturally. The treatment is very successful, with many people making a full recovery.  There is no market for pufferfish as a delicacy in Turkey but the fishermen often eat the fish they catch because they can’t sell it elsewhere. A recent survey found that 38% of surveyed fishermen had consumed pufferfish and of that group, 11% had shown symptoms of intoxication. Clearly, messages about the dangers of this fish have not been getting through.   The poison is not produced by the fish itself. Rather, it is a product of environmental bacteria that accumulate in the fish. Pufferfish are not the only species that can accumulate tetrodotoxin in this way. There is evidence that tetrodotoxin-contaminated seafood is spreading northwards – it has even been found off the southern coast of England. In this case it the fish involved wasn’t the silver-cheeked toadfish, as these are likely to remain in the eastern Mediterranean where the water is much warmer. Instead, tetrodotoxin was detected in molluscs – pacific oysters, native oysters, mussels and hard clams. The studies carried out so far have been small but substantial enough to highlight a potential problem and give hints of the causes and circumstances to be wary of. For example, not all species in all conditions are affected in the same way. Pacific oysters in the summer months from shallow, low saline sites show the highest levels of the toxin. Sea temperatures of at least 15°C seem to be needed to produce detectable levels of the toxin.  Sea temperatures around the UK coastline have already shown an increase of over 0.7°C over the last 30 years. These temperatures are likely to increase, as is rainfall, due to global warming. The speculation is that conditions will become increasingly favourable for the tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. What is certain is that more studies need to be carried out to understand the nature of any potential problem and identify what can be done.  Educating people about the dangers is certainly one important aspect of poisoning prevention. Screening can also help stop contaminated food from going on sale, but there might be ways of reducing the levels of toxin in the first place. For molluscs this may not be easy, but there are ways of removing the silver-cheeked toadfish from the Mediterranean and reducing the threat of poisoning there.  Fishing for the toadfish and removing it from the environment is one method, but there are few incentives to do this. There is no market to sell the fish for food, so bounties have been proposed for each fish landed. Unfortunately, the amount offered per fish is unlikely to be enough to give financial incentive for Turkish fishermen to catch the species.  Fortunately, there might be another market for this fish: medicine.  Tetrodotoxin, whilst proving extremely dangerous in high doses, may have medical benefits in lower doses. Studies have shown that in some circumstances the toxin may relieve pain, particularly in cancer patients. At a time when we are increasingly looking for alternatives to opiates for pain relief, tetrodotoxin may be one candidate; it has even been shown to reduce the pain of withdrawal from opiates. It may ultimately be the case that this invasive species could provide valuable benefits."

"As divisions between them widen on Earth, space must be where countries show they can work together for a common good, France’s best-known astronaut has said in a powerful plea for international cooperation beyond the final frontier. “From up there, the Earth seems so small, so tiny, so … the same,” said Thomas Pesquet, who spent 196 days, 17 hours and 49 minutes in space on the 50th and 51st expeditions to the International Space Station (ISS), returning in June last year.  “There are no borders. Even your own country – it’s impossible to make out where France ends, and Germany begins. You just realise, very strongly, how much we all share the same problems, how much we are, all of us, almost identical.” Pesquet, who arrived on the ISS six months after his friend, Britain’s Tim Peake, left it, said the joint project between the US, Russian, Japanese, Canadian and European space agencies was a potent symbol of how countries can cooperate above the Earth even as below, interests diverge and tensions mount. “Today no single country can go into space on its own,” he said. “The days when even the US could do that are long gone. And of course, up there, it’s very clear: you can only work together. You may have different views, but you have to get along. You have to make it work, every day, because you’re on the same spaceship.” Pesquet, 39, said his spell in space – which made him so famous in France that a semi-serious campaign was launched for him to enter the presidential race – had brought home to him the urgent need for more, not less, international cooperation in the face of the planet’s “extraordinary fragility”. Known as the overview effect, the experience of observing from 250 miles up the reality of Earth in the vastness of space has long been known to produce a cognitive shift in some astronauts. It transformed Pesquet into a militant environmentalist.  “I was already concerned about climate change and global warming,” he said, “but in a general way, like everyone else. But it’s happening on such a vast scale that from close up, it’s hard for us to grasp. In space, you take this huge step back. You experience it, fully. That really changes something.” Throughout his entire half-year stay, Pesquet said, he had been unable to take a clear picture of Beijing. “You see the air pollution: it’s right there,” he said. “You see the river and sea pollution. You see the clear-cutting in the Amazon. You see how much smaller South America’s glaciers are than they were a few years ago.” Viewed from orbit, what Pesquet called our “tiny, fragile planet, this delicate band of atmosphere that holds all of life, with nothing else all around it for billions of light years” prompted an obvious if startling comparison.  “The Earth is actually just a big spaceship, with a very, very big crew,” he said. “It really has to travel sensibly, be maintained and looked after properly, or its voyage is going to come to an end. That’s how it felt to me. That was my experience.” The obvious need for international cooperation – despite “frictions” created, for example, by Britain’s vote to leave the EU, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accords, which Pesquet has publicly dubbed irresponsible – has made high-profile projects in which countries “work visibly together” all the more important, Pesquet said.  While he regrets the Brexit vote, Pesquet, who was in London to take part in an embassy event marking France’s Night of Ideas, said he did not necessarily expect it to have a major impact on the Britain’s space programme beyond UK involvement in EU-run projects such as the Galileo GPS programme (whose back-up security monitoring centre, it was announced this month, is to be relocated to Spain).  The European Space Agency is not an EU body and Britain, Pesquet said, should continue to play its part. “I certainly hope so,” he said. “As things stand, Europe has always been a relatively small player in space – Japan has a bigger stake in the ISS on its own than all of Europe.” International space strategy over the coming years, he said, would aim to “open the door” for commercial operators, such as SpaceX’s Elon Musk and Virgin’s Richard Branson, to start operating in “near space”, while the professional agency astronauts push further into “deep space”. The primary objective would be to send a smaller ISS into an elliptical orbit round the moon. “The moon is the focus for now, not Mars,” Pesquet said. “It’s a sensible, immediate step. We can explore and research. Test the technology three days from Earth, rather than 300.” But whatever happens, the voices of the astronauts will be important, he said. Like Peake, who gained a big UK Twitter following during his ISS mission, Pesquet was huge on social media in France (“Much bigger than Tim,” he grinned. “You should write that. At one point I had five million followers on Facebook.”)  He lists the benefits of space exploration: modern navigation, communications, satellite and weather forecasting technologies are all by-products of man’s journeys into space. Of the 50 variables scientists use to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere and climate, more than half can only be measured from space; there is vital scientific research, notably in medicine, that can only be done in space.  In the past, the job of astronaut was largely scientific. “It’s about a lot more than that now,” said Pesquet. “It’s about teaching, demonstrating what people, and countries, can achieve when they really work together.” "
"The remit of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is one of the more complicated jigsaw puzzles in the world. Since 1988, it has overseen thousands of scientists pulling together tens of thousands of academic papers on atmospheric physics, meteorology, geography, marine science, economics, land-use and much more. A multi-layered process of expert assessment takes place every six or seven years where a set of carefully worded statements is approved by representatives of 120 of the world’s governments, specifying what we know about the defining challenge of the 21st century: climate change. It is an incredible, perhaps unprecedented undertaking – but until recently, it has been woefully underserved on the crucial issue of communicating its findings beyond specialist scientific and policy circles. And partly as a result of this, the organisation has historically been saddled with a reputation for being dry, bureaucratic and secretive.  But things are changing – which is good news for the climate. The IPCC has now recognised that it should take the same approach to communications as it does to science: go with the evidence base. In a handbook commissioned by the IPCC (Working Group 1, Technical Support Unit) and released on Tuesday, my colleagues and I at Climate Outreach provide social science-based guidance for IPCC scientists to use in their communication and public engagement. This is the first time advice like this has been produced for the world’s most prestigious climate science organisation, and it represents a timely and welcome shift. The IPCC’s next report will set out in greater clarity than ever before if – and how – we can avoid a rise of more than 1.5C in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels.  Communicating effectively around this crucial publication is essential, and our handbook sets out six well-established principles to achieve this, including the importance of ensuring the powerful human stories buried deep in the IPCC assessments are not swamped by the “big numbers” that define the science-policy discourse. Although they are the go-to metrics for scientists and politicians, global temperature targets or atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are unlikely to be understood or seen as personally relevant by a majority of the public. Starting with the everyday things that climate change is now profoundly influencing – tourism, health, important places – is a better approach, providing a solid grounding in shared values and local interests. There’s also a big focus in the handbook on showing the “human face behind the science”. By and large, scientists are highly trusted because of their independence, specialist expertise, and credibility. But trust is also about speaking authentically, as a relatable individual, with personal experiences and perspectives (not just a compelling grasp of the data). Who are the IPCC scientists? What are their stories? What is involved in an IPCC process at a human level? Another exciting development is that the social science of human behaviour is now increasingly making its way into the IPCC assessments themselves, addressing a long-standing blind spot in the long list of topics included in the IPCC’s remit.  The more social sciences can be integrated into assessments of the causes and consequences of climate change, the better – because one of the biggest uncertainties in any climate model is human behaviour. To properly understand how the climate is changing, and how likely we are to keep its most dangerous effects in check, we need to understand it as a social and cultural challenge as much as a scientific one. There will no doubt be a small group of hardliners who object to the very idea of scientists being more effective communicators, or including social science research in the assessment reports. But their argument that scientists should refrain from speaking about the societal implications of their vital research is an outmoded and increasingly discredited position. The science of climate change communication is a much-needed addition to the IPCC’s canon – and an essential next step in the evolution of this unique organisation."
"Policies aimed at limiting climate change by boosting the burning of biomass contain critical flaws that could actually damage attempts to avert dangerous levels of global warming in the future. That is the stark view of one of Britain’s chief climate experts, Professor John Beddington, who has warned that relying on the cutting down and burning of trees as a replacement for the use of fossil fuels could rebound dangerously. Beddington, a former UK government chief scientific adviser, said there was now a real risk that increasing wood-burning in order to help European countries, including Britain, reach renewable energy targets could turn out to be misguided. “These policies may even lead to a situation whereby global emissions [of carbon dioxide] accelerate,” he states in a blog on Carbon Brief, the UK-based website that covers climate and energy issues. He says wind and solar projects should dominate programmes to boost renewable energy generation in Europe.  Beddington, whose views are backed by several other eminent climate experts, said the burning of biomass – wood or other renewable organic materials – had the benefit of replacing fossil fuels, whose combustion raises carbon levels in the atmosphere, a process that is now warming the planet dangerously. Biomass absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then releases it in a relatively brief life-cycle which should, theoretically, have a restricted long-term impact on the atmosphere. As a result, giant power stations, including Britain’s Drax generators, are increasingly abandoning gas or coal as power sources and are instead turning to the burning of wood, usually in the form of pellets imported from other countries such as the United States and Canada. But burning wood to produce electricity is a relatively inefficient process. In generating exactly the same amount of electricity, wood will release four times as much carbon into the atmosphere as gas would do, and one and half times as much as coal. In addition, energy is used in harvesting and transport while vast stretches of land are needed to create the forests to supply generating stations with the wood they need. This also has profound environmental impacts for a world that will soon be home to more than 10 billion humans who will need every scrap of productive land to provide food. Over the past decade, Europe has increased its use of renewable energy sources to provide it with power, and about half of that rise has come from burning biomass. Unfortunately, says Beddington, if that increase continues Europe will soon need to burn an amount of wood greater than its total harvest and would have to seek sources from other continents. Either land for farming would be turned to biomass growing or precious natural habitats will be exploited, most probably the latter. “If Europe chooses this route, it seems likely that a consequence will be vastly greater removals which will come mostly from natural forest globally,” he states. Given that forests like those of the Amazon absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide, this destruction would only worsen the planet’s climate woes. “The result of promoting a system of biomass electricity from dedicated tree harvesting will in all realistic scenarios mean there will be substantially more carbon in the air for decades, regardless of the type of forest and no matter how sustainably they are managed,” he says. He calculates that carbon emissions will rise by 6% or possibly more if wood is allowed to continue to provide more and more of Europe’s energy output, rather than a reduction of at least 6% that would come from using other renewable sources, such as solar or wind power. This point was backed by climate expert Phillip Williamson of the University of East Anglia. He said a switch from fossil fuels to biomass had been built into most climate policy pathways as part of international agreements aimed at keeping global warming below a 2C temperature rise since industrial times. “Replacing fossil fuels with biomass energy seems like a good idea, both nationally and at the global scale. But such policies haven’t been properly thought through and risk making matters worse, not better. And even if further carbon dioxide release can be prevented, the scale of bioenergy required seems likely to have serious land-use implications, either at the expense of food production or resulting in natural habitat loss.” In the middle of the 19th century, wood burning rose to such levels that western Europe was almost completely deforested. Ironically, the rise of coal burning saved the situation. Now that coal is being phased out, it should not be an excuse to return to widespread tree burning, say researchers. Instead we should concentrate our efforts to boost solar and wind projects and other less harmful sources of renewable energy."
"China is moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable technology as the US pulls away, a new report has said. China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).  “As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA. IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth. China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services. “China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said. The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said. “That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.” As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%. Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”. “Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.” The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp. The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal. “[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said. The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles. On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”. However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid."
"Scientists are engaged in a race against time to breed staple crops that can both survive climate change and yield bigger harvests. Their aim is to feed a growing population in a warming world. The method used for centuries of growing one crop a year in variable weather conditions and then selecting the seeds from the best plants is no longer viable in fast-changing climatic conditions. Scientists are concerned that for some years there have been few improvements in yields of grain.  A new system called speed breeding, designed to grow six crops a year, has been developed in glasshouses to accelerate the process. Using LED lighting to aid photosynthesis, intensive regimes allow the plants to grow for 22 hours a day. This new form of lighting is a lot cheaper and also more efficient than using the old sodium vapour lamps that produced too much heat and not enough light. Among the crops that can now be grown up to six generations a year are wheat, barley, peas and chickpeas. Canola, a form of rapeseed, can achieve four cycles. Using this technology, scientists can study the way plants deal with diseases, and their shape and structure and flowering time, and the growing cycle can be repeated every eight weeks. It is hoped the technique will yield new varieties of crops that can be grown on a commercial scale within 10 years. If this could be achieved, it would increase productivity in the same way as the green revolution of the 1960s, when new crop varieties, modern farm practices, and use of fertilisers saved millions of people from starvation.

"There’s a debate in climate circles about whether you should try to scare the living daylights out of people, or give them hope – think images of starving polar bears on melting ice caps on the one hand, and happy families on their bikes lined with flowers and solar-powered lights on the other. The debate came to something of a head this year, after David Wallace-Wells lit up the internet with his 7,000-word, worst-case scenario published in New York magazine. It went viral almost instantly, and soon was the best-read story in the magazine’s history. A writer in Slate called it “the Silent Spring of our time”. But it also garnered tremendous criticism and from more than the usual denier set. Beyond quibbles with the science, critics including the illustrious climate scientist Michael Mann took issue with the piece’s “doomist framing” because, as he wrote at the time, there’s “a danger in overstating the science in a way that presents the problem as unsolvable, and feeds a sense of doom, inevitability and hopelessness”. But others say scaring people is the only way to make them care. Perhaps the most famous purveyor of climate scare tactics is Guy McPherson. Described by the New York Times as an “apocalyptic ecologist”, McPherson’s doomsday theory of “near-term extinction” has attracted something of a following. McPherson wrote on his website, which includes links to suicide hotlines, that the David Wallace-Wells piece “largely captures my message”. Rather than treat emotions as levers to be pulled, they should be seen as part of a dynamic interplay Both sides are wrong, from a psychological standpoint. Emotions are complicated and can vary tremendously from person to person. Trying to crudely manipulate them doesn’t work. That’s the conclusion from behavioral scientists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Daniel Chapman, Brian Lickel and Ezra Markowitz, who, in a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change, seek to bring the lessons of psychology to bear on communicating the importance climate change. To attempt to either scare or inspire people “simultaneously oversimplifies the rich base of research on emotion while overcomplicating the very real communications challenge advocates face by demanding that each message have the right ‘emotional recipe’ to maximize effectiveness”, they write. Climate experts, after all, are not experts on human behavior and the people who are say there are better ways to communicate the climate problem. Rather than treat emotions as levers to be pulled for a desired effect, they should be seen as part of a dynamic interplay among factors that shape our behavior, exquisitely specific to the human being inhabiting them. What’s more, since the vast majority of us are not very good at getting people to feel the way we want them to based on the words coming out of our mouths alone, the best approach, it would seem, is one of humility – that is, to spend more time listening, and also, to know our own limits. “Practitioners in different fields have varying perspectives on the issue,” Chapman told me. “In general, I think we need researchers and practitioners attending in an honest way to what research does and does not tell us about how to engage the public with climate change.” For those intent on communicating climate change in psychologically adept ways, there are some takeaways from the science.  For instance, though we’ve been conditioned to think of anger as an undesirable emotion, research has shown it to be an important emotion for motivating action in the face of social injustice. And the pairing of certain feelings, like fear and efficacy, can be helpful too.  Like a patient who’s given both a diagnosis and a course of treatment, people respond better to risks when given both a reason and a way to act. In this sense, it seems the hope and fear camps of the climate debate are each seeing only part of the puzzle. But even in places where the science is relatively strong, researchers caution against simplistic applications. Rote formulas like “three parts hope to one part scary” won’t translate from one person to another. Indeed, to use such information responsibly requires, if not some level of sophistication, then at least considerable forethought, as well as a concerted, ongoing effort to meet people where they are. That means, above all, knowing your audience and what’s relevant to them. Are they considering chopping down a nearby forest or putting their houses up on stilts? Do they need to rebuild or relocate? Parsing people’s needs and sensitivities is critical in any form of communication, but particularly when it comes to talking about climate science, with its great technical complexity, profound personal impact, and tremendous political polarization. Above all, it means remembering that climate change is a very big story. It isn’t monolithic, and communication of it looks like many things – be it climate scientists talking to lay-people or Leonardo DiCaprio making a movie. The overwhelming problem in climate communication, after all, isn’t how it’s talked about so much as whether it’s being talked about at all. A 2016 report from Yale’s programme on climate communication found one in four Americans say they “never” hear someone discussing it. Looked at that way, David Wallace-Wells’ apocalyptic horror story cum viral sensation is the best thing that’s happened in climate communication some time.• Lucia Graves is a Guardian US columnist"
"Bitcoin’s electricity usage is enormous. In November, the power consumed by the entire bitcoin network was estimated to be higher than that of the Republic of Ireland. Since then, its demands have only grown. It’s now on pace to use just over 42TWh of electricity in a year, placing it ahead of New Zealand and Hungary and just behind Peru, according to estimates from Digiconomist. That’s commensurate with CO2 emissions of 20 megatonnes – or roughly 1m transatlantic flights.  That fact should be a grave notion to anyone who hopes for the cryptocurrency to grow further in stature and enter widespread usage. But even more alarming is that things could get much, much worse, helping to increase climate change in the process.   Burning huge amounts of electricity isn’t incidental to bitcoin: instead, it’s embedded into the innermost core of the currency, as the operation known as “mining”. In simplified terms, bitcoin mining is a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second.  Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions.  Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis. The more electricity you burn, and the faster your computer, the higher your chance of winning the competition. The prize? 12.5 bitcoin – still worth over $100,000 – plus all the transaction fees paid in the past 10 minutes, which according analysts’ estimates is another $2,500 or so. This is a winner-takes-all game, where the prize is guaranteed to be paid to one, and only one, miner every 10 minutes. Burning more electricity increases your chances of winning, but correspondingly decreases everyone else’s – and so they have a motivation to burn more electricity in turn. The economic outcome of all of this is laid bare in a Credit Suisse briefing note published on Tuesday: the network as a whole will reinvest almost all the bitcoin paid out as mining rewards back into its electricity consumption. (Credit Suisse’s ballpark figure assumes that 80% of the expenses of bitcoin miners are spent on electricity). At current prices for electricity and bitcoin, the bank calculates a maximum profitable power draw of bitcoin at around 100TWh – two-and-a-half times higher than its current rate. Any higher and the miner will lose money. But it gets worse. If bitcoin were to become the global currency its supporters hope it will, its pricewould increase. And if its price increases, so too does the amount of electricity miners can afford to burn.  Credit Suisse estimate that a bitcoin price of $50,000 – five times its level as I write – would increase the electricity consumption tenfold. And at a bitcoin price of $1.1m, it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in the world for mining. The bank views the latter prospect as not worth worrying about, for two reasons: it doesn’t think bitcoin will ever reach that value, since the competition from other cryptocurrencies is too strong; and it thinks that power consumption of mining will fall over time as better technologies are used for miners. Credit Suisse explicitly compares bitcoin to marijuana cultivation and data centres, two other industries that once sparked fears they would have huge power draws. I’m not convinced we should be so blasé. It’s true that bitcoin may face competition from other cryptocurrencies, but almost all its competitors use essentially the same wasteful mining system it does. If they took over pole position, it would be out of the frying pan and into the fire. (One major competitor, Ethereum, has long discussed moving to a “proof-of-stake” system, which would radically change its power use for the better, but the switchover still hasn’t happened. It’s currently scheduled for mid-2018.) And while marijuana farmers and data centre engineers managed to reduce their power demands, the fundamentally wasteful nature of bitcoin mining means there’s no easy technological solution coming.  Mining computers have become more power-efficient, with the latest generation of machines able to do roughly 20% more useless calculations per MWh of electricity. But in the zero-sum game of bitcoin mining, that just means a miner can afford to run more machines at the same time, leaving their power usage roughly stable. In the end, there’s only one real reason why bitcoin’s energy consumption would fall, and that is if the price of the currency drops.  On that point, there is good news to be had: bitcoin is down to just over $10,000, almost half the level it was trading at a month ago. If it continues to fall, we might be able to return to worrying about more conventional sources of climate change, like the automotive industry, plane travel, and Donald Trump."
"A Queensland tourism representative has called one of the Great Barrier Reef’s leading researchers “a dick”, blaming the professor for a downturn in tourism growth at the state’s greatest natural asset. Col McKenzie, the head of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, a group that represents more than 100 businesses in the Great Barrier Reef, has written to the federal government asking it to stop funding the work of Professor Terry Hughes, claiming his comments were “misleading” and damaging the tourism industry.  But the Australian Conservation Foundation said tourism representatives and operators like McKenzie should stop blaming scientists for reporting what was happening to the reef and start targeting major polluters to ensure change. Hughes, who serves as the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and is considered one of the world’s leading experts on the reef, has been warning of the damage rising water temperatures have been inflicting on the reef for years. While not disagreeing there was work to be done on the reef’s health, McKenzie accused Hughes of exaggerating the damage, which he said has been detrimental to the region’s multibillion-dollar tourism industry. “I think Terry Hughes is a dick,” he told Guardian Australia. “I believe he has done tens of millions of dollars of damage to our reef in our key markets, being America and Europe. You went to those areas in 2017 and they were convinced the reef was dead. And people won’t do long-haul trips when they think the reef is dead.” McKenzie said in 2016, tourism growth in the region had returned to pre-global financial crisis levels, before “that growth died” in 2017, which he blamed on Hughes “negative comments”. In April 2016 Hughes made international headlines after releasing his final report on extensive aerial and underwater surveys, which showed that of the surveyed reefs (911 individual reefs), only 7% had escaped coral bleaching. McKenzie said that gave the impression the reef was “dead”. “All driven off the back of the negative comments made by a researcher paid entirely by commonwealth funds. I think it is a misuse of commonwealth funds to make false or misleading comments to the media.” He has previously written to ministers Christopher Pyne and Greg Hunt over the issue and said he had spoken to Josh Frydenberg “informally”. A spokeswoman for the Australian Research Council said the council had provided $28m over the past seven years to James Cook University to fund the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, with the funding going to the centre as a whole, not an individual.  “All projects funded through the ARC are subject to rigorous assessment and only the highest-quality applications are funded,” she said in a statement.  “The ARC monitors all projects that it funds for the achievement of their goals. All projects funded through the ARC are expected to be undertaken in accordance with the Australian code for the responsible conduct of research, which applies to the quality and integrity of the research.” Hughes did not respond to McKenzie’s comments directly, but included his most recent peer-reviewed articles in Science and Nature, which deal with the increased incidence of coral bleaching as a result of rising sea temperatures. His Science paper, published on 5 January, found that coral bleaching events were now happening too regularly to allow the reef to adequately recover. “We analysed bleaching records at 100 globally distributed reef locations from 1980 to 2016,” the paper reported. “The median return time between pairs of severe bleaching events has diminished steadily since 1980 and is now only six years.” The CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said too much was at stake for tourism operators to blame scientists for what was actually happening to the reef and the real problem, climate change, had to be addressed.  “Blaming scientists and attempting to get their funding cut is the worst possible response to this crisis,” she said. “Scientists are not to blame. Big polluters and their political allies are to blame. We need high-quality science more than ever so we can monitor and track what’s happening to the reef.” Darrell Wade, the executive chair of Intrepid Travel, also disputed the idea that talking about environmental problems kept tourists away. “The idea that conservation and tourism could be at odds on this issue is crazy,” Wade said. “It’s been implied that talking about the issues will have a negative impact on business – but we’ve actually found that the opposite is true.” The latest health report from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority found outbreaks of crown-of-thorn starfish across the reef. It noted the world heritage site has experienced “multiple significant impacts” over the past two years, including “severe coral bleaching, outbreaks of coral disease and crown-of-thorns starfish, and a severe tropical cyclone and subsequent flood plumes”. “The significant heat stress experienced during summer 2016-17 – along with a warmer than average winter and spring in 2017 – means corals faced continued stress and will potentially be more susceptible to bleaching and disease in early 2018,” it reported."

"With three strong hurricanes, wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather disasters: $306bn, according to a new government report released on Monday. The US had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215bn in 2005. Costs are adjusted for inflation and Noaa keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in US history hit last year.Hurricane Harvey cost $125bn, second only to 2005’s Katrina, while Maria cost $90bn, ranking third, Noaa said. Irma was $50bn, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18bn in damage, triple the previous US wildfire record, according to Noaa. Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse. Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday. There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge. Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater. “While we have to be careful about kneejerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today’s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society. At least 362 people died in 2017 due to these natural disasters, the agency reported, including 64 killed in Puerto Rico. Outlets such as the New York Times and BuzzFeed have questioned the official death toll from the island, and estimated that Hurricane Maria has caused the deaths of about 1,000 people. Noaa announced its figures at the society’s annual conference in Austin, Texas.The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in US records for the lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6F (12.6C), 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the lower 48 states have all happened since 2006. This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above-average temperatures for the year. Five states Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico had their warmest year ever. Temperature records go back to 1895."

" Tourism is Australia’s most vulnerable and least prepared industry to deal with climate change despite the fact it is already feeling its effects, according to an advocacy group report.  The report by the Climate Council, based on 200 source documents and articles, says while tourism is growing at an extraordinary pace – an 8% jump in visitors last financial year – not enough is being done to prepare for damage to the country’s greatest drawcards.  The five biggest attractions as reported by Tourism Australia – in order: beaches, wildlife, the Great Barrier Reef, unspoilt natural wilderness, national parks including rainforests and other forests – are all considered threatened by climate change.  The report says federal and state governments have mostly underplayed or ignored the risk to tourism. The government’s national Tourism 2020 plan makes no mention of the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions or improve sustainability in the industry.  Last month, the head of Queensland’s Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, Col McKenzie, called climate scientist Terry Hughes “a dick” and urged the federal government to cut research funding due to his public comments about rising water temperatures harming the reef. McKenzie said it had turned tourists away.  Ecologist and report co-author Prof Lesley Hughes said it should not be controversial to discuss the threat climate change posed to the industry.  Beyond the often cited back-to-back years of bleaching on the reef in 2016 and 2017, she cited as examples beach erosion due to rising sea levels and a projected accelerating growth in extremely hot days in the red centre and the Top End across this century.  “Most government and industry plans on tourism are focused on growth but they don’t also look at the other side of the coin, which is the risks,” she said. “When people come here they might do other things – cultural things such as visiting the Sydney Opera House – but really the overwhelming attractions are natural icons and it’s very clear they are all already being affected.”  Government data cited in the report underlines the extent of the tourism boom. International visitors spent $40.6bn last financial year and were served by a tourism industry that employs 580,200 people, 5% of the country’s total workforce. The government estimates that, for every dollar generated by the tourism industry, a further 90c is spent elsewhere in the economy.  New Zealand provided the most visitors, though Austrade expects it will be overtaken by second-placed China this year. Britain, the United States and Singapore round out the top five. Tourism Australia this week launched a major advertising campaign in the US during the Super Bowl based on the Crocodile Dundee movie franchise. Starring actors Chris Hemsworth and Danny McBride, the campaign emphasises Australia’s natural beauty.  The industry’s growth has made tourism Australia’s second-largest export after iron ore. It is a significantly larger employer than coalmining or oil and gas extraction, which in 2014-15 employed 39,000 and 22,000 people respectively.   Hughes said, despite this, the future of fossil fuel industries and jobs received far more attention in the national conversation. “It’s cognitive dissonance at its most extreme,” she said.  Examples of industries already being affected by global warming include ski tourism, which has seen a trend of increasing reliance on artificial snow as seasons she shortened over the past 25 years.  “That’s a classic illustration that tourism industries will need to adapt and diversify to find other ways to bring people to those regions,” Hughes said.  The report highlights some hotels, resorts, airlines and zoos have taken steps to cut pollution but says a national plan is lacking. Hughes called on more tourism operators to lobby governments to help the industry adapt and diversify.  “I would also like to see operators be part of the lobby for better climate and energy policy,” she said."

"The refugee crisis – particularly in the Mediterranean area – has received large amounts of new attention in the past few years, with people fleeing from Syria and entering the European Union emblematic of the problem. There has been some research connecting this refugee problem with changes to the climate. In particular, the years preceding the Syrian refugee crisis were characterized by a severe drought that reduced farm output and led to economic and social strife there. Separating out the influences of climate change from general social instability may be impossible, because they are intimately linked. But we do know that climate change can cause social and economic instability. We also know that these instabilities can boil over into larger problems that lead to mass exodus. The problem isn’t knowing the connection between climate and refugees exists – rather the problem is quantifying it.  All of this is important because we want to be able to plan for the “now” as well as the “tomorrow.” If we are already seeing climate-related migrations, can you imagine what’s in store in the next few decades as temperatures and extreme weather continue to increase? A very recent publication appearing in the journal Science investigates this complex subject. The paper, Asylum Applications Respond to Temperature Fluctuations, was published by Anouch Missirian and Wolfram Schlenker from Columbia University. It focused not just on Syria and the Mediterranean area, but expanded their study to be worldwide. The researchers identified 103 countries that contributed to asylum applications to the European Union. Collectively, these nations submitted 350,000 applications to the EU per year. The authors combed the weather histories from these 103 source sites and explored how the weather varied in the 2000–2014 time period.  They found that when temperatures in agricultural areas and seasons at the source countries varied away from an optimal value (of about 20°C), the number of people seeking asylum increased. And the increase wasn’t just proportional. They found it was nonlinear, meaning that initial increases in temperature only mildly changed the asylum application numbers. But as temperatures varied more and more, the number of seekers increased more quickly.  After making this connection to observations, the authors then projected into the future. Using a collection of climate models that are able to predict Earth’s future climate, the authors estimated that on a business-as-usual emissions pathway (where countries don’t meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions), asylum applications will increase by almost 200% by the end of the century. On the other hand, under a modest warming scenario, where humans take some meaningful action to reduce emissions, the increase falls to about 30%. Again, this shows that what humans do today to combat climate change really matters. What was also interesting is that temperature is a better metric for this problem than precipitation. I wouldn’t have guessed that initially; my naïve expectation would be that precipitation changes would also be very good at allowing prediction of asylum seekers. But it turns out temperature is much better. The discussion by the authors also demonstrated how many moving parts there are to this problem. Not only are the economic, climate, and social situations in the source country important, but those factors in the destination country are also critical. People migrate to where they expect better conditions. I spoke with the authors who told me this about their choice of using temperature as the metric for asylum applications: There is an emerging literature linking various sectoral outcomes in a country to weather shocks (conflict, agricultural yields, energy demand, mortality, labor productivity, labor supply, etc.). Using temperature shocks is ideal from a statistical perspective; our statistical model is not new, but well established.  With much study on the topic in recent years, I wanted to know what contribution this new paper had made (that wasn’t known already). They said this: The significance of our paper is that we are not looking at impacts in particular countries, but spillovers in the form of asylum applications. Most economic damage assessments examine the direct impact on a country, but countries are interlinked. So even if most of the economic damages occur in developing countries, there might be repercussions for developed countries.  There is an existing literature on migration and refugees, but previous studies usually focus on one country at the time. We use data from all over the world (103 source countries that list asylum applications to the EU in every year 2000–2014) to systematically examine the relationship. We picked the European Union as destination country since it receives almost half of the asylum applications.  Readers of this column know that I study climate change – both the rate and the future projections of what will happen. But readers also know I am very interested in the studies on impacts. We’ve solved the question about how much warming is happening and who is to blame. Now, the scientific community is turning its attention to the “so what?” questions. Questions about how climate change impacts us and what can be done to stop or prepare for the changes. This paper takes us another step toward answering those questions."
"The University of Edinburgh is dumping all its fossil fuel investments, making it the largest UK university endowment fund to be completely free of all coal, oil and gas holdings. The decision was announced on Monday and followed a long student campaign. More than 60 UK universities have now divested from fossil fuels, with the University of Sussex the latest to make the move.   Most existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned without causing dangerous climate change, and proponents of divestment argue this makes fossil fuel companies bad investments on both ethical and financial grounds. The risk to investments is taken seriously at the highest level, including the Bank of England, World Bank and the G20’s financial stability board, and many major investment firms have also divested. The University of Edinburgh decided in 2015 to divest from the most polluting companies – those involved in coal and tar sands – but stopped short of full divestment. But now the university will sell its final £6.3m of fossil fuel holdings, in the companies Total, BG Group and Atlas Copco. The University of Edinburgh’s £1bn endowment fund is the third largest in the UK, behind Cambridge and Oxford. Those universities have only committed to divest from coal and tar sands to date. Tara Wight, campaigner at People and Planet Edinburgh and a PhD student, said: “We are thrilled that Edinburgh University has finally realised the importance of divestment, and decided to match their investment portfolio with the environmentally friendly image they present to the public.” Prof Charlie Jeffery, senior vice-principal at the University of Edinburgh, said: “I’m very proud of the university’s decision. Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. Over the past few years, we have thought hard about how to respond to that challenge. This change in our investment strategy is a vital step on that journey.” A university spokesman said Edinburgh had invested more than £150m in low carbon technology, climate-related research and businesses that directly benefit the environment since 2010 and would become carbon neutral by 2040. In January, New York City announced it would sell $5bn of fossil fuel investments held by the city’s pension funds. The value of investment funds around the world committed to selling off fossil fuel assets is at least $5tn."
"Australia’s healthcare system is contributing more than 7% of the nation’s carbon footprint, with hospitals and pharmaceutical companies forming the bulk of health-related emissions, an analysis led by the University of Sydney has found. The findings, published in the international medical journal the Lancet on Tuesday, have prompted the climate lobby group Doctors for the Environment Australia (DEA) to urge the federal government to fund states and territories to make hospitals more energy-efficient.  Researchers obtained 2014-15 financial data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare for 15 sectors of the healthcare industry, including public and private hospitals, dental services and private practice. They used this data in mathematical modelling to determine a carbon dioxide equivalent emissions factor for each sector, and to obtain an overall emissions footprint. “We found that the carbon footprint attributed to healthcare was 7% of Australia’s total; that is, similar to the entire carbon emissions associated with the activities of 7% of Australians,” the study found. This represented 35,772 kilotonnes of Australia’s 494,930 kilotonnes of carbon emissions in 2014-15. The study found hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry were together responsible for two-thirds of the healthcare carbon footprint. It is the first time the carbon footprint stemming from healthcare has been determined for Australia. Similar analyses conducted overseas found healthcare contributed 3% of total emissions in England and 10% in the US. The co-author of the study, Dr Forbes McGain, an anaesthetist and intensive care physician with Western Health in Melbourne, said anaesthetic gases were a significant contributor to hospital carbon emissions. DEA has called on physicians to use general anaesthetic alternatives to gases, such as intravenous drugs. “The anaesthetic gases we pump into the atmosphere have a very high global warming potential, up there with chlorofluorocarbons,” McGain said. The gases desflurane and nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, were especially bad for the environment, he said. Intravenous drugs or less potent gases could be used instead, with no impact on the quality of patient care. “Though there are some reasons why gases might be used, such as fast onset and offset, Denmark for example uses intravenous anaesthesia much more commonly than gases,” he said. “So cultural factors are extremely important, as well as marketing by pharmaceutical companies to influence doctors. Gases won’t be completely replaced, but they don’t need to be used as commonly as they are.” He agreed with DEA that more hospitals needed to turn to renewable energy. Short payback times for photovoltaics and rising energy prices meant solar panels should become an increasingly viable option, McGain said. In an accompanying comment piece published in the Lancet, public health researchers Professor Peng Bi and Dr Alana Hansen from the University of Adelaide wrote that reducing the number of patients attending hospitals would also curb carbon emissions. General practitioners would be essential to this, by detecting disease early and promoting disease prevention measures.  “Health promotion efforts to encourage healthy lifestyles will help to reduce the need for access to healthcare and on the reliance for pharmaceuticals, the sectors with the highest direct carbon dioxide equivalent emissions emissions,” the authors wrote.  “Messages on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle might help to reduce individual and community vulnerability to the health effects of climate change and, ironically, help lower the main contributing factor – carbon emissions.” McGain said it was promising that many states had committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. “But to achieve emissions reductions in healthcare will be a massive effort, requiring support and funding at the federal level,” he said. “Climate change is a health problem, and the health sector should be leading the way in addressing it.”"
"January was the hottest month ever recorded in New Zealand, according to figures released on Friday, and experts say climate change is one factor. The heat has led to a shortage of fans that prime minister Jacinda Ardern jokingly referred to as “fan-ageddon”. Ardern said that while many people were probably enjoying a great summer, they also needed to consider the long-term consequences of climate change, including sea-level rise. Figures released by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research indicate the average temperature during January was 20.3C (68.5F). That was more than three degrees above normal and beat the previous record of 19.6C set in February 1998. Record-keeping began in 1909. Gregor Macara, a climate scientist with the weather agency, said that warmer seas, generally settled weather and more winds from the tropical north had led to the higher temperatures. He said climate change was an underlying and contributing factor. February began on a different note as New Zealand was hit by a tropical storm that brought heavy rainfall, flooding and cooler temperatures. But Macara said the agency still anticipates temperatures for the month will be higher than normal. New Zealand has a relatively mild climate that is moderated by the surrounding ocean. The warm temperatures and lack of rainfall in parts of the South Island have prompted the government to declare a drought in those areas."
"For the inhabitants of the Cumbrian village of Glenridding, the winter of 2015/16 was a miserable one. Storm Desmond brought the first deluge in December, turning the river into a raging torrent, sweeping through many properties, and cutting the village off from the outside world for a full two days. Storm Eva barrelled in a few weeks later, and Glenridding ended up awash three times in the space of four weeks. So what is going on? Are extreme climate events becoming more frequent, or were the residents of Glenridding suffering a series of unlucky rolls of the dice?  To answer this question, Wouter Berghuijs, from ETH Zurich, and colleagues have been analysing streamflow statistics from all over the world, and totting up the number of extreme events in each catchment.  They have found that European rivers have experienced a 44% increase in extreme floods since 1995, suggesting that global warming has played a role.  Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists conclude that flood history is not a reliable predictor for future flood risk, and climate change needs to be taken into account too."
"2017 was the hottest year since global records began that was not given an additional boost by the natural climate cycle El Niño, according to new data. Even without an El Niño, the year was still exceptionally hot, being one of the top three ever recorded. The three main global temperature records show the global surface temperature in 2017 was 1C above levels seen in pre-industrial times, with scientists certain that humanity’s fossil fuel-burning is to blame. The data, published on Thursday, means the last three years have been the hottest trio ever seen, with 2017 ranking second or third depending on the small differences between the temperature records. Furthermore, 17 of the 18 hottest years recorded since 1850 have occurred since 2000. 2017 also saw extreme weather events strike across the world, from hurricanes in the US and Caribbean to heatwaves in Australia and devastating floods in Asia. Many of these events have been shown to have been made much more likely by the heat resulting from global warming. Scientists from across the globe warned that the limit of 1.5C of warming, set as a goal by the international Paris climate change treaty, was being approached very rapidly and that it was more urgent than ever to slash emissions to avoid the worst impacts. The three global temperature records are compiled by the UK’s Met Office and Nasa and Noaa in the United States. The Met Office said the average temperature in 2017 was 0.99C above that seen from 1850-1900, despite the Pacific Ocean moving into its cooler La Niña phase. “While climate change deniers continue to bury their heads in the sand, global warming continues unabated,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Pennsylvania State University in the US. “And the impacts of that warming – unprecedented wildfires, superstorms and floods – are now plain for all to see. There has never been greater urgency.” In December, the US president, Donald Trump, suggested cold weather in the eastern US undermined the evidence of climate change, a statement called “phenomenally dumb“ by climate scientist Dr Sarah Myhre. Scientists said that the slight drop in global temperature in 2017 was unsurprising and that huge levels of carbon emissions are still being pumped out. “Global temperatures will continue to bob up and down from year to year, but the climate tide beneath them is rising fast,” said Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh in the UK.  “Despite our best efforts so far, global warming continues apace,” said Prof Martin Siegert, at Imperial College London. “This is yet another wake-up call to develop a zero carbon economy before it’s too late.”  Dr Dann Mitchell, at the University of Bristol, said: “We are getting ever closer to the Paris agreement target of 1.5C which we are so desperately trying to avoid.” Prof Stefan Rahmstorf said there had been a very significant increase in global temperature since the major El Niño seen in 1998: “In just 18 years, our greenhouse gas emissions have pushed up global temperature by a full 0.4C. At this rate the Paris goal of 1.5C will already be crossed in under two decades.” The 2016 peak in global temperature caused by El Niño is over. That peak was similar to the 1998 peak, but at a 0.4 °C higher global temperature due to #GlobalWarming pic.twitter.com/F7aBZt2k2J In Australia, the Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said: “The fingerprints of climate change were seen with extreme weather events across Australia in 2017. This data is yet another warning to the government to urgently slash Australia’s rising greenhouse gas levels in a bid to protect Australians from escalating extreme weather events.” The temperature data is all compiled using many thousands of measurements from all continents and all oceans. Small differences between them largely result from how temperatures for the fast-warming but data-sparse polar regions are calculated. The El Niño event in 2015-16 raised the annual average temperature for 2016 by 0.2C, but most scientists agree that both 2016 and 2015 would have been record hot years even without the El Niño. The 2017 global temperature was accurately predicted by the Met Office a year before, adding to confidence that scientists have a good understanding of the climate system."
"Environmental lawyers and academics have called for a comprehensive rethink on how Australia’s natural landscapes are protected, warning that short-term politics is infecting decision-making and suggesting that the public be given a greater say on development plans.  The Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law has launched a blueprint for a new generation of environment laws and the creation of independent agencies with the power and authority to ensure they are enforced. The panel of 14 senior legal figures says this is motivated by the need to systematically address ecological challenges including falling biodiversity, the degradation of productive rural land, the intensification of coastal and city development and the threat of climate change.  Murray Wilcox QC, a former federal court judge, said the blueprint was a serious attempt to improve a system that was shutting the public out of the decision-making process and failing to properly assess the impact of large-scale development proposals.  “We found the standard of management of the environment is poor because everything is made into a political issue,” Wilcox said. “Nothing happens until it becomes desperate.  “We need a non-political body of significant prestige to report on what is happening and have the discretion to act.”  The legal review, developed over several years and quietly released in 2017, resulted in 57 recommendations. It was suggested by the Places You Love alliance, a collection of about 40 environmental groups that was created to counter a failed bid to set up a “one-stop shop” for environmental approvals by leaving it to the states. The panel undertook the work on the understanding it would be independent and not a piece of activism.  Its work helped inform a motion passed by 250 Labor branches calling on the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, to put stronger national environmental laws and the introduction of an independent watchdog at the centre of his election pitch. The Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law convener, Rob Fowler, an environmental lawyer for more than 40 years and adjunct professor at the University of South Australia, said a key finding was that cooperative federalism – different tiers of government working together to solve common problems – had not worked in protecting the environment.  “It’s slow-moving, unwieldy and leads to compromised outcomes,” he said.  Fowler said devolving responsibility for environmental protection to the states had been popular with politicians, having been proposed by both the Gillard Labor government and the Coalition under Tony Abbott, but not the public. The 2014 constitutional values survey conducted by Griffith University found nearly 45% of respondents believed Canberra should be solely responsible for protecting the environment. Just 16% said it should be left to the states. He said the body of expert opinion was strongly in favour of the commonwealth taking responsibility. The panel believed a future government should introduce a mechanism that required states to act in line with plans and strategies developed by a commonwealth environment commission. If they failed to comply, they could be overridden. Wilcox, who before becoming a judge was president of the Australian Conservation Foundation from 1979 to 1984, said creating an environment commission was the panel’s most important recommendation, likening it to the Reserve Bank. “It hopefully would involve people of considerable ability and achievement,” he said. It would develop both national strategies and regional plans to protect biodiversity, and oversee a system of environmental data monitoring, collection, auditing and reporting. Where it did not do the monitoring itself, it would be required to ensure the work was done to a higher standard than currently, backed by federal funding. Wilcox said the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which was introduced by the Howard government in 1999, was an advance at the time but now “well and truly out of date”. The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has said the existing act continues to be the best mechanism for the federal government to protect the most important and sensitive matters. The opposition environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said the push to introduce national laws would be considered at ALP conference this year, and he was consulting about updating the act. Wilcox said the public should have a greater say in response to developments. He said state planning systems were good at handling small neighbourhood development problems but larger proposals tended to be “waved through by governments mesmerised by the corporate dollars”.  He cited the hotel and casino complex being developed at Barangaroo in Sydney. “Anything that did come out about that was released for political reasons. That story just applies again and again and again.  “If you believe in a democracy, then you believe ordinary people should be encouraged to get in and have a say, and that’s not the case at the moment. If anything the opposite is the case.”"
"David Attenborough’s Blue Planet series raised our awareness of rubbish tips traversing our oceans and choking some of our most beloved marine species. This has led to a global debate about how we manufacture and dispose of plastics. The Scottish government announced that it is to host an international conference in 2019 to discuss action on marine litter. It’s ideal territory for any government seeking to be regarded as edgy and cool on this year’s fashionable cause. No one could disagree with its aims and purpose and, more importantly, nothing that emerges from it will commit anyone to spending money or risking the growth of emerging industries.  Perhaps soon our marine technology will have advanced to the stage where we can actually interpret what whales and dolphins are saying and begin to solicit their views on the subject. These creatures are believed to possess remarkable intelligence. If we reached the stage where we could converse with them, perhaps we could appoint some of them as environment tsars in western governments: that would sort the wheat from the chaff in all the chattering about human impact on the health of marine life. As the debate about our slatternly disposal of plastics was raging down on Earth we were all acclaiming a fresh addition to the garbage dump swirling above us in space. The billionaire car manufacturer Elon Musk launched one of his Tesla Roadsters to Mars in a rocket produced by his company, SpaceX. According to people who know about this stuff, it was the biggest and most powerful rocket launched since the Apollo series and Saturn V. We further learned that the rocket, the Falcon Heavy, uses 27 Merlin rocket engines to develop 22,819kN of thrust. I’m assured that this can carry a 64-tonne payload into low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit: more than sufficient for propelling a sports car to Mars. I won’t pretend I understand the science but let’s just say that Musk won’t be getting invited to address an environmental summit in the near future. You might be tempted to dismiss this as an expensive publicity stunt by a billionaire playboy with too much time on his hands. But in reality it’s an important step towards a time when space travel for your average indolent millionaire will become commonplace. It will probably become another way of managing your finances when Mars inevitably becomes the ultimate off-shore tax haven. Quite what our fetish for space exploration and spending billions on the technology required to feed this does to the environment is a serious matter. There’s a dissonance emerging here. On Earth, we’re organising summits and setting up carbon footprint-reduction targets all over the shop. Yet, up in yonder outer space we’ve established a giant garbage dump replete with huge hulks of rusting metal and, as of last week, a $200k American sports car. Indeed, the whole issue of rocket emissions needs to be considered if we’re serious about the environment. These emissions deliver gases and particles into the Earth’s upper atmosphere and this will be addressed later this year at the UN’s quadrennial global ozone assessment conference. Martin Ross, a senior project engineer for civil and commercial launch projects at the Aerospace Corporation in California, told the online journal Space.com that rocket soot accumulates in the upper stratosphere, where the particles absorb sunlight. “This accumulation heats the upper stratosphere, changing chemical reaction rates and likely leading to ozone loss.” He added: “The 2018 assessment is really the first one to have a substantial section on rocket emissions, not just a passing thought… we now understand that the climate and ozone impacts of rocket exhaust are completely intertwined.” And if we’re discussing space, then we ought to be discussing the impact of all these rockets on our potential neighbours in the galaxy. I’ve always found it curious that despite spending even more billions over decades trying to locate other forms of intelligent life we’ve had nary a cheep back; not even a single intergalactic WhatsApp message. So either our neighbours are a rude shower or they simply don’t exist. But what if there’s another, more sinister explanation: that they do exist but are so far ahead of us in intelligence that they’ve created the means to put themselves out of our reach, perhaps with a giant jamming device. This would explain all those sightings of extraterrestrial spacecraft and kidnappings. Every so often, they check us out to see if we’ve advanced to a stage where they feel they can have a reasonable chat with us. Such visits are bound to have left them disappointed. In recent months, I can imagine one of their scouts reporting back: “Look, 2,000 years ago, the leader of the civilised world in Rome gave his horse a seat in his cabinet; now the most civilised country in the world has appointed some medieval bampot called Trump. They’re still savages.” I can only imagine, too, how resentful they’re getting at us disfiguring their neighbourhood with obsolete metal junk. If I was them I’d be sorely tempted to invade us to sort this out or simply send a short, sharp reminder that our actions have consequences. Mind how you go."
"2017 was the second-hottest year on record according to Nasa data, and was the hottest year without the short-term warming influence of an El Niño event:  In fact, 2017 was the hottest year without an El Niño by a wide margin – a whopping 0.17°C hotter than 2014, which previously held that record. Remarkably, 2017 was also hotter than 2015, which at the time was by far the hottest year on record thanks in part to a strong El Niño event that year. For comparison, the neutral El Niño conditions and the level of solar activity in 1972 were quite similar to those in 2017. 45 years later, the latter was 0.9°C hotter than the former. For each type of year – La Niña, El Niño, and neutral – the global surface warming trend between 1964 and 2017 is 0.17–0.18°C per decade, which is consistent with climate model predictions. I’ve been writing for the Guardian for almost 5 years now, and every year I’ve had to write a similar headline or two: Those early years were the height of the denier frenzy about the mythical global warming ‘hiatus.’ At the time, John Abraham and I frequently wrote pieces pointing out that while various factors were temporarily dampening global surface warming, the oceans (which absorb over 90% of the excess heat from the increased greenhouse effect) continued warming rapidly.  It was only a matter of time until short-term effects stopped holding back the rise of Earth’s surface temperatures. That’s now happened, and as a result we’re seeing unleashed global warming causing record temperatures year after year. In fact, in February 2014 I wrote about a study that predicted this would happen: the [ocean] heat uptake is by no means permanent: when the trade wind strength returns to normal - as it inevitably will - our research suggests heat will quickly accumulate in the atmosphere. So global temperatures look set to rise rapidly out of the hiatus, returning to the levels projected within as little as a decade. Temperatures have in fact risen so quickly, it appears to have taken just a few years for that prediction to come true and for the denier focus on the short-term surface warming slowdown to look quite foolish. Speaking of climate denial, on the 362nd day of the hottest year on record without an El Niño, the US president tweeted this: In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! Climate scientist Sarah Myhre aptly described the tweet as “Phenomenally dumb,” for several obvious reasons.  Trump also began the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, leaving America as the only country in the world denying the urgent need to address global warming. Fortunately, every other nation is taking action to mitigate this existential threat, but there’s a shocking gap between reality and the ‘fake news’ beliefs of arguably the most powerful man in the world. America was also battered by climate-fueled extreme weather events in 2017. Research has already shown that global warming boosted Hurricane Harvey’s record rainfall (and associated flooding) by about 38%. California’s record wildfire season was similarly fueled by the state’s hot summer. The southwestern states were cooked by record hot summer temperatures this year, and global warming is making droughts in America and Europe worse. America was hit by 15 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2017, and it will likely be the costliest such year on record once all of the hurricane damages are tallied. These extreme weather events are expensive. Until we manage to cut global carbon pollution, temperatures will continue to rise and climate change consequences will become more severe. While it broke many of today’s records, 2017 is just a taste of what’s to come."
"The UK will miss its legally binding carbon targets without urgent government action, official advisers have warned. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said vague ambitions, such as banning new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, must be turned into solid plans and new policies, such as planting more trees, are needed.  The CCC also warned that there are “significant” risks to the delivery of existing projects, such as the new Hinkley Point nuclear plant. However, the CCC also praised Theresa May’s government for putting green growth at the centre of the nation’s economic strategy for the first time when it published its Clean Growth Strategy (CGS) in October. “There has been a very fundamental change of stance,” said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC. “But that, of course, doesn’t mean there is not a very great deal more to do. There is a real pressure and urgency.”  Deben said the CCC analysis released on Wednesday was the best-case scenario and had assumed ministers will deliver all the carbon cuts pledged so far. “We have given every benefit of the doubt,” he said. “But even if they do all the things they say they are going to do, to the maximum, there will still be a gap.” The CCC’s independent assessment of the CGS analyses whether it puts the UK on course to meet its legally mandated carbon cuts in 2025 and 2030, and charts the most cost-effective path to an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. The UK has already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 42% since 1990 and is close to phasing out coal, but it is not on track to meet the future targets, the CCC found. The CCC highlighted a series of government pledges that have little or no detail on how they will be delivered, including giving all homes a good level of energy efficiency by 2035. Deben also attacked large housebuilding companies for not doing enough. “If Persimmon had spent the £110m bonus it has given to its chief executive [Jeff Fairburn] on the 18,000 houses it has built this last year, it could have saved very significantly the energy bills of everybody who bought a house and contributed significantly to emissions reduction,” he said. Also highlighted was the critical need to roll out carbon capture and storage plants (CCS) by the 2030s, to trap and bury emissions from fossil fuel plants. “We cannot underline more strongly that without CCS, meeting our statutory targets will cost a great deal more,” Deben said. “CCS is essential.”  The UK’s North Sea is seen as a perfect place for CCS development but former chancellor George Osborne killed a £1bn programme in 2015. Since then only £100m has been pledged in its place, a sum “not commensurate with its importance” according to the CCC.  But Deben also said oil and gas companies have not stepped up to develop CCS: “If you want to argue [against fossil fuel divestment campaigns], you have got to show you are taking really seriously the move away from fossil fuels. It is very dangerous for the industry not to take this very much more seriously.” Gaps in government policies identified by the CCC include a clear plan to drive up sales of electric cars to the upper end of its goal of 40-70% of all cars by 2030 and to approach 100% by 2035. Another is the need to plant 70,000 hectares of trees by 2025 – it would take a century to achieve that at current rates. The CCC also warned that relying on new nuclear plants for low-carbon electricity carried risks. “Nuclear has a history of not delivering on time or on budget,” said Deben. Any new nuclear plants after Hinkley “would have to come in at a much, much reduced cost”, given the very low cost offshore wind now offers, CCC officials said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The UK has reduced emissions per person faster than any other G7 nation and our CGS is the next ambitious milestone. But we have always said it is only the start of a process.”"
"In December 2017, Seona Candy drove through the vineyards of the Franschhoek Valley near Cape Town towards the banks of the Sonderend river. In the late 1970s, the waterway was dammed to create the biggest reservoir in South Africa’s Western Cape. Behind the thick walls of the Theewaterskloof dam lay the capacity to hold 480 million cubic metres of water, nearly half of Cape Town’s water supply. “When I got there, it was mostly dust,” Candy says.  Candy, a post-doctoral research fellow in sustainable food systems at the University of Melbourne, was in the city for food security conference. Every conversation, with everyone from other delegates to her Airbnb hosts, turned back to the water crisis. The city has been in drought since 2015. Its population has almost doubled since 1995, from 2.4 million to 4.3 million, putting pressure on the urban water system. At the end of last year’s dry season, the water behind Theewaterskloof dam was less than 13% full. Day Zero, when municipal water supplies will officially run out, is looming. The local government say the taps will be turned off on 11 May. At that point, people will only be able to collect a daily allowance of 25 litres from 149 points around the city, marshalled by the police and military. But experts believe this is a crisis that could easily face other major urban areas with similar population and climatic characteristics to Cape Town. “Cape Town is the canary in the mine,” says Candy. In Australia, the millennium drought, which parched the country for the first decade of the new century, left cities such as Melbourne a year away from running out of water. This experience has put the country, and institutions like the University of Melbourne, at the forefront of cross-disciplinary research into water security. “Experts overseas expect Australia to be one of the first developed countries to be really hit by climate change in terms of drought,” says Candy. “We already have been. The world is watching to see how we deal with climate change – either how badly or how well.” Her own research in modelling future scenarios around food security and greenhouse gas emissions points to one major recommendation: the wholesale switch from fossil fuels to renewables in energy generation. Agriculture accounts for the biggest use of water in most countries. But Candy has found the amount used in energy production is projected to leap to similar levels, fuelled by power demands from coal seam gas production. “If you switched to 100% renewable energy generation, in the future we could save the same amount of water that we currently use in agriculture,” she says. Expanding distributed, or decentralised, systems is another solution, she adds. It allows people to reduce the distance between collecting and using water. Rainwater tanks are the best example. The millennium drought saw nearly a third of households in Victoria install them. “These are good, not just because they take pressure off existing infrastructure and resource by having a technological solution, but also by making people more aware of what they are using,” says Candy. Any intervention in water security comes at a cost. With climate change amplifying both flood and drought, the risk of getting it wrong is also heightened. Professor Andrew Western is part of the hydrology and water resource group in the University of Melbourne’s department of infrastructure engineering. He has been running simulations to help city authorities hold future Day Zeros at bay without going bankrupt. Key to creating a buffer in a city’s water supply is having more than one source, he says. Reservoirs alone will not suffice for cities with highly variable climates like those in Australia or South Africa. “You need diversity of water supply to get security,” says Western. At the height of the millennium drought, Melbourne built a desalination plant and a pipeline to divert water from the Goulburn river in the rural north. Both were expensive – the plant cost $3.1bn – and politically contentious. But combined they now have the potential to supply more than half of Melbourne’s water needs. Using reservoir levels as a key indicator, Western’s work will help cities know when to start using such technological interventions and what the associated costs – capital, operating and social – will be. The aim is to help authorities avoid panicked, costly decisions. “It’s worth spending money to have really good plans in place for when crisis situations are emerging. With Cape Town, this is probably where it has fallen down,” he says. Meenakshi Arora is also part of hydrology and water resource group. The senior lecturer in environmental engineering has run detailed simulations of the water demand caused by household activities such as cooking, laundry, toilet flushing and showering. She recommends that houses should have two different water streams: drinking water for cooking and showering, and non-drinking water – including harvested rain and storm water and treated waste water – for toilet flushing, laundry and garden irrigation. Changing the water quality to suit the task would reduce demand for clean drinking water, lessen the risk of floods and reduce the amount of contaminated rainwater draining into rivers. “In most established communities we are still flushing our toilet with drinking water,” she says. The University of Melbourne’s chemical engineering department is also doing work on diversifying the mix of water. The team there is looking at advanced water treatment, converting sewage into drinking water, which uses less energy and produces more water than desalination plants. The real cost is political and social. It is a hard sell with most populations. However, Professor John Langford, from infrastructure engineering, suggests that cities with water supply issues should follow the example of Singapore, which already mixes some recycled water into its drinking supply. “The key point is they have a long-term plan of community engagement, so if Malaysia did turn off the tap [the city state is reliant upon its neighbour for most of its drinking water] Singapore could quickly take over the supply,” he says. “My argument would be, which has had no success with the politicians, is to have a long-term program of community engagement here in Australia so we also have that option.” There is nothing natural about a city running out of water, according to Professor Jon Barnett, an expert on vulnerability and adaption to climate change from the school of geography. “There are plenty of solutions to solve these problems,” he says. “It’s not like we don’t know what to do or that there is a shortage of options. Urban water scarcity is a problem produced by social institutions. It is an issue of transition.” But what if cities don’t adapt?  Barnett says examples already exist. “You will get shadow markets,” he says. “Water barons move in to control the allocation of water as they would drugs or illegal tobacco and alcohol during periods of prohibition.” Less clean drinking water means people will resort to using poorer quality, with all its attendant health risks. “There are still more than 2,200 children that die each day because they can’t access good-quality water,” he says. But there is some good news. Scarcity of water is unlikely to provoke war. There have been more than 10 times as many treaties on shared waters and rivers than there are international rivers in the world, says Barnett. “Basically, the incentives to conflict are very low, the incentives to cooperate are very high.” Despite this, action is needed. Increasingly volatile climates and booming populations will mean that more cities will have their own Day Zero. “We’ve already seen it in Australia and there are huge issues in Brazil,” says Barnett. “These are problems that require a lot of organisation, a lot of leadership, a lot of willingness to change. And if that isn’t there, then all the inhibitors to change will prevail. And you end up with Cape Town.”  • This article originally appeared in Pursuit, the University of Melbourne’s online magazine "
"Ways of sucking carbon dioxide from the air will not work on the vast scales needed to beat climate change, Europe’s science academies warned on Thursday. From simply planting trees to filtering CO2 out of the air, the technologies that some hope could be a “silver bullet” in halting global warming either risk huge damage to the environment themselves or are likely to be very costly.  Virtually all the pathways laid out by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to reach the targets in the Paris agreement require huge deployment of so-called negative emissions technologies (NETs) in the second half of the century.  This is because cuts in CO2 are expected to be too slow to hit zero emissions quickly enough, so the overshoot has to be recaptured later by NETs. The IPCC calculates that about 12bn tonnes a year will need to be captured and stored after 2050 – the equivalent of about a third of all global emissions today. “You can rule out a silver bullet,” said Prof John Shepherd, at the University of Southampton, UK, and an author of the report. “Negative emissions technologies are very interesting but they are not an alternative to deep and rapid emissions reductions. These remain the safest and most reliable option that we have.” The new report is from the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC), which advises the European Union and is comprised of the national science academies of the 28 member states. It warns that relying on NETs instead of emissions cuts could fail and result in severe global warming and “serious implications for future generations”.  The report assesses the range of possible technologies, including “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage” (BECCS), on which the IPCC scenarios rely heavily. BECCS involves growing trees, which take CO2 from the atmosphere, and then burning them to produce electricity while capturing the emissions and burying them. But Prof Michael Norton, EASAC’s programme director and another author of the report, said: “There are severe drawbacks.” These include the huge amount of land needed and the energy need to produce and deliver the fuel. Furthermore, it could worsen the enormous loss of wildlife – the sixth mass extinction – already occurring. “The biodiversity impact at the colossal scale envisaged would be severe,” Norton said. Planting new forests and improving soils could take CO2 out of the air at relatively low cost, the report found, but currently the world is losing trees and soil and reversing these trends is already a major challenge. The most high-tech prospect is filtering CO2 directly out of the air, but only one such plant currently exists in the world, trapping just 1,000 tonnes a year. As well as the technical difficulties, there is also no widespread or significant tax on CO2 emissions. “At the moment no one will do this, as no one will pay,” said Shepherd. Nonetheless, the report says research and development on NETs must continue because they could play an important, smaller role in dealing with emissions that are very hard to avoid, such as those from the global aviation industry.  “People are now talking about electric aircraft but I don’t expect to fly in one in my lifetime,” said Shepherd. “It may be cheaper to find a way of removing it from the atmosphere and letting the planes continue to fly.” “The new report is scientifically sound and politically important,” said Phil Williamson, at the University of East Anglia, UK.  “Its main message is clear enough: don’t put off the clean-up for 50 years, as is currently the case in most emission-scenarios that avoid climate chaos. The key issues are now of scale: the scaling-down of the unrealistic use of negative emissions in climate models and the scaling-up of ambition to achieve net zero emissions, as rapidly as possible.”"
"Deadly irukandji jellyfish are drifting further south along Queensland’s coastline and could eventually put tourism as far south as the Gold Coast at risk, an expert has warned. Prof Jamie Seymour has “little doubt” irukandji will keep moving after a stinger was found at Fraser Island on Sunday and a boy was stung on Mooloolaba beach on the sunshine coast 12 months ago.   “It would shut beaches. It would collapse tourism,” the toxinologist from James Cook University said.  Seymour said warmer sea temperatures behind the irukandji’s drift south, and they could become a regular occurrence at Mooloolaba, and even as far south as Coolangatta on the Gold Coast.  The lack of forward planning on the issue is a point of frustration for Seymour, who is “sick of” warning of the risk of the highly venomous species.  “How many more people need to get stung before it’s realised it is not just a one-off?” he said. “Be proactive, don’t wait until it becomes a larger problem. Throw money at it now.”  The irukandji jellyfish caught on the western side of Queensland’s Fraser Island on Sunday prompted a warning for swimmers to stay out of the water. “We’re urging everyone to stay out of the water entirely on that western side of the island while conditions are hot and humid,” the Surf Life Saving Queensland regional manager, Craig Holden, said on Wednesday. However, Queensland Tourism Industry’s chief executive officer, Daniel Gschwind, said there was no need for panic.  “We want people to have a great time here and go away healthy. We are concerned about any potential risk but there is no need to be alarmed at this point,” Gschwind said. Gschwind said collaborations with Surf Life Saving Queensland allowed information on risks to be communicated quickly to swimmers. “To speak about some sort of migration is misleading or premature,” he said.  SLSQ has upgraded its stinger response with daily drags to find the jellyfish after a spate of serious stingers hit the area between late 2016 and early 2017. There were 10 suspected irukandji stings on the western side of Fraser Island between 22 December 2016 and 5 January last year. Holden said if a person was stung a triple zero call should be made immediately and the sting area should be doused with vinegar as soon as possible. He advised people to take a bottle of vinegar with them if they were heading to the island.  “We don’t want to cause widespread panic, but it is really important for people to exercise caution and put safety first at all times.”"
"Winter storms battering the British Isles are more powerful than often assumed. The stormy winter of 2013-14 along the west coast of Ireland produced waves so powerful they tore great slabs of rock out of coastlines and shoved them inland. Among those boulders was a 620-tonne colossus, equivalent to more than three blue whales, which was shoved several feet inshore, setting a new world record for the largest boulder ever known to have been moved by storm waves.  Scientists from Williams College, in Massachusetts, examined photos of shorelines before and after the violent storms and discovered many coastal sites had been completely rearranged. Boulders the size of houses and weighing 100 tonnes or more had been lifted up by waves, tilted over and bulldozed along cliff tops or shorelines, up to 220 metres (722ft) inland and up to 29 metres (95ft) above high water. It was a shocking revelation – previously it was thought that only tsunamis had the power to move such huge rocks. The study published in Earth-Science Reviews also revealed that the storm waves had created many of the boulders by tearing the rocks out of cliffs, or peeling them out of rocky shores."
"Ocean dead zones with zero oxygen have quadrupled in size since 1950, scientists have warned, while the number of very low oxygen sites near coasts have multiplied tenfold. Most sea creatures cannot survive in these zones and current trends would lead to mass extinction in the long run, risking dire consequences for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the sea. Climate change caused by fossil fuel burning is the cause of the large-scale deoxygenation, as warmer waters hold less oxygen. The coastal dead zones result from fertiliser and sewage running off the land and into the seas. The analysis, published in the journal Science, is the first comprehensive analysis of the areas and states: “Major extinction events in Earth’s history have been associated with warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans.” Denise Breitburg, at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in the US and who led the analysis, said: “Under the current trajectory that is where we would be headed. But the consequences to humans of staying on that trajectory are so dire that it is hard to imagine we would go quite that far down that path.” “This is a problem we can solve,” Breitburg said. “Halting climate change requires a global effort, but even local actions can help with nutrient-driven oxygen decline.” She pointed to recoveries in Chesapeake Bay in the US and the Thames river in the UK, where better farm and sewage practices led to dead zones disappearing. However, Prof Robert Diaz at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, who reviewed the new study, said: “Right now, the increasing expansion of coastal dead zones and decline in open ocean oxygen are not priority problems for governments around the world. Unfortunately, it will take severe and persistent mortality of fisheries for the seriousness of low oxygen to be realised.” The oceans feed more than 500 million people, especially in poorer nations, and provide jobs for 350 million people. But at least 500 dead zones have now been reported near coasts, up from fewer than 50 in 1950. Lack of monitoring in many regions means the true number may be much higher. The open ocean has natural low oxygen areas, usually off the west coast of continents due to the way the rotation of the Earth affects ocean currents. But these dead zones have expanded dramatically, increasing by millions of square kilometres since 1950, roughly equivalent to the area of the European Union.  Furthermore, the level of oxygen in all ocean waters is falling, with 2% – 77bn tonnes – being lost since 1950. This can reduce growth, impair reproduction and increase disease, the scientists warn. One irony is that warmer waters not only hold less oxygen but also mean marine organisms have to breathe faster, using up oxygen more quickly.  There are also dangerous feedback mechanisms. Microbes that proliferate at very low oxygen levels produce lots of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. In coastal regions, fertiliser, manure and sewage pollution cause algal blooms and when the algae decompose oxygen is sucked out of the water. However, in some places, the algae can lead to more food for fish and increase catches around the dead zones. This may not be sustainable though, said Breitburg: “There is a lot of concern that we are really changing the way these systems function and that the overall resilience of these systems may be reduced.” The new analysis was produced by an international working group created in 2016 by Unesco’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. The commission’s Kirsten Isensee said: “Ocean deoxygenation is taking place all over the world as a result of the human footprint, therefore we also need to address it globally.” Lucia von Reusner, campaign director of the campaign group, Mighty Earth, which recently exposed a link between the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico and large scale meat production, said: “These dead zones will continue to expand unless the major meat companies that dominate our global agricultural system start cleaning up their supply chains to keep pollution out of our waters.” Diaz said the speed of ocean suffocation already seen was breathtaking: “No other variable of such ecological importance to coastal ecosystems has changed so drastically in such a short period of time from human activities as dissolved oxygen.” He said the need for urgent action is best summarised by the motto of the American Lung Association: “If you can’t breathe, nothing else matters.”"
"Earth’s surface will almost certainly not warm up four or five degrees Celsius by 2100, according to a study which, if correct, voids worst-case UN climate change predictions. A revised calculation of how greenhouse gases drive up the planet’s temperature reduces the range of possible end-of-century outcomes by more than half, researchers said in the report, published in the journal Nature.  “Our study all but rules out very low and very high climate sensitivities,” said lead author Peter Cox, a professor at the University of Exeter. How effectively the world slashes CO2 and methane emissions, improves energy efficiency and develops technologies to remove CO2 from the air will determine whether climate change remains manageable or unleashes a maelstrom of human misery. But uncertainty about how hot things will get also stems from the inability of scientists to nail down a very simple question: By how much will Earth’s average surface temperature go up if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is doubled? That “known unknown” is called equilibrium climate sensitivity, and for the last 25 years the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the ultimate authority on climate science – has settled on a range of 1.5C to 4.5C (2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit). Cox and colleagues, using a new methodology, have come up with a far narrower range: 2.2C to 3.4C, with a best estimate of 2.8C. If accurate, it precludes the most destructive doomsday scenarios. “These scientists have produced a more accurate estimate of how the planet will respond to increasing CO2 levels,” said Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds. Gabi Hegerl, a climate scientist at the University of Edinburgh who, like Forster, did not take part in the research, added: “Having lower probability for very high sensitivity is reassuring. Very high sensitivity would have made it extremely hard to limit climate change according to the Paris targets.” The landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015 called for capping global warming at “well under” 2C compared to a pre-industrial benchmark, and pursuing efforts for a 1.5C ceiling. The findings should not be seen as taking pressure off the need to tackle climate change, the authors and other experts warned. “We will still see significant warming and impacts this century if we don’t increase our ambition to reduce CO2 emissions,” said Forster. Even a 1.5C increase will have consequences. With a single degree Celsius of warming so far, the Earth is already coping with a crescendo of climate impacts including deadly droughts, erratic rainfall, and storm surges engorged by rising seas. A 3.5 C world, scientists say, could pull at the fabric of civilisation. Since industrialisation took off in the early 19th century, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by nearly half, from 280 parts per million to 407 parts per million. Up to now global warming predictions have focused on the historical temperature record. Cox and colleagues instead “considered the year-to-year fluctuations in global temperature,” said Richard Allan, a climate scientist at the University of Reading. By analysing the responsiveness of short-term changes in temperature to “nudges and bumps” in the climate system, he explained, they were able to exclude the outcomes that would have resulted in devastating increases of 4C or more by 2100. One wild card not taken into consideration by the new model is the possibility of rapid shifts in climate brought on by the planet itself. “There is indeed evidence that the climate system can undergo abrupt changes or ‘tipping points’,” Cox said. The collapse of the gulf stream, the thawing of carbon-rich permafrost, or the melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica – any of these could quickly change the equation, and not in the Earth’s favour."

"Among scientists who work on climate change, perhaps the most anticipated information each year is how much the Earth has warmed. That information can only come from the oceans, because almost all heat is stored there. If you want to understand global warming, you need to first understand ocean warming. This isn’t to say other measurements are not also important. For instance, measurements of the air temperature just above the Earth are really important. We live in this air; it affects us directly. A great commentary on 2017 air temperatures is provided by my colleague Dana Nuccitelli. Another measurement that is important is sea level rise; so too is ocean acidification. We could go on and on identifying the markers of climate change. But in terms of understanding how fast the Earth is warming, the key is the oceans.   This important ocean information was just released today by a world-class team of researchers from China. The researchers (Lijing Cheng and Jiang Zhu) found that the upper 2000 meters (more than 6000 feet) of ocean waters were far warmer in 2017 than the previous hottest year. We measure heat energy in Joules. It turns out that 2017 was a record-breaking year, 1.51 × 1022 Joules hotter than any other year. For comparison, the annual electrical generation in China is 600 times smaller than the heat increase in the ocean. The authors provide a long history of ocean heat, going back to the late 1950s. By then there were enough ocean temperature sensors to get an accurate assessment of the oceans’ warmth. Their results are shown in the figure below. This graph shows ocean heat as an “anomaly,” which means a change from their baseline of 1981–2010. Columns in blue are cooler than the 1981-2010 period, while columns in red are warmer than that period. The best way to interpret this graph is to notice the steady rise in ocean heat over this long time period. What is interesting is that from year to year (or over the span of a few years), the heat in the oceans may increase or decrease. This is because there are natural fluctuations that can transfer extra energy to or from the waters. One such natural event is the well-known El Niño/La Niña cycle in the Pacific Ocean. During an El Niño, the Pacific Ocean tends to have very warm waters at the surface, which causes heat loss to the atmosphere (so the ocean cools and the atmosphere warms). Conversely, during a La Niña, the reverse process occurs.  There are other fluctuations and natural occurrences like volcanic eruptions and other changes in ocean currents. But it just means we don’t want to take any one year as proof of global warming. The fact that 2017 was the oceans’ hottest year doesn’t prove humans are warming the planet. But, the long term upward trend that extends back many decades does prove global warming. The graph above is the most important image to show someone who denies the reality of a changing climate.  It’s interesting to look at the top five years on record in terms of ocean heat; they are listed below. Note that these are the five hottest years ever recorded. Truly astonishing. The authors went a bit further and investigated how the heat was input into the oceans by region. They found that in 2017, a lot of heat was deposited in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The authors also calculated that all this heat resulted in approximately 2 mm rise in sea level (as water warms, it expands and so that ocean levels rise).  Further consequences of this heating include declining oxygen levels in the oceans, bleaching of coral reefs, and melting of both sea ice and ice shelves (the latter of which which will also raise sea levels). We are observing these effects. Arctic ice is undergoing a long-term decline, and it’s possible the Arctic will become ice-free. Massive coral bleaching events have been recorded, particularly in the waters off of Australia. The point is, the effects of global warming aren’t just academic; they are real. The consequences of this year-after-year-after-year warming have real impacts on humans. Fortunately, we know why the oceans are warming (because of human greenhouse gases), and we can do something about it. We can take action to reduce the heating of our planet by using energy more wisely and increasing the use of clean and renewable energy (like wind and solar power)."
"In January 1995 the Keating government’s attempts to curtail logging in old growth forests ran into fierce opposition when timber trucks blockaded Parliament House, ringing the building for days. The government had established the regional forest policy in 1992, in a bid to balance environmental preservation with jobs in the timber industry. Its aim was to preserve high-value native old growth forests but allow logging in less valuable industries and to encourage value-adding, rather than just exporting raw woodchips.  But achieving the two goals proved difficult.  Cabinet records for 1994 and 1995 held by the National Archives of Australia are accessible from 1 January 2018. Copies of 245 cabinet records from 1994 and 1995 have been made available to the media under embargo. The Guardian’s reports are based on these. Some were redacted due to national security concerns. Information about the cabinet records, copies of key cabinet documents, including selected submissions and decisions, are available on the national archives website. Requests for access to records not already released may be made via RecordSearch on the website.  Two agreements had been introduced in 1994 but some states were still to sign on and Tasmania had not committed to the national forest policy. In December 1994 Keating went further. Using the federal government’s export powers, he declared that the amount of woodchips exported from native forests not covered by regional forest agreements would be reduced by about 20% a year to zero by 2000. The timber industry reacted with a furious campaign that included the blockade. Labor was watching the growing popularity of the Greens with trepidation. But the timber industry was critical to the economies of Tasmania and parts of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, and the powerful timber workers’ union had lots of allies. In March and April 1995 the cabinet agreed to accelerate the process and fund more agreements, arguing that it was necessary to achieve “ecologically sustainable resource use and management which fulfils both commonwealth and state objectives for a forest region”. “Forest industry groups have indicated that they favour the development of [regional forest agreements] as a means of underpinning informed and durable forest land-use decisions,” the cabinet was told. “Conservation groups have mixed views, some being suspicious of the process and likely outcomes with others moderately supportive. Inevitably, RFAs will involve compromises in ambit conservation and industry positions, and this can be expected to attract criticism from the more extreme elements on both sides.”  The tensions played out in cabinet, particularly when the then primary industries minister, David Beddall, tried to renew 11 woodchip export licences against the advice of the environment department. Cabinet agreed to revise legislation to ensure “the minister for resources is bound by the national ceiling”. Preserving the Daintree in the north proved easier. In April 1994 the cabinet allocated $11.5m to buy private land on the margins of the Daintree world heritage area to prevent the sensitive area being compromised by creeping urban development. Treasury opposed the buyback, arguing it was bad precedent and that the cabinet should have used existing regulations to manage land left in private hands."
"For fans disappointed that the next series of Game of Thrones won’t be on our screens until 2019, here’s some food for thought: an attack on Westeros would be most likely to come from the south in winter and north in summer, according to a climate model of the world of Game of Thrones. Furthermore, the model also sheds light on many mysteries surrounding the climate of the lands of Westeros and Essos – including the likely hibernation zones of White Walkers and the similarities between The Wall and Lapland.  You might well wonder why I and other climate science colleagues from Cardiff and Southampton universities have recently spent some of our spare time creating climate models of a fictional world. After all, is it helpful to know, as the model suggests, that due to the nature of the winds between Westeros and Essos, an attack on Westeros (whether by dragons, ships or both), would probably come via the south (from Dorne or Storm’s End) in winter, but more northerly (Vale of Arryn, or direct to King’s Landing), in summer? And what of the revelation from the model that that the Iron Fleet’s naval prowess can be explained by very strong winds in the region of the Iron Islands? Or the knowledge that the temperatures predicted by the model indicate that in summer, the only places north of The Wall that are below freezing are the high-altitude regions of the Frostfangs, perhaps indicating the likely summer hibernation zones of White Walkers?  Apart from the fact that we found it fascinating to flesh out this fictional world with our model, it’s also a nice way to illustrate how climate models work and to highlight some fascinating climate science going on in the real world. For example, the SWEET project is currently using novel techniques to reconstruct the climate of super-warm states of Earth’s past – which in turn will help to test state-of- the-art climate models under conditions of high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations similar to those expected by the end of this century. In our Game of Thrones model, by comparing the climate of places in the real world with those predicted by the model for the world of Game of Thrones, it could be seen that The Wall, where the land of Westeros is guarded from the White Walkers, has a climate in winter similar to that of Lapland. In contrast Casterly Rock, the stronghold of the scheming Lannisters, has a climate similar to that of Houston, Texas, and Changsha in China. But how did we create the model in the first place? When carrying out this “work”, which is written up in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of King’s Landing and the Twitter account of @ClimateSamwell, the first step was to modify a “normal” climate model so that the land and ocean was laid out as in the maps provided by George RR Martin in the Game of Thrones books.   The model was then modified to have the characteristic “extended seasons”, which the books and TV series describe as lasting several years. In the real world, the tilt of the spinning axis of the planet is at a fixed angle throughout the year, resulting in our characteristic four seasons. One way that seasons can be made to last longer is to allow this tilt of the spinning axis to change throughout the year, so that the Earth “tumbles” on its axis – a bit like a spinning top. If the Earth tumbles exactly once in a single year, then the spin axis always points towards (or away) from the sun, and the winter (or summer) is then permanent. Interestingly, a very similar tumble – but occurring on much longer timescales of tens of thousands of years – causes major changes to the climate of our own planet. For example, 6,000 years ago it resulted in plants in the middle of what is today’s Sahara desert, and contributed to the ice age cycle that caused much of the UK to be covered in thick ice 20,000 years ago. We also modelled the global warming that would occur if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were to be doubled, perhaps due to increases in CO2 and methane emissions from dragons and the excessive use of wildfire. The model estimates a global warming of 2.1C for a doubling of CO2 in the world of Game of Thrones.  The work illustrates that because climate models are based on fundamental scientific processes – many of which have been known since the days of Isaac Newton – they are able not only to simulate the climate of the modern Earth, but can also be easily adapted to simulate any planet past, present, future, or imagined, as long as the underlying continental positions and greenhouse gas concentrations are known.  Furthermore – and this is what I do in my “day job” – for some super-warm time periods in Earth’s past, there is geological data available that indicates what the climate actually was like, so we are able to test the climate models under high carbon dioxide conditions, similar to those we might expect by the end of this century if we continue emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate.  Such testing of climate models under super-warm greenhouse conditions is crucial if we are to have confidence in their predictions of the future – either for Earth or Westeros.

"A global campaign is being launched to turn a huge tract of the seas around the Antarctic into the world’s biggest sanctuary, protecting wildlife and helping the fight against climate change. The huge 1.8m sq km reserve – five times the size of Germany – would ban all fishing in a vast area of the Weddell Sea and around the Antarctic Peninsula, safeguarding species including penguins, killer whales, leopard seals and blue whales.  The idea was originally put forward by the EU and is being backed by a new Greenpeace campaign to be launched on Monday. The proposal already has the support of several countries – including the UK – and will go before a conference of the Antarctic nations in October. Will McCallum, of Greenpeace’s new Protect the Antarctic campaign, said: “The next few years are absolutely essential for the future of our oceans and we are in desperate need for governments to come together and do what is best for these amazing ecosystems.” He said a decision in 2016 to create a smaller sanctuary around the Ross Sea in the Antarctic proved global cooperation to protect the oceans is possible.  “Now we want to go one better and create the world’s largest protected area. We want to create that momentum that says this is not just possible, it is inevitable if we are to protect the wildlife that call the ocean home and crucially help mitigate the worst effects of climate change.” The sanctuary would stop industrial-scale krill fishing in the area, which scientists say is decimating key food that many larger animals – from penguins to whales – rely on. Norway, China, South Korea and Russia are big players in the krill fishing industry and campaigners say the success of the proposal will depend on persuading those countries to back it. McCallum said: “World leaders shouldn’t allow an ocean wilderness to be exploited by a handful of companies. In the 1980s it took a global movement to protect the Antarctic’s land. Now we need to protect its oceans.” Greenpeace are setting off on a three-month expedition of the Antarctic this week and say a quarter of a million people around the world are already signed up to support the idea.  24 national governments and the EU are members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources [CCAMLR], which is responsible for the conservation of Antarctic waters. It will decide on the new sanctuary proposal at a conference in Australia in October. Julian Gutt from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, which put forward the original proposal, said it would be an important moment in the fight to create a sustainable global ocean system. “This will bring huge benefits in protecting this amazing ecosystem, in preserving the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of the ocean and in the wider fight against climate change.” The seas around Antarctica are some of the most important in the world with a huge diversity of species. If successful, campaigners hope the sanctuary will build momentum towards a UN ambition to create a network of marine protected areas covering international waters. Experts say that, as well as protecting wildlife by allowing ecosystems to recover in and around the Antarctic, the ocean sanctuary would provide global benefits, with recovering fish populations spreading around the world, encouraging vital biodiversity and providing food security for billions of people. Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, said the sanctuary would also play a key role in tackling climate change – soaking up huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  “The Antarctic is very important in locking away carbon in deep-sea sediments. There is also a very rapid rate of sinking there – it has some of the coldest waters in the world … and this sinking is one of the great pumps of the global ocean system.” He added that the new sanctuary would be an important step to preserving a sustainable global oceans system. “The Antarctic is a massively important area and you mess with it at your peril.”"
"It’s nothing much to look at, but the tangle of pipes, pumps, tanks, reactors, chimneys and ducts on a messy industrial estate outside the logging town of Squamish in western Canada could just provide the fix to stop the world tipping into runaway climate change and substitute dwindling supplies of conventional fuel. It could also make Harvard superstar physicist David Keith, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and oil sands magnate Norman Murray Edwards more money than they could ever dream of.  The idea is grandiose yet simple: decarbonise the global economy by extracting global-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) straight from the air, using arrays of giant fans and patented chemical whizzery; and then use the gas to make clean, carbon-neutral synthetic diesel and petrol to drive the world’s ships, planes and trucks. The hope is that the combination of direct air capture (DAC), water electrolysis and fuels synthesis used to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels can be made to work at a global scale, for little more than it costs to extract and sell fossil fuel today. This would revolutionise the world’s transport industry, which emits nearly one-third of total climate-changing emissions. It would be the equivalent of mechanising photosynthesis. The individual technologies may not be new, but their combination at an industrial scale would be groundbreaking. Carbon Engineering, the company set up in 2009 by leading geoengineer Keith, with money from Gates and Murray, has constructed a prototype plant, installed large fans, and has been extracting around one tonne of pure CO2 every day for a year. At present it is released back into the air. But Carbon Engineering (CE) has just passed another milestone. Working with California energy company Greyrock, it has now begun directly synthesising a mixture of petrol and diesel, using only CO2 captured from the air and hydrogen split from water with clean electricity – a process they call Air to Fuels (A2F). “A2F is a potentially game-changing technology, which if successfully scaled up will allow us to harness cheap, intermittent renewable electricity to drive synthesis of liquid fuels that are compatible with modern infrastructure and engines,” says Geoff Holmes of CE. “This offers an alternative to biofuels and a complement to electric vehicles in the effort to displace fossil fuels from transportation.” Synthetic fuels have been made from CO2 and H2 before, on a small scale. “But,” Holmes adds, “we think our pilot plant is the first instance of Air to Fuels where all the equipment has large-scale industrial precedent, and thus gives real indication of commercial performance and viability, and leads directly to scale-up and deployment.” The next step is to raise the money, scale up and then commercialise the process using low-carbon electricity like solar PV (photovoltaics). Company publicity envisages massive walls of extractor fans sited outside cities and on non-agricultural land, supplying CO2 for fuel synthesis, and eventually for direct sequestration. “A2F is the future,” says Holmes, “because it needs 100 times less land and water than biofuels, and can be scaled up and sited anywhere. But for it to work, it will have to reduce costs to little more than it costs to extract oil today, and – even trickier – persuade countries to set a global carbon price.” Meanwhile, 4,500 miles away, in a large blue shed on a small industrial estate in the South Yorkshire coalfield outside Sheffield, the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC) is experimenting with other ways to produce negative emissions. The UKCCSRC is what remains of Britain’s official foray into carbon capture and storage (CCS), which David Cameron had backed strongly until 2015. £1bn was ringfenced for a competition between large companies to extract CO2 from coal and gas plants and then store it, possibly in old North Sea gas wells. But the plan unravelled as austerity bit, and the UK’s only running CCS pilot plant, at Ferrybridge power station, was abandoned. The Sheffield laboratory is funded by £2.7m of government money and run by Sheffield University. It is researching different fuels, temperatures, solvents and heating speeds to best capture the CO2 for the next generation of CCS plants, and is capturing 50 tonnes of CO2 a year. And because Britain is phasing out coal power stations, the focus is on achieving negative emissions by removing and storing CO2 emitted from biomass plants, which burn pulverised wood. As the wood has already absorbed carbon while it grows, it is more or less carbon-neutral when burned. If linked to a carbon capture plant, it theoretically removes carbon from the atmosphere. Known as Beccs (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), this negative emissions technology is seen as vital if the UK is to meet its long-term climate target of an 80% cut in emissions at 1990 levels by 2050, according to UKCCSRC director Professor Jon Gibbins. The plan, he says, is to capture emissions from clusters of major industries, such as refineries and steelworks in places like Teesside, to reduce the costs of transporting and storing it underground. “Direct air capture is no substitute for using conventional CCS,” says Gibbins. “Cutting emissions from existing sources at the scale of millions of tonnes a year, to stop the CO2 getting into the air in the first place, is the first priority. “The best use for all negative emission technologies is to offset emissions that are happening now – paid for by the emitters, or by the fossil fuel suppliers. We need to get to net zero emissions before the sustainable CO2 emissions are used up. This is estimated at around 1,000bn tonnes, or around 20-30 years of global emissions based on current trends,” he says. “Having to go to net negative emissions is obviously unfair and might well prove an unfeasible burden for a future global society already burdened by climate change.” The challenge is daunting. Worldwide manmade emissions must be brought to “net zero” no later than 2090, says the UN’s climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That means balancing the amount of carbon released by humans with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference. But that will not be enough. To avoid runaway climate change, emissions must then become “net negative”, with more carbon being removed than emitted. Many countries, including the UK, assume that negative emissions will be deployed at a large scale. But only a handful of CCS and pilot negative-emission plants are running anywhere in the world, and debate still rages over which, if any, technologies should be employed. (A prize of $25m put up by Richard Branson in 2007 to challenge innovators to find a commercially viable way to remove at least 1bn tonnes of atmospheric CO2 a year for 10 years, and keep it out, has still not been claimed – possibly because the public is uncertain about geoengineering.) The achilles heel of all negative emission technologies is cost. Government policy units assume that they will become economically viable, but the best hope of Carbon Engineering and other direct air extraction companies is to get the price down to $100 a tonne from the current $600. Even then, to remove just 1% of global emissions would cost around $400bn a year, and would need to be continued for ever. Storing the CO2 permanently would cost extra. Critics say that these technologies are unfeasible. Not using the fossil fuel and not producing the emissions in the first place would be much cleverer than having to find end-of-pipe solutions, say Professor Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, and Glen Peters, research director at the Centre for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Norway. In a recent article in the journal Science, the two climate scientists said they were not opposed to research on negative emission technologies, but thought the world should proceed on the premise that they will not work at scale. Not to do so, they said, would be a “moral hazard par excellence”. Instead, governments are relying on these technologies to remove hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere. “It is breathtaking,” says Anderson. “By the middle of the century, many of the models assume as much removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by negative emission technologies as is absorbed naturally today by all of the world’s oceans and plants combined. They are not an insurance policy; they are a high-risk gamble with tomorrow’s generations, particularly those living in poor and climatically vulnerable communities, set to pay the price if our high-stakes bet fails to deliver as promised.” According to Anderson, “The beguiling appeal of relying on future negative emission technologies is that they delay the need for stringent and politically challenging policies today – they pass the buck for reducing carbon on to future generations. But if these Dr Strangelove technologies fail to deliver at the planetary scale envisaged, our own children will be forced to endure the consequences of rapidly rising temperatures and a highly unstable climate.” Kris Milkowski, business development manager at the UKCCSRC, says: “Negative emissions technology is unavoidable and here to stay. We are simply not moving [to cut emissions] fast enough. If we had an endless pile of money, we could potentially go totally renewable energy. But that transition cannot happen overnight. This, I fear, is the only large-scale solution.”"
"The lack of women in energy companies is holding back the sector’s efforts to tackle climate change, a leading industry watcher has warned. Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said poor gender diversity meant the industry was less open to new ideas, in particular the move to a lower-carbon energy system. “I absolutely do think that the fact that the industry is so dominated by men and particularly older white men it is slowing down the energy transition,” said Mitchell, who has worked on energy issues for more than 30 years and advises the government, regulators and businesses. An energy conference featuring women-only panels is being held next month to address the lack of visibility of female leaders in the sector.  “I thought we really need to have something where all these women who are great get to speak,” said Mitchell, who has helped organise the event. She admitted it was not a given that women are more progressive on energy issues than men, but noted that the “conventional” parts of the sector – fossil fuel power generation and energy networks – are more male-dominated than greener, innovative companies. “The fact we are not moving is not good for Britain, is not good for the environment,” she said of attitudes slowing the transition to renewable and decentralised energy. Juliet Davenport, the chief executive of the energy supplier Good Energy, said the argument was credible. “The energy sector is lagging sorely behind other industries in terms of diversity, meanwhile sustainable [green] businesses are very balanced. So the idea that lack of diversity is contributing to the issue of transition to renewables is very plausible,” she said. Nearly two-thirds of the leading 89 energy companies in the UK have no women on their boards and industry events with men-only panels, or just one woman, are common.  One female energy expert said she had been disinvited from a panel of chief executives at an annual event after a company deputised a female executive.  “It became a panel of CEOs, with a woman, and so they did not ‘need’ another woman,” she said. Sometimes it is a case of being the only woman in the room. One senior female executive said she was the sole woman at a meeting hosted by an influential male government adviser in London.  Sexual harassment is not unknown either: one female leader, who did not want to be named, said she was groped by the head of a trade body at an awards event several years ago. Felicity Jones, a partner at the renewables and energy storage consultancy Everoze, recalled being in a speaker’s room at a conference when a fellow speaker asked for a coffee refill, assuming she was one of the catering staff. “That kind of thing happens, but I laugh it off. Because it works both ways: often my gender gives me an advantage. I do a lot of business development and pretty much all of my counterparts at competitors are men. That means that I stand out,” she said. Occasionally, the lack of gender diversity breaks out in public. During a recent questioning of energy chiefs by MPs on the impact of a price cap, the Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach said: “I am quite struck by the panel. We have four men here.” Sandbach went on to scold the retail chief executive of SSE, Stephen Forbes, for the company’s 19.4% gender pay gap, a figure he attempted to defend. Some in the industry are making an effort to address the problem, such as the big six lobby group Energy UK, which has banned men-only panels at its events. “The energy sector is undergoing a huge period of transition, which brings with it a huge opportunity to increase gender balance,” said the group’s external affairs director, Abbie Sampson."
"The future of snowsports is under threat, according to a report into the impact of climate change on grassroots and elite sport. Although it has been well below freezing as athletes prepared for the Winter Olympics in South Korea this week, winter temperatures in the Alps, where many British competitors train, could rise by up to 4C by 2100. By then, only six of the past 19 Winter Olympics venues could be sufficiently cold to act as host cities. The Met Office has warned the skiing industry in Scotland could collapse within 50 years as winters become too mild for regular snowfall. The Team GB snowboarder Aimee Fuller, whose annual training venue in Switzerland has undergone huge change in the past decade, said: “Snowboarding is really susceptible to the impact of climate change and we can see the impact on our sport in the mountains on a daily basis.” In the UK, the governing bodies of cricket and golf are growing increasingly concerned about the effect of extreme weather related to climate change. According to the England and Wales Cricket Board, 27% of England’s home one-day internationals have been played with reduced overs since 2000 because of rain. At least 175 days of play, equivalent to around 16,000 overs, have been lost in five of the past 10 years in the County Championship. Some of the most famous golf courses in the country, including St Andrews, are at threat from climate related coastal erosion, according to the report from the Climate Coalition, which also notes the toll extreme weather is taking on junior football. The future of county cricket is in jeopardy, according to Dan Cherry, the head of operations at Glamorgan, where the rate of rain-affected matches has more than doubled since 2011. “Our experience is becoming the norm for almost every club and it’s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact,” Cherry said. “It’s been worst in recent years – during the 2017 season five of our seven T20 Blast fixtures were badly affected by rain, with three being totally abandoned. T20 Blast is a great way to get new people through the gates but they won’t come back if this keeps happening and it’s damaged the club to the tune of £1m. If we don’t take it seriously, climate change will fundamentally alter the game.” Sea-level rise poses the most serious threat to golf in the UK, including at St Andrews, known as the home of golf. Some believe a 20% decline in golf club membership since 2005 can be partially ascribed to worsening weather trends. Steve Isaac, the director of sustainability at the R&A, said: “Golf is impacted by climate change more than most other sports. We are witnessing different types and timings of disease, pest and weed outbreaks.”"
"Your correspondent June Lewis (Letters, 29 December), having referred to Country diary, says that the country – by which I think she means the countryside and nature – is “carrying on happily”. While the natural world does indeed carry on functioning regardless of politics (sometimes almost in spite of it), that world of nature struggles more than ever to maintain diversity of species with loss of habitat, environmental pollution, pesticides, climate change and human thoughtlessness. I mention just a few casualties: hedgehogs, butterflies, meadow flowers and some common birds, the numbers of all of which have declined over the last few generations in particular. Not a cause for rejoicing.Margaret PorterGillingham, Dorset  • John Gilbey may not be right about the new nesting box location being more desirable (Country diary, Comins Coch, Ceredigion 30 December).

"Canadian climate science is facing a looming crisis whose repercussions could be felt far beyond the country’s borders, hundreds of scientists have warned, after the Canadian government failed to renew the country’s only dedicated funding program for climate and atmospheric research.   In an open letter addressed to Justin Trudeau, more than 250 scientists from 22 countries highlight their concern over the imminent end of the C$35m Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program.  Launched in 2012, the program funded seven research networks that explored issues such as the impact of aerosols, changing sea ice and snow cover, as well as atmospheric temperatures in the high Arctic.  Much of the research emerging from the program was focused on Canada’s Arctic, yielding data sets that were used around the world by scientists seeking to better understand climate change and its impacts.  The government’s decision came as a surprise to many in Canada, said Dan Weaver of Evidence For Democracy, the research advocacy group who published the letter on Monday.  “The government has taken great effort to engage with policies around climate and climate education, green energy and a lot of these great things,” he said. “But somehow along the way, the support for the atmospheric science – the underlying science of the issue – has been overlooked.” Scientists in Canada first sounded the alarm last spring after noticing that the 2017 federal budget did not include funding for the program. Amid public outcry the government said it would extend funding for one of the program’s projects; a one-of-a-kind research lab located some 1,100 km from the North Pole.  While the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory now has funding until the fall of 2019, the six remaining projects are bracing for their funding to dry up in March.  The loss of these projects will be felt globally, says the letter. Canada’s scientists are uniquely positioned to research the Arctic, arguably the world’s most critical region when it comes to quantifying how and why the climate is changing, said signatory Gloria Manney, a senior research scientist at the Northwest Research Associates in the US. “Continuous, stable funding support for Canadian atmospheric and climate science is thus crucial to advancing understanding of our planet.” As the Trump administration seeks to devalue climate science, Canada’s commitment to climate research is needed now more than ever, said signatory Benjamin D Santer, a senior climate researcher at the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. “The world is looking to Canada for political leadership that the United States is currently unable to provide,” he said. While Trudeau government’s stated support for climate science and the Paris climate agreement has been encouraging, “such support cannot be limited to fine-sounding words”, he said. “It must be backed by a real commitment to preserve and sustain the unique climate measurement, climate monitoring, and climate modeling capabilities that Canada possesses.” In response to the letter, Canada’s minister of science pointed to the additional C$70m her government had set aside for climate research in the last budget, adding to the C$37m provided annually by federal research granting councils. “We are doing more to combat climate change than any Canadian federal government in history,” Kirsty Duncan said in a statement. “Our government will continue to support and invest in the actions necessary to address climate change.”  Weaver welcomed these efforts, but he said they should be paired with long term funding for research. “If Canada isn’t contributing this key piece of the puzzle, no one else can,” he said. “The Trudeau government is taking concrete actions on climate and science in a variety of ways, but it’s missing a critical piece,” he said. “And that’s what this is all about – ensuring that this gap is filled in some way or another.”"
"What will happen if climate change pushes clouds higher into the sky, as models predict? One ecosystem that will be seriously affected will be cloud forests – tropical jungles persistently bathed in fog. Until now, little research had been done on the likely impacts of rising clouds, but one scientist is planning to change that using an enormous curtain strung up in the middle of the forest.  Cloud forest thrives on mountainsides at 500-4,000 metres above sea level, making up about 1% of the world’s forest in a tropical band that hugs the equator. But, though the area covered is small, the forests are vital to much broader regions. For instance, they help regulate rivers across vast tracts of lowlands, absorbing moisture into spongy soil when the weather is wet and releasing water when it’s dry. And they provide habitats for many birds, such as the coppery headed emerald hummingbird of Costa Rica and the elfin wood warbler of Puerto Rico, both of which live only in cloud forests. Many scientists believe the process forcing clouds higher may already have begun. This would diminish a cloud forest’s moisture and it’s uncertain whether forests could successfully migrate uphill in response. Examining the impact of clouds relocating is critical to understanding the future of the forests. Dan Metcalfe, a biology professor at Lund University in Sweden, wants hard data so he can determine what will happen to the forests that remain if the models are correct. He explains he’s trying something never before done: “an experimental approach where we actually physically try to remove clouds from a portion of the forest”. Metcalfe had planned to encircle a square plot twice the size of a basketball court with a mesh curtain suspended from 10-storey phone poles at each corner. Fog would condense on the fabric, leaving the interior moisture-starved. He chose the Wayqecha Biological Station, a cloud forest research centre 3,000m above sea level in Peru. But he didn’t factor in the difficulty of operating heavy equipment at Wayqecha. Precipitous slopes and fragile soil prevent hauling in the kind of drill rig that could set corner posts deeply enough for big nets. No roads penetrate to Wayqecha’s groves, only footpaths. Metcalfe realised he’d have to install bolted metal lattice towers. These can be hand-carried in pieces, then assembled on site. They can be built atop slender footings and stabilised by guy wires installed with lightweight equipment. But they’re expensive. He couldn’t afford two, let alone four, and feared that he might have to cancel the project. But then Metcalfe heard that not long before, the station had suffered a misfortune that could help him. Wayqecha already had three lattice towers, supporting a catwalk over a ravine. Until recently, the walkway had included a fourth tower, but it had been toppled by a landslide. However, the structure’s struts and decking were undamaged. Rather than completely enclosing a plot in nets, Metcalfe realised he could suspend a single mesh curtain across the path of mist blowing up a valley. The fog-catching curtain would dangle from a cable stretched between one of the undamaged towers and a new one he’d build out of the one that had fallen. Metcalfe encountered obstacle after obstacle even carrying out his plan: a key member of his construction team got sick and needed months of recovery; a fire destroyed expensive gear; and Peruvian customs balked when they saw that a shipping container of construction supplies included the bow and arrow he’d need for stringing cables. In the four years since he started the project, his wife had a child. And then another. It got tougher to leave home for Peru. But finally, the curtain is nearly done. A crew built the tower in September and the last step, suspending the curtain above the forest floor, was completed at the end of October. Soon, Metcalfe will be able to shed light on the future of the forest. • Reporting for this story was supported in part by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting and the Whole Systems Foundation."
"Climate myths are often contradictory – it’s not warming, though it’s warming because of the sun, and really it’s all just an ocean cycle – but they all seem to share one thing in common: logical fallacies and reasoning errors.  John Cook, Peter Ellerton, and David Kinkead have just published a paper in Environmental Research Letters in which they examined 42 common climate myths and found that every single one demonstrates fallacious reasoning. For example, the authors made a video breaking down the logical flaws in the myth ‘climate changed naturally in the past so current climate change is natural.’  Cook has previously published research on using ‘misconception-based learning’ to dislodge climate myths from peoples’ brains and replace them with facts, and beating denial by inoculating people against misinformers’ tricks. The idea is that when people are faced with a myth and a competing fact, the fact will more easily win out if the fallacy underpinning the myth is revealed. In fact, these concepts of misconception-based learning and inoculation against myths were the basis of the free online Denial101x course developed by Cook and colleagues. The new paper published today suggests an even more proactive approach to defeating myths. If people can learn to implement a simple six-step critical thinking process, they’ll be able to evaluate whether climate-related claims are valid. Step 1: Identify the claim being made. For example, the most popular contrarian argument: “Earth’s climate has changed naturally in the past, so current climate change is natural.” Step 2: Construct the argument by identifying the premises leading to that conclusion. In this case, the first premise is that Earth’s climate has changed in the past through natural processes, and the second premise is that the climate is currently changing. So far, so good. Step 3: Determine whether the argument is deductive, meaning that it starts out with a general statement and reaches a definitive conclusion. In our case, ‘current climate change is natural’ qualifies as a definitive conclusion. Step 4: Check the argument for validity; does the conclusion follow from the premises? In our example, it doesn’t follow that current climate change must be natural because climate changed naturally in the past. However, we can fix that by weakening the conclusion to “the current climate change may not be the result of human activity.” But in its weakened state, the conclusion no longer refutes human-caused global warming. Step 4a: Identify hidden premises. By adding an extra premise to make an invalid argument valid, we can gain a deeper understanding of why the argument is flawed. In this example, the hidden assumption is “if nature caused climate change in the past, it must always be the cause of climate change.” Adding this premise makes the argument logically valid, but makes it clear why the argument is false - it commits single cause fallacy, assuming that only one thing can cause climate change. Step 5: Check to see if the argument relies on ambiguity. For example, the argument that human activity is not necessary to explain current climate change because natural and human factors can both cause climate change is ambiguous about the ‘climate change’ in question. Not all climate change is equal, and the rate of current change is more than 20 times faster than natural climate changes. Therefore, human activity is necessary to explain current climate change. Step 6: If the argument hasn’t yet been ruled out, determine the truth of its premises. For example, the argument that “if something was the cause in the past, it will be the cause in the future” is invalid if the effect has multiple plausible causes or mechanisms (as with climate change). In our example, this is where the myth most obviously falls apart (although it had already failed in Step 4). The authors suggest that their six-step critical thinking process can be deployed via social media through ‘technocognition,’ and in the classroom. Co-author David Kinkead from the University of Queensland said: We hope our work will act as a building block for developing educational and social media resources, which teach and encourage critical thinking through the examination of both misinformation and fallacious reasoning. Lead author John Cook envisions that educators and others can use this approach to neutralize climate myths themselves: Our critical thinking process is a useful tool that scientists, educators, and communicators can employ to identify fallacies in misinformation, which they can use to create inoculating messages that neutralize the myths. This approach is practical, achievable and potentially impactful in both the short-term (e.g., in social media applications) and long-term (incorporating this kind of content into curriculum). Misinformation needs short, sharp, immediate inoculation. Our paper provides a blueprint into how to write these inoculations. Climate denial suffers badly from a lack of critical thinking, which has spread all the way to the White House. Teaching people to think critically can help prevent it from spreading even further. "
"The Australian Industry Group has warned that Tony Abbott’s call to rule out the use of international carbon credits will push up the cost of meeting emissions targets. The Turnbull government’s review of its climate policies, released before Christmas, flagged the Coalition’s intention to allow use of international permits to help Australia meet its international emissions reductions commitments.  Carbon credit schemes would allow Australian energy companies to buy credits for abatement projects, such as tree-planting in developing countries, to meet restrictions on emissions in the proposed national energy guarantee. On Wednesday Abbott said he did not support overseas carbon credits being available to Australian businesses because it was a form of “carbon trading, which is a carbon tax under a different name”. “That just means that Aussie consumers end up shovell­ing our money to foreign carbon traders and we all know the ­potential for rorts there,” he told the Australian. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said industry had advocated for international credits for many years “as a cost effective means of achieving our obligations”. “The sensible approach is to meet our obligations in the least costly ways possible,” Willox said. “And in some cases it will be less expensive to meet these obligations by reducing emissions [or sequestering carbon dioxide] in other countries. “It makes absolutely no sense to rule out this option by insisting that our commitments can only be fulfilled within our borders. “This can only increase the costs of meeting our international obligations.” Willox said Australians would need to be “totally satisfied” commitments were met with genuine reductions with “strict methodologies and transparent measurement”, but that was true wherever abatement was achieved. He said meeting Australia’s commitment in the Paris climate agreement would “inevitably” involve some cost. A spokesman for the Business Council of Australia said it also supported the use of “credible international permits as a practical measure to reduce emissions”.  He said support for international permits was a practical measure that would “help provide the flexibility and capacity for Australian businesses to participate in what is fundamentally a global issue”. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has stood by the in-principle support for international credits but said a final decision on the quantity and quality limits would be made by 2020. He hit back at Abbott’s comments, arguing that international credits have been on the table since the Abbott government signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Frydenberg said the climate review showed that the Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group and the Minerals Council all strongly support international permits. “It is worth noting that Mr ­Abbott’s position on international permits is closer to the Greens than that of Australia’s big employers,” he told the Australian. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chairman of the government’s backbench committee on climate and energy, has backed Abbott’s call to rule out the use of international permits. Kelly has advocated that Australia backload its emissions reduction target, opting to make less abatement in the short term and achieve higher emissions reductions closer to the 2030 deadline when renewable energy technology advances may make it cheaper to do so. “I am still relatively confident that under the Neg our Paris commitment can be achieved, taking advantage of technology, at virtually zero cost, if the trajectory is done in a sensible manner,” he told Guardian Australia. Kelly said if Australia could not meet its targets in that way “you’ve got to ask yourself if we have set that target too stringently” and there would be a debate about what price the community is prepared to pay to meet the targets."
"The risk to global civilisation is as high today as it has ever been in the face of twin threats, nuclear weapons and climate change, a group of leading scientists has announced, putting a significant share of the blame on the Trump administration. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its symbolic Doomsday Clock forward 30 seconds, to two minutes to midnight, in a reflection of how the scientists view the dangers facing the world.  The only other time the clock was set so close to catastrophe in its 71-year history was in 1953, after the US and the Soviet Union detonated their first thermonuclear bombs.  In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, the clock was set back to 17 minutes to midnight, but optimism about humanity’s future has steadily eroded since then.  “To call the world’s nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy,” said Rachel Bronson, the bulletin’s president and CEO, told journalists in Washington.  In explaining their decision on Thursday, scientists from the bulletin’s widely respected science and security board said that they were disturbed by the rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, the increasing emphasis and expenditure on nuclear weapons by major powers, the absence of arms control negotiations around the world, and the wavering political will to combat climate change. In the year since the hands on the Doomsday Clock were last adjusted, North Korea has carried out its sixth nuclear test, the most powerful to date and almost certainly its first hydrogen bomb. It has also made three successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the third of which, in November, appeared to be capable of reaching New York or Washington. At the same time, Trump has engaged in a highly personalised exchange of insults with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. He has threatened “fire and fury” against the nation, and vowed to “totally destroy” if Pyongyang continued to threaten the US American strategic bombers have flown north of the 38th parallel that divides the peninsula, along the North Korean coast. The bulletin’s scientists repeatedly singled out the Trump administration as a major factor behind the increased risks to the planet, pointing out the president’s volatility as expressed in his tweets and statements; the inconsistency of the administration’s foreign policy; and its apparent disdain for science, reflected in its high-level appointments, which have included climate change deniers. “Our allies and adversaries alike are being forced [into a] thicket of conflicting policy statements, from a US administration weakened in its roster of foreign policy professionals and unable to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent foreign – much less nuclear – policy,” said Robert Rosner, the chair of the bulletin’s science and security board. “This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability.” Sharon Squassoni, a professor at George Washington University’s institute for international science and technology policy also pointed to Russia’s role in heightening tensions. Last year, for instance, it fielded ground-launched cruise missiles, violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. “Russia has engaged in provocative and illegal behaviours thought to be part of cold war history,” Squassoni said.  Some experts argue that the comparison with the height of the cold war was an exaggeration.  “During the height of the cold war there was a nontrivial risk of global nuclear annihilation,” Vipin Narang, a North Korea and nuclear expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a tweet. “Today, the risk of single use may be higher but it’s unlikely to threaten global destruction.” The bulletin scientists said that climate change also weighed heavily in their deliberations. After flattening out for some years, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise and the levels of the polar ice caps are at new lows.  “Here in the US, the incoming President Trump promptly appointed a cadre of avowed climate denialists and quickly started reversing existing climate measures,” said Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute.  Trump was also criticised for downgrading the science in his administration. Lawrence Krauss, the chair of the bulletin’s board of sponsors, said that 2017 marked that the first time since the position was created more than a half-century ago that there was no presidential science adviser.  “The White House office of science and technology policy is essentially not staffed,” Krauss said. “The official mechanisms to tie public policy to reality are currently absent.” "
"A week-long heatwave has floored New Zealand, breaking temperature records across the country and causing a nationwide shortage of fans. Temperatures have soared above 37C (98.6F) in parts of the South Island, with records broken in Dunedin, Wanaka, Christchurch and many other cities and towns. Temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday or Wednesday around the high 30s or 40C mark – highs that are proving particularly challenging for school children as many New Zealand classrooms are equipped with heaters but not air conditioners. Ben Noll, a meteorologist from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), said unusually warm sea temperatures were the major factor contributing to the heatwave, as the mainland experienced a dramatic rise in land temperatures as soon as the sea rose above average. Niwa has recorded seas of 24C to 26C around Auckland, compared with 18C to 22C at the same time last year. New Zealand was tracking towards its warmest January on record, Noll said, with high temperatures expected to continue into February. He added: “In New Zealand its quite rare to get above 30C or even 35C, so New Zealanders are finding this tough because it’s not something they’re accustomed to. “We have no fans left and air conditioning is much less prevalent than in many other countries.” The Howard League for Penal Reform told RNZ it had heard reports of prisoners fainting from the extreme heat in unventilated cells and of prison guards struggling to cope in stab-resistant body armour. The chief coroner, Judge Deborah Marshall, issued a warning for people with health issues to take extra precautions, after a woman died in Christchurch from heatwave conditions. Hospitals around the country have reported an increase in patients – many of them elderly – presenting with heat stress and severe sun exposure. A nationwide shortage of fans prompted prime minister Jacinda Ardern to improvise, with her partner Clarke Gayford refurbishing a broken fan to keep the couple cool.  “Climate change means summer temperatures are expected to rise across both the North and South Island, increasing the risk of heat stress and subtropical diseases,” said associate health minister Julie Anne Genter. “Climate change is also likely to result in more droughts, wildfires, floods and infectious disease across the country. These are potentially big challenges for the health sector and I want to make sure it is ready to tackle them.” Ardern has called tackling climate change “my generation’s nuclear-free moment”.  The regions of Otago and Southland were expected to declare drought conditions this week after months of little to no rain. Some cattle and sheep farmers have taken to moving stock in the middle of the night to avoid the heat. Droughts have already been declared in the lower North Island and the South Island’s west coast, with the government offering farmers emergency relief funding.   New Zealand’s current hottest temperature on record was 42.4C, recorded in Rangiora in the South Island in February 1973, according to Niwa."
"President Donald Trump would be willing to sign the US back up to the Paris climate accord, but only if the treaty undergoes major change, he has said in comments published on Sunday. Trump was met with global condemnation when he announced in June 2017 that the United States was pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, painting it a “bad deal” for the US economy.  While the president remains firm in his criticism of the historic accord, which was signed by his predecessor Barack Obama, he said he would be willing to sign up to a revamped deal. “The Paris accord, for us, would have been a disaster,” he told Britain’s ITV channel in an interviewed to be aired late on Sunday in the UK. “If they made a good deal … there’s always a chance we’d get back,” Trump added, describing the current agreement as “terrible” and “unfair” to the US.  The landmark treaty was agreed by 197 nations in 2015 after intense negotiations in Paris, where all countries made voluntary carbon-cutting pledges running to 2030.  “If somebody said, go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal,” Trump said, according to extracts of the interview. “Would I go back in? Yeah, I’d go back in … I would love to. I like, as you know, Emmanuel [Macron].” Trump suggested the climate had been cooling as well as warming and asserted – wrongly – that ice at the poles has not been shrinking as predicted. “The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records,” he said. That assessment remarks does not match what data shows and scientists say.  The world has not been cooling except for normal day-to-day weather variations; it has been just the opposite. And there have been far more records for shrinking ice on the top and the bottom of the world than growing, despite what the president claimed. Earlier this month Trump said the US could “conceivably” return to the deal under more favourable terms, raising questions about whether he was bluffing about pulling out of the Paris deal in a bid for easier emissions targets.

"Donald Trump will loom large at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, as the self-styled anti-globalist joins the annual gathering of billionaires, business executives and politicians. The meeting at the luxury ski resort in the Swiss Alps at the start of each year is set to be dominated by the US president, who is due to give a special address to the conference on Friday.  The official theme of this year’s forum is “creating a shared future in a fractured world”, which could have taken its cue from Trump alone. However, it does leave enough wiggle room to take in Brexit and the growing risks from technological advances, climate change and rising inequality. Political upheaval and rising populism will also be hot topics for the more than 2,500 delegates from the realms of business, politics, academia, the charity sector and the arts, plus the usual smattering of celebrities. These will be the themes to watch out for. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual
four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is
a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made
it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite,
disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in
the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  The US president might enjoy the trappings of power and a billionaire’s lifestyle, like the most ardent of globalists at Davos, yet politically he has set himself up as the very opposite of the WEF and all that it stands for. The organisers set great store in “multi-stakeholder” solutions and the idea that global problems are best solved by countries working together – which makes the event an unlikely stomping ground for a president bent on isolationism and putting “America first”. Protectionism and the potential for the disruption of world trade and cooperation will be a hot topic all week. Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, gave a thinly veiled warning to Trump at his pre-meeting press conference, arguing “no individual alone can solve the issues on the global agenda”. He said the world was at an inflection point where there was a “real danger of a collapse of our global systems”. That may be no bad thing for Trump, who has shown little love for global institutions. His keynote address just before the close of the meeting on Friday will be unmissable. Almost 10 years on from the financial crisis, and the global economy has got its mojo back. The International Monetary Fund will deliver its latest world economic outlook update on Monday from Davos, where there are sure to be questions about the sustainability of the current upswing. The IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, will deliver the update and speak on several other panels throughout the week. The prospect of rising inflation and the removal of economic stimulus by central banks will be sure to feature prominently, while the theme of the conference – creating a shared future – will raise the issues of wealth and growing income inequality. The increasing use of artificial intelligence, robotics and the automation of jobs has been a repeating theme at Davos, and this year is no different. The impact of AI will be one of the forum’s major events, with a one-to-one interview to be held between Schwab and the chief executive of Google, Sundar Pichai. The “fourth industrial revolution” will be a key theme once more, with a focus on how the loss of millions of jobs could undermine social cohesion. The way states respond to governing and taxing technologies and borderless business will be high on the agenda. Although unlikely to be a major theme at Davos this year, the annual summit will present UK ministers with an opportunity to rub shoulders with European leaders just before they pile into more substantive talks on trade later this year. Theresa May and Philip Hammond will be in attendance, while representatives from all 28 EU member states will also be heading to Davos, including the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the French president Emmanuel Macron. Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will be making his first visit to Davos, planning to use the event as an opportunity to explain why the rules of the global economy need rewriting. May, on the other hand, will be expected to explain how Britain still matters on the global stage as it quits the EU. Trump moved quickly to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords in one of his first acts as president last year. At Davos, where the environment is always among the most important issues up for debate, this won’t have gone down well. The former US vice-president Al Gore is attending and will speak on several panels, including one about how extreme weather events are proving more devastating and expensive. The WEF’s global risks perception survey, released last week, cited climate change-related issues as the top problems facing the world, while it also issued a thinly veiled warning to the US president that “nation-state unilateralism” will make it harder to combat change and ecological damage. In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, gender equality and issues such as bullying and harassment in the workplace will be in sharp focus at Davos this year. Business leaders have often talked about encouraging diversity in the past, although are also accused of having made very little headway. Women will only account for 21% of all of the participants this year. At least three sessions will directly tackle the problems facing women at work, including one with the Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson and Canadian minister for the status of women, Maryam Monsef, titled “Gender, power and stemming sexual harassment”. More than a third of participants come from developing or emerging economies, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will address the opening plenary. Humanitarian crises are on the agenda, with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees out of Myanmar likely to feature prominently, as the forum considers the outlook for 2018. The actor Cate Blanchett, who alongside Elton John has won a prize designated for artists who best represent the “spirit of Davos”, will speak to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student who fights for education and women’s rights, will also speak about the importance of education and equal opportunities."
"Ford Motor Co will significantly increase its planned investments in electric vehicles to $11bn by 2022 and have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its model line-up, the company’s chairman, Bill Ford, said on Sunday at the Detroit auto show.  The investment figure is sharply higher than a previously announced target of $4.5bn by 2020, Ford executives said, and includes the costs of developing dedicated electric vehicle architectures.   Ford’s engineering, research and development expenses for 2016, the last full year available, were $7.3bn, up from $6.7bn in 2015.  Ford chief Jim Hackett told investors in October the carmaker would slash $14bn in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.  Of the 40 electrified vehicles Ford plans for its global line-up by 2022, 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids, executives said.  General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and target consumers who want luxury, performance and an SUV body style – or all three attributes in the same vehicle. Mainstream carmakers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in China, Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. They also are under pressure from Tesla Inc’s success in creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders. GM said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global line-up by 2023, financed by robust profits from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the US and China.  GM’s chief, Mary Barra, has promised investors the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.  Volkswagen said in November it would spend $40bn on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022. Toyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars.  Ford’s additional investments in electric vehicles contrasted with many of the vehicle launches at the Detroit show, which featured trucks and SUVs.  Daimler AG unveiled its new G-class SUV, a bulky off-roader. The Daimler CEO, Dieter Zetsche, hinted to Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during an exchange on stage next to the G-class that Daimler would some day have an electric version of the vehicle.  SUVs figured in Ford’s electric vehicle presentation. The automaker’s president of global markets, Jim Farley, said Ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020.  Ford’s shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after Hackett replaced former CEO Mark Fields in May.  The plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. In October, Ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to “think big” and “make quicker decisions”. Some of the electric vehicles will be produced with Ford’s JV in China aimed at the Chinese market.  China, India, France and the UK have all announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040. "
"Popping frozen peas into the microwave for a couple of minutes may seem utterly harmless, but Europe’s stock of these quick-cook ovens emit as much carbon as nearly 7m cars, a new study has found. And the problem is growing: with costs falling and kitchen appliances becoming “status” items, owners are throwing away microwaves after an average of eight years, pushing rising sales.  A study by the University of Manchester worked out the emissions of carbon dioxide – the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change – at every stage of microwaves, from manufacture to waste disposal. “It is electricity consumption by microwaves that has the biggest impact on the environment,” say the authors, who also calculate that the emissions from using 19 microwaves over a year are the same as those from a car. “Efforts to reduce consumption should focus on improving consumer awareness and behaviour to use appliances more efficiently. For example, electricity consumption by microwaves can be reduced by adjusting the time of cooking to the type of food.” Each year more microwaves are sold than any other type of oven in the EU: annual sales are expected to reach 135m by the end of the decade. David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out that the damage done by microwaves is still a fraction of that done by cars. “Yes, there are a lot of microwaves in the EU, and yes they use electricity,” he said.  “But their emissions are dwarfed by those from cars – there are around 30m cars in the UK alone and these emit way more than all the emissions from microwaves in the EU. Latest data show that passenger cars in the UK emitted 69m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2015. This is 10 times the amount this new microwave oven study estimates for annual emissions for all the microwave ovens in the whole of the EU.” The energy used by microwaves is lower than any other form of cooking. uSwitch, the price comparison website, lists microwaves as the most energy efficient, followed by a hob and finally an oven, advising readers to buy a microwave if they don’t have one. However, they urge owners to switch them off at the wall after use, to avoid powering the clock. “Yes, it’s important to use microwaves efficiently,” said Simon Bullock, senior climate change campaigner for the charity Friends of the Earth. “But so is making sure the electricity that powers them is as low pollution as possible. The government should reverse its policy attacks on solar and onshore wind. We need green electrons powering all the nation’s tellies, microwaves and fridges.” Alejandro Gallego-Schmid, one of the report’s authors, said: “The aim of our study was not to compare microwaves to other cooking appliances but to look at the environmental impacts of microwaves as ubiquitous devices in households in Europe and draw attention to the need to make their design, use and end-of-life waste management more efficient.” The report also reveals that the lifespan of microwaves has reduced by nearly seven years over the last 20 years – from more than a decade to six-eight years. By the end of this decade 16m microwaves are expected to be discarded each year.  “Given that microwaves account for the largest percentage of sales of all types of oven in the EU, it is increasingly important to start addressing their impact on resource use and end-of-life waste,” said Gallego-Schmid.  Existing regulation is not enough to reduce those environmental impacts, and specific regulations are needed for microwaves, says the report. “My microwave’s not too high impact at the moment,” said Bullock. “It’s broken, waiting in a corner for me to work out where best to recycle it.”"
"The American Museum of Natural History is under pressure to sever its ties to Rebekah Mercer, one of Donald Trump’s top donors who has used her family’s fortune to fund groups that seek to undermine scientists’ work on climate change. More than 200 scientists have put their names to a letter that urges the museum to “end ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation” and axe Mercer from its board of trustees, a position she has held since 2013.  A separate missive also calling for Mercer’s dismissal has been circulated among the museum’s own curators amid growing concern that the New York institution risks having its mission subverted by Mercer. The Mercer family is headed by billionaire rightwing benefactor Bob Mercer, a computer scientist and hedge fund CEO. In 2015, The Washington Post named Mercer one of the 10 most influential billionaires in politics, and by conservative estimates he has donated more than $35m to political campaigns over the last 14 years. Mercer also invested at least $10min the 'alt-right' news website Breitbart.com in 2011, anointing his relationship with the then executive chairman, Steve Bannon, the self-described “nationalist” who was a pivotal figure in Donald Trump’s election campaign and briefly a strategist in the Trump White House. Rebekah Mercer, Bob’s daughter, mostly serves as the public face of his political donor activities. Bob himself is notoriously reclusive and has few public statements to his name. In the bestselling book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, author Michael Wolff describes the Mercers as “tak[ing] over” the Trump campaign in August 2016 and “installing” Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, now counsellor to the president, atop a floundering operation. “Trump wouldn’t be President if not for Bob,” a former Mercer employee told The New Yorker. In the wake of controversy over Bannon and rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, Bob distributed his ownership stake in Breitbart to his daughters, including Rebekah, citing “personal reasons”. Jamiles Lartey Freshly obtained donation records, shared with the Guardian, show that the Mercer Family Foundation, overseen by Rebekah and her billionaire hedge fund father, Robert, funneled more than $2m to organisations that actively deny or obfuscate mainstream climate science during the election year. The donations include $800,000 to the Heartland Institute, a conservative group famous for its regular conferences for those who dismiss the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate, and half a million dollars to the Heritage Foundation, a free market group that promotes fossil fuel extraction and claims that spells of cold weather demonstrate that the planet is not warming.  In 2016, the Mercers funded two other groups for the first time – giving $125,000 to the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition. Both groups seek to sow doubt over the consequences of climate change. The CO2 Coalition’s chairman is William Happer, a Princeton University physicist who has been touted as a potential science adviser to Trump. The Mercers were a crucial backroom force behind the political rise of Trump. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, last year said: “The Mercers laid the groundwork for the Trump revolution.” Brietbart News, the rightwing outlet previously run by Bannon, has also received large donations from the Mercer foundation. “Since Trump’s election, the Mercer family has been flushed out of the shadows and revealed to be major supporters of the climate denial machine,” said Kert Davies, founder of a climate-focused transparency group who analysed the donations’ declarations. “Their support for climate deniers appears to be growing over time.” The Mercer foundation’s 2016 donations also include $200,000 directed to the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a group founded by Arthur Robinson, a biochemist who helped set up a widely discredited petition of purported experts denying that global warming is harmful.  The signatories had no vetting, however, prompting green groups to add singer Geri Halliwell and the entire cast of M*A*S*H to the list. More recently, Robinson has been storing thousands of samples of human urine in the belief that he will find a way to extend lifespans. Rebekah Mercer has reportedly suggested to Trump that Robinson be the president’s chief science adviser.  In their letter, concerned scientists and curators warned the American Museum of Natural History that while it is a “treasured and influential institution”, it could suffer a “loss of public trust” through its association with Mercer. As well as being a trustee, Mercer has donated more than $4m to the museum since 2012, records show. “Rebekah Mercer is one of the greatest funders of the bad faith attacks on climate science and climate scientists,” said Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist and one of the letter’s signatories. “It is an abomination for her to be sitting on the board of trustees of any science-themed institution let alone one of the greatest natural history museums in the world.”  Katherine Hayhoe, another prominent climate scientist who signed the letter, said it is imperative that museums “convey … information accurately, without either explicit or implicit pressure to downplay or even alter the facts”. Museums and galleries have come under increasing scrutiny as they attempt to balance the need for funding with concerns over climate change. In 2015, the Science Museum in London said it would not continue a controversial sponsorship deal with Shell, although BP continues to back several of the city’s major cultural institutions, such as the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and the Royal Opera House. This month, the American Museum of Natural History was criticised for an exhibit in its dinosaur wing that said warmer periods, such as the current one, are caused by variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun and that there is “no reason to believe another ice age won’t come”. The wing is funded by David Koch, a high-profile funder of climate change denying groups, although the museum said Koch had no influence over the content, which was merely outdated. “This country is having a crisis of trust, museums are the last bastions of trust and we have to be very careful of preserving that,” said Jon Foley, executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, which doesn’t accept money from fossil fuels.  “The American [Museum of Natural History] is one of the best museums in the world and it’s sad that we are talking about this rather than their great work. “It’s troubling if donors are supporting museums on one hand and funding anti-science on the other. Public science institutions need to pick people aligned to their mission, not just for their wealth. We are in a hypercharged atmosphere at the moment, science is under attack. This is an issue museums will have to navigate.” Foley, not a signatory to the scientists’ letter, said he gets calls “all the time” from donors about exhibits based on issues such as climate change or evolution. “The job is to listen and relay that the exhibits are based on the best available science,” he said. “You never let donors or trustees micromanage the content of exhibits. It’s more about the perception. But that perception is important.” A spokesman for American Museum of Natural History said the museum “deeply respects” the work and views of scientists and affirmed that the institution accepts that human-driven climate change is “well supported by scientific evidence and one of the most serious issues currently facing our planet”. “The museum itself, however, does not make appointment decisions concerning staff or trustees based on political views,” the spokesman said.  “It’s not the role of trustees or donors to make decisions about scientific and educational content. At the museum, those decisions are made by scientists and educators based on evidence, facts, and research.” The Mercer Family Foundation was contacted for comment."
"Donald Trump once dismissed it as a “hoax” created by the Chinese to destroy American jobs, but on a freezing Thursday night in the eastern US the president found himself pining for some of that “good old global warming”. On holiday in Florida on Thursday, Trump wondered if global warming might not be such a problem after all.  As severe cold and record amounts of snow swept across the US east coast, Trump wrote on Twitter that his people “could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against”. “Bundle up!” he added. The president was reheating two favourite tropes: the conflation of weather with climate to pour scepticism on global warming, and the supposed cost to the American taxpayer of the Paris climate accord, from which he has confirmed the US will withdraw. Climate scientists, however, have long warned against using individual weather events to ponder the existence or otherwise of global warming. Weather, they point out, refers to atmospheric conditions during a short period; climate relates to longer-term weather patterns. On Friday, Anthony Leiserowitz, director of Yale University’s project on climate change communication, said Trump’s tweet was “scientifically ridiculous and demonstrably false”. “There is a fundamental difference in scale between what weather is and what climate is,” he said. “What’s going on in one small corner of the world at a given moment does not reflect what’s going on with the planet.” The extreme cold snap in the eastern US is a rare example of a place experiencing below-average winter temperatures, he said, a point that was neatly illustrated by a map tweeted out by the Weather Channel on Friday. 1) There is a difference between #weather and #climate. 2) Short-term #cold snaps will continue to occur in a warming climate.3) 2017 will likely be a top three warmest year on record for the globe. (Graphic: Univ. of Maine - Climate Change Institute) https://t.co/kzuugeXi80 pic.twitter.com/gueOsp4yvu Elsewhere, Matthew England, a climate scientist from the University of New South Wales, called Trump’s comment “an ignorant misconception of the way the earth’s climate works”. “Nobody ever said winter would go away under global warming, but winter has become much milder and the record cold days are being far outnumbered by record warm days and heat extremes,” he said. “Climate change is not overturned by a few unusually cold days in the US.” David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne, put it even more bluntly: “It’s winter in the US. Cold temperatures are common in winter.” Climate modelling showed cold snaps like the one in the US were actually becoming less common as a result of global warming, Karoly said, adding that rapid attribution analysis means scientists are now able to look more closely at “classes of events”. That type of modelling for the north-east of the US, he said, showed that although there was a great deal of year-to-year variability, the average coldest temperature in December in the region has increased in the past 50 years. In any case, the US is already getting that “good old global warming”. 2017 is set to be the third-warmest on record, prompting among other things a climate-fuelled hurricane season in the country’s south. Experts also know climate change is linked to a dangerous pattern of major weather events. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US is on track to match or exceed the previous record year for extreme weather and climate events costing more than $1bn, including wildfires, hurricanes and flooding. There had been 15 such events by the end of September, compared with 15 for the whole of 2016 and 16 in the record year of 2011. Adam Smith, a climatologist at NOAA, said: “Climate change is playing a role, amplifying the frequency and intensity of some types of extreme weather that lead to billion-dollar disasters.” With Hurricane Harvey devastating Texas and extraordinary wildfires in California, Smith said 2017 was expected to “shatter” the record for the US’s costliest year in terms of weather events. That was 2005, with losses of $215bn from disasters including Hurricane Katrina. Trump’s tweet also revisited his claim that the Paris climate accord would have cost the US “trillions” of dollars. At a rally in Pennsylvania in April to mark his 100th day in office, Trump said “full compliance with the agreement could ultimately shrink America’s GDP by $2.5tn over a 10-year period”. The politically non-aligned website Factcheck.org asked the White House for a source for that remark, and was pointed to a 2016 study by the conservative Heritage Foundation which found the Paris agreement “will result in over $2.5tn in lost GDP by 2035”. While that is an 18-year period, not 10, Factcheck.org found the accuracy of Heritage’s statements depended on which numbers were used. The Heritage study used a carbon tax rate of $36, increasing 3% each year from 2015 to 2035. Other analyses have found the US would have needed only a carbon tax of $21.22 starting in 2017 to meet its Paris target by 2025. Leiserowitz, meanwhile, criticised the president’s use of social media. “It’s meant to be red meat for his base,” he said. “They’re the ones most likely to be dismissive of climate change and the most likely to vote in the 2018 Republican primaries – so it’s a warning shot for the GOP members in Congress.” The global warming tweet, he said, was another attempt by Trump to distract from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.  He added that the idea a cold snap disproves global warming is a “zombie argument”, because though “it’s killed over and over by the science” it “keeps coming back for more brains”. Trump’s tweet was “troll-like”, the scientist said, showing the president “delighting in sparking outrage among [his] opponents”."
"It’s been said that spring is coloured by flowers, while the colour of winter is only in the imagination. Not so for intrepid botanists who discovered 532 species of wildflowers in bloom across Britain and Ireland around New Year’s Day.  According to the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), which organises the annual New Year Plant Hunt, this rainbow of midwinter colour is a far cry from botanical textbooks of several decades ago which indicated only a few dozen species should be blooming in midwinter. This unexpected blooming included robust favourites such as daisies, dandelions, groundsel and gorse, but also “autumn stragglers” including ragwort, hogweed and yarrow, which normally flower after midsummer but well before midwinter. Botanists suggest that climate change bringing milder early winters may be a factor in the January colour, but so too is an increased search effort and the sharing of pictures on social media, as well as a burgeoning number of non-native flowers that have escaped into the wild. Nearly half – 46% – of the midwinter blooms were non-native. “If you believe the textbooks, only about 10% of the species we found in flower should be in flower,” said Dr Kevin Walker, BSBI’s Head of Science. “It could be climate change but it could also be because people didn’t used to go and look for flowers in midwinter.” According to Walker, urban areas tend to have more non-native flowering species than rural areas, with cities and towns providing more sheltered places with warm microclimates where plants that have escaped from gardens can thrive. Perhaps reassuring for lovers of a traditionally bleak winter, the 2018 tally was significantly lower than the 611 flowers recorded during the exceptionally mild winter of 2016. And there was no sign that the floral riches herald an early spring: only 14% of the species recorded were springtime specialists such as primrose and lesser celandine. “We’re not finding plants flowering earlier, we’re finding things are flowering later or just straggling on because the milder early winter is not killing them off with frosts,” said Walker.  More than 1,000 people – a record number – participated in the plant hunt from Caithness to Guernsey, with pictures shared on social media, including BSBI’s increasingly popular “wildflower hour” on Twitter on Sunday evenings.  The most floral place in Britain and Ireland during this bleak midwinter was Phillack in Cornwall, which boasted 114 different species in flower."
" Rising temperatures are turning almost all green sea turtles in a Great Barrier Reef population female, new research has found. The scientific paper warned the skewed ratio could threaten the population’s future.  Sea turtles are among species with temperature dependent sex-determination and the proportion of female hatchlings increases when nests are in warmer sands. Tuesday’s paper, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, California State University and Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia, is published in Current Biology. It examined two genetically distinct populations of turtles on the reef, finding the northern group of about 200,000 animals was overwhelmingly female. While the southern population was 65%-69% female, females in the northern group accounted for 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults and 86.8% of adults. “Combining our results with temperature data show that the northern GBR green turtle rookeries have been producing primarily females for more than two decades and that the complete feminisation of this population is possible in the near future,” the paper said. The temperature at which the turtles will produce male or female hatchlings is heritable, the paper said, but tipped to produce 100% male or 100% female hatchlings within a range of just a few degrees. “Furthermore, extreme incubation temperatures not only produce female-only hatchlings but also cause high mortality of developing clutches,” it said. “With warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature, it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.” The lead author, Dr Michael Jensen from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the research provided a new understanding of what the turtle populations were dealing with. He said the findings were surprising and “a bit alarming”, with significant conservation implications. “While we can hope there might be some cooler years to produce a few more males, overall we can expect the temperatures to increase,” he said. Jensen said the researchers worked around “ethical implications” of past studies that required sacrificing some hatchlings to accurately determine sex ratios and pivotal temperature ranges. This team instead studied more than 400 turtles at foraging grounds, gathering information on the sex of turtles from multiple generations. “Knowing what the sex ratios in the adult breeding population are today, and what they might look like five, 10 and 20 years from now when these young turtles grow up and become adults, is going to be incredibly valuable,” Jensen said. The research was facilitated through the Great Barrier Reef Rivers to Reef to Turtles project by the World Wildlife Fund Australia. The chief executive of WWF Australia, Dermot O’Gorman, said it was yet another sign of the impact of climate change, following recent research that coral bleaching events were occurring far more frequently. “We’ve had two years where we’ve had mass bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef,” he told Guardian Australia. “That’s a very visible sign of the impact of climate change. But this is an invisible change. We can’t see the impact it’s having on a turtle population until a study like this shows some long-term trends.” O’Gorman said more urgent action on climate change was clearly needed but conservationists were taking some practical measures, including trialling the use of shadecloth on known nesting beaches to lower the sand temperature, and reducing bycatch in the fishing industry. “[Shadecloths] can be done in certain places but there’s a limit to the scale you can do that,” he said.  The green turtle is one of the most populous species of turtle in the world but the Great Barrier Reef settlement was significant and turtles were under enormous pressure outside Australian waters, O’Gorman said. “An additional threat to them really does sound alarm bells,” he said. “Now every large reproductive male is going to be even more important.”"

"In the fourth and final essay of The Second Body, Daisy Hildyard describes winter floods inundating her house in Yorkshire. She didn’t have any home insurance. “There had been two false alarms that year … We’d been told that the water would come into our house at 4.2 metres, but when the levels got to 4.3 in early December, we were still dry.” She and her husband were in receipt of automated telephone calls whenever the rain started to fall – a computerised female voice would predict the height the river might reach. “When it rains she rings up all the time,” she explains; “you stop picking up to her.” They went away with their young daughter for a few days over the Christmas holidays, and when they came back, the river was lapping near their ceilings. “Before we went away we moved all our things a few inches off the ground, emptied the bottom drawers, and piled everything on to the second shelf up. This was one of the most pointless things I have ever done.” After the flood receded, neighbours and strangers gave up their Christmas holiday time to help her hose out sediment and clean up. “I became a designated Victim with an assigned caseworker and my own reference number at the food bank.” During the flood her father had swum out to the house to gather paperwork; as she laid out the papers to dry, passers-by took pictures of her with their phones. A reporter hoping to interview her feigned pity, and on the television she saw aerial footage of her street. “The flood looked very small. It wasn’t like that on the ground where it was everywhere.” She found catharsis in throwing away many of her possessions – a catharsis that expressed itself physically: “The sense of relief was located in my spine, it felt as if my vertebrae were spacing themselves further out, as if my body was growing longer and more loose.” Her in-laws live in Birmingham; she and her husband took turns driving between there, to spend time with their daughter, and alone in Yorkshire cleaning the house of slime and sewage. “In spite of all the help that was offered, nobody offered to help in such a way that would allow us to keep our family together, which was all I thought I wanted at the time.” The premise of The Second Body is that all human beings have two bodies – the one they have immediate autonomy over, made of flesh and bone, and another which is more diffuse. Hildyard struggles to define exactly what she means by the second body, but in one place calls it “the global presence of the individual body”. Elsewhere it is imagined as an entity shared and distributed across every aspect of the biosphere impacted on by humans. The flood was part of this second body – an elemental retribution brought about not just by her, but by all the collective bad decisions of Homo sapiens: “My second body came to find my first body when the river flooded my house.” Hildyard has taught Shakespeare at university level; in order to make sense of her experience she turns to Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. “He asks: what happens to a human from whom everything beyond his body has been taken away?” Shylock’s experience of destitution is to fall back on the carnal aspects of his humanity (“If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?”). She explicitly compares Shylock’s perspective to that of Nina Simone when, after listing everything she doesn’t have in “Ain’t Got No – I Got Life” (home, shoes, money, cigarettes), Simone proclaims and celebrates all her body parts (hair, brains, tongue, boobs). “Shylock and Nina Simone cannot speak directly about what it is to be a living human now. What was interesting to me was that they shared a vision of an individual body that was very personal, but also overpopulated with other people’s organs – this was how it seemed to me. I thought that other people acted as if that was not the case: as if their organs, and their bodies, were somehow different from those that were all around them.” Hildyard and her husband were awarded compensation by the government, which she used to take a cheap flight to a Mediterranean island with her daughter (“In a technical way I believe in climate change, but I do not much act as if I do … I didn’t want to spend this money on more things”). Walking in the warm evening air she comes upon beached lifeboats, an immigration Portakabin, some Red Cross tents and “a queue of humans, some wearing blankets, waiting to be seen”. The connection is left implicit between her own experience, internally displaced by climate change, and that of migrants on the Mediterranean beach. I have concentrated on Hildyard’s final essay because it’s there that her themes cohere most convincingly, and her writing is most compelling. The first three essays describe encounters with animals alive and dead, and with scientists who make sense of life. There’s a convalescence story of an injured pigeon that she later describes as a pet, a visit to a butcher called Richard and a conversation with Gina, an American zookeeper turned prison officer turned investigator of environmental offences (such as the smuggling of exotic animals as pets, and the slaughter of orangutans to clear forest for palm oil plantations). In Jena, near Leipzig, Hildyard seeks out the advice of three academic biologists – Luis, Nadezhda and Paul. Nadezhda teaches her about fungi, Luis about the origin of life. He is described as knowing more than Hildyard about almost everything, but she is puzzled by his optimism about the future of humanity, and discomfited when he explains that the definition of life is open to debate: “Stop,” I said. “You don’t actually know what life is? ... You need to get your act together.” These are fretful, questioning essays with occasional flashes of beauty, demanding of readers that they think about anthropogenic disruption of climate and ecology. Their structure feels disjointed, and their register wilfully banal, but perhaps their very fragmentation is a comment on modern disconnection and disaffection. They seem to come from a place of perplexity and anguish, bewilderment struggling towards expression. “When Hamlet, Macbeth and Lear die … they repeat themselves increasingly until they make funny sounds,” Hildyard writes towards the end of the book. She uses the example of King Lear: “Howl, howl, howl, howl! It is not clear whether this is a noise or a command.” • Gavin Francis’s Adventures in Human Being is published by Profile/Wellcome. • The Second Body is published by Fitzcarraldo.

"The mud cascaded down scorched, blackened slopes still blanketed with ash. With no trees or vegetation to slow the surge it swept rocks and boulders from the Verdugo mountains into a thunderous river. Jeannette Abney, 88, watched in horror not believing slopes could so quickly turn to sludge and so quickly surround her home in La Tuna canyon. “Oh God, the rain was terrible, terrible. Outside it was like a war zone, like Niagara Falls. It pushed my big truck 60ft across the road. It sounded like a freight train. I’ve never experienced anything like that.” Abney escaped Tuesday’s mudslide in this rural corner of Los Angeles with her two dogs and spoke on Wednesday from an American Red Cross evacuation center. It offered cots, blankets, food and instant coffee. A cool breeze flapped posters declaring “disaster services”. Swaths of southern California are in need after nature’s latest battering, this time in the form of heavy rains which unleashed massive debris flows, a grim sequel to a record drought and record wildfires. At least 17 people died, mostly in Montecito, a wealthy enclave north-west of LA. The avalanche buried homes and swept others from their foundations, which in addition to the dead left at least 25 people injured, 24 missing and hundreds marooned, authorities said. Rescue crews in helicopters plucked survivors from waist-high mud, including a 14-year-old girl. “I thought I was dead for a minute there,” she told them. “All hell broke loose,” Peter Hartmann, a dentist, told AP. “Power lines were down, high-voltage power lines, the large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half. Water was flowing out of water mains and sheared-off fire hydrants.” He watched rescuers revive a toddler pulled unresponsive from the muck. “It was a freaky moment to see her just covered in mud.”  The death toll was expected to rise as search-and-rescue teams took advantage of the storm’s ebbing to scour several dozen damaged and destroyed homes. “Right now our assets are focused on determining if anyone is still alive in any of those structures that have been damaged,” Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara county told reporters. The storm – the first of the rainy season – turned devastating because huge wildfires in recent months charred mountains and canyons, leaving soil unable to efficiently absorb water. Authorities anticipated the danger and issued evacuation orders in recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Only an estimated 10 to 15% of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara county heeded the warning. I’ve always been more scared of fires but now I think you have to worry more about mud – it’s silent and faster The harrowing consequences rekindled a perennial debate about the Golden State occupying a thin line between fortune and disaster, and the lottery of never knowing which will strike. “We’ve been dodging bullets and got lucky again,” said Tom Suchner, 63, a car mechanic, as he walked his dog down Kagel canyon. “It was a nice, steady rain. It got rid of a lot of the ash.” In this part of the Verdugo mountains, a rugged patch of nature on LA’s outskirts, residents woke up on Wednesday to marshy soil and not much worse.  But just a few miles away a mudflow traced a burnt ridgeline and smashed into an affluent neighbourhood lining La Tuna canyon road.  “It was a full river, boulders floating down, hitting cars,” said one resident, Diana Kalaitzian, 45. “I’ve always been more scared of fires but now I think you have to worry more about mud because you don’t see it coming. It’s silent and faster.” Helicopters hovered as Kalaitzian stood outside her home, surveying the aftermath: sludge in every direction, a landscape overnight turned brown. Neighbours were shovelling sludge. At one end of the road earth-movers were clearing lanes and imposing some order on the mud. At the other, higher up in the canyon, there was no way for cars to pass and mud-splattered police were riding mountain bikes, inspecting damage.  Kalaitzian’s home escaped but she was braced for a season of anxiety. “You know there’s more to come.” California has just endured its worst and most expensive wildfire season. The Thomas fire, which encompassed the land around Montecito, burned more than 280,000 acres, the biggest in the state’s modern history.  This followed a five-year-drought – by some measures the worst in a millennium – which emptied reservoirs and parched the countryside.  It ended in 2016 with record rainfall which counterintuitively aggravated last year’s fire season by producing vegetation – fuel. It turned tinder dry last summer, the hottest on record.  So many records in so short a time has convinced many scientists that climate change is a factor. Elizabeth Terry, 63, a caregiver who lives in a boarding home in the Verdugo mountains, has had to evacuate three times: a wildfire in 2016, another in 2017, then this week’s mudslides.  “California is a wonderful place to live – depending where you live,” she said, speaking from a Red Cross evacuation centre. Terry can’t afford to live in a safer area. “Lord knows I’m trying to move, desperately.”"
"The World Economic Forum delivered a strong warning about Donald Trump’s go-it-alone approach to tackling climate change as it highlighted the growing threat of environmental collapse in its annual assessment of the risks facing the international community. In the run-up to the US president’s speech to its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, next week, the WEF avoided mentioning Trump by name but said “nation-state unilateralism” would make it harder to tackle global warming and ecological damage. The WEF’s global risks perception survey showed Trump’s arrival in the White House in 2017 had coincided with a marked increase in concern about the environment among experts polled by the Swiss-based organisation. 1. Extreme weather events 2. Natural disasters 3. Failure to halt climate change 4. Water crises 5. Cyber attacks 6. Biodiversity loss 7. Mass involuntary migration 8. Manmade environmental disasters It said all five environmental risks covered by the survey – extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and human-made natural disasters – had become more prominent. “This follows a year characterised by high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions for four years. We have been pushing our planet to the brink and the damage is becoming increasingly clear.  “Biodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain, and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.” Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement under which nations agreed to take steps to limit the increase in global temperature. He has said the commitments made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, would damage the American economy. Other states have said they will keep to the pledges made in Paris, an approach supported by the WEF. “A trend towards nation-state unilateralism may make it more difficult to sustain the long-term, multilateral responses that are required to counter global warming and the degradation of the global environment,” it said. The survey said the extreme weather events in 2017 included unusually frequent Atlantic hurricanes, with September the most intense month on record. It was also the most expensive hurricane season. It added that when data was finalised, 2017 would be among the three hottest years on record, and the hottest without an El Niño, the Pacific Ocean climate cycle that affects the world’s weather. Biodiversity loss was occurring at mass-extinction rates, the WEF said, noting that the populations of vertebrate species declined by an estimated 58% between 1970 and 2012.  “Globally, the primary driver of biodiversity loss is the human destruction of habitats including forests – which are home to approximately 80% of the world’s land-based animals, plants and insects – for farming, mining, infrastructure development and oil and gas production.” Stronger than expected growth in 2017 meant economic risks were seen as less pressing, but the WEF said the upbeat picture masked continuing underlying concerns, including unsustainable asset prices; high levels of indebtedness, particularly in China; and continuing strains in the global financial system.  The International Monetary Fund is likely to raise its forecast for global growth when it gives its latest economic update in Davos next Monday, and the WEF survey said the recovery underway in all major economies had to led to a sharp improvement in sentiment. But it expressed concern that the swing to optimism might lead to complacency and a blind spot to economic risks. “There are certainly reasons to be cautious: one does not have to look far for signs of economic and financial strain”, the WEF added, calling for greater attention to be paid to the risks of another crisis erupting.    The survey warned there would be limited policy firepower in the event of a new crisis. It also warned of the disruption caused by automation, noting that “for the foreseeable future, automation and digitalisation can be expected to push down on levels of employment and wages, and contribute to increases in income and wealth at the top of the distribution.” It also highlighted the buildup of protectionist pressures against a backdrop of rising nationalist and populist politics and growing cybersecurity risks. The WEF said cyber attacks against businesses had almost doubled in five years, and that the financial impact of cybersecurity breaches was rising. "
"New York City’s decision to sever ties with its fossil fuel investments is set to prove a catalyst to other cities in the face of the Trump administration’s staunch support for coal, oil and gas interests, according to several leading economists. On Wednesday, city officials announced that New York was to divest its pension funds of about $5bn in fossil fuel-linked money over the next five years. New York’s total pension fund for its teachers, firefighters and other city workers is worth about $189bn.   Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor, also revealed the city is suing the world’s largest oil and gas companies over their role in knowingly creating dangerous global warming in a two-pronged assault that he said is aimed at “standing up for future generations”. Economists said the status of New York as a financial and cultural giant would probably spur other cities in the US and worldwide to divest and, more significantly, build momentum in the global shift required to reduce emissions and stave off the worst consequences of climate change. “This is a really big deal,” said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at New York’s Columbia University and special adviser to the UN secretary general. “Pension funds of other major US cities will follow, I think. New York is the neighborhood of the very big money managers. It’s a powerful, personal signal to them that they cannot keep funding the sorts of projects they have in the past.” Divestment is the opposite of investment. It's the shifting of stocks, bonds or funds from certain businesses or sectors. Individual people invest in various ways to generate money, but large institutions such as cities, universities and religious organizations do this on a huge scale. Traditionally, fund managers put together investment portfolios that will provide the best returns for these institutions, regardless of where the money is invested. The divestment movement, primarily consisting of climate activists, is urging private and public institutions to rid their portfolios of all oil, gas and coal stocks to send a financial and ethical message that fossil fuels are harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. So far, it's estimated that funds totalling $6tn have committed to divesting from fossil fuels. Activists hope this momentum will deprive fossil fuels of a social license, similar to tobacco, and help accelerate the deployment of cleaner energy, such as wind and solar. New York will be the first of the US’s largest cities to divest and has jostled to the forefront of a group of global metropolises that have committed to ridding themselves of fossil fuel stocks, including Paris, Berlin, Sydney and Stockholm. In November, the Norwegian central bank, which runs the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, proposed dumping shares in oil and gas companies. Dozens of other institutions, ranging from Oxford University to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, have also joined a movement that activists say is worth $6tn in divestments or avoided investments. “The divestment movement is active and growing and by its nature, New York will play a big leadership role,” said Sachs. “New York hosts Wall Street, the UN and the US media, it will now be the centre of climate action too. Even with Trump turning the keys over to the oil and gas industry, it’s clear that if you make egregious decisions you won’t get away with it.” The divestment itself will be brushed off by major fossil fuel companies but could help galvanize political action even as the Trump administration peels away environmental regulations and throws open more US land and waters to drilling and mining.  “Divestment isn’t about economically punishing businesses, it’s a tool of collective action that can politically isolate companies,” said Paul Ferraro, an economist at John Hopkins University.  “New York is fabulous in this respect because it’s so visible and it gives others room to create change. But it will only work if everyone follows, much like how everyone has to reduce their electricity use collectively for it to have a consequence for climate change.” New York’s move on climate isn’t without its critics – environmentalists have complained about De Blasio’s opposition to congestion charging for vehicles and his own frequent car trips to the gym.  Rightwing groups and business interests are also opposed. Linda Kelly, senior vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the plan was an “absurd attempt to politicize natural disasters, rather than a good-faith effort at securing meaningful change”. The deep divisions over climate change in US politics, along with the continued strength of major fossil fuel companies, has tempered the enthusiasm even of those in favor of divestment and action to reduce emissions. “The big oil and gas companies still have a long way to go and a lot of money to make,” said Ferraro. “When you look at the stock prices, it’s hard to believe that fossil fuels are facing imminent doom, as predicted by various environmentalists.”"

"Has spring sprung early where you are? Are you already noticing changes to the appearance or behaviour of flora and fauna in gardens, window boxes or local wild spaces? If so, we’d like to hear about it for a project mapping what appears to be a trend of shorter winters in the northern hemisphere. In 2017 the Climate News Network said spring began 26 days earlier than a decade ago. While for some this may mean the enjoyable sight of an early blooming snowdrop or daffodil, of course their appearance could be linked to the serious consequences of climate change.  We’d like your help understanding and tracking the situation where you are. Send us pictures of plants in bloom or other signs of the seasons changing and we’ll feature some of them in our reporting. Share your pictures via the contribute buttons on this article. Importantly, tell us where and when your photograph was taken – if you have older photos for comparison, or can describe how things were in previous years, we’d be very interested. You can also fill out the form below if you prefer. This assignment is aimed at readers in the northern hemisphere, but if you have seen anything notable where you are in the southern hemisphere you can still tell us about it."
"Electric or hybrid vehicles accounted for more than half of all new cars sold in Norway in 2017, official data shows, confirming the country’s pioneering role in carbon-free transport. Zero-emission, mainly all-electric as well as a few hydrogen-powered cars accounted for 20.9% of total sales in 2017, official figures released on Wednesday showed. Hybrid vehicles accounted for 31.3%, including 18.4% for plug-in hybrids, the Norwegian Road Federation calculated.  This represents an increase over the previous year, when zero-emission and hybrid cars accounted for 15.7% and 24.5% respectively of total sales, making Norway a world leader in electrifying road transport.  Norway, the biggest producer of oil in western Europe, has set itself the ambitious goal of selling only new zero-emission cars starting from 2025.  Unlike diesel or gasoline cars, which are heavily taxed, electric cars benefit from a very generous tax system, making their purchase prices relatively competitive. Their owners also enjoy many privileges such as free city tolls, ferries, parking and recharging in public car parks, as well as having the right to drive in bus lanes. Authorities plan to gradually reduce some measures whose benefits and costs are disputed by critics.  In 2017 the rightwing government tried to remove one of the tax exemptions on large and luxurious electric sedans in what was dubbed the “Tesla tax”, but was later forced to pull back due to opposition from its centre-right allies. The Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association welcomed the new statistics while calling for a continued state incentive: “The goal of 2025 is ambitious,” said its secretary general, Christina Bu. “We need to go from 21% market share to 100% in seven years, which means we still have a way to go even if it’s going in the right direction and the increase compared to 2016 is satisfactory.” While there was a large interest in electric and hybrid cars, proven by long waiting lists for new vehicles, manufacturers had been slow to meet this demand, with lengthy delivery times and a lack of models, Bu said.

"Australia’s response to climate change and the challenge of meeting its international obligations proved as difficult for the Keating government in 1994 and 1995 as it would for future governments. Cabinet papers released by the Australian National Archives on Monday show that much of the debate in the Keating cabinet was about how to cling on to the government’s “no regrets” policy while maintaining Australia’s influence at the international bargaining table.  The “no regrets” policy meant Australia would consider only measures that involved cutting emissions without any adverse impact on the economy or trade competitiveness. That ruled out most measures to tax fossil fuels, which would increase the cost of electricity. It meant Australia relied mainly on creating carbon sinks by limiting land-clearing and planting trees. Australia had signed on to targets at an international conference in Toronto in 1990 on the basis that the convention would recognise Australia’s high dependence on fossil fuels. But by September 1994 ministers were told Australia was falling woefully behind the implied target set in the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the interim planning target it had set itself. The interim target involved stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1988 levels by 2000, with a 20% reduction by 2005.  The cabinet was told Australia would achieve only 54% of the target, mainly through the One Billion Trees program. “Estimates of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and sink activity for 2000 indicate that Australia will not achieve either the implied target in the convention or the IPT,” the cabinet documents say. The papers note the Australian government was under increasing pressure from Europe and Pacific island nations to take tougher steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The truth was that the “no regrets” policy made Australia’s efforts to cut emissions ineffectual, as officials acknowledged in the cabinet papers.  But instead of taking tougher measures, most of the discussion in cabinet was about how to manage Austalia’s “relatively poor domestic greenhouse gas response”. The cabinet devised a two-pronged negotiating strategy for the next round of international meetings: advancement of the principle of “equitable burden sharing” and the “promotion of realistic and achievable means to to involve developing countries in emissions reductions”.  “Equitable burden sharing” was a nebulous idea that countries who were similarly dependent on fossil fuels should “share the burden” in the way the EU was doing across its member states. The cabinet identified Norway, Canada, the Russian Federation and Poland as possible allies, as well as Sweden and New Zealand.  But it warned there could be opposition from fossil fuel importers such as the EU – in particular Germany – and from Japan and Austria. The second leg of the negotiating policy was to press for some type of commitment from developing countries. This was a theme that would continue throughout the negotiations of future agreements and was taken up with gusto by the US president, George W Bush, after 2001. A 1994 cabinet paper included an option of withdrawing from future negotiations altogether but it warned that Australia faced a real risk that it could have bans placed on its exports as a result. By December 1994, with a further conference looming in March 1995, the cabinet was again wrestling with Australia’s poor performance.  It began developing further “no regrets” policies. Among the policy responses considered was a carbon or energy tax. But modelling by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture Resource Economics found the tax would be at about $US118 a tonne by 2000 compared with an average of $US24 for OECD countries. The costs of meeting the IPT target with a carbon tax alone would be prohibitive, the papers warn. Again there was discussion of abandoning the target. Instead the cabinet agreed to implement a voluntary program for industry called “Response to the Greenhouse Challenge”. The cabinet was told there was support for the voluntary approach from manufacturers and the mining and electricity sectors. There was also discussion of a spending package to boost renewable energy and tree-planting, which ranged from $45m to $78m. The finance department was highly critical, saying it “questioned the essentiality” of bringing the submission forward outside the 1995-96 budget. It described the spending as “mostly short-term” and said it would have little impact on the target gap."
