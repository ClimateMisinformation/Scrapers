Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving invested so much in renewables, the German government and Greens apparently are having great difficulties in coming to terms with the recently discovered huge reserves of cheap shale gas worldwide. This source of energy is not only affordable for consumers, but it is relatively environmentally friendly as well. But exploiting the gas would require governments and believers to abandon a big part of the green religion, i.e. renewables.
What do people do when they get so deep into an investment, and have worked so hard to convince everyone it is the right and moral thing to do, and then find out that there’s suddenly a much better and cheaper way? Do they simply abandon the entire endeavour? If the endeavour has become a religion and the meaning of life for them, the answer is no. They continue on a path to self-destruction.
That may indeed be the case for Europe and the Green Movement, who are now so deep into renewable energy that they may have gone beyond a psychological and emotional point of no return, a tipping point, and so they will refuse to abandon it no matter the cost. That could mean that the cheap and plentiful gas beneath our feet will simply be kept there, and we will be forced to continue paying exorbitant prices for an unreliable energy source and endure lots of pain.
Technically and economically, the recent discoveries of these huge deposits of natural shale gas in Europe make all the renewable energy pain completely unnecessary in the future. That ought to be good news, and governments ought to be breathing sighs of relief. But it isn’t so. Many European governments are not about to let anything disrupt their romantic visions of a future of renewables and the Truth.
Remember they are enlightened and infallible. So forget the drilling permits.

Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxiener at the online DIE WELT explain how the discoveries of shale natural gas have rendered renewable energies a complete flop. In a piece called Our Energy Dreamers Are Burning Money Instead Of Gas, they write:
Everywhere globally, huge reserves of natural gas have been discovered, from Israel to Qatar, from South Africa to Ukraine or Poland. The discoveries exceeded all expectations. The USA has found so much gas that it can become completely independent of imports. At current levels of consumption, there are enough for 100 years. And also Europe has gas for at least another 50 years – whereby the second biggest reserve is in North Rhine Westphalia.
Anyone in good psychological health would welcome such a blessing. But it seems we are living in times of increasing power madness. For example Maxiener and Miersch comment on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA), reaction:
But instead of expressing delight over the gas reserves, many of the archictects of our energy future are in a state of shock.
Equally shocked are the German energy dreamers with their solar cells because natural gas is relatively environmentally friendly and far more affordable than the option of Green-romantic alternatives.
So instead of burning the gas, the government will ask its citizens to burn their money to stay warm.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone reading last Friday’s piece here on the autobahn pile-up that killed 8 people (thankfully revised down from 10) because high-speed autobahn drivers were suddenly caught by a dust storm surely thought: “Hmmm, I wonder if warmists are going to blame this on climate change too?”
Yes we can!
Here it is at the online Bild in a headline story called: Dangerous Sandstorms Will Become More Frequent! Meteorologist Blames Climate Change. Bild writes:
A sudden sandstorm Friday led to aMass Car Crash near Rostock. Now a meteorologist warns: Such dangerous storms could be more frequent in the future! The fault is climate change.”
Of course driving too fast had nothing to do with it.
In last Friday’s piece, I did everything to avoid the temptation of writing “how long will it be before some opportunist steps up and blames climate change?” Not very long. That opportunist is publicity-seeker meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net, who also happens to be the official meteorologist of the Bild tabloid.
Northern Germany has received little rain over the last weeks and conditions were ripe for dust storms as farmers’ fields are exposed just as the planting season is getting ready to begin. Jung, who is a 33-year old whippersnapper, claims:
Climate change produces extreme weather conditions. Record heat waves, cold waves and extraordinary droughts, like the one that led to the sandstorm, are becoming more frequent.”
It’s the science that just cannot be falsified.

"Ed Miliband has said Labour needs a “wartime” mobilisation on the climate emergency in the next decade as he warned the party not to splinter over fixed decarbonisation targets. The former secretary of state for energy and climate change praised Labour activists for their Green New Deal campaign which demands Labour commit to a net zero carbon date of 2030. The Tories have pledged to do so by 2050, and Liberal Democrats by 2045.  However divisions emerged at the party’s autumn conference in Brighton this weekend over whether Labour should be committed to a date or not. The GMB union hit back at the Labour for a Green New Deal motion committing the party to a 2030 target, and instead brought forward their own motion without an end date, a move due to concerns about energy sector jobs. Both motions will be voted on by delegates on Tuesday after a record 10-hour compositing meeting held on Sunday decided it was not possible to reach a compromise. “[The year] 2050 isn’t the radical position and now it’s seen as a conservative ‘small c’ position. Look, in the end whether it’s 2040, 30 or 50 we’ve got to have the next 10 years, and in the first five years of a Labour government an absolute wartime mobilisation. Now everybody agrees about that,” Miliband said during an event held by alternative festival The World Transformed, run by Momentum. “One of Labour’s best kept secrets is that on domestic policy we are incredibly united. There is a desire for radicalism across the Labour party. Across people who would be considered on the so called right of the party. So let’s not pick fights. “It’s good to have the compositing and all that and push as hard as you can but we’re the only party that can deliver on this and we want to deliver in the next 10 years, whatever it says on the conference resolution.” The Labour for a Green New Deal is a movement to transform industry in the future to ensure it tackles climate change, while creating investment and new green jobs. The decarbonisation of the economy through legislation has been pushed hard in the US by Democrats, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Labour has backed a green industrial revolution programme, led by shadow secretary for business, energy and industrial strategy, Rebecca Long-Bailey, with billion pound investment commitments, including a major shift to electric cars. However, the motion presented by the Green New Deal campaign, and which had the support of up to 100 CLPs and Momentum, goes further, by adding a fixed target date. Miliband said Labour should have a radical green agenda, and push further than the Green party. He said: “There’s two ways this can go...it can either become an election issue or I’m afraid it will be like guns in the US, which is you have a good movement that is doing stuff on it but it never feels like it breaks through into being an election issue. That’s why Labour for a Green New Deal have done such an amazing job. “John McDonnell I think will be the first green chancellor we’ve ever had. Trust me on this we’ve got to make it an economic and social justice issue.” Miliband lambasted education secretary Gavin Williamson for criticising school pupils who missed out on school on Friday to take part in global climate change strikes. To cheers of activists in Brighton, he said: “By the way, that absolute moron, Gavin Williamson, said kids were bunking off, but this is a government that is bunking off for five weeks by closing down parliament.” The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  Ahead of Tuesday’s key vote on climate change motions, he warned again for the party to work with the unions, adding:“Firstly, keep protesting, keep striking, keep marching, keep the pressure on. Secondly this has got to be a working-class issue, not just a middle-class issue. “And our allies in the trade unions are incredibly important on this. I spoke to Paul Nowak [deputy general of the TUC]. He wants us to move forward as fast as we can but he’s worried about his workers in the oil and gas industry ... that’s what the just transition is all about.” Alex Mcintyre, spokesperson for Labour for a Green New Deal, said: “A Green New Deal needs an ambitious target for decarbonisation, or it is meaningless. “We understand and respect GMB’s concerns around the livelihoods of energy workers, which is why our motion calls for a 2030 target only if it assures a just transition for workers. “Our Green New Deal will be worker-led, creating millions of good, green jobs, building new green industries and empowering trade unions to fight for their rights. It’s the wealthiest that will pay for our Green New Deal, not workers and not ordinary people.”"

It’s not often you hear a distinguished scientist rip into his colleagues as Roy Spencer does at his blog here yesterday. His essay is a reaction to the House vote to suspend the funding the corrupt IPCC. Here are some excerpts:
On the IPCC:
Politicians formed the IPCC over 20 years ago with an endgame in mind: to regulate CO2 emissions.”
and
Science progresses by investigating alternative explanations for things. Long ago, the IPCC all but abandoned that search.”
On the most vocal AGW scientists (natural climate change deniers):
They apparently do not realize that ‘settled science’ is an oxymoron. The most vocal climate scientists defending the IPCC have lost their objectivity.”

and
They have a theory — more CO2 is to blame — and they religiously stick to it.”
and
I am ashamed for our scientific discipline and embarrassed by their behavior. Is it any wonder that scientists have such a bad reputation among the taxpayers who pay them to play in their ivory tower sandboxes? They can make gloom and doom predictions all day long of events far in the future without ever having to suffer any consequences of being wrong.”
and
They have gotten away with too much, for too long.”
On energy policy:
Making our most abundant and affordable sources of energy artificially more expensive with laws and regulations will end up killing millions of people.”
You really need to read his entire post to appreciate it. And I certainly would love to see Dr Spencer get “the opportunity to cross examine these (natural) climate change deniers in a court of law”. These cowards have ducked debate long eneough.

"Greta Thunberg’s address to the UN’s Climate Action Summit on Monday may well prove to be the climate change movement’s Gettysburg Address. Like Abraham Lincoln’s revered speech, which ran to 273 words, Thunberg’s was also very short, only 495 words long. Lincoln famously spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery, following the leading orator of the day, Edward Everett, who took two hours to deliver the official address, a 13,000 word oration. Lincoln’s speech, simply described in the day’s official program as Dedicatory Remarks, lasted less than three minutes. Thunberg would similarly have had some good acts to follow at a UN talk-fest, but her presence would not, at first glance, seem to be of the same significance as those of the various world leaders who had gathered for the event. And yet it is Thunberg’s speech, which took just four-and-a-half minutes to deliver, which, one suspects, will resonate long into the future. In the manner that was then traditional, Everett’s marathon speech, deemed very good by the standards of the day, was rich with classical allusion. But Lincoln used no classical reference. Instead, in a way that it is hard to appreciate from this distance of time, he was profoundly modern, using Biblical phrasing and rhythms that appealed to a population for whom the Book was the word, not Sophocles. Thunberg’s speech was similarly phrased in the contemporary argot pitched to the polarising force of social media’s algorithms, suffused with a contained rage. For she came not with a dream, but a nightmare, the scientific truth of climate change succinctly put in five paragraphs. Her dreams, she said, had been stolen from her along with her childhood. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing? Thunberg’s speech was damned by many, a Fox News commentator responding to the speech by calling Thunberg “a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left”. So too Lincoln, the London Times in 1863 not so very distant from Fox News in 2019, when, echoing some US newspapers, opined : “The ceremony [at Gettysburg] was rendered ludicrous by some of the luckless sallies of that poor President Lincoln.” Thunberg’s speech used phrases and ideas she has deployed before and to better effect. So too Lincoln. But what gives both speeches their enormous power is timing, each coming after historic events the significance of which had not yet been fully understood and was still in the process of creation. In Lincoln’s case it was the Battle of Gettysburg that had taken place a few months earlier, now regarded as a turning point in the civil war. In Thunberg’s case it was the massive global strike of schoolchildren a few days earlier inspired by her original, solitary strike on the steps of the Swedish parliament. Lincoln’s speech sought to give meaning to the enormous blood sacrifice of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the war more generally; in doing so he was shaping the future of the war and his nation. Thunberg’s singular achievement was to present the climate change issue as a battle for power. In doing so she spoke with the authority of the millions who marched only a few days before. For this Donald Trump trolled her. He intuited her power and tried to destroy it through mockery. In her speech Thunberg sets up an opposition between the plural we – those who want action on climate change – and a strangely singular use of the word you – those who don’t. And though she was speaking to an audience largely composed of those with power, her you was not only the assembled global leaders but everyone, and her we, while directly referring to the young and Friday’s three million marchers, was a we open to all, infinitely expandable. For the you is not just Trump or Scott Morrison or a fossil fuel company executive. Her you is personal. It is each of us who hears but as if in a nightmare cannot act. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing, condemning yourself to the ranks of those who the future “will never forgive”? On Wednesday the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the nation’s creepy gaslighter-in-chief, criticised Thunberg for similar reasons to Trump, saying, “I think we’ve got to caution against raising the anxieties of children in our country.” Since 1996 – seven years before Greta Thunberg was born – the Liberal party has been working assiduously to advance the cause of fossil fuel companies at the expense of our future. Morrison’s paternalistic piffle is just one more piece of grotesque bad faith on an issue about which the Liberal record is one of lying, scheming and wrecking at every step for over two decades. With his bluster of quiet Australians, Morrison is trying to pull a spit hood over the nation to silence us all. Recently released Australian cabinet papers reveal the Howard Liberal government was conspicuously campaigning in 1996 against legally binding, uniform emission reduction targets in the Kyoto protocol, with the prime minister’s advocacy to key world leaders proving “influential”. When uniform targets were eventually dropped, the Liberal cabinet praised John Howard’s negotiating strategy. If the world continues on its trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years “Australia is in a special position,” the cabinet papers record Howard saying. “We are a developed country that is a major exporter of energy.” And so it went for the next two decades. With the Liberals and the Murdoch press running political cover, the fossil fuel industries ramped up and up. By 2019 the Liberal party had defined itself as the party of coal, and a craven Labor party, after its defeat in the most recent election, is now following its lead. Today Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and LNG, and over the next decade Australia hopes to double its coal production. In consequence Australia is well on the way to becoming a pariah state along with the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia, its people hostage to the profits of its fossil fuel industry. The gross corruption of Australian public life so recently on display with examples of large sums of money from the Chinese Communist party seeming to flow into both Liberal and Labor coffers show exactly how easily purchased an enfeebled and unresponsive Australian democracy has become. And the corollary, the shameful, shared refusal of both Labor and Liberal parties to back a much-needed national corruption commission suggests only the obvious: the depth and breadth of corruption of our national polity. And yet while avoiding the criminality among their own, our leaders have been keen to criminalise those who actively campaign for our future. Queensland – the epicentre for major new coalmines – has significantly strengthened its laws against environmental protesters while lawyers for the Adani mine have publicly stated that they will seek to bankrupt any opponents of their new coalmine, the most controversial in the world, commercially viable only with the subsidies and tax breaks given for its consumption by the Indian government and for its production by Australian governments. When Morrison infamously brandished a lump of coal in parliament he told Australians not to be scared. But we should be. Australia is already living the grim consequences of climate change. If the world continues on its present trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years. The climate collapse is here. For over 30 years those who wished for action on climate change have believed that reason and truth would persuade those with power to act. But it is not so, and it did not prove to be so, and therein lies much of the reason carbon levels continue to rise and the planet’s very future is today hanging by the thinnest of threads. For power never gives to reason. Power bends only to power. And on Monday a schoolgirl raised the spectre of an opposing power that is now rising around the world and which will not be satisfied by those “who can only talk about money and fairytales of eternal economic growth”. “The young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you … We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.” Watching Greta Thunberg’s speech I understood what last Friday was about: a historic turning point where for the first time the power of we met the power of you without artifice, without compromise and with a ferocious courage. Millions marched last Friday. The next march will be bigger. The battle lines are finally clear. And each of us must now decide: am I you or am I we?

The prices that is. The UK Daily Mail reports today that inflation has reached the highest level in 20 years. Price increases have been fuelled primarily by an increase in VAT from 17.5% to 20%, and spiralling energy prices. The Mail writes:
For millions, the biggest battle is finding the money to fill up their car. The average price of petrol and diesel has never been higher. For example, a 50-litre diesel car now costs £70 to fill, compared with £59 last year. Unions said the inflation figures from the Office for National Statistics show ‘how tough it is for working families struggling to afford the most basic necessities, like food and fuel’.
Dr Ros Altmann, the director general of Saga, described the inflation figures as ‘truly dreadful’.”
Indeed a litre of petrol is up 14.7% in February over a year earlier, a litre of diesel is up 19.7%. And a litre of pure vegetable oil is up a whopping 42% and electricity up 6.5% . For petrol and diesel that all translates into something like $8 or$9 a gallon. This is the near future in America if you let the envirokooks get their way.
Risk of blackouts in Germany
Meanwhile in Germany electricity prices are also jumping. And as the country shuts down 7 of its nuclear power plants in a panic reaction to Fukushima, pressure for even higher prices will certainly mount. FOCUS magazine reports here that:

Many consumers are now threatened with a bad surprise when they get their next electric bills. According to an energy portal, prices will increase at 43 utilities. Also gas consumers are hit.
The announced price increases of the 43 utilities are at an average of 6.5%, according to the consumer portal.”
 
Natural gas prices are also rising. FOCUS reports that 37 utilities will jack up the prices.
High energy costs are not the only factor causing woes for German consumers. Soon they may no longer be able to rely on a steady supply. Yet another FOCUS report warns of possible blackouts, writing:
The German Energy Agency cautions on an overly hasty shutdown of nuclear energy. Switching off seven reactors power outages. The power grid needs to be massively expanded.”
The expansion of the power grid of course is to accommodate offshore windfarms and solar panels. The 7 nuclear power plants are scheduled to be shut down in May.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlorida State University scientist Dr Ryan Maue has an update on global tropical storm activity.
Now if global warming causes more, and more intense storms, then there must be some serious cooling going on right about now. Storms are practically off the radar! Here’s the chart for the last 40 years.

Dr Maue writes, adding his own emphasis:

Global Tropical Cyclone ACE does not show an upward trend in communion with global temperatures.”

Where’s the media? He also writes (emphasis added):
The March 21, 2011 00Z ECMWF deterministic 10-day forecast does not indicate another TC developing during the month. This will bring the previous 12-month total of global TCs down to 63 — by far the lowest in the last 40-years or more.”
Dr, Maue also says that this level is possibly “unprecedented”. 
So what should we start expecting from the “climate scientists? First they said global warming would lead to warmer temperatures. But then they changed their minds and said that it leads to colder winters. That means we can expect them to reverse on tropical storms and claim that warming will cause tropical storm inactivity.
But don’t count on it. For that to happen, the global warming “scientists” would first have to jump out of the pockets of reinsurers and into the pockets of those with interest in no storms, whoever that could be.

"Italian authorities have closed off roads and evacuated homes after experts warned that a portion of a Mont Blanc glacier is at risk of collapse. Stefano Miserocchi, the mayor of the town of Courmayeur, said “public safety is a priority” after experts from the Fondazione Montagna Sicura (Safe Mountains Foundation) in the Aosta Valley said up to 250,000 cubic metres of ice was in danger of sliding off the Planpincieux glacier on the Grandes Jorasses peak. “This phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,” Miserocchi said in a statement. Experts have been monitoring the glacier closely since 2013 to detect the speed at which the ice is melting, and Miserocchi said the rate had “significantly increased” recently. But they are unable to predict when the ice would break away. “There are currently no empirical models or methods that can enable quantitative predictions in the case of glaciers with sliding dynamics such as Planpincieux,” Miserocchi added. The warning comes as world leaders meet in New York for the UN climate action summit. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said: “The news that part of Mont Blanc risks collapsing is a warning that should not leave us indifferent. It must shake us all and force us to mobilise.” In 2017, about 50 cubic metres of ice fell from Planpincieux, while in September last year a mass of ice broke away from the Glacier de la Charpoua, on the south-east side of the Aiguille Verte, on the French side of Mont Blanc. Miserocchi’s order came into force on Tuesday and includes the evacuation of homes and mountain refuges in the area. He said it was a precautionary measure and there was no threat to residential areas or tourist establishments. The zones affected are in the area of Val Ferret. Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, with environmental activists in Switzerland holding their second “mourning ceremony” on the evaporating Pizol glacier in the country’s Glarus Alps on Monday. The glacier has lost up to 90% of its volume since 2006. In August, a similar event was held at a glacier in Iceland. A heatwave across Europe this summer is also said to have accelerated the melt speed."

Look – it’s a messy job cleaning this up and things will neither go smoothly nor happen right away when you want them to.Right now you’ve got hundreds of thousands of poor earthquake victims outside freezing in the bitter elements and it would be nice if the media focused on them and did something to lift their spirits for once.
That said, here are some good links from calmer heads:
– Firsthand account from someone in Tokyo: chipango blog (hat-tip: oekowatch.org):
And while a momentary increase in radiation has been observed on Monday (which was still an absolutely harmless figure and mostly proves the sensitivity of our measurement processes), the figures have been falling ever since. Since yesterday morning, we’re essentially measuring only the natural background here in Tokyo.”
– More information here at the iaea.org/news:
Japanese authorities have informed the IAEA that engineers were able to lay an external grid power line cable to unit 2. The operation was completed at 08:30 UTC.  They plan to reconnect power to unit 2 once the spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building is completed.
The spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building was temporarily stopped at 11:09 UTC (20:09 local time) of 17 March. The IAEA continues to liaise with the Japanese authorities and is monitoring the situation as it evolves.”

– More detailed report here at World Nuclear News:
There have been about 50 staff engaged in pumping seawater into the reactor cores and primary containment vessels of units 1, 2 and 3. From time to time these need to vent steam, which causes radiation to rise across the site and required the workers to move to a safer location.
Another 130 were also on site, according to reports, including soldiers from the Japan Self Defence Force.”
and
The Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said at 8.38pm that a cable was being laid to bring external power from transmission lines owned by Tohoku Electric Power Company. This was to be connected when radiation levels had died down after a planned venting operation at unit 2.
In addition, one of the emergency diesel units can now be operated and will be used to supply unit 5 and 6 alternately to inject water to their used fuel pools. Later, the power will be used to top up water in the reactor vessels.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore evidence of the obvious now revealed in a recent Nature article from research conducted by the IFM GEOMAR and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Believe it or not, they are slowly finding out that the oceans play a role in climate.
Once again climate scientists, who often claim the science is settled, are running into “surprises” and finding out that there is so much they don’t know. Here’s the press release from the IFM GEOMAR (emphasis added):
====================================================
Oceanographers from Kiel document the effect of equatorial deep currents on West African rainfall
May 18, 2011/Kiel. Our climate is affected by the ocean in many ways.
The most prominent example is the El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific, a well-documented interannual climate signal. Oceanographers from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI, USA) have recently documented the effect of deep equatorial currents in the Atlantic on rainfall and climate over West Africa.
Precipitation associated with the West African Monsoon is of major significance to agriculture, water resources and health concerns in one of the more densely populated regions in Africa. The timing and amount of rainfall each year in the countries along the northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea are determined in part by the sea surface temperature of the tropical Atlantic. The details of this interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere are not fully understood at this time. Previously it was thought that effects from the Pacific and North Atlantic were the main source for climate fluctuations in the equatorial Atlantic. Oceanographers from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR), in collaboration with their colleagues from the USA, were now able to demonstrate the existence of regular interannual temperature fluctuations which have an effect on the rainfall of the region but cannot be traced back to the previously known sources.  Even more astonishing for the scientists is the fact that all measurements indicate that these fluctuations are caused by deep currents of the equatorial Atlantic itself. “To date, when trying to explain tropical climate variations, we have always looked upwards, specifically to the atmosphere. Our new data, for the first time, direct our attention towards the depths of the ocean, thereby opening new perspectives for our scientific approach,” explained Dr Peter Brandt, professor at IFM-GEOMAR.
In a large-scale, international research programme, the Tropical Atlantic Climate Experiment (TACE), experts have attempted for years to track the causes, effects and potential periodicities of climate fluctuations in the tropical Atlantic. The German contribution to this programme also includes deep-sea moorings along the equator. These moorings consist of several km of mooring wire held upright in the water column by flotation and buoys. Instruments are mounted along the wire to continuously record current speed and direction, salinity and temperature, thereby allowing the observation of long-term changes of parameters in the deep ocean. Furthermore, the scientists obtain current data from freely drifting deep-sea buoys, so-called Argo floats, and also information on the sea surface itself and the atmosphere from various satellite-based sensors. “The time series obtained over the past ten to twenty years have revealed previously unknown fluctuations of currents and temperatures at the surface of the tropical Atlantic which have a regular cycle of 54 months, or 4 ½ years,” explained Peter Brandt. The scientists were able to document similar fluctuations of the “Deep Jets”, deep currents down to 3000 m with speeds of 10-20 cm/sec. They flow along the equator, crossing the entire Atlantic, with flow reversals every few hundred meters. “These jets are generated in the deep ocean, and their energy apparently propagates upwards through the water column. Once near the surface, this energy affects currents and temperatures,” stated Dr Brandt.
On the other hand, sea surface temperatures are among the deciding factors for rainfall fluctuations over West Africa. “How large the effect of these deep jets is, and how they are generated is still somewhat of a mystery,” said Dr Brandt, “we still have a lot of work ahead of us.”

We keep hearing that CO2 is the main climate driver, yet so much research has come out showing that it’s the sun and oceans.

Suggesting that Eton should inculcate compassion is downright patronising to the growing numbers of poor whose lives are destroyed and ambitions stifled by the privately educated. Wealthy families send their children to Eton to ensure they keep and increase their astonishing wealth by holding on to the levers of power in society. Government by former school chums ensures no one can know how wealthy they are, where that wealth came from, where it is stashed, and that fiscal policy is more than favourable. Britain did not become one of the most economically unequal societies in Europe by accident. A privileged group of people want it that way, and it is no accident that they are involved in leaving the EU, because it is a direct threat to their wealth.Dr Robin C RichmondBromyard, Herefordshire  • Leaving aside the issue of whether any “charity” boss should earn £270,000, the speech by Cheryl Giovannoni illustrates just why the Labour party should strip independent schools of their charitable status (Teach girls how to ask for a pay rise, says charity boss, 20 September). As you state, the Girls’ Day School Trust administers 23 private schools. Even its most ardent defender could not argue that this organisation does anything to encourage social mobility, never mind social justice. Of course women should “accept nothing less than salary equality”, but achieving this involves a lot more than teaching girls how to ask for a rise. Ending the gig economy and ensuring all workers have collectively negotiated contracts would be a better start.Declan O’NeillOldham • Once again, George Monbiot was essential reading (For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth, 19 September). However, I feel a caveat needs to be made on one point: “The assumption on which governments and economists operate is that everyone strives to maximise their wealth.” No, the assumption for economists is that everyone strives to maximise their utility, ie their overall satisfaction. The problem comes from too many people forgetting or ignoring this fundamental principle of the subject, and giving wealth too much weight in the utility function. While it is probably true to say that some economists are guilty of this mistake, it is made by far more non-economists – and, regrettably, by far too many policymakers.Dominic RiceSheffield • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a look into a climate science debate conference between skeptics and warmists that took place last month in Potsdam, Germany. The skeptics are scientists from the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and the warmists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
In October 2010 PIK Director Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber invited (reluctantly after some controversy) the skeptic EIKE scientists for a scientific colloquium on the subject of climate change with the aim of clearing up misundertandings that had flared up earlier. For years skeptic scientists had been denied the opportunity to debate the issue, and so thus advance science.
EIKE requested that I translate their conference report.
While PIK, which is massively funded by the state, is convinced of an approaching climate catastrophe, EIKE, on the other hand, views the science behind man-made catastrophic climate change with deep skepticism, and has acted as Germany’s spokesman for skeptic or non-alarmist scientists. EIKE has been the targeted and often denied a voice by the media and warmist scientists. It is run on a shoestring through private funding.
The following is a translation of EIKE’s protocol, see here for the original German (Note: some parts were condensed to remove clutter).

———————————————————————————– 
Participants:
PIK: Dr. Georg Feulner, Eva Gaigg, Prof. Dr. Friedrich Gerstengarbe, Dr. Veronika Huber, Dr. Brigitte Knopf, Claudia Köhler, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kropp, Prof. Dr. Anders Levermann, Dr. Jörg Pietsch, Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Prof. Dr. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Dr. Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Mareike Schodder, Jonas Viering. External participants for PIK: Tanja Fröhlich, Prof. Dr. Uwe Ulbrich
 
EIKE: Dr. Siegfried Dittrich Prof. Dr. Karl-­‐Friedrich Ewert, Michael Limburg, Prof. Dr. Horst-­‐Joachim Lüdecke, Klaus-­‐Eckart Puls; EIKE guests Dr. Alexander Hempelmann, Dr.Rainer Link, Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, Prof. Dr. Werner Weber
Date: April 2011
Location: Potsdam Telegrafenberg
The conference began with a presentation by Dr Feulner of the PIK, and then was followed by four presentations by EIKE scientists. All participants were aware that great differences existed beforehand between PIK and EIKE on the development of the global climate, reliability of models, interpretation of datasets, greenhouse effect, extreme weather frequency, sea level rise etc.
Before the conference, information exchanges mainly took place indirectly via media publications, the Internet and events like conferences and symposiums.  These discussions were often extremely heated, and so this face-to-face meeting was to serve as a professional way of exchanging information to avoid misunderstandings and to discuss controversial topics directly.
Opening
Prof. Schellnhuber opened the conference with a short statement at 1:40 pm and spoke about the circumstances that leading up to the invitstion [1]. He then explained why PIK, acting as the host of the event, wished no media attention although this had been suggested by EIKE, and expressed astonishment that EIKE planned to hold a press conference after the conclusion of the conference. He then opened the conference.
Michael Limburg (EIKE Vice President) expressed his thanks for the invitation and the opportunity to discuss scientific knowledge among each other.
“State Of Climate Science“
Dr Feulner then started his presentation: “State of Climate Science“ (see  Feulner). He presented the development of trends, as to PIK. The discussion after the presentation was lively. Dr Vahrenholt doubted the presented influence of solar activity (Feulner pegged at 0.1°K and so called it slight) referring to the newest findings from (Shapiro et al 2011) where the TSI-increase from the Little Ice Age until today was possibly 6 times higher than assumed in AR4. Also a paper from January 2010 from Solomon was referred to, where the cooling over the last 10 years has something to do with the 10% reduction in water vapour in the stratosphere.
It was also pointed out that GISS, in generating a “global temperature”, showed Arctic temperatures even though there exist nowhere near enough measurement stations there, as is also the case in Antarctica.
Dr Rainer Link also pointed out that the temperature oscillations of the oceans like the AMO, PDO, El Nino etc. are not accounted for in the models, and that the models cannot predicts them. But Dr Rahmstorf objected. Dr Feulner explained his claim that no decreasing trend in the recent global mean temperature can be discerned because a short-term look of less than 30 years doesn’t allow it. The climate models would not have a fine enough resolution to allow it. EIKE disagreed with this view by pointing out public data like from Hadley Center and UEA, which show no temperature increase since 1998.  Although it is correct, said EIKE, that a climate reference value of at least 30 years should be used, one has to recognise that the models used so far cannot appropriately show the last 10 – 15 years.
“Sun and Climate“ 
Dr Weber then started his presentation “Sun and Climate” at 2:20 pm “ (see short version here). In the brief first part, he showed the expected saturation of CO2 by the atmosphere. Today about 50% of anthropogenically emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere, while at the start of the industrial times all CO2 emitted by man remained in the atmosphere because of the equilibrium that existed between ocean and atmosphere. Then Dr Weber introduced the resulting differential equation that leads to an exponential saturation of atmospheric CO2 absorption in the most simple model with constant CO2 emission. At approx ca. 4 ppm annual CO2 emission, which is what we have today, saturation is at about 500 ppm CO2. Weber also pointed out that it is scientific practice to use the simplest models for public showing and then discuss subsequent tweaking and corrections. The necessary corrections and model limits would then be added.

In the main part of the presentation, Dr Weber looked at the indirect influence by the active sun on climate, caused by an up to 20% reduction in cosmic radiation by the solar magnetic field, which in turn eventually leads to an increase in solar radiation reaching the earth. These trends, which Weber had found in earlier solar data, had been doubted by Dr Feulner (PIK) in a paper. Then the presentation went on mainly about the quality of analyses on both sides. Unfortunately Dr Weber only had a preliminary and unclearly formulated version of Feulner’s paper at his disposal, and as a result Mr Weber assumed a technical error by Mr Feulner. Misunderstanding resulted and eventually the accusation of a technical error was cleared up. It was agreed that the final version of Feulner paper would be discussed in detail by Dr. A. Hempelmann, who had started a cooperation in this field with Weber.
“Climate Sensitivity of CO2 “
Next Dr Rainer Link made his presentation on “Climate Sensitivity of CO2“, (see short version), beginning with the well-known saying about science: “Every theory in science is accepted only when it is confirmed by observation. A single observation that contradicts the theory is sufficient to refute it. The postulated water vapour positive feedback in the models is the essential part of the alarmist forecast for temperature increase by the climate model cannot be confirmed by a single observation. To the contrary, it has been refuted on multiple times.“A Hot Spot in the middle to upper troposphere in the tropical regions could not be found by hundreds of balloon measurements. That therefore eliminates the possibility that the climate system would go out of control because of CO2 and the subsequent water vapour positive feedback. That also impacted the so-called 2°C target. Link calculated the temperature increase from a doubling of CO2 at a max. of 1.6°K ; however, it is probably significantly less (quoted Lindzen, Paltridge, Harde and others). Thus there is no reason for climate alarmism. Taking part in the controversial discussion in addition to Dr Link, were Dr Schellnhuber, Dr Rahmstorf, Mr Puls, Dittrich and Dr Huber. Dr Rahmstorf pointed out that the ice ages could not be explained by Milankowitch cycles alone and had to have been caused by the CO2 induced water vapour feedbacks, but could not deliver the evidence. The rise in temperature after each ice age is not the consequence of higher CO2 concentrations, but rather the higher CO2 concentrations result from the warming oceans. The arguments presented by Dr Link could not be convincingly refuted by the PIK participants.
 “Extreme weather and sea level“
After the coffee break, meteorologist Klaus-Eckert Puls made his presentation: “Extreme Weather and Sea Levels“ (see Presentation – long version). Mr Puls talked about how the public had been bombarded by countless, and at times absurd, warnings on weather and climate over the last 10 years. These warnings were aimed at producing the impression of an already started climate catastrophe. Moreover: In the public (media and politicians!) results from climate models from climate institutes are often presented as prognoses without the advisory that they are in fact only scenarios that entail large uncertainty. Puls suggested –  analogous to the Hamburg Declaration on long-term weather prognoses made by meteorologists – that PIK and EIKE draw up and agree on a so-called “Potsdam Declaration” with the objective of mutually setting the record straight concerning false or exaggerated statements in the media. No reply from the PIK with respect to this suggestion, and no mention of it in the conclusion (Schellnhuber).
Using charts, graphics, statistics and quotes from a variety of institutes, Mr Puls showed that after 150 years of global warming, weather agencies worldwide have found no 100-year trends in middle latitude cyclones, tropical storms, tornadoes, flooding and other weather events. Moreover, using a series of sea level measurements and satellite data from their own institutes and from the IPCC, the expected acceleration in sea level rise is nowhere to be found. Dr Rahmstorf noted that there are other datasets out there. Puls and Rahmstorf agreed to exchange their data. Concerning the 100-year trends documented at the German North Sea coast by K.-E. Behre (B., NIHK Wilhelmshaven), Puls in a debate with Dr Kropp pointed out that Behre did not take temperature into account and that Behre detected a deceleration in sea level rise over the last 400 years, particularly during the 20th century.
Global long-term temperature series
Dr Horst-­‐Joachim Lüdecke began his presentation “Global Longterm Temperature Series“ (see short version here). At the start, the various versions of the Mannian temperature reconstructions over the last 1000 years were clear. Dr Lüdecke and others termed them as clear falsification, whereby Dr Rahmstorf demanded proof of that claim. He was then refered to the comprehensive works of McIntyre and McKitrick. And it is very well summarised in Andrew Montford’s book: The Hockeystick Illusion“.
The core conclusion of the studies by Lüdecke and Ewert – backed by comprehensive statistical analysis intensive of auto correlation (persistence) on thousands of temperature series is: “There is nothing unusual about the warming of the 20th century.“ After a drop in temperature in the years before, there was a mostly naturally caused warming once the man-made influences of the UHI are removed. It is easily recognizable. Similar and often times even more pronounced fluctuations can be observed in the past over the last 2000 years. They were all caused naturally. Dr Schellnhuber and Dr Kropp both engaged in the lively discussion that followed. Dr Schellnhuber noted that the paper quoted by Dr Lüdecke (which Schellnhuber himself co-authored and confirmed missing warming) was a paper where Dr Kropp was the project leader with the University of Giessen. Dr Schellnhuber remarked that the result was in any case no smoking gun (against CO2-induced warming?). Dr Rahmstorf added that the statistic was “blind“ to the physics. This was rejected by Dr Lüdecke and Dr Link. Dr Kropp then pointed out that the methods that were used are still in development.
Summary
It is obvious that the participants were for the most part in agreement with the perception of the facts – the absence of increased weather extremes being unchallenged by PIK speaks volumes. The methods for assessing these facts however appear to differ. While the participants from EIKE put unconditional priority on physical measurements, climate impact research has to rely on models calculations for future orientation. It would be desirable if this difference were better known among the generally uninformed public. For the truthful informing of laymen, it is not helpful when popular presentations are made by scientists in which catastrophic weather extreme increases are reported as being attributed to anthropogenic climate change, in contradiction to measured facts.
Conclusion: Thanks and return invitation:
On behalf of the guests Mr Limburg expressed thanks for the open discussion and that they would gladly like to continue as the debate, as in EIKE’s view they were especially fruitful. Mr Limburg invited the PIK colleagues for an orderly meeting for late summer of this year – to which there was no objection.
The conference was ended with a short speech by Dr Schellnhuber somewhat behind schedule at 5:50 pm. He thanked the participants for their work and for the almost always factual discussion. He also remarked that he assumed there would be a fair treatment of PIK at the ensuing press conference. In response Mr Limburg invited him to join it. Mr Schellnhuber declined as he had another private matter to attend to, but named some of his colleagues to attend.

———————————————————————–
Some additional notes: Michael Limburg has informed me that PIK scientists have turned down EIKE’s invitation to continue the exchanges. And it is rather peculiar that the PIK objected and refused the presence of the media, and expressed reservations that EIKE held a press conference afterwards.
From the report one gets the impression that PIK puts a lot faith in climate models and is suspicious observations that do not conform to their models. In real science one ought to be suspicious of models that do not conform to real-life observations. Michael Limburg also added in his e-mail:
The scientific position and ability of PIK scientists during that meeting was rather weak. Whenever they had to agree that observation do not show any special increase neither in extreme weather, temperature nor sea level and so on, they mentioned: ‘But our models show…’ “
That their science is weak ought not be a surprise. What else could one possibly expect from a science that ignores observations and relies on models?

Many of us have been watching the sunspots every day and wondering if the sun was entering into some kind of Dalton minimum.
Solar Cycle 24 was about three years overdue.
Well, it’s still not sure if a Dalton-sort of minimum will or will not occur, but the latest event suggests that the sun has woken from its long slumber for good. Solar Cycle 24 is alive! This is the latest news from NASA.
====================================================
April 14, 2011:
If you’ve ever stood in front of a hot stove, watching a pot of water and waiting impatiently for it to boil, you know what it feels like to be a solar physicist.

Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet.

NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory recorded this X1.5-class solar flare on March 9, 2011. [movie]

“Ever since, we’ve been waiting for solar activity to pick up,” says Richard Fisher, head of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC. “It’s been three long years.”
Quiet spells on the sun are nothing new. They come along every 11 years or so—it’s a natural part of the solar cycle. This particular solar minimum, however, was lasting longer than usual, prompting some researchers to wonder if it would ever end.
News flash: The pot is starting to boil. “Finally,” says Fisher, “we are beginning to see some action.”
As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of “X-class” solar flares–the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006.

The Aquarius satellite will measure ocean surface salinity every seven days with a precision down to a pinch of salt (1/8 of a teaspoon) in a gallon of water – from 408 miles above the earth.

Why is this important? This VIDEO CLICK HERE (2 min) explains why. 
When I watched this video, I thought: “Wait a minute – I thought the science was settled, and that the models were pretty much fine-tuned and all.” But as you see in the video, three scientists are telling us there are still lots of data gaps that need to be filled in, and that this will take years to do.
The clip starts with NASA scientists Gary Lagerloef, Amit Sen and Yi Chao explaining why salinity is so important. Amit Sen says (emphasis added):
But yet we do not know one of the fundamental properties that effect climate, which is the density, the concentration of salt of the ocean.”
Yi Chao then says:
Salinity is one of the missing parameters we have never measured from space before.”

Gary Lagerloef:
We have no salinity samples at all from parts of the world, particularly in the southern hemisphere, the South Pacific, South Atlantic and southeren Indian Oceans. So there is a big data gap.”
and later:
Salinity is one of the measurements we need to fill in an important gap to do that very thing.”
Fine. But why not first fill in these “big data gaps” first before drawing final conclusions and settling on predetermined outcomes? Has no one ever told any of you how the scientific process works? And please don’t be so arrogant to think that you know the answer beforehand. Everyone knows that nobody is that clever.
One option I suppose would be to just extrapolate salinity concentrations at locations up to 1200 miles away from measured high salinity points, like your boss Hansen does with surface temperatures. The advantage is that it allows you to get the answer you want. I mean, after all, people in your field do this routinely.
Obviously the status of the science depends on who the scientists are speaking to. When they’re talking to policymakers, then they have have plenty of data to predict the future – even 100 or 200 years ahead! But when they are talking to people who decide the funding, then suddenly there are big data gaps – and everywhere!
Of course, we all know that the latter is true, and lots of data is still needed before one can even start to understand the complex system that is climate. And forget models that can predict 100 years down the road. It’ll be decades, if ever, before we reach that level of performance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt amazes me how the media take a non-story and inflate it into a “climate time-bomb”.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung has an interview today with Dr. Hans-Wolfgang Hubberten, a director at the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), who has been studying the permafrost in Siberia for 20 years now. Not surprisingly he sees signs of some permafrost melt – and why not? After all the globe has warmed about 0.6°C over the last 100 years.
In the interview Hubberten speaks about the scenario of massive permafrost melt and the implications such a scenario would have, but then reminds us that in reality the permafrost is thawing only very slowly, and so it’s no big deal. So what does the media focus on? On the horror scenarios of course, and not the reality.
One of the favorite horror scenarios floated out by AGW alarmists is sub-marine permafrost melt and the associated release of huge quantities of potent greenhouse gas methane, which then could lead to the much dreaded, yet elusive, tipping point.
Hubberten points out that there are 36 million square km of permafrost, which is equal to 25% the size of the earth’s land surface. Much of it lies below the Arctic ocean. The thickness ranges from a couple of meters to 1600 meters in some spots in Siberia. Of course warming and cooling of the climate leads to corresponding changes in the permafrost over time.
Here are some of Hubberten comments on melting permafrost:
1. Impact on sea levels:
It could by the end of the century lead to an additional global sea level rise of a few centimeters. Therefore the permafrost must be studied with the same seriousness as melting glaciers and sea ice.

//-->




This is a not so subtle call for lots more funding.
2. Is the permafrost thawing? According to Hubberten (paraphrasing):
In some areas in Russia within 50 years it has gotten about 20 cm thicker. Right now in treeless regions the upper 50 or 60 cm layer  is thawing. In the forested southern permafrost region up to 5 to 6 meters. The permafrost is warming also at greater depths where temperatures over the entire year range from -5°C to -20°C. We have exact measurements in Alaska for example. At a depth of 20 meters it has warmed 1.5″C over the last 35 years.”
Some places it’s thicker, some places thinner, and some places it is less cold. That shouldn’t be a surprise though because the planet has warmed a bit over the last century. So not really that much has happened.
3. What does Hubberten think about the possibility of a massive methane gas eruption from rapidly thawing permafrost (paraphrasing – emphasis added)?
Much is speculated on this ‘methane climate time-bomb’. In a sceanrio where there is a rapid and complete disintegration of the sub-marine permafrost, there could indeed be a huge methane release into the atmosphere, and from that a considerable global temperature increase from a greenhouse effect. In reality we assume, however, that there is a relatively slow reduction of the submarine permafrost – with a possible slight addition of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.”
Hubberten then throws his pitch for more funding, again, adding:
But, the sub-marine permafrost and the methane  gas hydrates are still mostly not researched and with today’s level of knowledge it is a big factor of uncertainty in the climate system.”
In the end we can safely say that all the permafrost warnings will likely turn out to be like the UN 50-million-refugee-predictions we have all been hearing about the last few days.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has a ""Master Plan"" for society. (Photo credit: http://nachhaltigkeit2009.commerzbank.de)
Hans Schellnhuber’s Social Contract For Sustainability‘s real economic and social impacts would be incalculable. This has never been attempted before, and its approach completely contradicts all fundamental economic and scientific principles. Moreover, it is to be implemented without first having a public debate, and to be done so at warp speed. This in itself makes the plan reckless, callous and extremely dangerous. It especially puts the poorest among us at risk. And with its authors having castigated our modern society time and again, it is de facto a Declaration of War on our current system.
That’s the conclusion I have reached having read in more detail Hans Schellhuber’s Social Contract For Sustainability, which he himself dubbed “a masterplan” for radically transforming society. It is truly baffling that this scheme could get so far.
“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”.
And when one considers the arrogance and the scientific dogma that propels Schellhuber’s Social Contract for Sustainability, even the notion of good intentions disappears. From Schellnhuber’s and his peers’ expressed views, one senses the genuine spite they must harbour for today’s modern democratic society and our system of prosperity and freedom. Anyone else would certainly use a different approach to bring about change.
Their manifesto not only calls for a radical overhaul of society, and especially the energy systems that support human life on the planet, but also of our politics and even the way we think. On page 1:
…the requisite transformation encompasses profound changes to infrastructures, production processes, regulation systems and lifestyles, and extends to a new kind of interaction between politics, society, science and the economy.”
Especially disturbing is Schellnhuber’s use of fabricated, junk-science-based horror scenarios for justifying a takeover of today’s democratic and free market system. Although there is a huge body of science showing that CO2 has only a minor, easily manageable impact on climate, Schellnhuber writes on page 1:
This drastic change in direction must be accomplished before the end of the current decade in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum by 2050, and thereby to maintain the possibility of avoiding dangerous climate change. Hence, time is of the essence here.”
Like the Pope Declaring The Islamic World Is To Convert To Christianity By 2020
Worse, the plan callously disregards all the obvious huge risks involved in this great social engineering experiment. The plan ignores science and violates every fundamental economic principle, and so poses a threat of an unimaginable scale to the humankind, society and the environment.  The Social Contract to Sustainability is equivalent to a Chilton’s How To Replace Jet Engines On An Airbus 380 Over To Propellers While In Flight And In Just 10 Minutes. Or, a plan from the Vatican to convert the Islamic World to Christianity by 2020.
More worrisome is that this Green Masterplan is now in the hands of every European Environment Minister, who are drooling over all the power it promises to bring them. It won’t work without something going horrifically wrong. We saw similar results with the Soviet Union.

Not only do the masterplan’s authors want to skip debate and necessary public discussion, which normally precede proposed public endeavours in democratic and open societies, they also  insist that it all has to be done ultra-rapidly, “before the end of the decade”, without debate and always with the fictitious gun barrel of imminent climate catastrophe at our heads. This is a sort of psycho-terror.
Except for their dubious computer models, there is no scientific data to suggest any sort of urgency. It is pure Malthusian paranoia. Don’t let the fuzzy warm platitudes about democracy and human rights in the text at the beginning of the Contract fool you – that’s sheep’s wool over the wolf. In fact the poor will get slammed the hardest.
Denying the poor cheap energy
This is probably the worst part of it all – the plan’s schemes to deny the poor cheap and plentiful energies that would lift them out of their abject poverty. Many poorer countries are planning to use nuclear energies to power their futures, but the masterminds oppose this. Page 3:
Several countries are currently planning to increase their use of nuclear energy. The WBGU urgently advises against this, above all because of the not negligible risks accompanying cases of serious damage, the still unresolved issues concerning final storage, and the danger of uncontrolled proliferation. Existing plants should be replaced by sustainable energy technologies as soon as possible, and, in the case of evident safety deficiencies, be closed down immediately. However, the phase-out of nuclear energy must not be compensated by renewed or intensified brown or black coal based energy generation.
Because it’ll be brutal enough for the richer countries to bear the high costs of renewable energy, you’d think the poor would get a pass be allowed to burn the cheap available energy beneath their feet. Nein! – says Schellnhuber. The council denies them fossil fuels as well, adding later on page 3:
The requisite decarbonisation of energy systems means that the pressure is on to act, not just in the industrialised countries, but also in the dynamically growing industrialising and developing countries. Even the poorer developing countries must veer towards a low-emission development path in the medium-term. The era of fossil energy carrier reliant economic growth must be brought to an end.”
Schellnhuber’s eerie attempts to bring an end to the carbonised society would in fact likely bring about the premature end to millions of lives.
Cost: $1 trillion PER YEAR, and significantly higher after 2030:
Even though many western governments are hopelessly caught in the unsustainable trap of massive debt, printing presses will likely be fired up to print money to pay for it all. The costs even by the masterplan’s admission are staggering. Page 4 states:
Globally, the additional investment required for transformation into a low-carbon society, compared with the cost of ‘just carrying on as we are’, probably lies somewhere in the region of at least 200 to up to 1,000 billion US dollars per year by 2030, and would significantly exceed this amount between 2030 and 2050. These investments will be offset by later savings of a similar size, and the avoidance of the immense costs of dangerous climate change.
This is all to avoid fictitious future “immense costs”. Now one gets a sense as to why this would border on a social and humanitarian folly of unprecedented dimensions.

"A meeting with US president Donald Trump was always a fraught proposition for New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern. It was never going to deliver any clear wins, and was unlikely to do her progressive reputation any favours. And that’s the outcome – Ardern’s reputation has probably taken a hit, at least among her own progressive constituency. Ardern’s liberal supporters see her as the polar opposite of the US president, and she has even been labelled the “anti-Trump”. They expected her in some way to speak truth to power when meeting the man who has become synonymous with the most reactionary problems in politics today. More than anything, Ardern might have been expected to use the opportunity to push Trump hard on the issue of climate change.  Instead, Ardern came out of the meeting typically upbeat, exuding her trademark diplomacy. She described the meeting as a “perfectly productive, warm, solid bilateral”, trotting out the usual platitudes about US-NZ relations, and highlighting Trump’s purported interest in New Zealand. There were some tidbits: we were informed of Trump’s somewhat incongruous interest in the gun buyback scheme established by Ardern’s government immediately following the Christchurch mosque terror attacks. But, as signalled prior to her departure for the US, trade was top of Ardern’s agenda, with climate change seemingly barely touched upon. Unfortunately for Ardern, the New Zealand media is now giving plenty of coverage of her positivity towards Trump, mixed with reports of dissatisfaction over her failure to push climate change action at the meeting. And to make matters worse for her, Trump has now tweeted that the good news stories about their conversation are “true” and that it was “A wonderful meeting!” In one sense the meeting was a success. Many conservatives will be very happy with a positive diplomatic outcome and Ardern’s focus on trade. Prior to the meeting conservative pundits congratulated Ardern for even securing the meeting with Trump and lobbied for her to use it to push a free-trade agenda, which has long been New Zealand’s diplomatic focus with the US. Ardern’s meeting ticked the usual objectives for a New Zealand prime minister meeting the US president. Business as usual has been achieved. Therein lies the problem for Ardern. Ardern isn’t supposed to be a traditional PM. She came to power riding a wave of enthusiasm for being different. Jacindamania was based on the expectation that she would do politics differently and would reject business as usual. She promised “transformational change”. Now this anti-Trump politician has had her first formal meeting with the real Trump, and nothing much has changed. While no one can have reasonably expected that her meeting with Trump would produce immediate results, there was certainly an expectation that she would at least emphasise the need for action on climate change. Ardern has previously campaigned on making climate change her “generation’s nuclear-free moment”. In inviting this comparison, she was consciously evoking a time when New Zealand stood up to the US government, banning American nuclear ships from visiting our ports in the face of enormous diplomatic and trade pressure. While contentious at the time, this defiant stance is now a source of immense national pride for New Zealanders. Climate change is also why Ardern travelled to New York this week. And her meeting with Trump was preceded by her speech at the UN in which she determinedly remained on message and suggested trade was an answer to climate change. To her misfortune, Ardern had to follow Greta Thunberg, who excoriated world leaders for their failure to act on climate change, describing this as a betrayal. Thunberg’s address made it clear there is now a new anti-Trump on the world stage – one who it is impossible to imagine meeting with Trump and letting him get away with business as usual, or proposing trade deals as a solution for climate change. Ardern is also fighting a rising tide of cynicism at home over whether her actions match her rhetoric. The New Zealand Labour party and, crucially, Ardern’s own office, is currently embroiled in a major sexual assault scandal. This is on the heels of failures to deliver promised changes – most notably the flagship housing policy has turned into a train wreck that her government is trying to salvage, without much success. Ardern’s performance in New York is not going to be enough to assuage the uneasy feeling that for all Ardern’s claims to be different, it’s very much business as usual. She described climate change in her speech at the UN as an “extraordinary threat” but, right now, her response to that threat is looking – as we say – “pretty ordinary”.

"Thousands of Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists are planning to shut down parts of central London for at least two weeks in October to demand governments take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. Organisers say the next round of protests, centred around parliament and surrounding government departments, will be bigger than those in April, when Extinction Rebellion activists brought key sites across the capital to a standstill for two weeks and more than 1,000 people were arrested. The October Rebellion in London, which will begin on Monday 7 October, is part of a planned series of XR actions taking place in more than 60 cities around the world, including Paris, New York, Buenos Aires and Delhi. It follows a rise in concern about the escalating ecological emergency, which last week resulted in millions of people taking part in a global climate strike. Sarah Lunnon, from Extinction Rebellion UK, said: “We hope that world leaders understand that the climate and ecological emergency means that the rules must change … business as usual is destroying our planet’s capacity to sustain life; humanity faces a growing risk of societal collapse in 10-20 years due to mass starvation, migration and war.” She said “more rhetoric” from politicians and world leaders would not help. “That is why we have been left with no other choice but to shut down capital cities to raise the alarm. The collapse of our climate and ecosystems has already begun, and is in fact accelerating beyond predictions.” In April thousands of peaceful protesters held key sites across London for two weeks, pushing the environmental crisis to the top of the political agenda and contributing to parliament declaring a climate emergency. Extinction Rebellion says its three demands of government: to tell the truth about the ecological emergency; halt biodiversity loss and reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and set up a citizens assembly on climate and ecological justice, have not been met. For October’s action, organisers say XR has built “a movement of movements”, with animal rights activists, faith groups, medics and peace and anti-war groups joining the protests. In a statement, XR said: “It is expected that thousands more ordinary citizens – with parents, builders, footballers, doctors, teachers, musicians, scientists, CEOs, farmers, with other movements aligned to the cause – will join and peacefully block more than 11 key areas until Extinction Rebellion’s demands, for truth, action and a democracy fit for purpose, are met.” A Metropolitan police spokesperson said on Monday the force was aware of the planned protests and policing would be “appropriate and proportionate”. Under XR’s plans, released on Monday, activists said they planned to block two bridges, Westminster and Lambeth, as well as several roads in and around Westminster. Animal rights activists announced last month they planned to block Smithfield Market, the biggest meat market in the UK, as part of the October protests."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI call this video here the latest attempt by warmists to assert science by public opinion (h/t  Climate Depot). Kind of like: “If we get more young people to believe it and sway public opinion in our favor, then the science will be settled. Let’s start a campaign against the skeptics, get right in their face, and call them names. Let’s be rap stars!”
What a brilliant strategy.
Unfortunately, this is how juvenile and removed from reality “climate science” has gotten. Just take a look at these idiots, thinking they’re cool:

What’s coming next? Mike Tyson climate science communication? Biting deniers’ ears off?
Got to be their latest 10:10 type-idea of “communicating the message better” to the public. These quack scientists are really in trouble. The only ones left they have a chance of convincing are kids.
We’ll gladly take this “own goal”, thank you. Are these quacks really so naive they think science gets settled by public opinion? Again Einstein, Planck, and a host of other science giants are certainly rolling in their graves.
In that video I was looking for Georg Hoffmann, the “climate scientist” who often behaves like a 6-year old, but didn’t see him. I suppose the video was even too juvenile for him.
Share this...FacebookTwitter "
"
Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst off, don’t take what this buffoon of a scientist Hoffmann says too seriously. He just serves as an example to illustrate what these self-anointed “elite climate scientists” think of people who don’t believe their junk science and believe in democracy. Some background:
Georg Hoffmann is a German nuclear physicist and worked on climate models at the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg. He then worked in Paris at the LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement) on various aspects of paleo-climatology, specialising in climate reconstructions over the last 1000 years. And last I’ve heard, he then got shipped out to some position out in the desert. Except for his rants at Scienceblog, a Google search turns up very little about any real accomplishments.
At the German Scienceblogs blogsite, Hoffmann, in his typical disdainful haughtiness, once again goes after the climate skeptics, this time using the nutty Glenn Beck in an attempt to put all skeptics in Beck’s boat. This is not the first time Hoffmann indulges in juvenile behaviour, see here. In his latest post he labels Beck as “crazy” – like Hannibal Lechter-crazy.
But first, Hoffmann tells us that skepticism “is a dangerous thing”, starting off his post with:
The so commendable ‘I don’t believe that offhand scepticism is a very dangerous thing. Skeptics of this or that easily become conspiracy theorists who are known to be only a step away from psychopathology. Being a climate skeptic is in no way a condition to put someone on this precarious level of increasing confusion, but let us say: It helps.”
In Hoffmann’s view, skeptics have the potential to become crazy, like Hannibal Lector, or Jack Nicholson in the Shining. Yes, we are probably a greater threat to society than nuclear power plants, and so Angela Merkel should shut us down too because of the unacceptable risk we pose.

Remember, Hoffmann is just one of the many Malthusian charlatans in Europe preaching a gospel produced by crystal balls and flakey climate models, who even claim they can mystically foresee the coming climate Armageddon – even 200 years into the future. (This Armageddon is of course unavoidable, unless of course we submit ourselves to their “masterplans”). These religious climate prophesiers tell us Biblical-proportion rubbish like:
– sea levels will rise meters and meters!
– species will die off like flies!
– ocean acidification will kill marine life!
– Himalayan glaciers are going to disappear by 2030!
– the Medieval Warm Period didn’t really exist!
– global temperatures likely will rise 8°C by year 2200, or more!
– coal plants are global warming death trains!
– global warming causes cooling! And so on.
Indeed it makes us wonder who really is just a step away from “psychopathology”.
Thinking he’s really clever and witty, Hoffmann rants on about Beck’s kooky antics, reminding us that the nutty Beck is a skeptic (and so skeptics are like Beck). Finally Hoffmann, who like Schellnhuber, just cannot conceal his disdain democracy, finishes with:
And everyone, everyone is allowed to vote, Beck is allowed to vote, and those who listen to him and think his analysis is interesting, they too are allowed to vote. So humanity, here is the question I ask you: Are we ready for the 21st century?”
That’s right you arrogant, intolerant agitator – WE CAN ALL VOTE.  The world is only in trouble if people listen and believe the crap you and your ilk put out. We saw what happens when a few elite masterminds with the same calibre of arrogance you display think they know what is best for everybody else.
My advice is that you start behaving like a scientist and get back to your work and do something for a change. Authoring childish provocations as you do is a disgrace to your profession. Skeptics have the democratic right to speak out and to do so without your bullying tactics.

That’s quoting Zettels Raum blog description of the deescalating situation at the Fukushima Diichi facility. Zettels Raum blog has been monitoring the Fukushima incident since the start, and reports on the latest.
Water is being pumped into the reactors with high-capacity airport fire fighting vehicles used by the military. A special piece of equipment has been flown in from the USA as well. Zettels raum writes:
Yesterday 44 fire fighting vehicles with 141 firemen arrived from Tokyo. According to the NHK , these are ‘elite units’. One of the vehicles is equipped with an unmanned extinguishing tower that is 22 meters tall and is designed to fight fires that are difficult to reach. In addition the military is using 5 extinguishing vehicles. So far today, 60,000 litres of water have been sprayed onto Block 3. The operation today will last a total of 7 hours.”
Things are getting under control there. But if you listen to the mainstream media to get the news about what is going on, you’ll quickly find yourself buying a Geiger counter, getting iodine tablets and digging a bomb shelter in your back yard. Again, it’s messy work and things don’t happen right away. On the power situation:
NISA has informed that power connections to Blocks 1, 2 , 3 and 4 will be completed on Saturday. In Blocks 5 and 6 the cooling systems have been put into operation.”
Zettels Raum also reports on radiation:
Radiation on the premises is decreasing, but is fluctuating.”
Around the atomic power plant there is a 20-km evacuation zone , and a 30-km zone in which people have been requested to stay indoors. Most measurements taken beyond these zones show higher, but not dangerous, radiation levels (between 0.0005 mSv/hr and 0.052 mSv/hr).”

"Visiting the United States, Australia’s prime minister demanded of China “participation in addressing important global environmental challenges” in light of its “new status and responsibilities”. As part of a broad call to expect more of China, the comments on environment caught attention as they were made at the time of the UN climate summit. Pointing to China’s emissions growth as an excuse for lack of climate action in Australia was in vogue a decade and longer ago. Then, China’s energy use and carbon emissions rose sharply with its investments in factories, infrastructure and housing. But things have changed in China, and there no longer is a formal distinction between climate pledges from developed and developing countries. In many regards, China’s climate action is stronger than that of Australia or America, at much lower levels of development.  Do the PM’s advisers know? An up-to-date cheat sheet would read like this. 1. China’s CO2 emissions from fossil fuels use rose by just 2% over the last five years (2013-18), with all of that growth in 2018 after a four-year hiatus. That is a stark difference to earlier: China’s CO2 output rose 25% over the five years before that, and 62% the five years before that, according to data compiled by BP. In the US, these emissions fell by 2.5% over the last five years. In Australia, emissions from fossil fuel use rose by 3.6% from 2013-18, faster than the world average of 3.2%; Australia’s overall national emissions rose by 3.9% over the five years. Australia has nothing to brag about in terms of recent emissions growth. 2. The emissions pledges under the Paris agreement do not distinguish between developed and developing countries, in contrast to the Kyoto protocol. All countries are called on to act, and the vast majority of countries have pledged to cut or limit their emissions. China has quantitative targets. The principle of “common but differentiated commitments” applies, with higher expectations placed on more developed countries, but there is no formal distinction. 3. China’s main Paris target is to reduce the ratio of energy CO2 emissions to GDP (the “emissions intensity”) by between 60-65% over the period 2005 to 2030. China’s high GDP growth rates mean that absolute emissions are nevertheless allowed to rise, as they did until 2013. But the highly intensive growth spurt has finished, and emissions are likely to start falling before 2030, China’s target year for CO2 peaking. The reduction in emissions intensity of the economy from 2005 to 2018 was 47% in China, 23% in Australia, and 25% in the United States. We are taking the carbon dioxide out of economic growth, but not nearly as quickly as China. 4. We are far richer, and have much higher emissions per person. Emissions from fossil fuel use in 2018 were 6.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita in China, 17 tonnes in Australia, 15 tonnes in the United States and 4.5 tonnes globally. With all greenhouse gas emissions included, the number for Australia is 22 tonnes per person. GDP per person per year was about US$10,000 in 2018 in China and $55,000 in Australia ($18,000 and $52,000 adjusted for purchasing power). 5. China’s government intervenes to shift to a cleaner energy, industrial and transport system. Fighting air pollution is a top priority, and that also means lower CO2 reductions. Old power stations are replaced with more efficient ones and with wind, solar and nuclear plants; the fleet-wide efficiency of coal power plants in China is now far better than that in Australia. Inefficient industrial plants are replaced with higher value-adding activities, and the share of electric vehicles is rising sharply. Investment in greener kit is massive. A national emissions trading scheme is in preparation, though direct regulation has remained the mainstay of China’s policy approach. 6. All that said, China could do much more and move more quickly towards a lower-carbon economy. Heavy industries remain the backbone of the economy in many provinces, and building new coal-fired power plants means long-term carbon liabilities. And China continues to build coal power plants in other countries under its belt-and-road program. There is massive room for improvement. China could and should strengthen its 2030 emissions target, as just about all nations should. This could well happen next year. If so, then surely Beijing will ask Canberra about their plan for stronger commitments. Lambasting China goes down well in the US. But it could be costly. Australia is on track to be seen as being in lockstep with the US not only on security and other issues but on climate change, and that could come to haunt us. It must seem like we are asking to be left behind. And if the trade wars get worse, then carbon tariffs on climate policy laggards may be on the cards too. For China, a low-carbon future is desirable not only because it limits climate change, but because it creates new high value-added industries. China is positioning to become a dominant supplier of clean technologies. It is already the largest producer of solar panels, and it sees huge opportunities in markets for advanced electricity grid equipment, batteries, electric cars and much more. Decarbonisation of energy and industrial systems has started in most countries. It is happening in Australia and in the US, though driven more by technology than by policy. The governments of China and many other countries are actively going after the opportunities. Australia should seek a big role in a global low-carbon economy. We could become an exporter of renewable energy and of energy-intensive products made from renewable power, and secure our role as an energy exporter in a world that will increasingly shun fossil fuels. To get to that position we’ll need to be seen as partners, pulling in the same direction. Throwing barbs from the sidelines won’t get us there. • Frank Jotzo is the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University"
"The forests still burn, but the world now looks away. In both the Amazon basin and the rainforests of Indonesia, the world-scorching inferno rages on, already forgotten by most of the media. Intricate living systems, species that took millions of years to evolve, are being incinerated in moments, then replaced with monocultures. Giant plumes of carbon tip us further into climate breakdown. And we’re not even talking about it.  But underneath the grief and frustration, I also feel disquiet. We rightly call on other nations to protect their stunning places. But where are our rainforests? I mean this both metaphorically and literally. Out of 218 nations, the UK ranks 189th for the intactness of its living systems. Having trashed our own wildlife, our excessive demand for meat, animal feed, timber, minerals and fossil fuels helps lay waste the rest of the world. Among our missing ecosystems are rainforests. Rainforests are not confined to the tropics: a good definition is forest wet enough to support epiphytes – plants that grow on other plants. Particularly in the west of Britain, where tiny fragments persist, you can find trees covered in rich growths of a fern called polypody, mosses and lichens, and flowering plants climbing the lower trunks. Learning that Britain is a rainforest nation astounds us only because we have so little left. We now know that, alongside keeping fossil fuels in the ground, natural climate solutions – using the mass restoration of nature to draw down carbon from the air – offer perhaps the last remaining chance to prevent more than 1.5C, or even 2C, of global heating. Saving the remaining rainforests and other rich ecosystems, while restoring those we have lost, is not just a nice idea: our lives may depend on it. But in countries like the UK, we urge others to act while overlooking our own disasters. Foreigners I meet are often flabbergasted by the state of our national parks. They see the sheepwrecked deserts and grousetrashed moors and ask: “What are you protecting here?” In the name of “cultural heritage” we allow harsh commercial interests, embedded in the modern economy but dependent on public money, to complete the kind of ecological cleansing we lament in the Amazon. Sheep farming has done for our rainforests what cattle ranching is doing to Brazil’s. Then we glorify these monocultures – the scoured, treeless hills – as “wild” and “unspoilt”. When the International Union for Conservation of Nature sought to classify our national parks, it had to invent a new category. Most of the world’s national parks are category I or II: set aside principally for nature. But all of ours are category V: places where, in practice, business comes first and nature last. Much of the land in our national parks is systematically burned. In the northern parks, this destruction is wreaked by grouse estates, and in Snowdonia by farmers. But on Dartmoor and Exmoor, the park authorities do it themselves, torching wildlife, roasting the soil, pouring carbon into the skies: everything we condemn elsewhere. The government’s new Landscapes Review is better than I expected, but its positive proposals are in no way commensurate with our ecological and climate crises. It suggests that England’s national parks and other protected landscapes should “have a renewed mission to recover and enhance nature … simply sustaining what we have is not nearly good enough”. But it does not argue that any of our parks should aim for something better than category V. Nor does it recommend that burning should cease, or that farming should withdraw from some places to allow rainforests and other rich habitats to recover. Where is the ambition our emergencies demand? We urgently need more trees, but we appear to believe that the only means of restoring them is planting. We have a national obsession with tree planting, which is in danger of becoming as tokenistic as bamboo toothbrushes and cotton tote bags. In many places rewilding, or natural regeneration – allowing trees to seed and spread themselves – is much faster and more effective, and tends to produce far richer habitats. All over the country, I see “conservation woodlands” that look nothing like ecological restoration and everything like commercial forestry: the ground blasted with glyphosate (a herbicide that kills everything), trees planted in straight rows, in plastic tree guards attached with cable ties to treated posts. It looks hideous, it takes decades to begin to resemble a natural forest and, in remote parts of the nation, it is often the primary cause of plastic litter, much of which is never recovered. There are no woodland creation grants in this country supporting natural regeneration: public money is pegged exclusively to the number of trees planted. This is one of the reasons for the shocking failure to meet the UK’s targets for new woodlands. The government should follow the hierarchical approach suggested by the conservationist Steve Jones. It should fund natural regeneration wherever possible. Where trees struggle to establish themselves, it should finance assisted regeneration (clearing competing vegetation). Only where those options won’t work should it offer grants for tree planting. But while nature loves a mess, officialdom abhors one: instead of natural exuberance it seeks neat industrial rows. Don’t expect much help from politicians. Michael Gove’s successor as environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, seems tongue-tied, apparently terrified of offending vested interests. Labour’s vote for a Green New Deal, with a 2030 deadline for decarbonisation (20 years before the government’s) is exciting. But we now need to see its commitments on industrial emissions matched by ambitious proposals for ecological restoration. Nor are the big conservation groups filling the void. Ours is an extraordinary situation: a nation of nature lovers, obsessed by wildlife programmes, represented by gigantic NGOs, but apparently incapable of preventing the precipitous decline of wildlife and habitats. The conservation groups have manifestly failed to translate our love of nature into action. They betray their radical roots. The National Trust arose from the Commons Preservation Society, that tore down fences to return land to the people. Now it allows the forces it once contested to ride roughshod over its land, allowing trail hunts and exclusive grouse shoots to erode the sense of national ownership. On its Exmoor estate, in the resource book it publishes for school teachers, it celebrates burning the land. The RSPB was founded by women seeking to ban the import of birds’ plumage for hats – they eventually succeeded. Now, as independent ecologists raise massive petitions to ban driven grouse shooting, the RSPB undermines their campaigns by calling for this devastating practice to be, er, licensed. Hesitation and appeasement reign. We should continue to mobilise against the destruction of the world’s great habitats, and its terrifying implications. But the most persuasive argument we can make is to show we mean it, by restoring our own lost wonders. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf saving the human race from the imminent climate disaster is so imperative, then why did Chancellor Angela Merkel request the immediate shut-down of CO2-saving, technically sound nuclear power plants in an area free of earthquakes or tsunamis?
Merkel suddenly decided that coal power plants emitting 4% more CO2 is no longer a problem.
Not long ago, Chancellor Merkel called climate change due to greenhouse gases emitted by man the greatest crisis facing humanity and said no efforts can be spared in drastically reducing CO2 emissions. So grave was the CO2-climate problem that a massive, society-altering $15 trillion plan was recently unveiled by Brussels, all with the target of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% over the next 40 years.
Suddenly all the imperative and urgency oc climate change gets waved aside.
Veteran author Hartmut Bachmann at Die Freie Welt has written an essay on Angela Merkel’s knee-jerk reaction in ordering the closure of 7 of Germany’s 17 reactors, in a political knee-jerk response to Fukushima. Bachmann writes:
The only energy that can really be delivered free of CO2 on a large scale was and is from nuclear power plants. But these have been ordered shut down without a single mention of  the word – the term – CO2, neither from the government nor – as is expected– from the media. And this was done without any discussion whatsoever on the consequences this would have on the government’s fight for our purported survivial against CO2. This exposes the fight against CO2 as a hoax, as a fiction, that only serves to bilk the citizens rather than serve them.”

The reactors were certified as safe just months ago
The shutdown of the seven reactors, which were deemed completely safe just a few months earlier, and so were granted extended operating times, will now result in much more coal-burning, which of course will increase Germany’s CO2 emissions by a staggering 4%.
Years of painful investment to reduce CO2 are thus being wiped out, all with the snap of a finger, by the once CO2-fearful Merkel.
One has to ask just how threatened is the human race from Co2 after all. Not very much if coal plants spewing millions of tonnes more of CO2 are even safer than allowing technically approved nuclear reactors to run – in an area that is free of tsunamis and earthquakes.

"Scott Morrison signalled that Australia is unlikely to update its emissions reduction commitments under the Paris agreement before a speech to the UN in which he declared that the media was misrepresenting the country’s climate change record. During a press conference before his UN speech at a recycling facility in Brooklyn, the prime minister said he wouldn’t characterise “misrepresentations” about Australia’s climate stance as fake news. But he suggested that negative media coverage fuelled criticism that was “completely false and completely misleading”. People expressed “prejudiced” views about Australia’s climate policy, he said – “Now where do they get their information from? Who knows, maybe they read it.” Asked whether Australia intended to update its emissions reduction commitments as required by the Paris agreement’s five-yearly review process, Morrison suggested that Australia’s 2030 target was fixed: “We are keeping to the commitments we have set and do you know why? That’s what I put to the Australian people.” The Paris global climate accord includes a five-yearly global stocktake to assess collective progress, and Morrison’s signal in the US appears at odds with advice this year from Australian officials who restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic commitments when the EU and China questioned Australia’s policies. Asked whether he would keep a commitment Australia made at the Pacific Islands Forum to develop a 2050 climate policy by next year, Morrison said: “We will assess that as we said we would do, but my priority is meeting 2020 and 2030. We will look at the broader context but, honestly, our focus is on meeting those commitments.” The forum’s communique says all parties to the Paris agreement will “formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020”. With Morrison facing criticism for failing to attend Monday’s climate action summit at the UN, and with attendees at the UN general assembly reporting that Australia is getting some negative blowback because of climate change – the prime minister sought to use his first address to the UN as leader to project a more positive message about his country’s stance. “Australia is taking real action on climate change and getting results,” he told world leaders. “We are successfully balancing our global responsibilities with sensible and practical policies to secure our environmental and economic future. “Australia’s internal and global critics on climate change willingly overlook or ignore our achievements, as the facts simply don’t fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution. Australia is responsible for just 1.3% of global emissions. Australia is doing our bit on climate change and we reject any suggestion to the contrary.” Morrison said few countries in the OECD could report to the general assembly that they had overachieved on their Kyoto commitments. He didn’t mention Australia was given special treatment in the Kyoto process – it was permitted to include carbon emissions from land clearing. He said emissions per person and the economy’s emissions intensity were at their lowest levels in 29 years. He did not tell the general assembly that emissions across the economy are rising in Australia, and have risen every year since the Coalition abolished the carbon price. Emissions in the electricity sector had fallen, he said: “In the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia’s electricity sector were 15.7% lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009.” But he did not mention that emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising, driven predominantly by an increase in liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia, and transport. Morrison also noted that while Australia was a “resource-rich country, it is important to note that Australia only accounts for around 5.5% of the world’s coal production”. After the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg used an appearance at the UN this week to excoriate the lack of action by world leaders, Morrison returned serve in the same venue. Australia’s prime minister said his view was that children had “a right not just to their future but to their optimism”. He told the general assembly he received “many letters from children in Australia concerned about their future”. “We should let our kids be kids – teenagers be teenagers – while we work positively together to deliver practical solutions for them and their future,” he said. Morrison said Australia was committed “to leading urgent action to combat plastic pollution choking our oceans; tackle overexploitation of our fisheries, prevent ocean habitat destruction and take action on climate change”. He said Australia was determined to create a “circular plastics economy”. “Recently, I announced that Australia will ban exports of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres, starting in 2020. That’s about 1.4m tonnes of potent recyclable material. “Australia is also leading on practical research and development into recycling – turning recycled plastic and glass waste into roads, manufacturing 100% recycled PET bottles and capturing methane and waste to create energy. “New technologies are coming on line with the potential to recycle used plastics into valuable new plastics – creating a circular plastics economy.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said Australia would invest $167m in a domestic recycling plan and create the right investment environment so that new technologies were commercialised, “preventing pollution entering our oceans, and creating valuable new products”. The prime minister also restated that Australia would be investing in climate actions through the aid budget in its region rather than through the UN climate fund. He rejected a view expressed this week by the UN’s chief, António Guterres, who warned the 74th general assembly that the world faced a “great fracture”, with the countries at risk of cleaving between the US and China. Australia would resist the path of “binary choices”, Morrison said. “Approaching its 75th anniversary next year, the UN must reform and evolve to respond effectively to the challenges of the 21st century, and to fulfil its core mandate, the UN must be ever mindful of the principles and values that have always been foundational to the UN’s efforts.” He said the UN was founded on liberal democratic principles: “We believe they should remain the guiding principles for the UN into the future.”"

Imagine if the Wright Brothers had abandoned flight after the first mishap, only listening to the voices of fear that heavy objects have no place in the air and that it isn’t possible to eliminate accidents? Imagine if society had abandoned the automobile after the first deadly accident? Imagine if early doctors had been prevented from attempting surgery on a seriously ill person. Of course, if humans had given up after every failure, we’d still be in the Stone Ages – if not extinct.
Japan’s disaster will provide valuable lessons learned
I believe the disaster in Japan will act as a blessing is disguise. I say this because many lessons will be learned from this incident. This is not to say we are pleased about any injury or death resulting there – that’s tragic. I’m saying we have the chance to learn from it. It’s already quite impressive that the Fukushima facility survived the 9.0 mega-earthquake and was done in only by the ensuing mega-tsunami. Fukushima was subjected to an extreme natural event and the results will lead to many valuable findings. It’s up to us if they will be applied to future power plants. It’s a chance to improve our lives.
China and applying lessons learned
China has announced it will put its plans to build new nuclear facilities on hold for now. This in no way means China is abandoning its ambitious plan to build nuclear power plants. Indeed it is going to pause and take a look at what went wrong at Fukushima, and then apply the lessons learned to its own plants, making them more sound, and equipped with better and even more reliable redundant safety systems. The result: China’s nuclear power plants of the future will be even safer, more modern and thus will end up saving many lives with the reliable supply of electricity they will provide.
China’s bold electrical energy plan: 200 reactors
Along with 2000 coal-fired power plants, with each one getting more modern, China will also add a huge number of nuclear reactors to its energy supply infrastructure over the next 2 decades. Already China is currently constructing 27 reactors, another 50 have been approved and funded, and a whopping 110 additional reactors are proposed. China today is already the number 2 economy globally. With addition of hundreds of power plants, China will surely be the powerhouse of the future. That does not come from being chicken with small risks, but from boldness and belief in huge technological progress.
Some western countries are abandoning development
Many western countries, on the other hand are taking the opposite approach. Instead applying lessons learned, they are moving back to the Dark Ages, when energy was harnessed from the wind or direct sunlight, where the energy yield per square meter is in the range of watts, and not kilowatts or megawatts. Oil is being abandoned, so is coal – and now nuclear.
The west reacts with fear and hysteria

The accident in Japan did not lead Germany to examine what went wrong and to attempt applying lessons learned to improve safety and reliability at its own reactors, rather it has decided, in a fit panic and hysteria, to abandon the technology altogether and relinquish it to other competing countries. No othe rcountry has reacted so rashly. Physicist Dr. Peter Heller at Science Skeptical explains why:
There were times in history when ignorance and cowardice overshadowed human life. It was a time when our ancestors were forced to lead a life filled with superstition and fear because they were forbidden to use their creativity and fantasy. Religious dogma, like the earth being the centre of the unverse, or creationism, forbade people to question. The forbiddance of opening a human body and examining it prevented questions from being answered. Today these Medieval rules appear to us as backwards and close-minded. We simply cannot imagine this way of thinking having any acceptance.
Unfortunately today, they do. It is well-documented in nuclear and climate science.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s response to Fuskushima? She blinked, panicked and immediately shut down 7 of Germany’s nuclear reactors, and then announced an accelerated shut down of nuclear energy in Germany overall. I’m not aware of earthquake-prone Japan even shutting down its other nuclear reactors. Such actions are undertaken only by hysterical minds.
Superstition and prophesies of disaster pervade
Today in modern Germany, and in many western countries, phony catastrophe scenarios, both in nuclear science and climate science, are being served up as science when in fact they are pure dogma – i.e. gross departures of science – and are solely intended to spread fear. We are discouraged from asking questions; we are told to believe the “experts”. Do not dare to ask questions.
Religion in technology
The media and anti-nuclear technology activists are now applying religious terms to describe the Fukushima disaster: Armegeddon, mega-disaster, catastrophe, etc. Some have even attempted to connect the earthquake and tsunami to climate change, caused by man’s activity, without producing an iota of data to support this. Like God’s wrath on man in the Bible, it’s Nature’s wrath on man. Nuclear power has been branded as evil, although it has a very high level of safety in almost every country where it is used.
Sure there will be accidents and mishaps, but they will become rarer and smaller, and the benefits will far outweigh them. Just like all other technical products and systems.
Heller ends his essay:
I am a physicist. I’d like to live in a world that is willing to learn and to improve whatever is good. I would only like to live in a world where great strides in physics are viewed with fascination, pride and hope because they show us the way to a better future. I would only like to live in a world that has the courage for a better world. Any other world for me is unacceptable. Never. That’s why I am going to fight for this world, without ever relenting.
I agree with Dr. Heller and he has plenty of company. There are many out there who share his view. As dogma, fear, superstition take hold and western society slips backwards into dark times, more and more on Heller’s side will make their voices heard.

"Scott Morrison has responded to an impassioned speech by the Swedish teenage climate activistGreta Thunberg at the United Nations by declaring the climate change debate is subjecting Australian children to “needless anxiety”. The Australian prime minister, who will address environmental themes in his address to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, including ocean management, plastics, waste management and illegal fishing, was asked for his response to Thunberg’s excoriation of world leaders at this week’s climate action summit, when she accused the political class of failing the younger generations. Morrison told reporters he acknowledged “how deeply people feel about this issue” but said the public debate was replete with disinformation about Australia’s climate change policies. “It often comes as news to people when I share with them Australia has the highest per capita investment in renewable energy of any country in the world,” Morrison said – in the process neglecting to mention that his predecessor Tony Abbott had tried to wind back the renewable energy target, which triggered an investment strike. Morrison said he would use his looming address to the UN – his final public commitment before leaving New York for Australia on Wednesday – to address the lack of awareness about “the action Australia has been taking”. “I do understand that people feel strongly about this, but I think we also have to take stock, we have to ensure we get a proper context and perspective,” Morrison said. “I want children growing up in Australia to feel positive about their future, and I think it is important we give them that confidence that they will not only have a wonderful country and pristine environment to live in, that they will also have an economy to live in as well. “I don’t want our children to have anxieties about these issues.” Asked whether Australian children would be less anxious about the worst-case scenarios associated with climate change if Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were falling instead of rising, and if the Morrison government would make a clear commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said kids needed to be given “context and perspective”. He acknowledged that he spoke to his own daughters, aged 10 and 12, about climate change. “We don’t have deep conversations about emissions reduction targets and what’s happening with the Kyoto protocol and Paris, but we talk about fossil fuels and we talk about what they learn at school, and I encourage them to have a passionate independent view about how they see the world, but I also give them a lot of context. “I don’t allow them to be basically contorted into one particular view. I like them to make up their own mind but I also like to give them reassurance because the worst thing I would impose on any child is needless anxiety. They’ve got enough things to be anxious about. “We’ve got to let kids be kids. We can’t have them growing up as mushrooms, but we’ve got to get a bit of context into this.” Morrison said being present at the United Nations should also serve as a reminder that the world was fully capable of solving vexed problems and responding to existential threats. “Australia has dealt with so many issues in the past, and the world has dealt with so many difficult issues in the past, and here [at the UN in New York], we are reminded of that.” Australian observers in New York have told Guardian Australia Morrison’s failure to attend a UN climate action summit on Monday despite being in the US, and his apparent rejection of the need for Australia to do more to address its rising greenhouse gas emissions, had eroded goodwill for the country on the issue. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist of Climate Analytics and a longtime adviser to countries at climate talks, has dismissed Morrison’s argument this week that China had to be treated as a developed  economy in the context of climate change and embark on more ambitious emissions reduction as a “ridiculous fake argument”. Hare said China, the world’s most populous country and biggest annual polluter, was not doing anywhere near enough to tackle the crisis, but was doing more than Australia on many measures. It had national policies in a number of areas – boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles and efficiency in industry – where Australia did not. Greenhouse gas emissions have been rising in Australia since the Coalition repealed Labor’s carbon price despite the country’s commitments to reduce pollution under the Paris agreement. Total national emissions have increased each year since 2014. The government says it will meet the commitments made under the Paris agreement, but its carbon pollution roadmap for doing so shows Australia is relying on a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet the 2030 target. The indicative roadmap for emissions reductions to 2030 includes an electric vehicle strategy that the government has not yet unveiled, and the government has also booked just under 100Mt of abatement to “technology solutions” that are not specified. Morrison signed a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum that included a commitment to “formulate and communicate mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020” – but asked this week whether he would deliver on that undertaking, the prime minister hedged. Renewables have boomed after rebounding from the Abbott government’s efforts to dismantle the renewable energy target, but a recent forecast from the industry warned that investment has slowed right down in the absence of policy certainty in climate and energy. The Coalition abandoned a key policy mechanism for the electricity sector – the national energy guarantee – in the middle of the conservative-led strike on Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership. The forecast from the Clean Energy Council says the large-scale RET, which winds down after 2020, led to 15,700MW of new capacity being financially committed over the past two years, with that generation either under construction or recently commissioned. “But with the absence of policy certainty beyond the 2020 RET and a range of regulatory barriers to overcome, investment commitments in new generation have fallen dramatically this year,” it said. “Quarterly investment commitments in new renewable energy projects reached a high of over 4500MW in late 2018, but has since collapsed to less than 800MW in each of the first two quarters of 2019.”"

My last article, Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real (But It’s Not From CO2, contained the statement: “No one (to my knowledge) has researched what part of the global temperature rise is due to energy use. All energy use ultimately goes to heat. This is what causes the heat islands.” This raised eyebrows in at least one reader, who commented, to paraphrase, that in his opinion, heat islands were caused by solar energy acting on and with the structures in the city, pavements, buildings, etc. The answer is: both solar and anthropogenic heat contribute to heat islands.
There have been studies done on some towns and cities. I cited the study done on Barrow, Alaska in A Light In Siberia. The heat island there is 2.2°C in winter when there is no sunlight at Barrow’s latitude north of the Arctic Circle. At Barrow, it is clear that the heat island is due to the fuel used to heat the village. To quote from that study, “There was a strong positive relation between monthly UHI magnitude and natural gas production/use. Integrated over the period September–May.”
Fairbanks, Alaska, has also been studied for heat island. There, the heat island was shown to grow with increasing population over the 50 year time period from 1949 to 1999. The temperature difference at the end of this period was 1°C in mid-winter at Fairbanks airport, 7 kilometers from downtown, compared to Eielson Air Force Base, about 40 kilometers away, and nil in the summer. Again, as Fairbanks is nearly at the Arctic Circle, solar heating cannot be the cause.
What about heat islands further south? This author has lived in the Pacific Northwest of the US for most of his life, the last 50 years in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. In winter, there have been several hundred occasions when it was raining in the downtown areas, and snowing in the suburbs or surrounding rural areas. These cities are well known for cloudy and rainy climate, especially in the winter, when the sun may not shine for months at a time. These winter heat islands cannot be solar caused.
In Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real, the article stated that the U. S. used 29 PetaWattHours of energy in 2005. This is from all sources: fossil fuels, hydroelectric, wood, solar, wind-turbines, and pedal-power included. The last three contributed insignificantly, so can be ignored. The total land area of the contiguous 48 states is just over 8 million square kilometers. In 2002, urban area was less that 3% of the land area, or 240,000 km2 and 79% of the population lived in these urban areas. If each person consumes roughly the same amount of energy, then roughly 23 PetaWattHours was used in less than 240,000 km2, or almost 1010 WattHours per square kilometer, or 100 kilowatthours per square meter annually in urban areas. This is 6.1% of the sun’s energy on that same square meter. This will raise the temperature in that square meter by 17.4°C.
This figure seems a little high, as it is more than the NASA heat images reveal (10 to 15°C), and more than most studies have stated. This is probably because more energy is consumed between urban areas, for transportation (jet fuel, long-haul trucks, auto travel), farm energy use, electricity transport losses, and losses from the wind simply blowing it away to the rest of the northern hemisphere. But it does indicate that energy use heating may be the large factor in urban warming.

But what about the city structure itself absorbing solar energy and providing it back to the environment? This undoubtedly happens. The ability of a land surface to reflect solar energy is called albedo. The scale is zero for no reflectance, or complete absorbance, to 1 for perfect reflection. Lamp-black has an albedo of nearly zero, and fresh fallen powder snow has an albedo of nearly 1. Cities are fairly dark because asphalt city streets and parking lots, along with most roofing materials, are a large percentage of the surface. Most cities have an albedo of between 0.1 and 0.2. The average albedo of the earth is between 0.29 and 0.35, but it varies widely from about 0.9 or more for Antarctica and Greenland, to 0.2 for forests and vegetated areas. Deserts and dry grasslands have an albedo of 0.4 to 0.5. The oceans have an albedo of less than 0.1.

Figure 1. Terrestrial earth albedo. Source: NASA Earth Observatory, http://www.eoearth.org/article/Albedo?topic=54300
A city with an urban core that has an albedo of less than 0.2, surrounded by desert or grasslands with an albedo of 0.4 to 0.5, will be warmer than the surrounding area because it absorbs more solar radiation. Any heat energy produced by the population will simply add slightly to that heat. Examples would be Phoenix, Arizona or Cairo, Egypt.
There is a study that compared energy use and albedo for several cities. The link is below. If a city is mostly light colored concrete, with an albedo of 0.2, and is surrounded by suburbs with green lawns and asphalt streets, with an albedo of 0.11 to 0.16, the city core may be cooler than the surrounding area because the city core reflects more heat than the darker surroundings. An example would be Los Angeles, California.
Cities north of about 45° latitude, such as New York City, Montreal, Moscow, and of course Fairbanks and Barrow Alaska, will tend to have more anthropogenic heat than solar heat. Cities south of that line will tend to solar heating. A compact city will have more anthropogenic heat than one that is spread out because the anthropogenic heat will warm a smaller area. Again, New York City, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and Moscow, Russia, are good examples of compact cities with extreme heat islands driven by energy consumption. St. Louis, Missouri, USA and Berlin, Germany are the opposite examples with heat islands that are predominately driven by the sun. A city’s location, days of sunshine, density, and the character of the structures, will define whether the heat island is predominately caused by the sun or by the people.
One of the commenters on Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real…wanted an explanation on why some urban surface stations show a cooling trend. The answer lies in the local trends in albedo. If cities or regions get lighter, (white concrete streets replacing asphalt, increasing numbers of white sheet metal, or white painted roofs replacing tarred or composition roofs, increasing parks and open spaces, etc.) conditions would favor declining temperatures. A recent paper about land use changes in Spain cites an example where greenhouse horticulture in the southeastern part of the country changed the albedo locally by +0.09 changing the local temperature trend to –0.3°C/decade. Changes in land use, population density, vegetation, or even changes in local building codes may change the local albedo and change the trend in temperature. Very small changes in local albedo will lead to noticeable changes in local temperature trends.
Temperature change driven by urban warming or cooling, and albedo changes are what makes the total global surface temperature trend so maddingly difficult to ascertain. In the absence of man’s influence on albedo or burning of fossil fuel (ignoring any possible CO2 influence), the earth may be warming, or it may be cooling. We simply do not know. Albedo changes and energy use are masking the truth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel has a report here today on what an accelerated shutdown of all 17 German nuclear reactors by 2020 would mean.
Germany was spooked by the nuclear disaster in Japan, all fueled by turbo-hysteria from its media. In a knee-jerk reaction, unmatched by no other country in the world, Angela Merkel’s coalition government ordered 7 of the country’s reactors be shut down immediately. Now activists are demanding the shutdown of all reactors.
This, of course, is easier said than done. Who or what would step in to fill in the 20.8 gigawatt gap?
Half of Germany covered by solar panels
In a nutshell, this would be horribly expensive, and ugly. Der Spiegel looks at what Germany would look like if it converted over to mainly renewables such as solar, wind and biogas by 2020 in place of the nuclear reactors. This is how Der Spiegel describes it:
The dream of a rapid shutdown of nuclear reactors is technically possible. But it would have a high price.
First of all it would profoundly alter the landscape of Germany.
In the 2020 scenario, the current status quo of wind and solar would be multiplied many times over: 46 gigawatts of wind energy, 52 gigawatts of photovoltaic and 8 gigawatts of biomass – quasi half of Germany would be paved with solar panels. Huge rotors would litter the landscape. On fields, there would be a questionable monoculture of bioenergy plants.”
So why does all this massive government intervention and state-controlled energy remind us of Soviet style central-panning? The consequences certainly threaten to be the same: an abject failure and bankruptcy.
Not only would this trash and ruin Germany’s once idyllic countryside, but it would probably bankrupt he country too. According to Der Spiegel stopping nuclear and switching over to  a hodge-podge of unsteady renewables would first require an investment of € 245 billion just to build up the needed equipment and infrastructure. Then consumers would also have to bear much higher electricity rates.
Lack of acceptance

Der Spiegel also looks at the problem of dwindling acceptance of renewable energy due to consumers’ displeasure with their rising electric bills and the scourge to the landscape they represent. Der Spiegel:
Indeed large wind turbines are again and agin met with fierce protest. And even the most green-blooded environmentalists fly into rages because of the growing corn monoculture.
Windmills and solar systems have short lifetimes
Unfortunately, Der Spiegel and the eco-masterminds also seem to have failed to notice another costly factor: operating lifetimes. While lifetimes of 40 years are not uncommon for coal and nuclear power plants, they are much shorter for renewable energy systems. 20 years is already a pipe dream.
This all means everything would have to be replaced soon, and again at a huge cost. Let’s not forget the higher maintenance costs as well.
Back to 200 years ago
But costs have never discouraged the eco-masterminds in their pursuit of their goals. People can be brainwashed into accepting them, at least that’s what Michael Sterner, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy Systems Technology (IWES) and advisor to the federal government, seems to think:
The acceptance for renewable energy must be urgently increased. Because of climate change, resource shortages and the atomic catastrophe, people have to be made aware that our energy supply system must return back above ground – just like it always was 200 years ago.”
The irony of the Japan earthquake is that in the end Germany may be the country that winds up with the most damage. Not because of the tsunami per se, but because of a tsunami of technical and economic blindness.
200 years back? That would be about right.
==============================================
UPDATE: I’d also like to remind the taxpayer-subsidised Fraunhofer Institute how energy needs were met 200 years ago. Have they ever wondered what happened to all of Europe’s forests back then?

"David Attenborough has criticised the Morrison government’s record on climate policy and support for new coalmines. In an interview that will air on Triple J’s Hack on Tuesday, the celebrated broadcaster and natural historian also said visiting coral reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, that have bleached due to warming oceans is “a tragic sight”.  Attenborough told the program that previous Australian governments had been “saying all the right things” on climate policy but this had changed. “You are the keepers of an extraordinary section of the surface of this planet, including the Barrier Reef, and what you say, what you do, really, really matters. “And when you’ve been upstanding and talking about what I see as the truth and and you suddenly say, ‘No it doesn’t matter ... it doesn’t matter how much coal we burn ... we don’t give a damn what it does to the rest of the world.” Attenborough also criticised then treasurer Scott Morrison for bringing a lump of coal to question time in 2017. “I don’t think it was a joke,” he said. “If you weren’t opening a coalmine OK I would agree, it’s a joke. But you are opening a coalmine.”  The conservationist said politicians are capable of building support for stronger action on the climate crisis by appealing “to what people think is right”. “Do you think it’s right that we go on destroying the natural world?” he said. He also said there was an economic advantage in taking more urgent action on global heating because businesses and the finance sector will be exposed to greater financial risk if the world doesn’t move quickly enough. In July this year, Attenborough told a UK parliamentary committee that the Great Barrier Reef was the starkest example of climate change’s impact that he had seen. He also told the parliament that Australia was an “extraordinary” example of a country where climate deniers remained in parliament despite the country facing some of the worst effects of global heating. In the interview with Hack, Attenborough said “a bleached reef is a tragic sight”. “A desperately tragic sight, particularly if you’ve seen it before, and you know what it could have been like.” The full interview is on Hack on Tuesday from 5.30pm and the ABC’s 7.30 program."

Politics the Chicago-way is not exclusive to Chicago.
This is the table where deals are made. “Cheers to helping me out”.
Obama meets with Internet and Technology executives. (Photo source: White House release, by Pete Souza)
 You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours. Corporations don’t make big changes in business plans and policy unless there are very promising incentives to do so. And the President of the United States is someone who is fully capable of delivering such incentives.
Is this really about creating jobs? A little. But anyone can tell you that the CEOs attending this dinner are capable of only creating so many jobs – a number that wouldn’t even change the US unemployment statistics.
Everyone also knows that most jobs get created by the small to medium-size companies. Give small business some incentives, and watch the economy take off. Yet, no one was there at the dinner to represent them.
Small and medium-size business are being ignored. And we already know how strained the relations between the representative of the these businesses, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Obama Administration are. I’d have to conclude that this meeting was not really about jobs, but about how to win next year’s election, and how to turn the tide of politics back to where it was 2 years ago.
One important way to do this would be to take stronger control over the internet. Doing this by law would backfire, of course. So just let the companies do the dirty work for you.
Take a look at some of the persons in attendence:

Eric Schmidt, Google
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
Dick Costolo, Twitter
Carol Bartz, Yahoo!
Steve Jobs, Apple
John Chambers, Cisco Systems
Larry Ellison, Oracle
Reed Hastings, CEO, NetFlix

Although these people won’t be able to create enough jobs to solve USA’s economic crisis, they are capable of rescuing Obama’s presidency with lots of money and assisting in providing “better communication” to the public. Again, it makes me nervous. Obama is fighting a war not in Iraq or Afghanistan, but at home.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back Steve Goddard was looking at unusual extreme events that occurred – back in the days when CO2 was at benign levels and the weather was supposedly always “normal”. Here’s another one. Anton Yevseyev of the Pravda.Ru news wrote about rare twisters hitting Russia. Though the main part of his report is about twisters that hit in 1984, he mentions one that hit way back in 1904 as well.
He writes:
The most destructive twister occurred in Central Russia in 1904   The twister appeared near Moscow, destroyed two villages and then ravaged the city itself. Over 100 people were killed and over 200 were wounded.”
Imagine the media if something like this happened today. More on the 1904 twister can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1904_Moscow_tornado. Yevseyev reminds us that twisters are not only confined to the American Midwest and South:
This natural disaster is most common for the south of the United States. However, twisters and tornadoes can appear anywhere in the world. The most important condition for them to appear is the presence of the so-called active convection zone in the atmosphere. Most frequently, twisters appear during warm seasons, in the afternoon from 3 to 6 o’clock amid thunder clouds of cold fronts and ahead of them. If a cold front arrives to a warm location, a twister is very likely to appear.
80 years later, in 1984, more twisters hit Russia, but killing fewer people – at least according to the Soviets. Yevseyev writes:
Twenty-seven years ago, on June 9, 1984, three fierce twisters struck several regions in the center of Russia. Such natural disasters have never occurred in Russia before. The unusual natural disaster, which ravaged Russia in 1984, killed 69 people. Fifty-seven of them died in Ivanovo. As many as 804 people were injured. However, one should not trust the Soviet statistics if it goes about catastrophes. The Soviet authorities preferred not to say anything about them at all.
Can’t only not trust the Soviets. The same brand of information politics is also practiced in much of the western media and at GISS. They also prefer not to say certain things.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new book written by University of Konstanz Professor Gerd Ganteför is now being released by science publisher Wiley VCH: Klima – der Weltuntergang findet nicht statt (Climate – The End of the World Called Off).
Although Ganteför is a warmist, he dismisses the notion that a climate catastrophe is coming, and even adds that warming will bring advantages. This sort of optimism has sparked an angry response from the forces of German doom and gloom. The following clip is an interview of Professor Ganteför (in German).

At the start of the clip the interviewer asks Ganteför (right), with amazement: “The climate catastrophe is everywhere in the media, it really isn’t going to take place?” Ganteför responds:
Yeah, I’m really sorry about that, but the end of the world is not going to take place. Indeed we are going to have a warming, there’s going to be drought, there are going to be heavy rains, there’s going to be sea level rise, but these floods will be within the normal range of variation. Normal when you look at what happened over the last 2000 years. At the North Sea coast there have been large floods every 20 years, and it is not going to get any worse or better than what humans have experienced before.”
This kind of optimism and realism of course contrasts starkly with the dark images of catastrophe that get delivered by the crystal balls of AGW fortune tellers. For example, Ganteför’s realism has infuriated the catastrophe-obsessed cultists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PIK, who have since blasted Prof. Ganteför’s book, see Stefan Rahmstorf’s web blog of doom and pessimism Klimalounge.
Klimalounge wasted no time and spared few words in deriding Ganteför’s book, credentials and optimism, saying that he’s not a climate scientist and that any respectable publisher would have refused publishing such a work. Ganteför is just the latest enemy on the PIK’s ever growing blacklist.

Ganteför does not dispute that CO2 is causing warming, but adds:
This warming is neither worse nor better than the warming we’ve had in the past. There has always been climate change in the past. Two hundred years ago there was the Little Ice Age. This caused a lot of hardship for the people back then – with widespread hunger, bad harvests and so on. Back then we had a natural climate change that was negative. Now we are causing a positive climate change. If we didn’t do that, then it would probably get cooler, as we are scheduled for an ice age.”
I’m not sure about CO2 preventing an ice age, but I do get a kick out of the PIK when they claim we’re headed for the opposite kind of catastrophe. Both of these views are wild.
The book is also featured at: Readers Edition, which writes on how the book looks at three main topics:
Topic I: For environmental protection, the standard of living in undeveloped countries has to be improved. To achieve this, modern coal and nuclear power plants are necessary.
Topic II: The consequences of climate warming are not catastrophic, and even bring some benefits.
TpoicIII: The following should be supported to have climate protection: low-emission coal plants, modern nuclear power, wind energy, geo-thermal and nuclear fusion. Subsidies for bio-fuels, wood pellets and solar energy cause more bad than good.
Ganteför’s book is the latest in the starting and growing trend of seeing global warming as positive. Late last year, German news magazine FOCUS had a special called:
Global Warming Is Good For Us, 
which concludes warming has many positive benefits. Then a short time ago a German YouTube video parody featuring Jürgen Klimann appeared – asking where’s the climate change? And says warmth would be a welcome alternative to Germany’s otherwise gray, dreary and cool weather.
So maybe a little sanity and optimism is returning to Germany.

ARD public television is Germany’s flagship news channel which broadcasts its “Tagesschau” news at the prime-time slot of 8 p.m. You can compare it to the BBC News (unfortunately its reputation is following the same path).
It’s no secret that the German media has über-hyped the news in Japan in order to über-dramatize the nuclear power plant accident. So dramatic was the response to the incident in Japan that Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered the immediate shutdown of 7 of Germany’s older reactors in order to restore some semblance of calm among Germany’s freaked out population.
As an example of the media’s reckless reporting, Zettels Raum blog here brings our attention to 14 factual errors made in the ARD news last Thursday evening. Zettels Raum writes:
You will probably not want to believe what you are about to read, but it is the truth: In itsPrime-time newscast yesterday at 8 pm, the “Tageschau” reported 2:30 min on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. In these two and half minutes, there were 14 factual errors.”
The Zettels Raum author then lists all 14 errors and corrects them. As a whole, the entire ARD report was what Germans would call a media GAU (huge media meltdown). Of course all the errors, every one of them, served to exaggerate and over-dramatize the situation. I’ll now describe briefly each error.
Error 1: ARD claimed the military used water cannons and helicopters to cool the reactor, when in fact the water cannons were used by the police, and the military used helicopters of the fire department of a military base.
Error 2: ARD claimed that personnel risked their lives. Zettels Raum calls this claim “absurd”, saying that the guidelines for exposure to radiation by workers were fully adhered to.
Error 3:ARD claimed the radiation in the area had increased sharply, when in fact the radiation had dropped from 3. 8 mSv/h to 1.6 mSv/hr.
Error 4:ARD claimed that a video had been published in the Internet showing the destruction, when in fact the video was news footage from an NHK program.
Error 5: ARD claimed that the helicopter that made the video “flew over the reactor grounds,” when in fact  it was 30 km away.
Error 6: ARD claimed that the army way trying to prevent a reactor meltdown, when in fact the risk of such had not been in existence for days. The real concern were for the used fuel rods that were outside of the reactor.

Error 7 and 8: ARD claimed attempts by helicopters and water cannons to cool the reactors were interrupted and so precious time was being lost in the fight against a nuclear catastrophe, when in fact the water cannons were replaced by the more powerful fire-fighting vehicles of the military, and the claim that “precious time was being lost” was freely fabricated by ARD.
Error 9: ARD claimed that there was a hydrogen explosion at the building, in Block 3 an explosion in the building, when in fact the explosions did not occur once “at” and once “in” the building, but with both blocks in the reactor building.
Error 10:ARD claimed that the fuel rods had been exposed at times and that there was an explosion in Block 2 that may have damaged the reactor core and that after a fire the fuel rods were exposed and could not be cooled. But in fact, Zettels Raum blog writes:
A connection between the fire (likely burning lubrication oil) and exposed fuel elements is not known up to now. The elements are no longer suffciently covered by water because the pumps didn’t function, and the water in all cooling ponds – whether there was a fire or not – had evaporated.”
Error 11:And so, ARD claimed that the exposed fuel rods would eventually heat up to the point they would melt,  penetrate the concerte reactor encasing and eventually reach the earth and then radioactively contaminate the groundwater. Zettels Raum calls this claim: “one of the most absurd errors in this “Tagesschau” report, saying reactors 1-3  had long since ben cooled and that reactor 4 had not been in operation and thus no heating to lead to such a scenario.
Error 12: ARD claimed that experts were working feverishly to lay an emergency power supply line to the power plant in order to switch on the cooling system, when in fact it wasn’t an emergency power supply, but a line to the ordinary ordinary high voltage power grid.
Error 13: ARD claimed that line would be finished earliest on Friday, and that it was unknown whether or not the cooling unit would even switch on. At this point German viewers were probably biting their fingers off. But the fact was that it was already Friday in Japan – 4 a.m. – when the ARD report was being aired. So there was no way for the line to be finished on Thursday or earlier.
Error 14: How the ARD knew that it is”unknown” whether it would function is their “secret”. Of course pumps can be repaired and put back into operation. But you need power to do this.
Zettels Raum concludes as follows:
Is that only a mess, sloppiness or pure ignorance? Or is it political agitation? What is obvious, in any case, is that all the errors were made without exception in a way that exaggerated the actual damage and actual danger. If this were simply sloppiness, one would then expect some errors to be made in the other direction too.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere is no energy shortage. What we have is a shortage of energy that we are ALLOWED to be used.
The list of energies we are allowed to use just keeps getting shorter. Techno-politico elitists are busily crossing out everything on the list, like coal, nuclear, all petroleum products, wood, and biofuels. The latest to join that list is the hope of the future: natural gas, this according to the The Hill blogsite here.
Recently there has been a flurry of reports of huge natural gas reserves in shale formations that are abundant enough to supply the world’s energy needs for decades, read here.
The Hill has posted a draft of a new study from scientists at Cornell University that concludes that natural gas mined by using hydraulic fracturing is even more dangerous than burning coal due to high fugitive methane emissions. The study will appear in the “Climatic Change Letters“.
Natural gas-fired power plants were once viewed as the ideal supplement to balance out the irregular supply of wind and solar energy. Coal and nuclear power plants are unable to react quickly enough to fluctuations in supply and demand. The Hill has posted the entire paper – here’s the abstract:
Abstract:
We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30% more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured — as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids — and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.”
No problem, let’s just set up more windmills, enviro-nutjobs and kooks may say. But these plants, aside from their technical problems, are now facing grassroots opposition as well.
This is where we stand today. We are literally standing on huge reserves of cheap natural energies, just waiting to be taken, yet some zealot, power-mad earth-nannies, armed with nothing more than climate change wive tales, are telling us we have to go without.

"Million-year-old ice buried deep in Antarctica could hold crucial information about the planet’s past and help climate predictions. And scientists with the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) are a step closer to unearthing it.   On Monday, they unveiled a drill designed to reach three kilometres below the surface of the frozen continent. “What we’re embarking on over the next few years is to solve one of the last great problems in climate science,” glaciologist Tas van Ommen said. The ice, believed to be up to 1.5m years old, is the target of several international research projects. “We’ll see in the ice, tiny bubbles that are trapped between snowflakes in the ice as it gets buried,” van Ommen said. “These tiny bubbles are time capsules of past atmosphere. “We want to get that ice, analyse those time capsules and understand what [carbon dioxide] did in that period around one million years ago when the climate was changing.” About 1 million years ago the Earth shifted from a 40,000-year ice age cycle to a 100,000-year cycle, van Ommen said. “[Carbon dioxide] is tied up in that change and it changes the rate at which ice ages have worked in the past,” he added. “We need to understand if the CO2 we put in the atmosphere will have long-term consequences for the Earth in the future.” The drill, made from stainless steel, aluminium bronze and titanium, is a mix of international and Australian technology and can withstand -55C. But reaching the buried ice won’t be a quick, or easy, feat. Drilling is expected to begin in 2021 and take four years in total.  A mobile 500-tonne base will take equipment to the work site, 1,200km inland from Antarctica’s coast.  “We are sending men and women into the most remote extreme environment on earth,” AAD director, Kim Ellis, said. “It’s a really challenging adventure.”"

Can we provide enough energy to power the world using alternative sources, such as wind, solar, or bio-fuels?
This is a question that has largely been ignored, in hopes that the answer will prove to be in the positive. This article is the first in a series, taking the question one technology at a time.


Figure 1. Solucar PS10 solar concentrator power plant near Seville, Spain. Source: Wikipedia Commons

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg
Four problems with wind and solar power are: the area needed for the plants, energy storage when the wind or the sun is not available, transmission costs, and energy losses in storage and transmission. For solar power in the U. S., the power is available in the southwest of the country, and the power is needed in the northeast. In Europe, sunshine is abundant in Spain, but not so much in Germany. In general, environmentalists oppose additional transmission lines nearly everywhere. But let us assume that the transmission problem is solved. Is there enough area to collect sunlight to support all the energy needs? Let us take the area where this author lives as an example.
New Mexico – area 314,460 km2 – insolation 7 kWh/m2/day
Not all of the area is usable. Mountains, forest, wilderness, National Monuments, farm and urban areas, military training areas, bombing and missile ranges, are off limits. Perhaps 10% of the land area might be available for solar if all the ranchers are bought off and the environmentalists are bound and gagged. That likelihood seems very remote, considering that every patch of sagebrush seems to harbor an endangered lizard. (In California the animal holding up solar plants is the Desert Tortoise).

The power available on 10% of the area of New Mexico is:
31,446,000,000 m2 X 7 kWh/m2 X 365 = 80,344,530,000,000 kWh or 80.345 PetaWatthours (PWh)
This sounds like plenty of energy. The U. S. currently uses about 30 PWh per year. But there are problems. This figure is for a two-axis solar concentrator if it runs at 100% efficiency. The real efficiency of a solar thermal plant is in the range of 8 to 15%, about the same as photovoltaic panels. The Sierra SunTower plant in Lancaster California generates 5 MW peak, with no thermal storage, occupies 20 acres of land, about 81,000 m2, or about 62 W/m2. It is in a zone with 7 to 8 kWh of solar radiation available. That is an efficiency of about 8%. The Andasol 1 and 2 plants in Spain claim 15% annual average efficiency with 8 hours of thermal storage.
So, using the above efficiency figures, 10% of the area of New Mexico would supply 6 to 12 PWh of electricity or 20 to 40% of the energy needed for the US. We would need to build the same number of plants in at two or three more states, California, Nevada, and Arizona would be candidates.
Storing the heat for use at night is the next biggest problem. With current technology the most efficient thermal storage (molten salt) stores heat for about 8 hours. The salt used is a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate (fertilizer). It takes about 28,000 metric tonnes of salt to support the Andasol 1 plant for 8 hours of heat storage. Sodium and potassium nitrate are also known as saltpeter, the oxygen source in gunpowder. Now visualize a terrorist-driven airliner full of jet fuel (the carbon source) crashing into the storage tanks at one of these plants. It would be the equivalent of a small tactical nuclear bomb.
The total world production last year for nitrate fertilizers was 154 million tons, but most of that was ammonium nitrate. Chile, the chief supplier, only produced about a million tons of sodium and potassium nitrate. If all one million tons were used for energy storage, that would supply thirty-six 50 MW plants, or 0.018 PWh of electricity annually, 0.06% of that needed for the whole US, and less than 0.15% of that needed for all the above plants in New Mexico. One hundred years of Chilean production would build 6% of the needed solar plants for the U. S. alone.
There are other heat sinks that can be used, but they have problems of their own. The most efficient heat storage is the above described nitrate salts. The other proposals are more costly or have less volume specific heat capacity. One of the cheapest is concrete blocks with embedded pipes. But the structural stability of the pipes and concrete over many temperature cycles is a problem, and the mass needed is 250% of that needed using nitrate salt. For a plant the size of Andasol 1, 70,000 metric tonnes of concrete would be required. That volume takes up ground area, lowering the overall plant efficiency, and requiring more area for a given power output.
Let’s say we have beaten the above problems. We have paved 10% of four western US states with solar plants of 15% efficiency and are providing more than 30 PWh of electricity to the US, all the power we need. The problem then is that we are dumping nearly 200 PetaWh of heat into the environment, almost seven times what we are dumping now, and twice what the whole world is producing. What will happen to the temperature? The southwest US will be uninhabitable at something like 10 or 15°C hotter than at present. If the same thing is done in Europe, the rain in Spain will no longer fall anywhere. It will bring on the catastrophe that Hanson et al have been warning us will happen.
A solar power solution requires vast areas, with a high environmental cost that probably cannot be paid, and the waste heat load would make any projected CO2 warming look benign. Solar plants are not the long-term solution to our energy requirements.

"In your 10 charts explaining the climate crisis (21 September), aviation is targeted as a “difficult problem” to solve. Given that the global climate strike was organised by, among others, the student climate network, students need to ask their academic staff how much they are cutting down on flying to conferences. The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research states that academics are among the highest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. And while universities are increasingly committed to a green agenda for their own organisations in terms of carbon reduction, recycling and sustainable living, there is little evidence that academics are cutting down on their frequent flying habit. Some may argue that face-to-face meetings at conferences around the world are necessary for the exchange of ideas and production of knowledge. However, research at the University of British Columbia suggests that there is no clear relationship between those who fly more and the quality of research. The University of Lund in Sweden is exceptional in requiring staff to set out concrete personal reduction targets. Isn’t it time that all UK universities followed suit and that students held their lecturers to account by asking them what steps they are taking to fly less?Celia RobertsProfessor emerita, King’s College London  • It is good to see your week of articles regarding global warming concluding with graphs to support the case. Sadly, you overlooked the most important issue in the whole saga, namely the rise in human numbers since the beginning of the industrial revolution. About 200 years ago there were about 1 billion of us; today it is about 8 billion and rising. For the sake of human comfort we have used technology to systematically destroy the natural order of things – and the more of us there are, the worse it will become. To make up for this omission I suggest a future article on the issue. If you wish for ready data I’m sure the pressure group Population Matters will be only too pleased to help.John GamlinEast Bergholt, Suffolk • The statement that “climate action must never be reduced to individual choices” (Editorial, 21 September) needs to be qualified. Some responsibility should be placed on individuals, but as members of extended families expressing their mutual love and care for each other through making “family declarations” about the climate and loss of biodiversity. Pledging to become better informed and act accordingly, to be honest and transparent, and work collectively to reduce the carbon emissions for which they are responsible to zero by 2030 (with the larger reductions in the early years), and to lobby and rebel to achieve system change regarding the remainder. All global citizens are acquainted by applying only about six degrees of separation. Applying that number of links that normally are deeper and more loving, the sum of family declarations could amount to powerful and decisive influence on governments and businesses across the world, resulting in systemic change.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire • Although it is clear that we have to fly less or stop flying, what happens to poor countries which are very dependent on tourism? We were in Sri Lanka earlier this year when the bombs went off. Our small group stayed on, but we watched the hotels emptying out, the restaurants without diners and the increasing desperation of people who are dependent on visitors from distant countries. Will the rich west have to help such countries change their economic models to stop them being tourist destinations?Alicia BakerLondon • During the climate strike, mention was made of this being “bigger than Brexit” and it occurred to me that wasn’t David Cameron also the one who got rid of “all that green crap”: removing subsidies for renewables and thus giving the message to go ahead and keep exploiting finite resources?

"Just 1% of English residents are responsible for nearly a fifth of all flights abroad, according to previously unpublished statistics. The figures, published in a Department for Transport survey, also reveal that the 10% most frequent flyers in England took more than half of all international flights in 2018. However, 48% of the population did not take a single flight abroad in the last year. The new findings bolster calls for a frequent flyer levy, a proposal under which each citizen would be allowed one tax-free flight per year but would pay progressively higher taxes on each additional flight taken. The revelations follow a new report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s official adviser, which urged ministers to put tougher regulations on the international aviation and shipping sectors to keep the economy on track for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Environmental activists said the new figures showed the UK could cut air traffic and emissions without affecting ordinary holidaymakers. “There is this narrative that tackling the climate change problem from aviation means stopping people from taking holidays or seeing their families – and actually, when you look at this data that is wrong,” said Leo Murray, director of innovation at 10:10 Climate Action. “What we need to do is target a minority of problem flyers and stop them from taking so many flights,” he added. The findings are based on responses from more than 15,000 English residents who participated in the 2018 National Transport Survey and were revealed to the Guardian following a Freedom of Information request. The aviation sector accounted for about 7% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. It is projected to be the single biggest source of emissions in the UK by 2050 due to the steadily increasing demand for flights. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, also endorsed the idea of a frequent flyer levy. “It makes it easier for families to fly once a year, but the escalating tax on further flights means that the people responsible for most of the problem are the ones who end up paying most of the tax – or, ideally, flying a lot less,” he said. Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green party, said the new data showed the UK could cut its air traffic without hitting those who can least afford it. “It’s about people who fly again and again and again.” “A progressive tax on the most frequent flyers is a fair policy that most people would come behind if the government put it forward,” she added. Tuesday’s CCC report suggested a number of policy options to curb demand for flights, including a frequent flyer levy, and said technological improvements alone could not be the solution to the growing emissions problem. There is currently no country in which travellers pay an escalating levy on each flight they take in a year. “In the absence of a true zero-carbon plane, demand cannot continue to grow unfettered over the long-term,” it stated. Emissions from international aviation are not currently included in national carbon budgets such as the UK’s but instead managed by a dedicated UN agency – the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, some have said the body is too secretive and close to industry to take on the major polluters. The CCC said international air travel should be included in the UK’s climate strategy like any other business sector. “Not having [international aviation] in the target is a barrier to putting in place good policies to get us on the trajectory to be net-zero overall,” said Chris Stark, the CCC’s chief executive. He argued that the UK should take a leading role in cutting emissions from the sector, rather than wait for more comprehensive international agreements to be struck. “There should be no barrier to bringing aviation emissions into the carbon budgets and then putting in place a set of policies that at some stage in the future will be compatible with those international agreements,” Stark said. A DfT spokesperson said: “Tackling climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges that we face. Which is why this government has set a bold 2050 net zero target for the UK and a greener aviation industry will play a key role in that. “The government is funding the future of flight and have announced £5m in funding for new technologies like electric and autonomous aircraft to help us tackle climate change. We are working with our partners to ensure the government takes a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.”"

"A coalition of Pacific island nations wants to raise $500m (£400m) to make all shipping in the Pacific Ocean zero carbon by the middle of the century. The Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership, announced on Tuesday by the governments of Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, has set an emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030, and full decarbonisation by 2050.  The partnership intends to raise money through grants from multinational institutions, concessional loans, direct private sector investment and through issuing regional “blue bonds”. The money would be used to retrofit existing passenger and cargo ferries with low-carbon technologies, and to buy new zero-emissions vessels. Pacific island populations are dependent on shipping for travel, medicines, their livelihoods and connection to the outside world. Such countries are precariously dependent on imported fossil fuels and acutely vulnerable to price shocks or supply disruptions. The region imports 95% of its fuels. Imported petroleum accounts for an average of 40% of GDP in Pacific island countries, with the transport sector the largest fuel user. In archipelago states of small island populations spread over vast ocean distances, sea travel is vital for linking communities and for economic development. The lack of regular connectivity between islands is a major constraint on domestic, social and economic development and on international trade. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  The climate crisis is making travel significantly more difficult and disrupted. Rising sea levels and the increased frequency of dangerous weather are making sea journeys more difficult and slower, leading to more frequent cancellations of journeys and damaging ageing transport infrastructure such as ports and refuelling facilities. A joint Fiji-Marshall Islands government briefing paper said that compared with other major economic sectors, “investment in the sustainable development of sea transport for Pacific island countries has been extremely limited to date”. “A transition to sustainable, resilient and decarbonised sea transport at this scale will require substantial investment, including at least $500m to support implementation of the 10-year work programme.” The Marshall Islands environment minister, David Paul, told a forum at the UN climate action summit in New York that securing funding would spark a “rapid transformation of our … shipping sector”. The Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions, but in many instances is feeling the impacts of climate change first and most acutely. Sea levels have risen at nearly four times the global average rate in some parts of the western Pacific, and the increased frequency of natural disasters has weakened island nations’ ability to recover from repeated, worsening catasrophes. Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said in May that the globe’s major emitters and largest economies were not contributing enough to help the Pacific adapt to climate change. “We need major economies to strengthen their climate finance investments, including their replenishment of adaptation and green climate funds. It is the defining crisis of our time. And if we do not take action, that crisis will soon escalate into chaos that will consume the entire world.” He said Pacific dependence on shipping “demands a transformation of our maritime sectors which will require new kinds of financial partnerships with bilateral and multilateral assistance and, potentially, a regional blue shipping bond”. A blue bond is a debt instrument issued by governments, development banks or others to raise capital to finance marine- and ocean-based projects that have positive environmental, economic and climate benefits. The Seychelles last year launched the world’s first sovereign blue bond, a $15m 10-year bond to protect marine environments and safeguard fisheries. Dr Peter Nuttall, a scientific and technical adviser for the Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport at the University of the South Pacific, told the Guardian that shipping was the “absolute lifeline” of any Pacific community. “Without shipping, our economies die, our people can’t survive. In places like the Solomon Islands or the Marshall Islands, 80% to 90% of all goods arrive by ship. We have the most expensive shipping in the world, the longest transport routes, and the worst ships.” He said the Pacific was acutely vulnerable to oil shocks, citing examples from remote Pacific islands where critical services, such as visits by health professionals, had to be abandoned because fuel prices were too high. Nuttall said the Pacific “cannot wait for the rest of the world. We have to bespoke design a Pacific solution if it is going to work, not leave the Pacific to languish. “We’re running the biggest risk. The Pacific did nothing to cause climate change, but we’re about to get smashed by it. What is it we can practically do to make people’s lives better now? We know the answers, and we don’t have time to wait.”"

With today’s emissions levels, our remaining CO2 budget will be gone in less than 8.5 years You say you “hear” us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I don’t want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C degrees, and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50% is acceptable to you. But those numbers don’t include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my children’s generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us – we who have to live with the consequences.  To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise – the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business-as-usual and some technical solutions. With today’s emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not. • Greta Thunberg is a climate activist • This is the speech Greta Thunberg delivered to the UN Climate Action summit in New York on Monday"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online NZZ from Zurich has a report on a recent multiple-proxy temperature reconstruction produced by a Swedish team of scientists. It wasn’t that long ago when European media outlets were saying Mann’s old hockey stick was settled science – that is until a series of scientific and statistical analyses by leading experts debunked it and the pressure to drop it became too much to bear.
Now Europe’s media are quietly abandoning it and returning to what years and years of reliable literature originally had stated: The temperature trend over the last several thousand years was by no means flat and that there were periods that were just as warm, if not warmer than today.
Here’s the 2000-year reconstruction of the Swedish team I found at the NIPCC site:
Swedish proxy temperature reconstruction: Source; http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2010/dec/15dec2010a4.html
The meticulous new reconstruction was produced by scientists of the University of Stockholm, led by Fredrik Ljungqvist, and the results were published last year in Geografiska Annaler. It’s a temperature reconstruction of the extra-tropical northern hemisphere (30°-90°N)  over the last 2000 years.
Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht Germany says it’s one of the best reconstructions he’s seen, and reminds us that proxy reconstructions aren’t easy. NZZ quotes Zorita:
Errors can be avoided only when paleoclimatologists and statistics experts work closely together. The right method for reconstructing temperature history hasn’t really been found up to now.”
Even when done meticulously, uncertainties can’t be eliminated. According to the NIPCC, this reconstruction was based:
…on 30 temperature-sensitive proxy records with annual to multi-decadal resolution, including two historical documentary records, three marine sediment records, five lake sediment records, three speleothem δ18O records, two ice-core δ18O records, four varved thickness sediment records, five tree-ring width records, five tree-ring maximum latewood density records, and one δ13C tree-ring record, but not employing tree-ring width records from arid and semi-arid regions…”
Indeed, Ljungqvist found temperature fluctuations that are markedly more pronounced than shown earlier in many reconstructions. NZZ writes:
According to his reconstruction, the Littel Ice Age, which took place between 1400 and 1850, was up to 0.8° Celsius colder than the climate average of the period 1961–1990. 
Perhaps the temperature dips of the past are even greater – Ljungqvist suspects that the cold of the Little Ice Age is underestimated.”
There’s still a lot of discussion on whether the current modern period is warmer than the MWP and the Roman Period. The study indicates that it was warmer in the past. The reconstruction also shows that the current warming started already way back in the early part of the 18th century, i.e. long before man started emitting CO2 in earnest. So what could be the cause of the temperature fluctuations? The NZZ writes:
Considered as causes are external factors such as volcano eruptions and solar changes, but also internal climate processes.”

The NIPCC also provides additional quotes from Ljungqvist, who notes:

…decadal mean temperatures in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere seem to have equaled or exceeded the AD 1961-1990 mean temperature level during much of the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period”
and
…the second century, during the Roman Warm Period, is the warmest century during the last two millennia,”
adding:
…the highest average temperatures in the reconstruction are encountered in the mid to late tenth century,”
Clearly the evidence shows that nothing unusual is happening. The Swedish reconstruction also uses “Mike’s nature trick“, tacking on the instrumental record for the last 20 years, but does not cover this up. And what about the claim that CO2 is causing the temperature to rise? Here’s how the NIPCC sums it up:
That claim — for which there is no supporting evidence, other than misplaced blind faith in climate models — is totally bogus.”
Do you now hear the hisses and gnashing of teeth from the AGW cultists?
Interestingly, the traditionally green NZZ first starts its story by glossing over some background and history on tree-ring temperature reconstructions, mentioning “pioneer” Michael Mann’s work and his iconic hockey stick graph, and provides some details about its embattled story, writing: 
…skeptical activists even accused Mann and other paleoclimatologists of fraudulently fabricating the curve.”
The NZZ refuses to believe this of course, but Mann most certainly did. But we understand the greenie media – sometimes it’s hard to say goodbye to an old friend that had served them so well. Good riddance to one of the most corrupt chapters in the history of modern science.

"The bitter irony of the current drought in Australia is that it has again called forth the same myths and false beliefs that got us into trouble in the first place. Mingled with a genuine desire to help farmers and rural people caught in a spreading tragedy are the age-old calls to “drought-proof’ the continent, to turn the rivers inland, to harvest all their water lest it run to waste in the sea.  We now know that these are not solutions but recipes for disaster that fight against the nature of the continent instead of working with it. Yet they recycle every generation and dominate the populist rhetoric of the public debate. They are simplistic solutions that will destroy Australia. Like the lotus-eaters, we inhabit a dreamworld where water is plentiful and the landscape resembles the soft, green hills of Europe. It is time to awake and accept where we live. The Australian psyche is dominated by dreams of water. Early settlers found the landscape harsh and arid, lacking the verdancy and park-like qualities of Europe. The rivers were untamed: within weeks the vast floods that spread across the plains became a chain of muddy pools. Yet like spectres from the dying land­scape, the old myths have arisen once again with the present drought. Myths burnt into our psyche and captured in our folklore that keep us forever locked into unsustainable dreams. Dreams advocating we should try to bash Australia into submission instead of accepting its nature and learning to live within it. The three great myths that still haunt our thinking are that: • any water allowed to run to the sea is wasted; • we must make the desert bloom; and • we must “drought-proof” Australia Consider the three myths in turn. The natural flow of water down a river to the sea is part of a healthy system. It is when we prevent this by damming, building weirs and, especially, by taking out too much of the flow for other uses that the river’s health is placed at risk. If the river cannot flush itself, it has no way to remove the salt, nutrients and pollution that build up in it, quite apart from river flows driving many critical carbon and nutrient cycles critical to our marine ecosystems. The Australian landscape, its plants and animals have evolved to cope with episodic flooding. By removing the water and preventing floods, we are also destroying that landscape and rivers functions that give life to it. The key lies in striking a better balance between the needs of the natural environment, agriculture and our cities. It also lies in being a lot smarter in how we use our water. For example, almost all of our urban storm water and most of our sewage effluent is not recycled. The second myth – of making the desert bloom by turning coastal rivers to run inland – is as much in vogue today as it was 100 years ago. The drought has prompted calls to revive the Bradfield scheme, a 1930-40s plan to turn the Tully, Herbert and Burdekin rivers back across the Great Divide into central Queensland and connect to the Murray-Darling. Two centuries of development in Australia seem to have taught us little about the hazards of salinity, soil and water degradation, loss of habitat and species and the simple fact that the communities from which the water is taken will one day want it back. An awful political dilemma. The third myth of “drought-proofing” our drier areas is equally fraught with risk because it invites us to grow things in areas where the nature of Australia makes it inadvisable to do so. It involves bringing water to places where it is normally only an episodic event, and can cause unforeseen problems. From a national perspective it is also unnecessary. Australia has a huge “fertile crescent” of reliable high rainfall country and fertile soils around our coastline, on which we could develop sustainable agriculture and horticulture. But instead of growing food, we have chosen to use these lands for urban sprawl, tourism and hobby farms. So we have squandered our most precious resource in an arid, infertile continent. What other country would put its best farmland under concrete, race­ horses and golf courses? We now have the tools to predict risk in farming. We can say, with high confidence, how many crops you can expect to get in a given area over a decade, and what sort of cash flows they will yield. There is no need to grow things in places where failure is likely. There is no need to risk landscape destruction. Learning to farm Australia sustainably is about having a good grasp of these risks. All that stands in the way are the mirages and myths with which we surround ourselves. Our rivers and landscapes are suffering once again and it is not due to drought. It is caused by poor policies and poor management. And these are driven by populist myths. The critical need is not to drought­-proof the inland, for that is impossible. It is to myth-proof Australians.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Germany’s flagship political daily, has a stinging commentary on the “growing green tyranny” in Germany. Its piece titled The Affectionate Ecological Dictatorship takes aim at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), headed by Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, NASA’s James Hansen, and German policymakers. The usually staid and measured FAZ uses a tone that is uncharacteristically harsh.Germany’s first (hardline) green state minister gets sworn in
The article comes at the heels of last Thursday’s swearing into office of Winfried Kretschmann – Germany’s first Green Party state minister in the industrial state of Baden Wurttemberg, home of automotive giant Mercedes Benz and sportscar manufacturer Porsche. The new State Minister Kretschmann means green business, and warns companies will have to change the way they do business.
If one should doubt that Kretschmann and the Greens really mean business, read some of the quotes the FAZ reports:
His words are neither to be taken as political-tactical provocation, nor as lip service to the base, but as dead serious: ‘We have to bring our model for living in agreement with the fundamentals of the planet. With our business and economic practices, we are harming the planet. For the automotive industry: ‘If the automobile industry fails to green up, then it will not have a future’.”
Kretschmann is not mincing any words as Germany begins to get a taste of the country’s first Green authoritarian hardliner, a harbinger of what may be in store for Germany if it continues on its current path to Green tyranny.  The country’s mad rush into ecological dictatorship is underpinned by science from the über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a science that is packaged and uncritically disseminated to the public by a green cheerleading mainstream media.
“Ecological tyranny is growing”
As Germany rides a wave of environmentalism in the wake of Fukushima, the public as a whole is hardly voicing any opposition to the bold state intrusion into corporate management and private lives. And not only the Greens are spurring on the enviro-movement, but all of Germany’s political parties. Opposition to the green movement is weak, and political leaders feel embolden to grab power. The FAZ writes (emphasis added):
For a long time now it is no longer just the Greens who are intruding into private and company freedoms with the aim of cutting the people down for an ecological lifestyle. An ecological tyranny is growing in Germany; it leans on a large majority. And the German federal government is leading the pack.”
The FAZ then cites a number of examples: the government mandating ethanol fuels that no consumer wants, reducing rental rights of tenants when landlords do ecological renovations, mandating energy saving lights and chimney filters, forcing homeowners to insulate their homes, forcing consumers to buy expensive green electricity, plans to massively subsidise electric cars – to name a few. In a nutshell, property owners are now being told by the power-obsessed state what to do with their property and how to spend their money.
“Forced feeding of ecologically correct products”
Still, for the greens, things are still moving far too slowly. And the federal government is committed to putting Germany on the Great Transformation fast-track, where the state would have full power to decide the future course of its citizens. Guidelines are already being drawn up for deciding what consumers will be allowed to eat and how much energy and water they will be allowed to consume.
On all the government’s intrusion on personal sovereignty, the FAZ writes:
‘Forced feeding with ecologically-correct products’ is what economist Carl-Christian von Weizsäcker called the government’s style of not taking the citizens’ consumer sovereignty and freedom to decide seriously. Those who don’t cooperate, get defamed.”
and (emphasis added):

‘It’s bad enough to be oppressed by a minority, but it’s worse to be oppressed by a majority,’ formulated British liberal Lord Acton more than 100 years ago. ‘We are moving towards an ecological dictatorship,’ Weizsäcker says today.”
Hans Schellnhuber has little patience with democracy.
Losing patience with democracy
Much of the science underpinning the Green tyranny comes from the overzealous and dogmatic Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, led by Hans Schellnhuber. The FAZ appears to be realising this. I don’t know how often I’ve warned how dangerous this Schellnhuber and his greenshirts are, e.g. read here. For them things are not moving quickly enough. The FAZ is beginning to notice and takes aim at both James Hansen and Schellnhuber. The FAZ on Hansen:
Foremost, climate scientists are losing patience with the slow moving democratic processes. The world renown climate researcher James Hansen, who heads the renown NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, regularly expresses doubt on whether democracy can stop climate warming. Recently he praised China’s autocratic regime as hope. There, sustainable living could be ordered.”
The FAZ reports on how Schellnhuber once said that the German Parliament needs to be supplemented by a “Council for the Future” – which would have a 10% say on passing laws. The FAZ focuses on Schellhuber’s 32-page Social Contract For Sustainability, writing:
 It is full of moralization and revolution.”
and:
It overrides ‘interests groups’ and ‘veto players’ who hinder ‘the transition to a sustainable society’.“
This is written by the FAZ – the WaPo of Germany! Clearly the author is spooked, and the rest of us ought to be as well.
Hans von Storch: “quite arrogant”
Now even some renown German warmist climate scientists appear to be concerned by Schellnhuber’s bold master plan to transform the world and the government’s enthusiasm for it as they rush to implement it. The FAZ writes and quotes Hans von Storch:
‘The tenor of the paper reveals a problematic understanding of democracy,’ says climate scientist Hans von Storch. Moreover: ‘The authors reduce the world’s problems to carbon. That is one-dimensional and even quite arrogant.’ There’s global hunger for example, but that is not in fashion today.”
Indeed it is not. Green policies, particularly those promoting biofuels, are about to profoundly exacerbate the problem.
This is the real deal – the rise of green supremacism. This green malignancy will not remain confined to Europe. Make no mistake – it is a global endeavour. This is no time for Neville Chamberlains.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Der Spiegel here reports on Ottmar Edenhofer, who once admitted that reducing CO2 emissions was really all about redistributing global wealth.
Edenhofer is a UN economist and researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and is responsible delivering the economic arguments for conducting the Great Transformation to a decarbonized society.
How much is it going to cost? According to Der Spiegel and Edenhofer, so far except for lots of wild ass guesses, there are no real reliable figures available.
Recently it was reported that it would require only a “mere” 12 trillion by 2025, read here. That IPCC WG3 report, read here contains a lot of “ifs” and “maybes” scattered over a broad spectrum. Even Edenhofer sees a huge information deficit. Der Spiegel writes:
‘Everyone talks about renewable energies, but no one knows the costs exactly’, he said on Monday at a press meeting in Berlin. He too was amazed at how bad the state of information was.
In the report 120 researchers tried to derive an estimate of the costs of renewable energy. They rummaged through studies and databanks, and what they found was hardly satisfactory. ‘The data have a wide range and are often not critically checked over’, Edenhofer reported.”
So the proponents of the Great Transformation have no ideas how much it is going to cost. Yet we can be sure that energy will be much more expensive, and much more expensive energy and food are going to cost the poor lots of money and so many lives. So what does one do when there is such broad uncertainty? Der Spiegel writes:

In the end the IPCC scientists could only present numbers accompanied with error bars, said Edenhofer. Politicians, who expect clear recommendations, were aggravated by this.”
For Germany, switching to renewables also means revamping the entire power transmission grid. For example windparks in the North Sea will need power lines to bring the power inland and to the south. Everything would have to be integrated with the current system. There’s very little literature available to show how much this would cost. Edenhofer says:
The integrations costs cannot be determined from the literature. There’s a large factor of uncertainty. Whoever converts systems has to anticipate many surprises.”
Edenhofer also sees no reduction in CO2 emissions without a binding global CO2 treaty. As long as there is no treaty with teeth, CO2 emissions will continue to rise.
Kyoto successor will be buried in Durban
So what are the chances of getting a treaty in Durban next year? Der Spiegel quotes Edenhofer:
I have the impression that the successor to Kyoto will be buried there.”
Let’s hope he is right – permanently. But Edenhofer has not lost all hope. According to Der Spiegel, he belives the chances of getting a climate treaty will be good in 2014 – after the release of the next IPCC assessment report.

Satellite photos now show huge clouds of ash blotting out the sky, see left, centre.
The volcano began erupting on Saturday evening – the first time since 1861, the German daily Bild reported here.
But as Der Spiegel reports, French scientists had misidentified the volcano. It wasn’t Dubbi after all. Der Spiegel writes: 
The VAAC volcano monitoring center in south-France Toulouse, which monitors the air space over North Africa, made the volcano Dubbi responsible. But a closer assessment of the satellite photos now show: Not Dubbi, but the Nabro volcano exploded – for geologists that is sensational.
The 2200-meter high Nabro has not erupted since man can remember, it’s been asleep since at least 10,000 years.”

The instability of the magma in the region and the eruption are now so great that the eruption was associated with an earthquake that measured 5.7 on the Richter scale. Der Spiegel writes that VAAC experts were stunned that Nabro had erupted because they thought the volcano was inactive. The huge amounts of ash first obscured the real source (Nabro).
The region is collapsing rapidly
Geologists say that the Eritrea region of Africa is now crumbling rapidly, and soon will be taken over by the Red Sea. We wrote about this back in Jaunary here.

The area between the dotted lines could be submerged – soon! (Photo source: Wikipedia.

The reason for the East African collapse is explained here in a Nature report titled: The protracted development of the continent–ocean transition in Afar
Nabro’s eruption coincides with the South American Puyehue eruption. The Caulle chain of volcanoes in the Chilean Andes 1600 kilometers southwest of Buenos Aires has been spewing a huge amount of ash up to 10 kilometers into the atmosphere since Saturday.
Although none of these volcanoes is large enough to impact the climate on its own, yet together and considering how much tectonic instability now seems to be at play, climatic changes due to these tectonic forces of nature seem to be more in the works. Expect more eruptions soon.
The ash spewed out thus far certainly will not help those betting on more warming, especially in combination with the sleepy sun and the multidecadal ocean cycles.

"António Guterres is this week hosting a major gathering of world leaders in an attempt to accelerate global action on climate change. The UN secretary general has made tackling fossil fuels, and especially coal, central to the summit’s success. He has urged governments to stop permitting new coal-fired power stations to be built and to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels. In this context, the countries that are subsidising and facilitating the expansion of coal, oil and gas production merit just as much critical scrutiny as those that are burning these fuels. Just as it would be wrong to tackle smoking by focusing only on smokers and ignoring the efforts of Big Tobacco, it is wrong to tackle the global fossil fuel addiction by ignoring the countries that deal heavily in the product.   When it comes to global fossil fuel dealers, Australia is a kingpin. It is the world’s largest coal exporter, having captured a larger share of the global seaborne coal market than Saudi Arabia has of the global oil market. Australia is the largest liquefied natural gas exporter, too. From 2000 to 2015, Australian coal exports more than doubled and LNG exports tripled, and since then LNG exports have nearly tripled again. When you tally the greenhouse gases from the fossil fuels exported by each country, Australia’s coal and gas exports total over 1.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide – more than double its domestic emissions – making it the world’s third largest exporter of fossil carbon, behind only Saudi Arabia and Russia. You might wonder, then, why so little diplomatic attention is focused on Australia. It’s a testament to the effectiveness of Australia’s assiduous diplomatic efforts on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. Not only does Australia encourage other countries to buy its toxic coal and gas, but it works tirelessly in international forums including the G20 and the UN climate system to ensure that its huge fossil fuel exports are not discussed, let alone criticised. Australia’s conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, is notably absent from this week’s climate summit. Despite being in the US anyway to dine with President Donald Trump at the White House, Morrison declined to attend the summit because his government has no new climate commitments to announce. Far from increasing its paltry commitments to climate action, Australia is continuing to ramp up its fossil fuel production, mostly for export. With 53 coalmines  proposed, Australia wants to double its existing production again by 2030, aspiring to be the supplier of choice to fuel a proposed new wave of power stations in Asia. It is expanding its LNG production, too, with numerous large projects finishing construction and 19 proposals for projects or expansions. The implication is simple: if Australia achieves its planned fossil fuel expansion, the world cannot achieve the climate goals of the Paris agreement. Part of the response must involve curtailing the market into which Australia is selling its product. That means ensuring that new power stations in Asia are non-fossil fuel and that steel is increasingly produced sustainably, rather than from traditional methods that use coking coal. But economics 101 tells us that the greater the quantity of a product that is supplied into a market, the lower its price, and the lower its price the more attractive to buyers it will be than substitute products. That’s why fossil carbon has to be cut with both arms of the scissors – with measures to regulate both demand and supply. Other governments, powerful companies and mass social movements must therefore ratchet up the pressure on Australia to ban new fossil fuel production and instead mandate an orderly phase-out of its existing production. They must add their voices and their support to the millions of Australians who want their government to be a responsible global leader in staving off the climatic breakdown that is already wreaking havoc in Australia, to say nothing of its Pacific island neighbours and beyond. There’s nothing new about the idea of regulating the supply of dangerous products. Australia itself, for example, is a world leader in tobacco control, with scores of regulations targeting the supply of cigarettes and their consumption. Globally, treaties regulate the supply of and international trade in uranium, asbestos, hazardous waste, ozone-depleting gases and dangerous weapons. Fossil fuel power stations are catastrophically dangerous weapons and fossil fuels are their ammunition. It’s high time the rest of the world treated Australia like the carbon kingpin it is.

Fergus Green will be a postdoctoral research fellow at the Ethics Institute at the University of Utrecht from 1 November 2019 "

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Defence Minister (Dr?) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is under heavy fire amid allegations he plagiarised other works and included them in his doctoral thesis, read short report here.
Unlike Climategate, the media here is doing its work and reporting on these developments which are now breaking, thanks in large part to the work of bloggers.
The case against zu Guttenberg appears to be hardening, at least that’s what we are hearing from the media. If it turns out that he did indeed plagiarise, then his doctorate will be revoked, and he will be under massive pressure to resign. Others of course say that everyone makes mistakes, and so he ought to stay. I think he ought to resign if he did indeed plagiarise.
Although the media hype surrounding zu Guttenberg is immense, the general public is a bit more calm about it. Most Germans here will tell you that they would not be surprised if many doctoral degree holders probably have done the same to a greater or lesser extent.
This got me thinking about climate science and all the professors and scientists out there. How many were really honest in their doctoral theses? In climate science we’ve seen a lot of shady dealings, criminal activity, corruption and downright fraud. It certainly would be interesting to examine a few theses from some of these leading warmist scientists.
I’ll just come out and say it. Any scientist that has the habit of manipulating, torturing and misrepresenting climate data probably was also less than honest in writing his/her thesis. Dishonesty starts very early on in life. Sure, this is a dangerous path to take, and one that is probably best avoided. It would indeed signal the start of a whole new level of mud-raking that might do more harm than good. Even honest people make mistakes, after all. Everyone has lied at one time or another. Yet, while some people rarely lie, others are pathological.
Shouldn’t the public know?
Sometimes it is not even clear what is a lie. Many tell half-truths, which is a way of deception. At this blog I tend to tell only one side of the story – because I feel the other side has been told ten times already. Does that make me deceptive?
Shall we have a look at some doctoral theses?

Hat-tip DirkH
It was already widely known that CFLs released deadly mercury, but only if they broke, see here for example, or here onwhat to do if one breaks. Now, according to the German television news show “Markt“, which will air tomorrow evening at 8:15 pm, CFLs also emit cancer-causing fumes during their operation, principally phenol, which is highly toxic even in small amounts.
DIE WELT reports that the NDR news magazine selected a random sampling of CFLs from various manufacturers and had them tested by an independent laboratory.
DIE WELT writes:
The official expert for lighting, Peter Braun, confirmed the magazine’s claims that substances can find there way in the air in a room. ‘Of special concern was that all lights that were tested emitted cancer-causing substances while they operated, and these happened to be the substances that occurred with the highest concentrations,’ Braun told the network.”
One manufacturer said they would look into it, while another said they know of no concentrations that are a threat to anyone.
Great! Now we are creating a global Love Canal to make believe we are rescuing the behavior of the atmosphere.

"Flying will have to become more expensive, especially for frequent flyers, to avoid climate chaos and keep the UK within its carbon targets, the government has been warned, while going ahead with a new runway at Heathrow would all but rule out airport expansion in the rest of the country. Ministers are likely to have to choose among options including hikes to air passenger duty, new levies on frequent flyers and changes to air taxation relative to rail and road in order to limit burgeoning demand for cheap flights in the next few years.  Aviation is likely to become the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by 2050, warned the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser, even though technological advances will reduce aircraft emissions. The committee wrote to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, on Tuesday, setting out possible policy options for ministers to stay within the legally binding net-zero target. “If this is represented in the right way, it should not be unpopular and the vast majority of people need not be very affected,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change. “But it’s very important that the government is honest about aviation emissions. We have to plan for the whole economy.” The committee’s findings throw into doubt the government’s green light for a new runway at Heathrow, the consultation on which ended last week. The Department for Transport has previously conceded that the net-zero target, enacted by Theresa May after the Heathrow decision was taken, could provide arguments towards a review. While the committee stopped short of advising against Heathrow expansion, it warned: “Current planned additional airport capacity in London, including the third runway at Heathrow, is likely to leave at most very limited room for growth at non-London airports.” Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said ministers must go back to the drawing board: “The government’s current aviation strategy is incompatible with our net-zero target and must be revised. The new strategy must focus on restricting demand growth, and will either require Heathrow’s third runway being cancelled or capacity restrictions on other airports to balance Heathrow’s expansion.” While improvements in aircraft fuel efficiency, and new technologies and designs, will reduce emissions from aviation substantially, this will not be enough to reduce emissions in line with a net-zero target because of the projected rise in flying, according to the committee. New technology such as biofuels cannot satisfy fuel needs as demand for flights rises, while speculative technology such as electric aircraft is a long way off, and capturing and storing the carbon emissions from conventional aircraft would be highly expensive. Flying at present is “very skewed” towards a small number of people, said Stark. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year but a minority fly often. On current trends, the number of flights taken in the UK would rise by 50% by 2050, but the committee advised this must be halved to a 25% increase to stay within the zero-carbon target. Many green campaigners want policies to focus on penalising frequent flyers and curtailing airport expansion, along with improvements in public transport to make rail a better option than flying on short journeys. Leo Murray, director at 10:10 Climate Action, said: “Most of the environmental damage from air travel is caused not by annual family holidays but by very frequent leisure flights by those at the top end of the income spectrum. A frequent flyer levy is the fairest and most effective way to keep aviation within safe limits, while protecting access to some air travel for all.” As a first step, the government could amend the law to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and shipping are included in the net-zero carbon target for 2050. They are currently excluded, but Stark said there was “no practical barrier” to counting them. Shipping emissions could be brought down by new technologies, and international cooperation will be key, according to the letter. The committee also found that buying carbon offsets – by investing in measures and projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere – or ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would still be needed to balance out the emissions remaining after the other measures to reduce emission from shipping and aviation had been undertaken. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The fight against climate change is the greatest and most pressing challenge facing the modern world and this government recognises that aviation and shipping have a crucial role to play in tackling it. “The government has already made clear its commitment to zero emission shipping in the Clean Maritime Plan, which was published earlier this year. We are also committed to setting a clear ambition for the aviation sector and will carefully consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change when we publish our position on aviation and climate change for consultation shortly.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany of you may have noticed that Steve Goddard at his Real Science site has recently posted a number of similar articles, putting to rest that weather extremes are exclusive to today (because of our CO2 emissions). Indeed they were just as frequent in the past.
This story here is just the latest, from online Der Spiegel titled: Tree Rings Witness To Devestating Droughts.
Der Spiegel starts by mentioning that Mexican construction workers in 2007  in Tula had excavated into an ancient Toltec chamber which held the skeletons of 24 youths, all under the age of 15. Among the bones were small statues of the god of rain, Tlaloc. The children had not died of natural causes, but had been sacrificed – in the year 1150 AD.
They had been the victims of futile weather appeasement rituals performed by high priests.
Tree rings show extreme droughts in the past
A recent study by author David Stahle, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, shows that an ancient drought, previously confirmed for the U.S. Southwest, extended into central Mexico from 1149 to 1167, and thus likely delivered the potentially fatal blow to the Toltec culture.
Photo credit: David Stahle
Stahle and his co-authors assembled a new and complete 1,238-year-long tree-ring chronology – the longest and most accurate of its kind – for ancient Mexico and Central America (or Mesoamerica). It  is the first to reconstruct the yearly climate of pre-colonial Mexico over more than a millennium and identifies four ancient megadroughts down  to their exact years.
Stahle’s team used 30 specimens of the more than 1000 year old Montezuma bald cypress trees near Tenochtitlan, which served as the captial of the Aztec empire, and Tula. Our amazing planet.com writes:
Tree rings give a precise estimate for wetness for every single year, Stahle said. The researchers determined the year of formation for each tree ring and analyzed what the rings’ growth patterns had to say about how soil moisture varied from growth season to growth season over the years, a parameter directly associated with rainfall.”

Stahle and his team stumbled upon the reason why these children had been sacrificed: Severe droughts had been decimating the Toltec population, and so the Aztec priests appear to have had the children sacrificed to in a bid to end the weather extreme that had gripped the region and parched their agricultural activity. Der Spiegel writes:
For many years the fields yielded too few crops to feed the people. At the end, the drought was so bad that the residents of Tula offered the god of rain the blood of children in a bid to gain back mercy – but the drought stayed.”
The drought lasted 18 years, from 1149 to 1167, forcing an entire generation to grow up under constatnt hunger and killing thousands. Der Spiegel also writes that another major drought could be easily discerned from the tree-ring chronology, one beginning in the year 1514, five years before Cortez and the Conquistadors landed on the Mexican beaches, and ending in 1539.  Like the Toltecs, the Aztecs also performed human sacrifices. Der Spiegel:
Similar to the Toltecs, the Aztecs tried to appease god of rain Tlaloc; archeologists discovered the skeletons of 42 executed children in the large pyramids of the Aztec capital if Tenochtitlan.”
Strangely the ouramazingplanet.com article issues a message of warning to today’s societies, though probably not the one it intended. University of Tennessee/Knoxville archaeologist David Anderson says:
This study will prompt a great deal of follow-up research by archaeologists and paleoclimatologists alike, and offers lessons for our own civilization — specifically how vulnerable complex societies may be to drought-induced crop failures.”
If any lesson ought to be learned from all this, it is that rain-dancing and performing rituals to appease the weather gods with the aim to prevent “weather extremes” is not only ineffective, but is pure madness.
The difference today is that at least Toltecs and Aztecs waited until things were really desperate before embarking on their madness. In today’s modern world, at the very height of human prosperity, we have science lunatics proposing the same mad behaviour in a bid to prevent weather extremes in a distant future – based on tea leaves and crystal balls.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome sad news I am compelled to report today. The German poster child of Arctic ice melt, polar bear Knut, died mysteriously yesterday at the Berlin Zoological Garden.
No animal had ever been so instrumentalized by the German media for the purpose of rallying attention and sympathy to the mythical plight of the polar bears in the Arctic. According to Wikipedia:
Knut (born 5 December 2006 – died 19 March 2011) was a polar bear born in captivity at the Berlin Zoological Garden. Rejected by his mother at birth, he was raised by zookeepers. He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than 30 years. At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a tourist attraction and commercial success.After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping the cub in captivity, fans worldwide rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub’s life were sent from around the world.
Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed “Knutmania” that spanned the globe and spawned toys, media specials, DVDs, and books. Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007. Zoo attendance figures for the year had increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history. Knut died at the age of four on the afternoon of 19 March 2011.”
Unfortunately, Knut did not fare well in captivity. His chances surely would have been better if he had lived up in the Arctic (assuming no rejection by his mother), where the polar bear population has quadrupled over the last 50 years or so.
Bild tabloid today has the photos of Knut’s last moments at the Berlin Zoological Garden.
I wonder if Germany is going to declare a national day of mourning. Knut’s death is being reported everywhere. Rest in peace, Knut. Hopefully where you are now, you won’t have hordes of enviro-drones gawking at you all day long.
Am I being too hard on Knut tourists? Was there a “Brennpunkt” news special yesterday evening? Flags flying at half mast?…
Reading the controversy part of the Wikipedia account, I have to say the let-Knut-die proponents have an inhumane view. It wasn’t his fault he was born there. The keepers have a young animal on their hands, and it is their moral obligation to care for it. Sometimes I ask myself what for barbarians are out there. As short as his life was, I’m sure he had many moments of content.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a mix of various news stories in Germany.
1. E. Coli epidemic in Germany (and handling with gloves)
Journalist Michael Miersch reports on the double standard in reporting the organic food catastrophe in Germany. Since E. coli bacteria infected the supply of food and so creating Germany’s worst food outbreak and scare in decades, the media have been doing all sorts of fancy acrobatics to play down this glaring Utopian green dream failure.
Officials now claim the source of the E. coli bacteria is indeed a “plant” in North Germany. That “plant” of course is an organic vegetable farm.


 

The above graphic shows the number of E. coli illnesses (and deaths in parentheses) for each German state. Source: http://www.stepmap.de/karte/2011-06-09-ehec-hus-154483 (3 deaths outide of Germany).
Now that we have so many deaths and hundreds ill, we ask: is the German government moving to shut down all organic farms in Germany, to protect the public, in a move similar to the shut-down of nuclear power plants in the wake of Fukushima? The answer is “no”.

Indeed news reports this morning say that the organic “plant” where the bacteria originated will be allowed to remain open!…citing “excellent hygiene standards”. I’m not convinced. A few days ago the Gärtnerhof Bienenbüttel organic farm showed workers in the food processing plant handling raw vegetables with their bare hands. The “bare hands” photos have since been taken down and replaced with scenic outdoorsy nature photos, see here. Hiding something? Noooooo.
2. Energy boss warns of German industrial exodus
Jürgen Großmann, a vocal critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to end Germany’s reliance on nuclear energy by 2022, told the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung the country was jeopardizing its economic foundation.
“Politicians would do well to review their actions, and consequences for the price of electricity,” he told the paper. “Consumers will pay more and many companies will think twice about whether they are in good hands in Germany. Continue reading here…
3. Green politician wants highway robbery of transport
Consumers aren’t paying through the nose enough, and they need more restriction. So says green European Parliamentarian Michael Cramer here. Cramer advocates a hefty “climate traffic toll” all across Europe. He says:
The problem is that the costs caused by trucks are not being accounted for. If they really were taken into account, then the tolls would have to increase considerably. Studies have shown that noise from trucks cause costs of 20 cents per kilometer.”
and (paraphrased):
Member countries should be able to increase toll rates by up to 175% during peak traffic times. The problem is that the EU has a lid on toll revenue. According to the Parliament, the toll rates outside of rush hours should be lower so that the state does not take in more revenue. So now there is no real incentive for less driving, rather there’s an incentive to drive during other times of the day.”
For the greens, it’s all about getting restricting people and stealing your money.

Here’s another “global warming is good for everything that’s bad, and bad for everything that’s good” story. Now according to the online Swiss suedostschweiz.ch:
Ticks could become more dangerous because climate change favours infected ticks. That’s the conclusion that researchers of the University of Neuenburg concludes. The study was supported the Swiss Nation Fund.”
Scientists claim that the infected blood-sucking critters live longer when it’s warmer. Every year 10,000 Swiss people are infected with the Lyme-Borreliose.
A team led by Lise Gern have been studying the Holzbock tick over 10 years and found they have become increasingly infected during that period. The Suedostschweiz.de says:
Climate warming could have enhanced this trend, the researchers fear.”
Could?
====================================================
Inflation In Germany and Europe Jumps
This certainly is no surprise to anyone. When sources of energy are villainized and citizens are forced to buy more and more expensive energy, plus the senseless shut own of nuclear power plants, eventually these dumb policies start having an impact on supply chains. The online Mitteldeutsche Zeitung here reports:
Consumer prices climbed in march like in February on a year earlier another 2.1 percent. That’s the highest increase in two and half years, according to the German Federal Office of Statistics. Foremost energy prices are fuelling inflation. Energy increased in price in March 10 percent. Heating oil (+ 32.8 percent) as well as gasoline and diesel (+ 11.2 percent) were at the top of the list. But also electric bills climbed sharply (+ 7.6 percent).”
There are no “coulds” here – just hard reality. The price of food, which requires substantial energy to produce, also jumped 2.2%. Unfortunately political shift to renewable energy has barely gotten underway, and so these increases are only a tiny sampling of what is in store should Europe plunge fully into the renewable energy madness.

The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research of the Helmholtz Association here reports that its Polar 5 research plane, loaded with measurement instruments, has just completed a 6-week expedition over the high Arctic, along with 2 other planes from the European and American space agencies ESA and NASA, to measure, among other things, the thickness of the ice.
On May 6 the Polar 5 Arctic expedition plane returned to Bremerhaven, Germany, where scientists will evaluate the volumes of data on sea ice, trace gases, aerosols and meteorological parameters that have been collected.
The Polar 5 route started in Barrow (Alaska) went over Inuvik, Resolute Bay, Eureka, Alert (all in North Canada), Station Nord (Greenland) and all the way to Longyearbyen at Spitzbergen. These locations were the base stations for the measurement flights over the uninhabited Arctic regions. The total flight time for measurement and travel was 130 hours. One of the main tasks was large-area sea ice thickness measurement in the inner Arctic, and this was done in close cooperation with the University of Alberta.
Preliminary results show thinner ice?
They used a four-metre long electromagnetic ice thickness probe, also called an EM-Bird. The Polar 5 towed the probe on an 80-meter long cable at a height of 15 meters over the ice surface. The AWI press release states:
A preliminary evaluation shows that one-year ice in the Beaufort Sea (north of Canada/Alaska ) is about 20-30 centimeters thinner this year than in the last 2 years. Ice thickness in 2009 was on average 1.7 meters, 2010 at 1.6 meters and 2011 at 1.4 meters. ‘I would expect this one-year thin sea ice will not survive the melt season this year“, estimates Dr. Stefan Hendricks. In a few weeks his colleagues at the sea ice group at the Alfred Wegener Institute will introduce their model calculations for the 2011 sea ice minimum.”

So the ice in the Beaufort Sea has gotten thinner? How does this assertion compare with PIPS, see here? Here are the PIPS ice thickness charts for the last three years, all for May 1st. Green is thicker and blue is thinner (see their site for the scale). For 2009:
May 1, 2009
and for 2010:
May 1, 2010
and for 2011:
May 1, 2011
Hmm. Clearly we see that somebody is overflowingly filled with crap. The charts show that Arctic sea ice is getting thicker.
So what is going on? We do know that the AWI is funded by the government, which happens not to be  interested in any news that may suggest they have been going down the wrong path and living in a planet-rescue fantasy. No, the ice has to be getting thinner – even if it is getting thicker – and their masterminded plan to rush into renewable energy indeed is going to rescue the planet. The scientists were probably summoned by the Klimateburo and told to watch what they release to the public, or else get the big cut-off! Who knows.
In the meantime maybe we can find an explanation for the huge discrepancy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s logical. Bad science leads to bad policy, which leads to bad decisions, which in turn inevitably leads to costly results.
Destructive “solutions”
A perfect example is the science behind palm oil plantations for producing biofuel. Here the costs outweigh the benefits probably 1000 to 1. But can you even put a price tag on rain forest destruction? Then there are the high food prices driven in part by biofuel crops, causing political unrest in poor countries, which now threatens to explode globally. Italy’s first boatloads of economic refugees from Tunisia are making the point clear to stubborn, reality-disconnected politicians in Europe. Another example are mercury-laden energy saving lights. They’re expensive, do little to reduce CO2, and their disposal is now poisoning the planet.
Face it, the preliminary concepts drawn on napkins always look good. That was the case for renewable energy like wind and solar. But when these were put on the test-stand of reality, the renewable energy sources were exposed as unreliable, highly costly, and did nothing for the environment. Wind farms transformed once beautiful landscapes into industrial eyesores that pose a danger to migratory birds. Resistance is mounting.
Worse, all of it is for nothing.
The unsteady supply of renewables, British lives at risk
Today the unsteady supply of energy from renewables is leading to huge costs for consumers. A steady supply of electricity is now in jeopardy. Nothing better illustrates this than Britain’s wind farms last December. Veteran science journalist and hyrobiologist Edgar Gärtner ín a commentary cites the near collapse of the British grid during the bitter cold of December:
Precisely on the bitter cold days did most of the 3000+ British windmills remain idle. On one of the cold days, the 283 wind farms with a total of 3153 windmills supplied a total of just 0.4% of Britain’s energy demand. In order to prevent a blackout, older coal power plants and gas turbines had to be urgently fired up. Large industrial consumers had their power rationed.”
Right when the supply of energy was most needed, was it the most unreliable. If it had not been for the despised conventional energy sources stepping in during the emergency, thousands of British lives would have been put at risk. Britain’s target of producing 30% of its energy demand by using renewable sources looks doubtful. Gärtner writes:
To reach that target, the number of windmills would have to double. At the same times, coal, oil and gas fired power plants would always have to be on stand-by for windless periods. But, according to the wishes of the EU Commission, there aren’t supposed to be any more oil and coal power plants. In any case, the energy costs for private households will double by 2020. every household will have to pay on average a 2,890 euros a year in heating and lighting.”
Soaring energy costs in Germany

The situation in Germany looks even gloomier. With its currently installed wind energy capacity, Germany will have to put old moth-balled coal burning plants back into operation or build new ones to assure capacity for windless days. That means 200% capacity to assure 100% delivery – hardly economical. Consumers will have to pay through the nose, and certainly will be angered by it. Gärtner writes:
In 2009 German power consumers subsidised ‘renewables’ with 9 billion euros, according to Prof. Dr. Ing. Helmut Alt. This year the amount is estimated to be over 14 billion euros. Here social dynamite is being kept tinder dry.
Cheap and plentiful supplies at home
The worst part about it all is that it is unnecessary. German consumers will become especially agitated when they start learning that there are now very cheap and plentiful reserves of natural gas available – right at home. Gärtner writes:
After successful test boreholes by ExxonMobil, Wintershall and BEB in Germany and Poland, it is sure that there are natural gas reserves large enough to supply domestic demand for decades, and thus eliminate the need for natural gas imports from Russia. Worldwide, using a new extraction technique, useable natural gas reserves will be 10 times greater, says a Texas geologist. Obviously this revolution does not accommodate Angela Merkel’s ‘energy concept’ for the simple reason that it was not planned.”
Just at a time when consumers are being punished by high energy prices does a cheap and plentiful supply appear, making future pain completely unnecessary. Gärtner adds:
It can be anticipated that natural gas on the European markets in the coming decades will be so plentiful and cheap that it will become increasingly difficult to continue on the German unilateral, go-it-alone ‘renewables course. It will be increasingly difficult for political leaders to sell a supply of expensive and unreliable energies to a hurting public when there is a a far better alternative readily available, especially in view of the colder upcoming winters forecast by experts.”
Forcing people to freeze in the coming colder winters when there’s a cheap supply directly under their feet can be socially explosive.
Energy snoops and a planned climate economy
For this reason the Dutch European Energy Review already writes of signs of a coming “Energy Civil War” in Germany. This is why the EU and German politicians are getting nervous and pushing hard to invest 200 billion in revamping the energy grid so that it can work with solar and wind sources over international borders. But that won’t be enough to solve the technical problems. Consumers will have to be forced to use less – much less. That’s why the Handelsblatt reported on February 9 of the EU Commission’s plan to prepare a new ordinance that would send inspectors in factories and businesses:
These inspectors will force private industry to move faster so that the EU reaches its 20% reduction target for energy efficiency by the year 2020. This increases the fear that the centrally planned climate economy will make interference in private property rights necessary. Such intervention will certainly be met with massive resistance.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuestion: A man sitting next to a radiator in his living room wants to feel 0.2°C cooler. What should he do?
a) Move his chair a couple centimeters further away from the radiator, or
b) Go out and pay $5000 for a completely new heating system from a shady manufacturer who promises it will be 0.2°C cooler.
Sane persons of course will answer with “a”. But if you’re the European Union and your advisers are German economist Ottmar Edenhofer, and sleazy furnace salesmen Hans Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Malthusian Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), your answer is “b”.
In fact salesmen Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf have convinced the man that unless he buys the new, cooler furnace today, he’ll soon fry.
Worse, the furnace that promises to solve “the problem”, does not even work when there’s no sun or little wind. No matter though, you still have to buy it. This is what Schellnhuber and Edenhofer of the alarmist/activist PIK are demanding of every global citizen today. The absurdity and arrogance simply could not be more profound.
Call it a field plan for a green September 1, 1939 kind of bank account invasion (US citizens, watch your 401k). It’s that crazy.

According to the green-fundamentalist Klima Der Gerechtigkeit (in English: Climate of Justice), the teutonic Edenhofer of the PIK) on Monday will introduce to the public his master economic plan for mitigating dangerous global warming, dubbedSpecial Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation.
The Special Report sums up 164 existing studies and tries to get an overview of just how much renewable energies can contribute in solving the “climate problem”. This of course involves spending gargantuan sums of money that an almost bankrupt planet does not have. How much will it cost? Klima der Gerechtigkeit writes (emphasis added):
Witha mere twelve thousand billion dollars by 2030, a global energy transformation could be achieved that would lead to about 3/4 regenerative energy worldwide by 2050.”
Yes, for that “mere” amount of money, we can get a temperature change that no one will even notice. That “mere” amount is about 8 times the direct cost of WWII for the planet, see here (h/t ArndB). So far I have yet to find a single language that has the words to describe the magnitude of this proposed folly.
As it stands now for the greenshirts, we are nowhere near where we have to be. Klima der Gerechtigkeit writes:
Indeed the current situation is dismal: Almost the entire energy mix comes from coal, gas and oil. Nuclear energy is only 2% (and growth here is very improbable). About 13% is already generated by“renewables”, by behind this is unfortunately too much biomass that is used conventionally, i.e. firewood, and so directly drives  deforestation (and the climate problem) . ‘Water power then follows (2.3%), wind energy (0.2%), solar energy and geothermal (each 0.1%) as well as ocean energy(0.002%).’ (Zeit)”
How many tens of billions have flowed into renewables so far? 0.3% is all we have to show for it? The 12 trillion number can be doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled, and you still will never reach the 75% target by 2050. In the end as a result, we’ll have a hollowed out society with hundreds of millions more suffering and dying in abject poverty.
What we need is economic sustainability, and not sustainable wealth destruction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClearly there is a pattern. We’ve seen it with Bill Clinton, allegedly Al Gore, and now we have the IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the Socialist Party France.They are all proponents of a powerful, domineering state that demands citizens bend to its will. Submit to the state and all shall be well, the statists tell us.
It’s all over the news today. But unlike Al Gore, Strauss-Kahn is not that central to the global warming religion, and so there’s much less at stake with him getting arrested.
What is it about some people that leads them to believe everyone else has to bend to their will? They are so convinced of themselves, elitist, all-knowing, believe they have all the answers and expect everyone to follow their instructions.
In climate science, they (politicians, activists like Al Gore, and a number of scientists) demand everyone else fall to their knees and start acting according to their instructions. “Don’t do this, don’t do that – do this and do that. Stop resisting – you know you want it…”
Giving instructions while being the beneficiaries of the consequences of the instructions is fun. But notice how they rarely ever follow their own instructions. They continue their lives of private jets, mansions and pleasure. They sure do like it on top, don’t they?
I’m not passing blanket judgement. But I am saying beware of people who constantly and habitually demand we bend and submit to their will – especially when the science is bad and it serves to satiate a personal need. Throw in power, arrogance, and a lack of checks and balances, and soon you get disaster.
Of course we have to wait and see the results of the investigation before concluding. Clearly it’s another case of the weak up against the very powerful. The political deck is firmly stacked against the young woman – good luck reaching justice. The bearer of truth here once again will probably come out of this smeared, ruined – a victim for a second time.
If a smear campaign is launched against the victim, or if a huge amount of hush money gets paid, then we’ll know the truth. Rules for you, but not for me.

"Greta Thunberg has excoriated world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through their inertia over the climate crisis at a United Nations summit that failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating. In a stinging speech on Monday, the teenage Swedish climate activist told governments that “you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.” Days after millions of young people joined protests worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered for the annual United Nations general assembly aiming to inject fresh momentum into efforts to curb carbon emissions. But Thunberg predicted the summit would not deliver any new plans in line with the radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are needed to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” a visibly emotional Thunberg said. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.” As the summit spooled through about 60 speeches from national representatives, it became clear that Thunberg’s forecast was prescient. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, told delegates that “the time for talking is over” in announcing a plan to ramp up renewable energy but didn’t announce any phase-out of coal – a key goal set by António Guterres, the UN secretary-general who convened the summit. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did set out the end of coalmining in her country but only by 2038 – a lengthy timeframe that disappointed environmentalists. Meanwhile, China declined to put forward any new measures to tackle the climate crisis. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called for the European Union to deepen its emissions cuts and said that France would not make trade deals with countries not signed up tor the landmark Paris climate agreement. “We cannot allow our youth to strike every Friday without action,” Macron said, in reference to Friday’s global climate strikes. Despite Guterres’ efforts, the summit was somewhat overshadowed by its absentees – most notably the US, and Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil, whose representatives were reportedly not selected to make a presentation there because of Brazil’s failure to outline plans to strengthen its efforts to counter climate change. Donald Trump did visit the UN on Monday but only briefly dipped into the climate summit to see Modi’s speech before attending a meeting which he had called on religious freedom. As he arrived at the UN, Trump crossed paths with Thunberg, who fixed the president with a hard stare. The summit was designed to accelerate countries’ ambition to address the climate crisis amid increasingly urgent warnings by scientists. A new UN analysis has found that commitments to cut planet-warming gases must be at least tripled and increased by up to fivefold if the world is to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement of holding the temperature rise to at most 2C above the pre-industrial era. The world is currently on track to warm by as much as 3.4C by the end of the century, the UN warned, a situation that would escalate disastrous heatwaves, flooding, droughts and societal unrest. Major coral reefs and many other species face extinction. “There’s a big dissonance between every leader saying to Greta ‘we hear you’ and the commitments they are putting on to the table,” said Isabel Cavelier, a former climate negotiator for Colombia who is now senior adviser at the Mission 2020 climate group. “China said absolutely nothing new, India mentioned commitments made in the past, the US, Canada and Australia aren’t here. We are seeing governments showing up empty-handed. There’s a feeling that the big emitters are holding things back.” There were a few signs of progress. A group of nearly 90 large companies promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, while a handful of countries said they will be winding down coal use. But it became apparent that most of the ambition was coming from developing countries, rather than the major polluters. Trump has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, while other major powers are wary of making further commitments ahead of key UN climate talks in Glasgow next year. Thunberg’s speech was “very emotional and grounded in science”, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If I were a world leader I’d feel very uncomfortable. But we’ve seen nothing from the big national leaders, the G20 players. It’s hard to say the summit moved the needle on the emissions curve.” “Other countries must follow our lead,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, a country situated on coral atolls in the Pacific that is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. “Falling short will represent the greatest failure humanity has ever seen. The summit must be the moment we choose survival over selfishness.” But delegates at the summit warned that the international effort to stave off dangerous global heating was being undermined by a wave of nationalism. “If you look at the US and Brazil, it’s a result of populist politics that is turning its back on the climate,” said Cavelier. “That needs to be made explicit and isolated from the world.” Amid the stunning rise of the youth climate movement, Thunberg, who arrived in the US last month on a solar-powered yacht, has directly castigated Congress and leaders at the UN, as well as spearhead the largest ever climate protest last week. On Monday she joined 14 other children to lodge a formal complaint under the UN convention on the rights of the child. The complainants, from countries including Argentina, the Marshall Islands, France, Germany and the US, claim that countries’ failure to address the climate crisis violates the international convention. “Each one of us had our rights violated and denied, our futures are being destroyed,” said Alexandria Villaseñor, a 14-year-old from New York who has taken to protesting outside the UN headquarters every Friday. Thunberg said that world leaders were endangering children by ignoring climate breakdown. “They promised to protect the rights of the child and they have not done this,” she said at a media conference at the offices of Unicef. “The message is that we have had enough.” • This article was amended on 1 October 2019 because an earlier version misdescribed the 2015 Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to at most 2C above the pre-industrial era, as limiting global heating to at least 2C above the pre-industrial era. This has been corrected."
"Scott Morrison is increasingly seen as running a “denialist government” that is not serious about finding a global climate solution and uses “greenwash” to meet its emissions commitments, analysts and former diplomats say. Australian observers in New York said Morrison’s failure to attend a UN climate action summit on Monday despite being in the US, and his apparent rejection of the need for Australia to do more to address its rising greenhouse gas emissions, eroded goodwill for the country on the issue.  While representatives from about 60 nations spoke at the summit, Morrison gave a keynote speech at the Chicago Institute for Global Affairs in which he challenged China to do more heavy lifting on climate change and suggested it should be treated as a “newly developed” economy rather than a developing one. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist of Climate Analytics and a longtime adviser to countries at climate talks, said the UN summit had been “very disappointing” as most larger polluters, including Australia, had failed to meet the secretary general Antonio Guterres’ call to increase commitments, leaving ambitious strides to smaller nations. He said country representatives at the summit were dismissive of Australia’s intentions. “Diplomatic officials from countries that I speak with see Australia as a denialist government,” he said. “It’s just accepted that’s what it is. It is seen as doing its own promotion of coal and natural gas against the science.” Hare said Morrison’s suggestion China should be doing more on climate, and be treated similarly to the most developed countries, while Australia’s emissions continued to increase year-on-year was a “ridiculous fake argument”. He said China, the world’s most populous country and biggest annual polluter, was not doing anywhere near enough to tackle the crisis, but was doing more than Australia on many measures. It had national policies in a number of areas – boosting renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles and efficiency in industry – where Australia did not. “Is that having enough of an effect in China? No. But will China peak its emissions by the end of the 2020s? Yes,” Hare said. “Will Australia? There is no evidence that Australia will peak its emissions as far as I’ve seen in any projections that have been published.” A report backed by the world’s major climate science bodies released on the eve of the summit found current plans would lead to a rise in average global temperatures of between 2.9C and 3.4C by 2100, a shift likely to bring catastrophic change across the globe. Richie Merzian, a former climate diplomat who now works at progressive thinktank the Australian Institute, said Australia was seen by other countries as denying the severity of the problem and in engaging in “greenwashing” by using accounting tricks to meet targets while actual emissions increased. While leaders from other countries did not attend – notably Japan, Brazil and South Africa, while Donald Trump made a surprise passing appearance – Merzian said Morrison’s absence was seen as condescending as he was nearby. “If prime minister Morrison thinks he has skipped this meeting and not damaged his relationship with the Pacific, he’s in denial,” Merzian said. With Morrison absent, having not being invited to speak, Australia’s delegation was instead led by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling. The former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd told the ABC Morrison’s failure to attend sent a message to corporate Australia it was not serious about climate action. National emissions have increased each year since the carbon pricing scheme was abolished in 2014. “When you have a prime minister of the country not stepping up to the plate, addressing the world’s forum, and indicating what Australia’s future carbon reduction commitments will be, it sends a very clear message to the Australian domestic community and the international community that the Australian government is just not serious,” Rudd said. “We are free-riding on the rest of the world. I believe it’s unacceptable.” Asked about criticism thrown at the Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who gave an impassioned address at the summit, Rudd said she represented “the anger of that generation and does so effectively”. “It might insult a whole lot of middle-aged white guys, because it is not the way that we would talk, or we think that it is inappropriate for a young girl to speak that way, but when I speak to young people around the world, whether it is in China, here in the United States or back home in Australia, frankly there is a rising rage that our generation has failed to step up to the plate,” he said. Dean Bialek, a former Australian diplomat to the UN, now working with the Mission 2020 campaign led by ex-UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, said Australia was increasingly perceived as a “self-interested laggard”, pointing to the Morrison government’s support for new coalmines as the mainstream science community and the UN secretary general called for thermal coal to be rapidly phased out. He said Australia was also seen as engaging in double-speak as it claimed to be meeting its international commitments while planning to use “carryover credits” from the Kyoto protocol that did not represent new emission cuts and were not referred to in the Paris agreement. Australia was also ignoring a key part of the Paris deal: that the targets volunteered in France, in Australia’s case a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels by 2030, were not enough and would be reviewed and ramped up. “Not only has Australia started with a very weak target but it is now saying it is not planning to increase that very weak target next year,” Bialek said. “There seems to be complete amnesia about this big commitment made in Paris.” Under questioning in the US, Morrison ducked questions about when Australia would develop an emissions reduction strategy for 2050, despite signing on at the Pacific Islands Forum to a communique pledging to develop one next year. He said his government would meet the 2030 commitments made at the election. Asked what the plan beyond that was, Morrison said: “We are making our commitments to 2030, that’s what we are doing. We keep setting the targets and we keep meeting them.” – Additional reporting by Amy Remeikis"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHead for the hills folks! Sea levels are rising. But first read Ed Caryl’s latest essay on sea levels. It sure helps ignoring the climate catastrophe cultists for a few minutes and taking a sane look at the data.
———————————————————————————
A Level Look At Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
Figure 1: Sea level rise since the last glacial maximum 20,000 years ago. (Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png 
One of the tenets of the AGW crowd is the idea that sea level rise is going to be catastrophic in the next 100 or 200 years, drowning our coasts and harbors, and in the case of low-lying countries, like The Netherlands, whole countries. These are not the facts.
Figure 1 shows the sea level rise over the last 20,000 years. In the last 8 thousand, the curve looks flat. It looks like there has been no rise since civilization began, and that the recent rise of about 20 cm (Figure 2) since 1900 is “unprecedented.” That is not true. The sea level has risen and fallen several times in the last few thousand years.
Figure 2: Recent sea level rise. Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Recent_Sea_Level_Rise.png
In Figure 3, one can see that the sea level did not abruptly level off after the rather swift rise as the major continental glaciers melted, but slowly continued to rise, with one episode of falling between 3 and 4 thousand years ago.
Figure 3: Magnified view of sea level rise in the last 8,000 years. Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Sea_Level.png 
A closer look at the last 2000 years is wanted. An article describing the sea level at Barrow Alaska was found. Here is the abstract in full:
Eustatic rises of sea level between A. D. 265 and 500 and between A. D. 1000 and 1100 caused the formation of raised beaches. After the first rise, sea level dropped about 2 meters below the present level, permitting Eskimo settlement of Birnirk about A. D. 500. The second rise of the ocean flooded Birnirk. At present, sea level is about 0.6 to 1.0 meter below the high water levels; the ocean partially floods Birnirk.”
The rises and falls at Barrow mirror the Roman Warm Period, the Dark Age Cool Period, the Medieval Warm Period, and the last fall in sea level in the Little Ice Age, with a slow rise since then. (See From Hockey Sticks to Boomerangs for the temperatures during this period.) But we are still below the high water levels seen at Barrow. These events are somewhat visible in the data points of figure 3, but the author of that chart has chosen to use a straight line to depict the sea level for the last two thousand years, not showing the natural variation.
 The same rises and falls happened in the Fenlands of eastern UK. This description is from Wikipedia. The Roman period in the UK was from 43 CE to 410 CE, well into the Dark Age Cool Period.
The peak of the water levels in the fens was in the Iron Age; earlier Bronze and Neolithic settlements were covered by peat deposits, and have only been found recently.[11] During the Roman period, waters levels fell once again, and settlements were possible on the new silt soils deposited near the coast. Though water levels rose once again in the early medieval period, by this time artificial banks protected the coastal settlements and the inland from further deposits of marine silts, though peats continued to develop in the freshwater wetlands of the interior fens.[12]”
 Then there are the Roman fish pens. Described at this site, but the story is all over the internet as proof of AGW caused sea level rise. It proves no such thing.

‘The Romans dug these fish pens into bedrock, and the water line in these well-preserved structures shows that the sea level along the Italian coast 2000 years ago was 1.35 metres below today’s levels. “They were used for only a very short time, so they make rather nice markers,’ says Lambeck.”
He then analysed how land elevations changed along the Italian coast due to both plate tectonics and the after-effects of the last ice age. In a paper to appear in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, he concludes that geological processes affecting land levels over the past two millennia accounted for 1.22 metres of the change, which means that the global sea level rose by 13 centimetres.”
The only problem with this story is that the sea level changed several times in the intervening years, both up and down. The fish pens are just one marker in time. They were used only for a short time because after that they were either above sea level and dry, or below sea level and unusable. Is there a chart of sea level over the last 2000 years? There is this one at CISRO, but the error bars are very long and it shows nothing useful. We only begin to get good data from tide gauges in the last 300 years.
 A problem with measuring sea level is that isostatic rebound, post-glacial rebound, or glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), is still happening. It affects tide gauge readings all over Europe, especially in Scandinavia. One way to correct for this is to use GPS readings to find the actual earth movement and subtract that from the tide gauge measurements. When this is done, the real sea level rise in recent years begins to dwindle. This quote is from the abstract of Geocentric sea-level trend estimates from GPS analyses at relevant tide gauges world-wide.
Sea level change in the era of the recording tide gauge. Int. Geophys.Ser., 75, pp. 37–64.] rules, whose estimate is 1.84±0.35 mm/yr after correction for the GIA effect [Peltier, W.R., 2001. Global glacial isostatic adjustment and modern instrumental records of relative sea level history. Int. Geophys. Ser., 75, pp. 65–95.]. We obtain a value of 1.31±0.30 mm/yr, a value which appears to resolve the ‘sea level enigma’ [Munk,W., 2002. Twentieth century sea level: an enigma. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 99(10), pp. 6550–6555]. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
S. Jevrejeva et al (Figure 4) did another sea level reconstruction using several European tide gauges and correcting for GIA in 2008. This shows a steady rise of about 300±100 mm since 1800. This is about 1.5±0.5 mm/year. This is a steady rise since the end of the Little Ice Age, with no unusual rise after the increase in CO2. This natural rise began long before mankind began burning fossil fuel in earnest.

Is sea level rising? Yes, as it has been since the end of the little ice age 200 years ago. It will continue to rise. The remnant glaciers will continue to melt until the next cool cycle. But there is no catastrophe. At 1.31±0.30 mm/year, or 1.5±0.5 mm/year, if the trend is linear, it will be up 10 to 20 cm by 2110. The Dutch will need to put more blacktop in their dike roadways, which they normally do anyway, several times in the next 100 years. But if the current solar minimum continues for a few years we won’t need to worry about it. We will be in a cool cycle.
Anticipating questions, these are provided:
What about Bangladesh? The river silt has kept up with sea level rise so far, and will in the future, in fact, 250 years ago, much of Bangladesh was flooded all the time. To learn more look: here, here, here, and here.
What about the Pacific Islands, the Maldives, etc? Coral grows much faster than 2 mm/year, and has kept up with sea level rise so far, and it will in the future. Many of those islands are only there because of coral growth.
What about our harbors? Infrastructure is continuously wearing out, being torn down, and rebuilt. The docks of 1700 are no longer there. They have been replaced, 300 mm higher.

"Fox News has apologized after a guest criticized the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg as a “mentally ill Swedish child”.  Appearing on Fox News on Monday, the rightwing commentator Michael Knowles launched an extraordinary attack on Thunberg, 16, who is campaigning in the US to urge action on the climate crisis. Knowles’s swipe at Thunberg followed one from Laura Ingraham, one of Fox News’s most prominent presenters, who compared Thunberg and other young climate activists to the characters in Stephen King’s horror story Children of the Corn. Holy shitMichael Knowles of Daily Wire just called Greta Thunberg a ""mentally ill Swedish child.""@ChristopherHahn tore into him pic.twitter.com/Ki0cK6W3Ev Thunberg gave a blistering speech at the United Nations summit, criticizing world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through a lack of action on the climate crisis. Knowles, a guest on Fox News’s The Story, was invited to discuss Thunberg’s speech and the climate crisis. He was dismissive of both. “If it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,” Knowles said. The commentator Christopher Hahn, appearing on The Story to theoretically offer a liberal perspective, immediately criticized Knowles. “Yeah, I mean, you’re a grown man and you’re attacking a child. Shame on you,” Hahn said. A Fox News spokesperson subsequently told the Daily Beast: “The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful. We apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.” Fox News told the Hollywood Reporter it had “no plans” to book Knowles as a guest in the future. The channel has not commented on Laura Ingraham’s attack on Thunberg. Ingraham used her show The Ingraham Angle to suggest, incorrectly, that Thunberg wanted people to “cede control of our economy, our way of life, our way of transport, how many children you want to have, and if we don’t go along, we will be punished by our own children. “Does anyone else find that chilling?” Ingraham said. “I can’t wait for Stephen King’s sequel, Children of the Climate.” King’s fictional story The Children of the Corn focuses on a group of children in a remote town who believe anyone over the age of 19 should be killed. Curtis Ingraham, Laura Ingraham’s brother, swiftly criticized his sister, suggesting that her rightwing pronouncements were motivated by financial gain. He said: “Clearly my sister’s paycheck is more important than the world her three adopted kids will inherit. “I can no longer apologize for a sibling who I no longer recognize. I can and will continue to call out the monstrous behavior and the bully commentary born out of anger.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Alfred Wegener Institute has issued a press release about a comprehensive study on the erosion of Arctic coastlines it has recently released. Many media outlets in Germany were busy peddling the “dramatic results” over the last day or so. So what data do we have to back up all the drama? Only about 10 years worth, it turns out.
Dramatic! Most coastlines are stable or actually agrading. (Source: Alfred Wegener Institute)
Excerpts of the AWI press release (emphasis added):
The coastline in Arctic regions reacts to climate change with increased erosion and retreats by half a metre per year on average.  This means substantial changes for Arctic ecosystems near the coast and the population living there. A consortium of more than thirty scientists from ten countries, including researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association and from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, comes to this conclusion in two studies published in Estuaries and Coasts and online on www.arcticcoasts.org. They jointly investigated over 100,000 kilometres and thus a fourth of all Arctic coasts and their results have now been published for the first time.”
I’d think data from up there is probably rather scant going back more than 10 years, certainly when you go back 50 years or more.
The changes are particularly dramatic in the Laptev, East Siberian and Beaufort Seas, where coastal erosion rates reach more than 8 metres a year in some cases. Since around a third of the world’s coasts are located in the Arctic permafrost, coastal erosion may affect enormous areas in future.”
Two thirds of the Arctic coasts do not consist of rock, but of frozen soft substrate (permafrost). And precisely these coasts are extremely hard hit by erosion. As a rule, Arctic regions are quite thinly populated. However, as nearly everywhere in the world, the coasts in the far north are important axes for economic and social life. The growing need for global energy resources as well as increasing tourism and freight transport additionally intensify anthropogenic influence on the coastal regions of the Arctic. For wild animal stocks, like the great caribou herds of the north, and the widespread freshwater lakes near the coast progressive erosion brings about significant changes in ecological conditions.

This looks more and more like a touchy feely nature documentary we often see on TV. No one lives there, yet it has an economic impact? Ice ages have also had an impact on these regions, like being covered by a mile of ice. Most animals get a bit disturbed by that too.
‘When systematic data acquisition began in 2000, detailed information was available for barely 0.5% of the Arctic coasts,’ says Dr. Hugues Lantuit from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).”
10 years of data? That’s it? That’s enough to call the situation dramatic?

Photo of coastal erosion. Source: Wikipedia – (Pacific coastline, not the Arctic).
These are impacts due to weather. We have little historical data with which to compare this to. Coastal erosion has been around since we have had oceans and seas. I seriously doubt there is much there except a subtle plea for more funding. Finding a spot or two along the Arctic shores with 8 meters of erosion makes for nice headlines.

"Angela Merkel’s government has promised more than half a billion euros to revitalise the country’s crisis-hit forests in the fight against climate change. A third of Germany’s landmass is covered in woodland, and forests play an important role in the country’s national folklore, from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to the poems of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  But a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 250,000 football fields, forcing the government to convene an emergency “forest summit”, held on Wednesday in Berlin. “Every missing tree is a missing comrade-in-arms against climate change,” agriculture minister Julia Klöckner said ahead of the gathering of around 170 organisations representing both environmental groups and industry. “Whatever we don’t reforest today, our grandchildren will, of course, miss.” In the face of the numerous challenges, Germany’s federal government has announced making available €547mover the next four years to remove dead trees and plant new ones, with state contributions boosting the emergency fund to €800m. The defence minister and CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has pledged the military’s help with the effort. Woodland owners however insist their trees deserve better financial compensation for cleaning polluted air. Representatives of the country’s influential forestry industry – employing some 720,000 people, almost as many as the car sector – have already warned the funds won’t be enough to replace the forest that has been lost. Umbrella organisation AGDW, representing forest owners and forestry workers, has called for direct investments of €2.3bn, as well as a new tax on industrial pollution that would help to subsidise forests at €125 a year per hectare of forest. Trees absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO₂), and their leaves can trap the toxic pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone, and harmful microscopic particles produced by diesel vehicles, cooking and wood burning. According to AGDW, Germany’s forest currently compensates 14% of the country’s CO₂ emissions. “Those who pollute our environment with dirt have to pay for it, and those who receive the dirt should be financially compensated in turn”, forest owner Ferdinand Graf von Westerholt told broadcaster ZDF. “That’s the solution.” But even how the funds already made available can be used has become a divisive issue between landowner and environmentalists. The forestry industry proposes replanting areas of destroyed forest with some non-native species that are more suited to a drier and hotter climate, such as the Japanese larch, the North American Douglas fir or the northern red oak. Environmental groups warn this could have a devastating impact on local wildlife, which could struggle to adapt to the new environment. Hubert Weiger, chair of the German branch of Friends of the Earth said cash should be injected on “public money for public services” principle: “Taxpayers’ money should only be spent to build up natural broad-leaved deciduous forests made up of native species”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman sporting and dog magazine Wild und Hund reports that thousands of domestic and wild animals are falling ill from tainted waste from green “climate-friendly” biogas plants, which is then used as an agricultural fertilizer in fields.
Hat tip: Dirk Maxeiner here (in a commentary titled: “Gross negligence in green”).
Wild und Hund has put out a press release announcing a report appearing in its latest issue, now available at news stands today. The Wild und Hund press release reads as follows (slight editing added for international readers):
DEATH FROM THE BIOGAS PLANT – CHRONIC BOTULISM
There’s been a terrible suspicion for years. The residue from biogas plants that produce “clean” green electricity is causing a deadly disease among domestic and wild animals, and humans – chronic botulism.
Wild und Hund not only examines the disease, but also looks into the background as to why such a hazard has not been publicly discussed for 10 years. In the aftermath of Fukushima, the public wishes to shift to renewable energy sources. Today in Germany already over a million acres of land are producing corn for biogas plants. German Agriculture Minister Ms Ilse Aigner announced on 27 April 2011 that land used for growing plants for producing energy will be significantly expanded to an area anywhere between 4 to 6 million acres. Today biogas plants are sprouting everywhere in the countryside.
However, the supposedly environmentally friendly supply of energy is likely hiding a lethal bacteria in its waste. Christoph Boll of the hunting magazine WILD UND HUND has investigated the disease, whose existence has been denied by the industry, and whose impact on wildlife could be catastrophic to wildlife. In the German region of Vogtland in Saxony, 600 cows and the farmer himself fell seriously ill. Diagnosis: chronic botulism. And that was no isolated incident says Professor Dr. Helge Böhnel of the University of Göttingen. The scientist reveals that the number of sick animals observed runs to 4-digit numbers. Dr Böhnel is convinced that chronic and visceral botulism could impact all birds and mammals  – including humans.
In general botulism is a lethal type of poisoning. But chronic botulism can also stealthily drag on in small quantities for years. Dr. Böhnel believes that biogas plants are “very likely” the source. How is it caused exactly? In early spring when harvesting biomass plants, foremost green rye, young wildlife end up getting minced by harvesters and end up as an ingredient in the biogas plant brew. In a addition slaughterhouse waste and other meat, such as old hens, along with manure slurry, get thrown in as raw material. At a brewing temperature of 40°C, bacteria multiply with abandon, which in turn leads to the production of enormously resistant botulinum spores that survive the hygienisation process (heating to 70°C). The waste material that is left at the end of the biogas process then gets used as fertilizer for agriculture, and so the spores wind up spread all over the landscape where they get ingested by grazing animals (domestic livetsock, wildlife, birds, etc.). Once in the digestive tract they then convert into the bacteria that produce the deadly toxin. Often the amount of toxin is not sufficient for a quick death, rather the poisoning is slow and chronic.”
So add another to the list of wonderful things delivered by the green revolution, which already includes a mercury contaminated environment from energy saving lights, birds getting shredded by windparks that have devastated the local landscape, biofuels that drive up the price of food and so lead to hunger for millions more, etc.

Finally, I wonder if they use this all-natural fertilizer from the “clean” biogas plants as a fertiliser for the organic food farms?
==========================================================
UPDATE: VIDEO HERE IN GERMAN, hat-tip DirkH
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev6hOeog5jU&feature=player_embedded
Cause of the suffering and dead cows: chronic botulism. Worse! The infected cattle shown that are still alive are being slaughtered and sold as fresh meat to supermarkets! The moderators says:
“The state veterinary officials say chronic botulism does not warrant the cattle be stopped from being slaughtered. ‘For the delivery of cattle for slaughter…there are no restrictions.’ “
and
Experts say up to 1000 farms may be affected – thousands of dead animals are the result.”
In the meantime, the infected cattle are being sent to slaughterhouses, and the meat to the supermarkets. The German health officials don’t want to hear about it, the report says. The Green movement keeps moving. This is a scandal.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Joachim Schellnhuber, German architect of the masterplan, dubbed the Great Transformation, warned back in 2009 that unless the world heeds his message, 6 billion people would perish. This was reported in the New York Times here, which wrote: 
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if the buildup of greenhouse gases and its consequences pushed global temperatures 9 degrees Fahrenheit higher than today — well below the upper temperature range that scientists project could occur from global warming — Earth’s population would be devastated.
According to the New York Times, Schellnhuber also said at a plenary session at the international climate change conference in Copenhagen (emphasis added): 
“In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something –- namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people.”
What Angela Merkel’s climate advisor is saying is that there are billions of us too many on the planet and that more lebensraum is needed. He then adds:
What a triumph. On the other hand do we want this alternative? I think we can do much, much better.”

Even more bizarre, one year earlier in a Nov. 13th, 2008 interview with news television PHOENIX TV he reveals his thoughts on growing human prosperity and population, see this Youtube video link here:
The video text caption at the start reads:
Already with the current world population of 6.6 billion people, an overuse of resources is taking place. In the year 2050, 9.4 billion people will be living on the planet.”
Well that is simply too many and all very frightening for Schellnhuber. In the video he says with somber tones:
The earth likely will be populated by at least 9 billion people by 2050. You have to imagine that these people will reach an average level of consumption that Portugal has, one of the poorer countries in Europe. When you imagine that if all these 9 billion people claim all these resources, then the earth will explode.”
Of course Paul Ehrlich made similar absurd predictions 40 years ago, and the exact opposite happened. Ehrlich was exposed as a charlatan. So far all the model projections that his Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research have produced in the past have turned out to be all wrong.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it, Germany’s elitst leaders think that by righteously adopting positions of “protecting the climate” and the “responsible” use of energy, they’ll be able to assume the role as the world’s moral leaders.
The pious, like Chancellor Angela Merkel and all the leaders of all other parties, media, etc., all insist they have truly learned the lessons of history and are now ready to take on moral leadership of the world and exercise the authority to admonish the rest of the world for its wasteful energy use.
Almost daily does the German public hear of a new energy-savings plan announced by these annoyingly pious and wise leaders on how to be even more responsible, and demands to make even more energy sacrifices, e.g. like shutting down power plants, installing more solar and wind farms, eliminating light bulbs, imposing tougher auto emissions standards, mandating ethanol, regulating people’s fireplaces, plans to increase tax on energy, and even master plans for the great transformation of world society. The list is endless.
Readers here would think that Germany surely will soon be a carbon-free paradise, an island of nature and morality. Well, think again. According to the Swiss online ee-news, Germany’s primary energy consumption spiked 4.6%  in 2010 – due to the “economic rebound and cooler weather“. EE-News writes:
The higher energy consumption led to an increase in energy-dependent CO2 emissions. According to the calculations of the AG Energy Management,  there were very little changes in the energy mix as a whole and about two thirds of the energy increase came from carbon-based energy sources. The increase in energy-dependent CO2 emissions was at about 4%.”
While Germany’s leaders demand other countries reduce their carbon footprints and be more responsible with the use of energy, they have no qualms about their own growing consumption. Especially burning anthracite coal, which James Hansen compared to death trains, shot up 15.4%. The use of anthracite coal increased even much more than the “booming” renewable energies, which increased only a relatively weak 9.9%.
Yet, let’s not blame the average citizen’s desire to stay warm, and to work and use more energy to fill customer orders. I say be happy they are burning more and not less. German products are solutions that make other people’s lives easier all over the world. So hopefully Germans will consume even more in the future, and so continue producing more technology, machinery and solutions to fulfill human needs for comfort and dignity. Indeed, using more energy to help others is arguably a moral obligation.
Here are some of consumption increase statistics (%):
Petroleum: +1.3%
Natural gas: + 4.2%
Anthracite coal: + 15.4%
Brown coal: +0.2
Renewables: + 9.9%

"Volunteers are being urged to do their bit to stop the climate emergency by grabbing a spade and signing up for the biggest mass tree-planting campaign in the UK’s history. Plots in suitable sites around the country are being prepared for 30 November, when the Big Climate Fightback campaign will start with pledges sought from 1 million people. Local groups are being encouraged to run tree-planting events and councils are being asked for permission to plant trees on their land, or outside schools and other publicly owned properties. Businesses are also being urged to plant trees on their own premises if possible.  People without gardens or the means to plant their own trees are being encouraged to spot potential sites and ask their local council or the landowner for permission to plant. By 2025, the Woodland Trust – the charity behind the Big Climate Fightback – hopes to have planted a tree for every person in the country. All of the trees provided by the charity will be native broadleaf varieties, such as oak, birch and hawthorn. The writer and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig has pledged to plant a tree and called on others to do the same. “Climate change is a real threat and affects us all, but there is the simplest of all solutions: the humble tree,” she said. “I urge people to get off their sofas and plant a tree. It’s very simple and you could be one in a million.” According to the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers on the climate crisis, the UK should have 1.5bn new trees by 2050 to meet the net zero carbon target, set in line with international scientific warnings on the climate crisis. The government has set a target of 5,000 hectares a year for England alone, but planting rates have fallen well short of that, with last year only 1,420 hectares (3,508 acres) of new woodland planted. However, trees will also need to be cared for after planting to ensure they survive, so groups are encouraged to participate beyond the planting stage. The Woodland Trust also warned that tree planting alone was not enough. “As individuals, we all need to do much more to reduce our impact on the planet by cutting emissions and reducing pressure on resources,” said Darren Moorcroft, the charity’s chief executive. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Working with the Woodland Trust and other organisations, we also want to encourage everyone to play a part and help us to plant more trees. We’ve already kick-started the creation of a Northern Forest, which will see 50m trees planted from Liverpool to Hull, and we have set up two funds worth £60m to drive up planting rates, including in our towns and cities. Later this year we will be consulting on a new English Tree Strategy, focusing on how to accelerate woodland creation across the country.”"

At his Der Wettermann website retired German meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne is calling for an immediate stop of all state-funded climate research.
h/t DirkH
Dr Thüne, who is sort of Germany’s version of John Coleman, has been one of Germany’s most outspoken critics of climate science and the huge waste of taxpayer money all the research involves.
Dr. Thüne:
For decades billions of US dollars of taxpayer money have been pumped into climate research without getting any detectable progress. Climate experts still have not even succeeded in delivering the physical proof of the claimed “greenhouse effect”.
The meteorological fact is that at no point on earth and at no time of the year do either the daily or yearly air temperature and CO2 concentrations causally correlate. There is no correlation! Also a radical reduction of ‘greenhouse gases’ in Europe, or “achieving a ‘CO2-free Europe’, would have absolutely no impact on the weather over the course of the annual seasons.”

Thüne then blasts EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard’s “Energy-Climate-Package” which calls for spending €270 BILLION every year over the next 40 years in order to reduce CO2 emissions by 80%, calling it a “senseless physical endeavour”. He adds:
No state, already under a mountain of debt, can morally justify the burning of  billions, and yes trillions, on the ‘protection of the global climate’ without leaving proof of having any effect whatsoever.
The correlation between the CO2-value in Hawaii and the annually calculated ‘global temperature’ is a fictitious correlation that imposters as causal effect, but is in reality only a make believe correlation.”
Thüne then reminds us that the earth’s climate has been proven to correlate with the angle of the sun’s rays striking the earth’s surface and that ‘it is as old as the planet itself’, has nothing to do with industrialisation and that the calculated temperature increase of 0.7°C  that has taken place since 1860 is a normal earthly process.
Thüne clearly labels the state’s attempt to regulate global temperature, while at the same time delivering social justice, a folly. He adds: “weather cannot be disciplined, and weather alone determines what climate a location or a state has”. Thüne ends by reminding us:
Humankind would be helped in practical ways if 20% of research resources were instead devoted to better weather forecasting and the remaining 80% devoted to combating hunger and poverty.”

"What is the “green industrial revolution”? The Labour party’s answer to the climate emergency is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in new industries and reforms to existing practices, to generate economic opportunities, particularly in areas where old industrial jobs have vanished. The ideas behind it are similar to those of the international move for a Green New Deal, espoused by leading Democrats in the US, but draw on the UK’s specific industrial resources, skills and heritage.  What measures have been announced? On Monday, a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points, to ensure rapid refuelling for long and short journeys. There will also be interest-free loans for electric car buyers, with the aim of electric vehicles making up two-thirds of those on UK roads by 2030. Energy generation is another key target: home insulation and solar panels will be introduced free for more than a million people in low-income and social housing. If elected, a Labour government would renationalise the electricity grid, with a national energy agency and regional agencies taking over the task of delivering energy and balancing demand, while suppliers would remain private. Labour would also ban fracking. What other measures are likely? Labour will announce plans to remove planning restrictions that stop onshore windfarms. A large proportion of the proposed £250bn national transformation fund will be spent on the “green industrial revolution”, in ways yet to be laid out in detail. Additional Treasury policies could include adjusting the discount rate to make investments in green measures cheaper and changes to tax. Public procurement would be reformed so that suppliers to the public sector have to meet stringent green standards. And there may be a move to bring forward the government’s current target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, enacted by Theresa May. What will this mean for jobs? Labour claims the measures will create tens of thousands of new jobs around the country, and unions are broadly in favour, backing a “just transition” from high-carbon industries to a low-carbon economy that would create high-quality jobs to replace those lost in industries such as coal. How is this being received? There is support among party members, with Labour for a Green New Deal and Momentum backing the idea, and it seems to play well among young people in particular. Businesses seem more wary, with the CBI telling the Guardian that “renationalisation will disrupt the investment needed across water, rail and energy that all contribute to reducing emissions”. Will Brexit have an impact? Plans for green industry are being presented as separate to Brexit, representing a way forward that all sides of the Brexit debate can espouse, as they are targeted at new green jobs and an industrial revival. But a close relationship with Europe is viewed as essential, to collaborate on green standards and carbon accounting. The UK will host the major UN climate conference in 2020, called COP26, so Labour would seek to showcase the “green industrial revolution” on the international stage if in power next December. What about aviation? One key issue that must be addressed is the forecast rapid rise in emissions from aviation, and Labour has been divided over a new runway at Heathrow, in contrast to the Liberal Democrats who want a moratorium on all airport expansion. Improved and cheaper public transport is key to Labour plans: the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, pointed to flights within the UK that are much cheaper than rail journeys as one target for action."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a magical element about that number. Maybe because it is 1000 squared. Or maybe it’s a quantity that is very high, yet still within the realms of human imagination. It’s a number that certainly exudes magnitude.

There are a number of phrases with the word “million”, some examples:
– millionaire
– thanks a million
– not in a million years
– one in a million
– million dollar question
– million-dollar deal
– multi-million dollar project
– million dollar baby
– I told you a million times (CO2 is not driving the climate!)
As I mentioned earlier this morning, today is a special day for NoTricksZone – this site reached the milestone of 1,000,000 hits – some time around 11 a.m. this morning – a little more than a year after first starting on 1 April, 2010. 
THANKS A MILLION – READERS!
Okay – compared to other blogs, which get this in just weeks, or even days, it’s not so much. Yet, it far surpasses anything I expected when I first got started. The first days of blogging saw a few dozen hits, and I thought maybe some day I’d get 100 or even 500 hits a day. One hundred thousand hits seemed so remote. But here we are – 1,000,000!
The first 6 months NTZ saw 220,000 hits, and the next 6 months and 10 days we got 780,000 hits.
Also thanks to the guest writers who contributed, namely Matt Vooro, Ed Caryl, Juraj, Jimbo (I know I’m missing a person or two here, so please forgive me) and all the regular readers. Readers are always welcome to contribute as guest writers.
And hopefully readers will keep dropping by.
Thanks to other sites for posting and mentioning my posts, particularly Climate Depot, WUWT, Tom Nelson and others. All of this contributes to readers getting stories and insights that they might not otherwise see. My main focus will be to continue writing about climate news in Germany and Europe so that people can get a feel of what is going on here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe animated graphic below was created by geophysicist Joachim Saul from the Helmholtz Association GFZ Research Centre for Geosciences, read here and shows the sequence of quakes since March 9. The animated image is available at www.gfz-potsdam.de. Click the image to activate.

The GFZ press release writes:
It shows the earthquake activity in the region of Honshu, Japan, measured at the GFZ since 8 March 2011. After a seismically quiet 8th March, the morning (coordinated universal time UTC) of the March 9 began with an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 off the Japanese east coast, followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.
The morning of March 11 sees the earthquake disaster that triggered the devastating tsunami. This earthquake is followed by many almost severe aftershocks, two of which almost reach the magnitude 8. In the following time period the activity slowly subsides, and is dominated today (March 16) by relatively small magnitude 5 quakes, though several earthquakes of magnitude 6 are being registered on a daily basis.
By analysing over 500 GPS stations, the GFZ scientists Rongjiang Wang and Thomas Walter have found that horizontal displacements of up to five meters in an eastern direction occurred at the east coast of Japan. The cause lies in the earthquake zone, i.e. at the contact interface of the Pacific plate with Japan. Computer simulations of this surface show that an offset of up to 25 meters occurred during the earthquake.
Calculations of the GFZ modeling group headed by Stephan Sobolev even yielded a displacement of up to 27 meters and a vertical movement of seven meters. This caused an abrupt elevation in the deep sea, and thus triggered the tsunami. The images of the GPS displacement vectors and the computer simulations can also be found among the online material provided by the GFZ.
Already shortly after the quake Andrey Babeyko and Stephan Sobolev of the GFZ modeled the propagation and wave heights of the tsunami in the Pacific over the first 16 hours. The tremendous force of the earthquake is highlighted here, too: in the open Pacific, relatively large wave heights of over one meter were calculated, which agrees very well with the observations. How high the tsunami is piled up on the coast is largely determined by water depth and the shape of the coastline. The GFZ material also contains an image and an animation regarding this work.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have to keep repeating this because the irresponsible media keeps distorting everything.
Zettels Raum brings the latest update here. So far every single one of his reports has been spot on. 
Here are the latest main points:

Works on the nuclear power plant have made amazing progress. One can say with high probability that no big accident will occur. The catastrophe, which the media has been filled with, will not take place.

The first days of activity focused on preventing a meltdown of the reactors. To do this the pressure inside the containment had to be lowered by releasing air out of the containment and into the reactor building. That led to two consequences:  
1) the air was radioactive and escaped into the surrounding environment. This improvement naturally led to a worsening situation on the other hand. This makes every decision a difficult balancing act.
2) hydrogen had gathered in the room between the containment and the building roof when the valves were opened, which led to an explosion. The resulting harmless fire outside of the containment made for good pictures for the media and led them to falsely claim that the reactor had been reduced to rubble and ash. These picture were shown repeatedly on TV. See here.


The fact is that there was very little damage – and workers were back immediately putting the system back into order.Such trade-offs have been the order of the last day.Now also Blocks 3 and 4 are now connected to the power grid and so this allows the control room to be put back into operation. But switching on the the power is not possible as long as huge amounts of water continue to be sprayed  onto the reactor building. This leads to a difficult decision: When can you risk stopping the external cooling – at least temporarily – to allow the power to be switched back on and to change over to normal cooling by pumps?
As NHK reported this evening at 18:01 CET, normal cooling of Block 3 will begin tomorrow, provided that the external cooling of this block ends. This is all about making the transition from improvised cooling  over to normal cooling operation in a coordinated manner, and making sure that cooling goes as uninterrrupted as possible.”

Thanks to Zettels Raum blog for keeping us informed.
