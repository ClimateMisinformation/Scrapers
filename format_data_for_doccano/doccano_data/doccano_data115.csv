" The World Bank will invest heavily in clean energy and only fund coal projects in “circumstances of extreme need” because climate change will undermine efforts to eliminate extreme poverty, says its president Jim Yong Kim.  Talking ahead of a UN climate summit in Peru next month, Kim said he was alarmed by World Bank-commissioned research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, which said that as a result of past greenhouse gas emissions the world is condemned to unprecedented weather events.  “The findings are alarming. As the planet warms further, heatwaves and other weather extremes, which today we call once­-in­-a-century events, would become the new climate normal, a frightening world of increased risk and instability. The consequences for development would be severe, as crop yields decline, water resources shift, communicable diseases move into new geographical ranges, and sea levels rise,” he said. “We know that the dramatic weather extremes are already affecting millions of people, such as the five to six feet of snow that just fell on Buffalo, and can throw our lives into disarray or worse. Even with ambitious mitigation, warming close to 1.5C above pre­-industrial levels is locked in. And this means that climate change impact such as extreme heat events may now be simply unavoidable.” But the bank, which has traditionally been one of the world’s largest funders of fossil fuel projects and has been accused of adding to the problem of climate change, said it could not ignore the poorest countries’ need for power. “We are going to have to focus all of our energy to move toward renewable and cleaner forms of energy. But on the other hand we believe very strongly that the poorest countries have a right to energy and that we not ask these energy ­poor countries to wait until there are ways of ensuring that solar and wind power can provide the kind of base load that all countries need in order to industrialise,” said Kim. “The stakes have never been higher.We cannot continue down the current path of unchecked growing emissions. The case for taking action now on climate change is overwhelming, and the cost of inaction will only rise,” he said. Kim was backed by Rachel Kyte, World Bank group vice president and special envoy for climate change. “It will only be in circumstances of extreme need that we would contemplate doing coal again. We would only contemplate doing [it] in the poorest of countries where their energy transition as part of their low-carbon development plan means that there are no other base load power sources available at a reasonable price,” she said. “The focus is on being able to ramp up our lending and the leveraging of our lending into all forms of renewable energy. That’s the strategy. It includes everything from all sizes of hydro through to wind, to solar, to concentrated solar, to geothermal. I think we’re invested in every dimension of renewable energy. That is what we’re concentrating on.” The bank’s report showed that with a 2C warming, soya and wheat crop yields in Brazil could decrease 50-70%. “In the Middle east and north Africa, a large increase in heatwaves combined with warmer average temperatures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources with major consequences for food security. Crop yields could decrease by up to 30% at 1.5-2C and by almost 60% at 3-4C. Pressure on resources might increase the risk of conflict,” it said. Climate change posed a substantial risk to development and cutting poverty, the report said, adding that action on emissions need not come at the expense of economic growth. But the bank made no commitment to cut funding for oil or other fossil fuel exploration. Analysis earlier this year by Washington-based NGO Oil Change International showed that the bank had funded $21bn (£13bn) of fossil fuel projects since 2008, including $1bn of oil and other fossil fuel exploration in 2013.  “The bank has taken an important first step in essentially stopping its support for coal-fired power plants, but climate change is caused by more than just coal,” said Stephen Kretzmann, director of Oil Change International. “The vast majority of currently proven fossil fuel reserves will need to be left in the ground if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change, but last year the bank provided nearly $1bn in support for finding more of these unburnable carbon reserves.”  "
"The waves of rainfall mostly across the western side of the British Isles last week raised the possibility of further serious flooding this winter. At this stage nobody is sure what will happen. Will the jet stream get stuck again and lines of storms strike Britain, or will a normal pattern of warm and wet periods alternate with cold and dry?  For those who have suffered flooding and fear it happening again, this is a troubling time. Many of the communities involved have got together this summer with various emergency services to make themselves better prepared and more resilient. At the same time, some of the people involved have been having discussions about their floods and the science of climate change. The Climate Outreach organisation says this is a fascinating topic of research because some people still regard this as “a difficult area to discuss” with their neighbours. While some were aware of the link between their floods and climate change, others still felt they did not know enough about the subject – even though the science has been clear for two decades. A small minority regard climate change as a political issue and refuse to countenance any connection with local flooding. It is hard to think of any other subject where the scientific consensus can be simply rejected. It could account for why, even in areas that have been flooded, wind and solar farms are still vehemently opposed, when opinion polls consistently show an increasing majority is in favour of these developments."
"This week marks the five year anniversary of ‘climategate’, a rather grandiose title given to the theft and online publication of controversial email correspondence between climate scientists in November 2009. Since this date, no fewer than six separate inquiries have rejected claims by climate sceptics that the emails contained evidence of scientists manipulating data.  But if you’re scratching your head trying to remember exactly where you were when this momentous event took place, you are in good company. Although the affair was big news around the water cooler of climate science departments, and has continued to reverberate around the blogosphere, there is little evidence that ordinary members of the public either noticed or cared about the claims.  In fact, although the sceptic bogeymen (and they are mostly men) continue to draw the ire of scientists and environmental campaigners, there is increasing evidence that the contrarian positions of climate sceptics are becoming irrelevant for most ordinary people. In COIN’s latest report, Young Voices, we spoke to young people in the UK aged between 18 and 25 about their views on climate change. Most were not interested in fighting a battle against organised scepticism. Debating solutions, rather than the science, was deemed a much higher priority. The ‘solutions not science’ mantra is likely to be a much more effective method of overcoming scepticism overall, rather than slogging it out in the scientific arena. A new paper by scholars Troy Campbell and Aaron Kay confirmed what several previous studies have hinted at: Republican aversion to the conclusions of climate science diminishes when presented with responses that fit more closely with their values (policies that don’t challenge the logic of the free market, for example).  This insight is also reflected in 10:10’s #ItsHappening campaign, which promotes creative ways of tackling climate change from across the globe on social media. The logic of the campaign is simple: show people that solutions are not only possible but already proliferating, and a powerful sense of momentum will grow.  Interestingly, though, a study conducted in Canada suggests that people don’t necessarily need to know much about climate policies in order to support them. There is no direct relationship between policy knowledge and support for them. In other words, you don’t have to be a climate policy expert to be inspired by positive examples of low-carbon solutions, in the same way that it is not necessary to understand the physics of the greenhouse effect to be concerned about the impacts of climate change.  More important than the actual solutions are the stories that grow around them, and the meanings people attribute to different technologies and ideas. The success of #ItsHappening is most likely driven by a sense of social momentum rather than anything inherently ‘likeable’ about the projects shared.  Consider the contrasting ways that people respond to wind farms. Those who support onshore wind equate the turbines with progress, and feel reassured about the prospect of a clean energy future. And those who oppose them tell powerful stories about money-grabbing ‘outsiders’ and pledge solidarity in the face of undemocratic imposition on their community. Crucially, there is nothing written in the blades and motors of the turbines themselves that underpins these narratives. They are entirely social in nature. We shouldn’t get too carried away with the idea that communicating climate solutions is a panacea for public lethargy. Climate answers breathe life into an otherwise frustratingly arid subject because of the stories they tell. This means that telling the most powerful and compelling stories is the key – stories that relate to the aspects of people’s lives they care passionately about.  It is encouraging that there is a growing movement away from ‘myth-busting’ and towards ‘solution sharing’. But we should remember what dozens of studies on climate change communication have taught us: people fit the facts to their pre-existing narratives about the world, which are first and foremost a product of their values and political outlook.  A climate solution is only as good as the story that surrounds it. Read more like this: Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

"An interesting sequence of events followed the publication of a scientific paper I co-authored in May last year. The paper found a 97% consensus that humans were causing global warming in relevant scientific papers. Finding an overwhelming consensus was nothing new. Studies in 2009 and 2010 also found 97% agreement among climate scientists on human-caused global warming. Nevertheless, the paper attracted much media attention, including tweets from Elon Musk and President Obama. In reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change http://t.co/soQCnJB61B  Retweet if you agree it's time to #ActOnClimate. pic.twitter.com/xZxi6KdInY We expected our work would be attacked from those who reject climate science. We weren’t disappointed. Since publication, hundreds of blog posts, reports, videos, papers and op-eds have been published attacking our paper. A year and a half later, there is no sign of slowing. But this is just the latest chapter in over two decades of manufactured doubt on the scientific consensus about climate change. What did surprise me were criticisms from scientists who accept the science on climate change. They weren’t arguing against the existence of a consensus, but whether we should be communicating the consensus. This surprised me, as our approach to climate communication was evidence-based, drawing on social science research. So in response, I along with co-author Peter Jacobs have published a scholarly paper summarising all the evidence and research underscoring the importance of consensus messaging. One objection against consensus messaging is that scientists should be talking about evidence, rather than consensus. After all, our understanding of climate change is based on empirical measurements, not a show of hands. But this objection misunderstands the point of consensus messaging. It’s not about “proving” human-caused global warming. It’s about expressing the state of scientific understanding of climate change, which is built on a growing body of evidence. Consensus messaging recognises the fact that people rely on expert opinion when it comes to complex scientific issues. Studies in 2011 and 2013 found that perception of scientific consensus is a gateway belief that has a flow-on effect to a number of other beliefs and attitudes. When people are aware of the high level of scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, they’re more likely to accept that climate change is happening, that humans are causing it and support policies to reduce carbon pollution. Another argument against consensus messaging is that public understanding of the climate issue has moved on from fundamental issues such as the consensus. The evidence says otherwise. Public surveys have found that the public are deeply unaware of the consensus. On average, the public think there’s a 50:50 debate. There are several contributors to this “consensus gap”, including mainstream media’s tendency to give contrarian voices equal weight with the climate science community. Funnily enough, a third objection to consensus messaging argues that we shouldn’t communicate consensus because public views have not moved on. In other words, the fact that public opinion about consensus hasn’t shifted over the last decade implies that consensus messaging is ineffective.  Dan Kahan argues that consensus is a polarizing message. Liberals are predisposed to respond positively to consensus messaging. Meanwhile, conservatives are more likely to reject the scientific consensus. Political ideology certainly does influence people’s attitudes towards climate change. The following graph shows data I’ve collected from a representative sample of Americans, asking them how many climate scientists agreed about human-caused global warming. The horizontal access in this graph represents political ideology (specifically, support for an unregulated free market, free of interference from government). Two important features jump out from this figure. First, the slope in the line represents the strong influence of political ideology. Conservatives (with stronger support for free markets) show a much lower perception of consensus than liberals. Second, even liberals have a low perception of consensus relative to the 97% consensus. Given liberals are predisposed to accept the consensus, this “liberal consensus gap” is a result of a lack of information and/or a surplus of misinformation. So there is still much work to do. Several decades of casting doubt on the consensus has contributed to maintaining the consensus gap. This is why communication experts urge scientists to communicate the 97% consensus. This approach is based on a growing body of evidence underscoring the important role of perceived consensus and the necessity of consensus messaging."
"“I have no theological objection” to nuclear power, Tony Abbott said on 1 December, responding to Julie Bishop’s relaunch of the right’s preferred “solution” to global warming this week.  Abbott’s choice of words is fascinating. On the face of it he’s suggesting that opposing nuclear power is a faith-based, rather than rational, view. But it is the right’s consistent promotion of a technology that has been shown repeatedly to be too slow, too costly and too risky (see, for instance, here and here) that is underpinned by several right wing articles of faith. It’s worth unpacking this credo, because it reveals what’s really going on when nuclear power is raised.  The first tenet is a truly theological one, based on a one-eyed reading of the Bible: “And God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” The US Christian right has long promoted this line from Genesis 1:28 as a Biblical critique of environmentalism. God is telling them, they believe, that we humans are entitled to do whatever we like with the Earth and its resources. There is, of course, a very different Biblical view. Thea Ormerod of the Australian religious response to climate change, among others, talks of the concept of “stewardship”, and the responsibility to look after God’s creation. But the “dominion mandate” dovetails so neatly with the modern industrial idea that humanity is separate from and dominant over nature that it has become a powerful aspect of the western materialist creation story. Nuclear power fits perfectly within a world view that sees splitting the atom as the apogee of human dominance over nature. Given its enormous and persistent waste problem, nuclear power is only acceptable if you believe that it is our right to pollute as we please. Abbott has explicitly referred to the dominion mandate, most notably in a speech about forestry early this year. Clearly, this theology influences his views on nuclear power. The second tenet is not canonical, unless you believe Jesus was making an ironic statement when he threw the money-lenders out of the temple. But the increasingly blind faith Abbott and his ilk invest in corporate capitalism has developed a distinctly theological aura.  While it is reasonable to reject climate science, and acceptable to deny declining reef health, it is heresy to question whether handing ever more power to corporate interests will benefit the rest of us. The privatisation of profit and socialisation of risk inherent in nuclear power only makes economic sense if you believe in the divine right of corporations. With multi-billion dollar cost blowouts in construction and decommissioning, the refusal of private insurance companies to cover risk, and a waste stream that will need to be managed for many times longer than our civilisation has so far existed, it’s basically a complex wealth transfer from citizens to corporations. Nuclear power’s great attraction for those who subscribe to this particular faith is that it would maintain the corporate grip on energy infrastructure at a time when diversified and distributed renewable energy systems threaten to democratise energy supply.  Energy regulators the world over are facing increasingly panicked demands from beleaguered fossil fuel companies to staunch the loss of market share as more and more people realise that solar power makes sense. In parts of the USA, there are even proposals to make going off the grid illegal. In this context, nuclear power is a godsend. The final tenet is the central one of conservative faith - that change is difficult, dangerous and unnecessary. This, as Naomi Klein’s latest book, This Changes Everything, points out is what makes climate change so threatening for the right. The clear message of accelerating global warming caused by the fuels that have allowed industrial consumerist capitalism to develop is that we have to change direction. If you want to deal with climate change – but your world view won’t let you contemplate changing the way we use energy, the way we consume, the way our society is structured – nuclear power provides a neat solution. It suggests that we can tackle climate change without really changing anything. A pity it’s not true. Not even the International Energy Agency believes it. But then neither, frankly, do many of its advocates. Spruiking nuclear power, for many on the right, is not about actually promoting its use. It’s far more important as a weapon in the culture war, promoting an idea which buttresses their three key articles of faith: that “man” has dominion over nature; that corporate might makes right; and that change must be avoided. Opposition to nuclear power is, I would emphasise, a rational position. The evidence is stacked against it. A suite of renewable energy options can be rolled out faster and cheaper and more safely, and they can supply our energy needs - so long as we also change our profligate lifestyles. But it is also an ethical position, based on a particular world-view; a view that we humans need to stop living as if there is no tomorrow, or there will be no tomorrow; a view that we can and should live as though all of us on this planet, human and non-human, now and in the future, matter. Support for nuclear power is based on a world-view, but it doesn’t have the benefit of also being backed by rational arguments. It is simply a fantasy of the right, a convenient prop they occasionally produce to pretend we can address climate change while changing nothing, and a weapon in their culture war."
"Curbing the world’s huge and increasing appetite for meat is essential to avoid devastating climate change, according to a new report. But governments and green campaigners are doing nothing to tackle the issue due to fears of a consumer backlash, warns the analysis from the thinktank Chatham House.  The global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all cars, planes, trains and ships combined, but a worldwide survey by Ipsos MORI in the report finds twice as many people think transport is the bigger contributor to global warming.  “Preventing catastrophic warming is dependent on tackling meat and dairy consumption, but the world is doing very little,” said Rob Bailey, the report’s lead author. “A lot is being done on deforestation and transport, but there is a huge gap on the livestock sector. There is a deep reluctance to engage because of the received wisdom that it is not the place of governments or civil society to intrude into people’s lives and tell them what to eat.”  The recent landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that dietary change can “substantially lower” emissions but there is no UN plan to achieve that. Past calls to cut meat eating by high-profile figures, from the chief of the UN’s climate science panel to the economist Lord Stern, have been both rare and controversial. Other scientists have proposed a meat tax to curb consumption, but the report concludes that keeping meat eating to levels recommended by health authorities would not only lower emissions but also reduce heart disease and cancer. “The research does not show everyone has to be a vegetarian to limit warming to 2C, the stated objective of the world’s governments,” said Bailey. The report builds on recent scientific studies which show that soaring meat demand in China and elsewhere could tip the world’s climate into chaos. Emissions from livestock, largely from burping cows and sheep and their manure, currently make up almost 15% of global emissions. Beef and dairy alone make up 65% of all livestock emissions. Appetite for meat is rocketing as the global population swells and becomes more able to afford meat. Meat consumption is on track to rise 75% by 2050, and dairy 65%, compared with 40% for cereals. By 2020, China alone is expected to be eating 20m tonnes more of meat and dairy a year. Two recent peer-reviewed studies calculated that, without severe cuts in this trend, agricultural emissions will take up the entire world’s carbon budget by 2050, with livestock a major contributor. This would mean every other sector, including energy, industry and transport, would have to be zero carbon, which is described as “impossible”. The Chatham House report concludes: “Dietary change is essential if global warming is not to exceed 2C.” The consumer survey in the report, covering 12 nations including the US, China, India, Brazil and the EU bloc, found a link between the awareness of climate change and its impacts and the willingness to change behaviour. Acceptance that human activities cause climate change was significantly higher in China, India and Brazil than in the US, UK and Japan. The good news, said Bailey, was that “the majority of future demand appears to be in the countries [like China and Brazil] that are the most receptive to change”. He said it was “pretty disappointing” that in developed countries, where meat and dairy eating is highest, awareness of livestock’s impact on the climate is low and willingness to change is low. Brigitte Alarcon, sustainable food policy officer at WWF said: “Our LiveWell project has shown we can cut a quarter of our climate emissions from the European food supply chain by eating more pulses, fruit and vegetables and by reducing our meat consumption. National governments should improve food education to encourage healthy eating habits and environmental sustainability as a first step.” A spokesman for the UK government said: “Greenhouse gas emissions from the UK agricultural industry have fallen by more than 20% since 1990. While food choices can have an impact on emissions, well managed livestock also provide many environmental benefits including supporting biodiversity.”  A separate survey by the Eating Better alliance, also published on Wednesday, shows that UK consumers are beginning to eat less meat. The YouGov poll found 20% saying they have cut the amount of meat they eat over the last year, with only 5% say they are eating more. Prof Keith Richards, at the University of Cambridge and one of the researchers behind the two key scientific studies, said: “This is not a radical vegetarian argument; it is an argument about eating meat in sensible amounts as part of healthy, balanced diets.”"
"The UK has been seen by some as a climate change leader, partly because of its early adoption of a legally binding target to reduce its 1990 levels of emissions by 80% by 2050.  In contrast, the US has been seen as a laggard, in both domestic and international arenas. While the recent US-China climate change agreement (in which the US has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 levels by 2025) may signal a change, it remains to be seen how successful the US will be at delivering on these commitments.  But do government attitudes to climate change influence corporate attitudes and practice on climate change?  We have recently completed a review of the climate change practices and processes of major retailers in the US and the UK. While certain of the sector’s activities and operations are regulated (ie vehicle efficiency standards) and others are influenced by wider climate change policy (ie through electricity prices), the sector’s overall emissions are not directly regulated, in either the US or the UK. Not surprisingly for a sector where marginal changes in prices can have a large impact on sales or profitability, we found energy prices to be an important influence on actions taken. Improving energy efficiency in buildings and transport dates back to at least the mid-1990s, for retailers on both sides of the Atlantic. However, while broadly the same actions (ie improving the efficiency of electrical equipment) have been taken, there is a noticeable difference in the outcomes that have been achieved.  Driven by the higher energy prices that have prevailed in the UK over the past decade, UK retailers have reduced their energy and/or emissions intensity by an average of approximately 4% per annum over periods of 5 or 7 years. In contrast, US retailers reduced their energy and/or emissions intensity by an average of slightly less than 3% per annum over the same time period.  Important though prices are, the political and policy context is also hugely important. In the UK, the 2005 to 2007 period was a critical tipping point. This period saw the publication of the fourth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the publication of the UK government sponsored Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System, the introduction of national policies directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and a significant increase in the level of UK and European business press attention on climate change. UK companies commented that at this point, they saw high energy prices and strong policy action on climate change as “inevitable”. Most UK retailers have now set long-term overall targets for their own operations. These targets, if achieved, could see UK retailers reducing the total greenhouse emissions from their operations and transport by more than 1.5% per year over the period through to 2020.  UK retailers also have a range of initiatives directed at reducing greenhouse emissions from their supply chains. The major supermarkets have established programmes to help their suppliers improve their environmental performance, and see these efforts as having the potential to deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  While UK retailers saw an alignment of pressures, US retailers were faced with a less clear cut picture, with strong political opposition to policy action on climate change, and energy prices continuing to be much lower than in Europe. As a result, they saw little need to go beyond a relatively short-term, narrowly defined approach to climate change.  The majority of US retailers expect their absolute emissions to in fact grow over time, with business growth swamping efficiency gains. In addition, US retailers appear to have paid relatively little attention to their supply chains. Where they have engaged with their suppliers, the focus is largely on those aspects that directly affect the retailer (ie reducing product packaging), rather than on issues such as production processes or supplier energy management.  It is clear from our research that government attitudes on climate change directly and indirectly affect the manner in which companies respond to climate change. Higher energy prices and strong political signals make it more likely that companies will take a proactive approach on climate change.  Put another way, if we want to see climate change leadership at the corporate level, we first need to see climate change leadership at the national level.

"Even as he continues to win plaudits from visiting Chinese and Indian leaders, the high priests and priestesses of the fourth estate are in full-throated rebellion against Tony Abbott. Defensive, embarrassing, timid, insular, clumsy, flawed, weird, cringeworthy – this is just a sampler of media comment on Abbott’s performance at the G20 in Brisbane. But it is perhaps better to see Abbott as someone who refuses to agree at all times with outspoken, self-appointed pressure groups that breed around controversial questions. He makes an inviting rhetorical target precisely because he embodies that down-to-earth quality in our national spirit that has been all but obliterated by the modern obsession with courting fashionable opinion. His bluntness – such as his defence of Big Coal or his threat to “shirtfront” Putin – takes him where mealy-mouthed politicians fear to tread.   I say this as someone who disagrees with his stance on Ukraine. It is one thing to try to subject the Russian-backed rebels to some scrutiny for 17 July; it is another thing for the leader of a middle power to issue dire threats and warnings to a nuclear power with vital strategic interests at stake in a region that has been in its sphere of influence for centuries. All things considered, however, Abbott’s diplomatic conduct in recent days has been defensible. Start with the China trade deal, a major victory for our exporters that will add tens of billions of dollars to the economy. The prime minister promised to clinch unprecedented and lucrative agreements with Japan, South Korea and China by the end of the year. His foreign affairs and trade team have achieved this goal with aplomb. All three nations account for about half of all our exports.  The critics were having a field day feasting on Abbott for daring to talk about his government’s domestic policy challenges; never mind that the leaders were invited to the G20 opening session to discuss how domestic politics impede a pro-growth reform agenda.  Then there is the G20 growth agreement itself, which will dramatically improve the lives of people all around the world, so long as nations deliver on their promises. Even Michael Gordon, one of Fairfax Media’s many Abbott critics, has conceded that for the first time the world’s richest economies have committed themselves to a specific (and ambitious) growth target and they have been prepared to allow independent bodies to scrutinise their approaches. We are told that on climate change, the G20 leaders spectacularly wrong-footed Abbott. Yet he has merely defended the national interest and kept faith with the Australian people who gave him an electoral mandate to abolish Julia Gillard’s widely unpopular carbon tax. We are also told that Paris is the moment when the world will come together to save us from an excess of greenhouse gas emissions. It’s a fair bet Abbott’s position will be vindicated at the United Nations climate talks next year. Shortly before Brisbane, Beijing concluded a bilateral accord with Washington in which they agreed (on a non-binding basis) to begin reducing their annual emissions by 2030. The understanding is clearly that, since Obama signed up to this deal (and indeed presented it as a triumph), he will not push the Chinese any further at next year’s meeting in Paris. Meanwhile, Obama needs to ask the US Congress to appropriate $3bn for the global climate fund. Republicans will oppose it, and many Democrats repudiated Obama’s energy agenda in the recent midterm elections. No member of the visiting Washington press corps, judging from the press conference on Sunday, evidently thinks the issue is an American priority. Congress won’t legislate a carbon tax or a national emissions trading scheme. As for China, their leaders’ priority is to grow their economy at 7-8% annually and to reduce poverty; and the cheapest way of doing so is via carbon energy (president Xi did not even mention climate change in his address to parliament yesterday.) True, Beijing is investing in renewable energy projects and piloting cap and trade schemes in some provinces. But China is also building a coal-fired power plant every 8-10 days and its net emissions continue to escalate steadily (on 1990 levels, Australia is set to cut its greenhouse gas emission by 4% by 2020.) Any “deal” at Paris will merely give China and India a free rein until the 2030s without any binding obligation to be monitored and scrutinised by the west on their actual behaviour. That is why Abbott is wise to make any Australian climate policies conditional on a legally binding, verifiable, enforceable and genuinely global agreement to replace the Kyoto protocol. Even the Germans have essentially done that.  What is shaping up now, as Benny Peiser of the London-based Global Warming Policy Forum predicts, is a huge blame game over the likely failure to agree to a post-Kyoto treaty. China and India will blame the west for its failure to deliver $100 bn per annum – yes, $100bn – that was promised at Copenhagen. Obama and the left will blame the Republicans. The EU will blame the Americans. Climate enthusiasts and developing nations will blame all and sundry.  And Abbott will look like a genius for keeping Australia on the margins of yet another climate summit fiasco. "
"Tony Abbott has defied global pressure to commit to the Green Climate Fund, designed to help poor countries adapt to climate change, because Australia is already spending $2.5bn on its domestic Direct Action fund and providing $10bn in capital to a so-called “green bank” – which he is trying to abolish. World leaders forced Australia to include stronger language about the Green Climate Fund in the G20 communique – Barack Obama pledged the US would contribute $3bn to it and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered $1.5bn – but soon after the conference was over Abbott indicated it wouldn’t make any immediate difference to Australia’s position.  Speaking after a meeting on Sunday night with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Abbott said Direct Action was already “quite a substantial fund”. “We also have a Clean Energy Finance Corporation which was established by the former government and there is $10bn in capital which has been allocated to this,” he said. “In addition to those two funds a proportion of our overseas aid, particularly in the Pacific, is allocated for various environmental schemes including schemes to deal with climate change. So, we are doing a very great deal and I suppose given what we are doing we don’t intend, at this time, to do more.” Abbott told world leaders at the Brisbane summit that as the leader of a major coal producer he would be “standing up for coal”. The communique references demanded by other leaders, including Obama, were reluctantly accepted by Australia at the last minute. They included a call for contributions to the Green Climate Fund that the prime minister has previously derided and for the “phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. An EU spokesman reportedly described the climate negotiations with Australia as being like “trench warfare”. Other officials said it had been “very difficult” and protracted. Speaking to the media after the summit, Abbott downplayed the importance of the fund. He took a similar line on the greenhouse reduction pledges unveiled by Obama and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, immediately before the summit. He said all nations “support strong action … to address climate change”, but added: “We are all going to approach this in our own way and there are a range of [climate] funds which are there.” Obama and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, both urged G20 countries to contribute to the Green Climate Fund, which is seen as critical to a successful outcome at crucial climate negotiations in Paris next year. In the end, at Australia’s insistence, the communique called for contributions to financing funds “such as the Green Climate Fund”. Obama said the US and Chinese agreement meant there was “no excuse for other nations” not to make similar commitments on greenhouse gas reductions. But Abbott said by his reading the deal “means 80% of China’s power needs in 2030 are still going to be provided by coal”. He said coal was critical to lifting 1.3 billion people out of poverty, and “what we need to do is to ensure that the coal-fired power stations we need are as efficient as possible”. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, also downplayed the deal earlier on Sunday. “Barack Obama has to get any initiative on climate change through a hostile US Congress,” he said. “So far he hasn’t had great success.” As Obama explained again on Sunday, the US “shaped that target based on existing authorities” to use Environment Protection Agency powers “rather than the need for additional congressional action”. Abbott began the closed-door discussion on energy on Sunday morning by telling the world leaders that “as the world’s largest producer of coal, I’d like to stand up for coal”, sources told Guardian Australia. Speaking to the press after the meeting, Abbott denied Australia had been forced into climate discussions, saying “the very first draft [of the G20 communique] talked about climate change, all the way through we have been talking about energy efficiency and climate change”. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the first draft did include climate change, but in very general terms. But European countries and the US argued until late on Saturday to force the host country to strengthen the words – including the commitment to the Green Climate Fund, which Abbott has previously said Australia would not support. Australia was also reluctant to include the reference to fossil fuel subsidies in the communique, but it was eventually included after forceful support from Obama. The communique calls on G20 members to “rationalise and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”."
"A world that does not manage to curb global warming is an insecure world. A series of recent reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it abundantly clear. If we do not succeed in staying below the target of keeping temperature rises below 2C over preindustrial levels, the consequences are likely to be far-reaching and disastrous. We will see a dramatic rise in sea levels, by up to a metre in this century alone, a greater frequency of violent storms, increased desertification, with hundreds of millions of people experiencing water scarcity, and radical changes in entire ecosystems. This will pose a serious threat to the livelihoods of large swathes of people, causing unprecedented refugee flows and, in the worst case, new conflicts and wars. Recently, military strategists around the world have declared that uncontrolled climate change constitutes a global security threat. In February this year, US secretary of state John Kerry called climate change “perhaps the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction”, and a threat to democracy and our entire way of life.  In May, 16 US generals, writing in a report entitled National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change, warned that climate change will pose at least as great a threat to national security as the Cold War or transnational terrorism. Economist Lord Nicholas Stern echoed this warning recently in The Guardian. Many people regard the UN climate summit in Paris next year as the last chance for the world to unite on a climate agreement that will enable us to meet the 2C target.  Little time remains before then, but there are vital stops along the way for the international community to demonstrate its commitment to addressing global warming. One was the recent G20 meeting in Brisbane, another is the pledging conference in Berlin this week, which aims to mobilise resources for the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF). The task of the GCF will be to support developing countries through measures to promote climate change adaptation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The new red-green government in Sweden has promised $580m (£370) to the GCF. This contribution, which covers the period 2015–2018, is the most ambitious contribution per capita of the countries that have so far announced their intention to support the GCF.  It is well known that in purely factual terms, climate change will have the greatest impact on countries that are already poor: countries around the equator and small impoverished Pacific islands that face the threat of disappearing completely or being laid waste by extreme drought or flooding. It is therefore imperative to show our solidarity with those who need economic support. At the same time, no country in the world will be immune to the consequences of climate change, and no country today can act alone to protect itself from global disasters. Sweden today is being severely tested by the strains imposed by the instability of the world around us. We receive unprecedented flows of refugees from wars and disaster, some of which have likely been caused by climate change.  This summer Sweden suffered exceptionally violent natural disasters – the largest forest fire in our history, and floods and torrential rain that destroyed houses and knocked out infrastructure. Similar disasters have occurred in the Balkans and the UK this year, while extreme waves caused astonishment this summer on the coasts of Spain and Portugal. The GCF is pivotal in furthering international momentum to tackle climate change - by strengthening mutual confidence among all the parties involved and catalysing new capital that can help the world switch to clean, renewable energy.  We should not forget that this fund will potentially create millions of new jobs and lead to development and prosperity. The recent New Climate Economy report indicates that $45 trillion needs to be invested in new energy infrastructure over the next 15 years, regardless of whether the energy is clean or dirty. The difference is that we will achieve a sustainable society if we choose clean.  Tackling climate change does not mean we should abstain from prosperity and development. Quite the contrary. The GCF is not a charity; it is an investment for our collective future, for a secure world where we can all enjoy the welfare that our unique living planet can actually give us.  The Swedish government hopes and expects that many more of the developed countries will put enough money into the new GCF this Thursday to allow it to send a real signal that the world is jointly taking its responsibility and that we believe that investments in clean and renewable energy are possible. We cannot continue on the same track any longer, when both scientists and military experts warn us so emphatically what will happen if we do so. There is another way. Let us take it. • Isabella Lövin is Sweden’s minister for international development cooperation"

"Yeb Saño, one of the most vocal critics of rich countries in international global warming negotiations, has not arrived at the latest UN climate conference in Lima and is believed to have been dropped by the Filipino government as its chief negotiator. The move coincides with the Philippines apparently leaving the ‘like minded developing countries’ (LMDC) group, a powerful bloc of nations regarded by the US and Europe as the main obstacle to a new global agreement.   Saño, who has headed the Filipino diplomatic delegation to the talks for three years and is director of the government’s climate change commission, became one of the few iconic figures in the 2012 talks after an emotional speech when he broke down in tears and called on rich countries to act urgently for the climate.  At the UN climate summit in Warsaw last year, Saño and 300 other delegates fasted for the duration of the talks when his father’s home city of Tacloban was flattened by Typhoon Yolanda, one of the world’s strongest recorded cyclones. Last month Sano walked 1,000km from the centre of the Filipino capital Manila to Tacloban. As another powerful typhoon developed in the Pacific ocean and headed towards the Philippines this week, neither Saño nor the Filipino government responded to calls. However, a video of Saño was published online on Monday, where he did not explain his absence at the Lima talks but said he would be fasting during the conference because he cared “about the future of this world” and to avert a “climate crisis”. NGOs said his absence was likely to be linked to his growing reputation and to rich countries’ hardening attitude to political opposition ahead of crucial meetings.  “[Saño’s absence] has certainly left many wondering if this could be due to pressure being brought to bear on small countries like the Philippines by those whose interests such powerful voices threaten,” said Friends of the Earth UK’s Asad Rehman.  Christian Aid’s senior climate change adviser, Mohamed Adow, said: “It is strange that he is not here to join us in Lima. Yeb’s absence is very curious given the significant leadership role he has played at these talks, fighting for the rights of people suffering from climate change. People are scratching their heads as to why Yeb is not on the delegation anymore. He is a ray of light in an often dark process and I hope he has not been excluded from the delegation because some people don’t like the important truth he tells.” Voltaire Alferez, co-ordinator of Aksyon Klima Pilipinas (AKP), anetwork of more than 40 Filipino organisations working on climatechange, said the government should explain why he was not in Lima. “Weare at a loss as to why Saño is not present here in Lima. His absenceis greatly felt, especially by civil society members who he inspiredin Warsaw. They must focus on the negotiations instead of bickeringamong themselves.” There is a long history of industrialised countries exerting strong pressure on poorer countries in advance of major climate negotiations. Veteran negotiator Bernarditas Muller was “neutralised” ahead of the Copenhagen meeting in 2009 after she was identified as a leading opponent of the US position and dropped by the Filipino government.  Muller had gained a reputation as a “dragon woman” who would not yield to intense diplomatic pressure in negotiations. She now represents the Philippines on the Green Climate Fund, a key institution which developed countries have recently pledged $10bn (£6.4bn) to, and which is intended to raise $100bn a year to help developing countries adapt to climate change and to mitigate emissions.  The Philippines, a former US colony and important development, trade and security partner to the US, has “a special relationship” with Washington. It receives over $6bn a year in US foreign investment. The LMDC group represents more than 50% of the world’s population and includes China, Venezuela, India and Indonesia. They traditionally negotiate as a group until the last few hours of the talks. The Lima meeting, which has entered its second day, is the last summit before countries expect to sign a binding climate deal next year in Paris. Politicians from over 190 countries will arrive next week to take over negotiations. "

" The UK will give £720m to an international fund to help poor nations cope with climate change, the Guardian can reveal.  The UK commitment is greater than that of Germany or France and is only surpassed by the US and Japan. The deadline for contributions to the UN’s green climate fund (GCF) is Thursday and achieving its $10bn target is seen as a vital step towards rich and poor nations sealing a deal to tackle global warming in 2015. The donation comes at a sensitive time in domestic UK politics. The parliamentary byelection in Rochester is expected to see the Conservatives lose the seat to the UK Independence Party (Ukip), which wants to slash overseas development aid, as do some backbench Conservative MPs. Earlier in the week, the prime minister, David Cameron, betrayed his anxiety over the issue by repeatedly stressing that the funding was not new money, but had already been set aside for the purpose. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary, told the Guardian: “A little-Englander approach, an isolationist approach, is going to be a disaster for the people of Britain. Climate change does not recognise borders.” Experts warned recently that global warming would affect health, business and food production in the UK, with a senior military figure also warning that armed forces would be unable to provide global security if climate change went unchecked.  “There is a huge amount at stake,” said Davey. “Anyone who has followed the UN negotiations knows the poorest and most vulnerable countries on the planet are looking to developed countries to help them survive climate change. If we do not do this, I don’t think we will get a global deal. It is as simple as that.”  He said: “[Critics] do not realise the vital work this money is for. This is about saving lives and we have a duty to do this.” Examples, he said, were helping low-lying nations cope with rising sea levels and subsistence farmers cope with failing crops.  The contribution to the GCF will come from an existing UK climate aid fund, which will spend £3.9bn from 2011 to 2016.   Asked why the UK was offering the equivalent of $1.13bn, more than the $1bn pledged each by Germany and France, Davey said the UK would only pay the extra if other countries came forward to contribute. “We are doing that to encourage others to give,” he said.  So far, 14 other nations including Mexico and South Korea have contributed to the GCF, bringing the total with the UK contribution to about $9bn. Australia, led by the climate sceptic Tony Abbott, has refused to give money to the GCF. Meena Raman, from the NGO Third World Network and an official observer on the GCF board, said: “Given the scale of the challenge at hand for developing countries, the UK contribution is very small.”  She said the £10bn likely to be pledged for the GCF for the period 2015-18 was “backsliding” compared to the ambition in 2009, which was for $10bn a year. Subsequent UN talks have set a goal of $100bn a year by 2020, she said. Sir David King, the UK foreign secretary’s special representative for climate change, told the Guardian last week that the billions spent by the UK on overseas climate aid were “critically important” to creating the trust between nations required to seal a global deal.  Sweden has pledged $0.5bn to the GCF and Isabella Lövin, international development minister, said: “The GCF is not a charity; it is an investment for our collective future, for a secure world.”"
"The European Union (EU)’s delegation at the climate change conference in Lima has argued that legally binding cuts applying to all countries are necessary and should be adopted by 2015 and entered into force by 2020. “The EU is of the mind that legally binding mitigation targets are the only way to provide the necessary long-term signal, the necessary confidence to the investors ... and provide credibility in the low carbon transition worldwide,” said Elina Bardram, head of the EU delegation at the conference, which opened on Monday.   “We’re not convinced that an alternative approach could provide the same signals that would be sufficient to deliver the global momentum,” Bardram told the Guardian, adding the EU would seek to take a leadership role in negotiations for an agreement which would be “owned by all parties.” It is the first time an EU official has publicly gone on the record on legally binding targets, stating the EU’s negotiating position at the Lima conference, which is intended to deliver the first draft of an accord to cut carbon emissions and stave off dangerous climate change. The accord is expected to be signed at a UN conference in Paris next year. The EU appears to have toughened its stance faced with major nations which claim they could not impose economy wide targets. Bardram hinted that such positions could stall the negotiating process in the lead-up to the Paris meeting. “We don’t want to get to Paris and realise that the targets and the contributions did not add up to what we needed,” Bardram told the Guardian, adding that the EU wanted the 2015 agreement to have “legal force through robust rules, procedures and institutions, to ensure long-term certainty and accountability”. The EU’s stance is at odds with the US position which favours the ‘buffet option’, that would contain some legally binding elements but allow countries to determine the scale and pace of their emissions reductions, even if this this calls into question the aim of keeping temperature rises below 2C, the level that countries have agreed to limit warming to. The US delegation at the conference in Lima were unavailable for comment. “What the United States is putting on the table is basically the Wild West,” Asad Rehman of Friends of the Earth told the Guardian at the conference. “Having a deregulated climate system, having countries just make any pledge they want is a recipe for disaster. What we need is science-based rigorous regulations, it’s the only way are going to tackle this climate crisis,” he said. The US pledged to cut its emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 in a deal with China last month. The EU in October agreed to binding 40% cuts by 2030 from 1990 levels. Rehman said both pledges fell short of previous commitments, adding that the EU should be spending its “political capital” to challenge the US’s approach on deregulation as well as making sure Canada and Australia’s stance of “ignoring climate science doesn’t pollute these climate talks”. But the UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said a “gradual approach would be needed to get countries to make their independent nationally determined contributions [countries’ pledges on emissions cuts],” adding it would be more of an “art than a science because there are no environmental police”."

"The Canadian government has revealed it will give $265m to a UN fund aimed at helping the world’s poorest countries invest in clean energy technologies and cope with the effects of climate change. The announcement came late on Thursday after a Berlin conference where nearly $9.3 billion was pledged to the Green Climate Fund by 21 countries.  Rated the world’s 11th largest economy by the World Bank in 2013, the offer is significantly lower than other major developed countries, but will be seen as significant given the government’s recent hostility to climate change talks at the UN. In a statement, environment minister Leona Aglukkaq said the announcement demonstrated leadership and Canada’s “commitment” to a UN climate pact, scheduled to be agreed in Paris next December. “The Green Climate Fund’s strong focus on helping the poorest countries with adaptation and promoting private sector investment will play a key role in addressing climate change globally,” she said. “We will continue to protect our environment and support our economy as we move towards a new climate agreement in 2015 that must include all major economies and major emitters.”"
"2071 is not a play, it’s a lecture, read from an autocue in a nervous but poised performance by Chris Rapley, professor of climate science at University College, London. What’s frustrating about it is the limits it sets itself. The prof, almost by way of apology, reminds us towards the end of just over an hour, that science’s job is to inform not arbitrate. But theatre’s job is to do more than inform. It has, potentially, a moral momentum, a power to move, shake and stir. This lecture was weirdly balanced between the alarming and the soporific. Its elegantly swirling black, white and scarlet computer graphics (designer Chloe Lamford) mesmerically illustrated melting glaciers, collapsing ice shelves – in “unprecedented retreat” – and rising sea levels. The professor never stirred from his chair. I watched several people drop off to sleep in the stalls, becalmed just when they should been galvanised.  And this was a pity because Rapley’s endeavour, under Katie Mitchell’s dedicated direction (a successor to Stephen Emmott’s Ten Billion, an exploration of population explosion), is a brave new departure about the brave new world we hope will never arrive. It was an evening to make the craziest of climate change deniers blush. Yet its only engaging moment was when Rapley described holding in his hand an offcut of ice (he made many visits to Antarctica when he was director of the British Antarctic Survey) and watching it melt, in awe that it was releasing air from the beginning of time. Even as a scientist, he explained, he was moved. It was also made clear that 2071 is personally significant to him as the year in which his eldest grandchild will arrive at his present age. His resolve, otherwise maintained throughout, to detach science from feeling did the subject no favours. The conclusion was clear: we need to make sure the global temperature rise does not exceed 2C, and this will “require the greatest collective action in history”, but he was perfunctorily non-crusading about detail – I’d have liked a bolder prescription. Still, what is heartening is that Rapley emerged not as a prophet of doom but as a professor of cautious hope. Wildefire review – an unexpectedly sympathetic look at the Met Queen Coal review – ruptured relationships in a former mining community Royal Ballet triple bill – a purely surface rendering of Auden’s Age of Anxiety The Shape of the Table review – David Edgar’s power play proves prophetic Stewart Lee review – tricksy gags about liberals, rightwingers and ‘the Islams’ Solomon and Marion review – a knockout of a play"

"This is what your atmosphere looks like in carbon dioxide (CO2). And it’s not a pretty sight. Nasa provides a stark and stunning view of a year in the life of our planet as humans continue to emit greenhouse gases that warm the planet. The animation comes courtesy of one of the highest-resolution computer models in existence. Since the industrial revolution, CO2 has been rising in the atmosphere due to human activities. Seasonal cycles mean that CO2 rises progressively throughout autumn and winter before peaking in late spring. At that point, a flurry of plant growth in the northern hemisphere — where most land is located — draws CO2 levels down over the summer before the cycle begins again. That process is made clear in the saw-toothed Keeling Curve, which shows ever rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. This past spring, it topped 400 parts per million for three months, a symbolic milestone. But while the Keeling Curve is derived from atmospheric CO2 measurements in one location, a new dataset and visual from Nasa makes clear that CO2 isn’t uniformly distributed across the world. By feeding ground measurements of CO2 and weather data into a high resolution computer model, scientists are able to show in some of the finest detail just how CO2 moves throughout the atmosphere over the course of a year. Winds play a major role in ushering CO2 around the planet just as they do storms. You’d even be forgiven for believing the animation simply shows clouds. But beyond the obvious seasonal cycle that hints at CO2, there’s also another sign you’re watching something other than storms swirling around the globe. Long tails of CO2 extend from the US, China and Europe, the world’s three largest emitters. The deep reds and purples show the highest concentrations of emissions coming from these locations as well as the pooling of CO2 in the Arctic throughout the spring. Emissions from rainforests in central Africa and South America also show up due to forest fires of both natural and human causes. But ultimately, it’s human emissions that have thrown a pretty finely-tuned system out of whack. The modelling effort, along with new data pouring in from Nasa’s latest CO2-monitoring satellite, will give scientists better insights into sources and sinks of CO2, but the current effort provides one of the clearest views yet of just how humans are having a large-scale impact on the atmosphere and the planet it surrounds."
"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has intensified pressure on Australia to say how deeply it will cut carbon emissions, telling a Sydney audience “all countries” should reveal their targets “in the first quarter [of 2015] at the very latest”. Giving the annual Lowy lecture, Merkel said on Monday the world must put a brake on climate change or “it will have devastating consequences for all of us”.  “Climate change knows no borders. It will not stop before the Pacific islands and the whole of the international community here has to shoulder a responsibility to bring about a sustainable development,” Merkel said. The call for greenhouse gas targets to be announced early was included – reportedly against the wishes of the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott – in the G20 summit’s final communique. An early announcement is seen as a key condition for the success of November’s climate conference in Paris. The G20 communique included a little wriggle room, asking parties to reveal their targets early next year only if “ready to do so”, but was seen as a substantial concession by the summit’s Australian hosts. In a wide-ranging address, Merkel tied “the terrible disease” of Ebola, China’s rise (“peaceful and without any ruptures”) and the civil war raging in eastern Ukraine to her theme of the importance of European institutions after a blood-soaked century of conflict on the continent. “We have to see that in Europe too there are still forces that refuse to accept the concept of mutual respect and of settling conflicts with democratic and legal means,” she said.  The annexation of Crimea by Russian-linked forces was “a clear violation of international law”. “Russia in this way violates territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Ukraine as a state … After the horror of two world wars and the end of the Cold War, this calls the whole of the European peaceful order into question,” Merkel said. Mindful of history, particularly in a year commemorating the outbreak of the first world war, she said Germany would “spare no effort to promote a diplomatic solution to the conflict”. “We need to have the necessary patience for an uphill battle,” she said. She touched on a restive UK, whose Conservative leader, David Cameron, is distancing himself from the European Union over the free movement of labour and has promised a referendum on EU membership if his party regains power at next year’s election. “What the British decide to do is something they have to decide for themselves,” Merkel said. “But I hope this drifting away will not happen … It is most important for us to have the United Kingdom in the union.” It was a high-powered audience, dotted with business leaders, former prime ministers, students and diplomatic officials. The presence of the institute’s namesake and benefactor, Frank Lowy, whose father died in Auschwitz, added poignancy to the German leader’s call for international order. Merkel even managed a quip across the language barrier, answering a question on the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden, that the United States had spied on her and other German officials. “I think the political class in Berlin doesn’t need to be supervised and monitored by intelligence services in order to find out what they’re thinking,” she said. “Just go to lunch with them, go to dinner with them, or read the papers.”"
"UN climate negotiations opening in Lima on Monday have the best chance in a generation of striking a deal on global warming, diplomats say. After a 20-year standoff, diplomats and longtime observers of the talks say there is rising optimism that negotiators will be able to secure a deal that will commit all countries to take action against climate change.  The two weeks of talks in Peru are intended to deliver a draft text to be adopted in Paris next year that will commit countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the economic development of poor countries. Diplomats and observers of the UN climate negotiations said recent actions by the US and China had injected much-needed momentum. “I have never felt as optimistic as I have now,” said Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, which are sinking as sea levels rise in the Pacific. “There is an upbeat feeling on the part of everyone that first of all there is an opportunity here and that secondly, we cannot miss it.” Beyond Lima, there is growing evidence of the dangers of climate change, and of countries’ failure to act. The UN environment programme warned earlier this month that industrialised countries were falling short of the emissions reductions needed to prevent warming of 2C above pre-industrial levels, the goal set by world leaders. Carbon dioxide emissions are expected to reach a record high of 40bn tonnes in 2014. Meanwhile, 2014 is shaping up to be the hottest on record. Observers, however, said there was fresh optimism surrounding the Lima talks after the US and China declared on 12 November that they would work together to cut carbon pollution. Under the deal, China committed to cap its output of carbon pollution by 2030 or earlier and to increase its use of zero emission energy to 20% by 2030. The US agreed to reduce its emissions by between 26% and 28% from their 2005 levels by 2025. The EU, the next biggest polluter after the US and China, earlier pledged to cut emissions by 40% from their 1990 levels by 2030. Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official, said the commitments, which have been made well in advance of a March 2015 deadline, had given the talks a boost. “It is hugely encouraging that well ahead of next year’s first-quarter deadline, countries have already been outlining what they intend to contribute to the Paris agreement. This is also a clear sign that countries are determined to find common ground,” she said in a statement. Todd Stern, the US state department’s climate change envoy, said the US-China deal could push other big polluters such as India, Japan, Brazil and Russia to come forward with their own post-2020 targets. That in turn boosted prospects for a good outcome in Paris. “I think it will spur countries to come forward with their own targets,” he said. “Generally if you are holding stock in the Paris negotiations your stock went up.” Andrew Steer, the president of the World Resources Institute, an environmental thinktank in Washington, said the US-China deal had changed the atmosphere surrounding the talks. “There is in the air a sense of momentum,” he said. “You’ve already got commitments of about half of all the greenhouse gas emissions that need to be reduced.” The deal likely to be done in Paris will likely be a hotchpotch of targets such as those announced by the three top carbon polluters, according to an analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The test for Lima will be the degree to which negotiators can corral those separate action plans from up to 190 countries into a single agreement. If the talks are to succeed, they will have to come up with a draft text that outlines the structure of that agreement - how to ensure countries commit to deep enough cuts to limit warming to the 2C goal, and how to verify their actions. The US is pushing for a deal that would avoid setting emissions reduction targets that are legally binding under international law, because that would set up a clash with congress. Many developing countries, however, insist on legally binding targets. They also argue that only the industrialised countries should have to cut emissions. The negotiators will also try to ramp up pledges for the Green Climate Fund, which was set up to help developing countries deal with climate change. So far, the fund has raised $9.7bn (£6.2bn) from 22 countries, just short of its initial $10bn target. The fund is woefully behind its goal of mobilising $100bn a year in public and private finance by 2020."
"Next December, 196 nations will meet in Paris to agree a course of action to respond to climate change. They will do so under the auspices of the UN framework convention on climate change. This is an international treaty negotiated at the Earth summit in Rio in 1992 with the objective to “stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system”. The discussions in Paris in 2015 will be informed by the latest climate science. In our play 2071, which recently completed its inaugural run at the Royal Court theatre in London, directed by Katie Mitchell, we explore the science, its implications and the options before us. A key aim is to leave the audience better placed to participate in the public discourse, in which we all need to play a part. Climate change is a controversial subject that can raise strong emotions. We are all susceptible to being less open-minded and rational about it than we may appreciate. The climate system is very complex, yet its discussion is often oversimplified. There are gaps in our knowledge, and many scientific uncertainties, some of which are fundamentally unknowable. This makes it extremely difficult to predict precisely what the future holds and to determine exactly what actions, if any, to take. In addition there are economic considerations, political implications and ethical questions that further complicate the way forward. In 2071 we describe how satellites allow us to probe and map our planet’s key components – atmosphere, oceans, ice, and land – in unprecedented ways. By using computer models to bring together the space data with a myriad measurements made in situ, and by combining these with our understanding of underlying physical laws, it is possible to begin to make sense of what is observed. This provides a grand perspective of the Earth’s system as a whole, of its component parts and the interconnections between them. The system behaves in complex and often counterintuitive ways. But the fundamental principles of it are quite simple: its component parts interact with each other such that, over time, the amount of energy leaving the planet is equal to the amount entering it from the Sun. The interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the ice on land and sea drive the natural variability of the climate. The system is very responsive. Even a small change in one component can trigger a chain of consequences in the other parts. When such changes alter the energy balance, the effects are felt throughout the entire system, while it adjusts to reach a new balance.   Since the majority of inbound solar energy is absorbed by the oceans, which cover 70% of the planet’s surface and are dark, any imbalance should be most readily observable there. Sea levels rise as water temperature increases, acting as a global thermometer. By combining data gleaned from beach structures and archaeological data, we know that during the latter part of the Holocene, the unusually stable climatic period the planet has undergone since the end of the last Ice Age, sea-level changes did not exceed 0.2mm per year. Information from tide gauges, and more recently, satellite radars, show that in the late 19th century, sea levels began to rise. Over the 20th century the rate of rise averaged 1.8mm per year. Over the last two decades, the rate has further increased to 3.3mm per year. This may not seem much, but it is geologically significant. The current rate is approaching the 10mm per year which occurred during the transition from the last Ice Age to the current warm interglacial, a major climatic shift. And it is occurring during the warm interglacial, at a time unrelated to the natural ice age cycle. In 1978 John Mercer, a US glaciologist, described how, in a warming world, a successive collapse of ice shelves extending down the Antarctic Peninsula might occur. He suggested that this would be a warning sign of a more significant sequence of events to come. The Antarctic Peninsula connects to an area of the Antarctic called West Antarctica, where the massive ice sheet sits on bedrock that is up to 2km below sea level. Mercer’s concern was that if the successive collapse reached this far, the pressure of the warmer water at depth would lift the ice sheet, causing water to penetrate deeper and deeper below the ice, reducing friction between the ice and rock, leading to an unstoppable collapse. This would result in a rise in sea levels over time of many metres, as the total volume of ice in West Antarctica is equivalent to a six-metre rise. Since the 1990s, a successive series of ice shelf collapses has occurred along the peninsula, and parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are now accelerating into the ocean. And in the northern hemisphere, the satellite and surface data show that the loss of ice from the Greenland ice sheet increased by 600% over a decade following the 1990s. It is estimated that, at present, the melting of ice sheets and glaciers contributes to about half of the observed sea level rise. Apart from a small contribution from human use of aquifers, the rest of the sea level rise is due to thermal expansion – the oceans are warming. The greenhouse effect The atmospheric trace gases – water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide – provide an explanation of the planetary energy imbalance. These gases are present in relatively small quantities in our atmosphere, but they have a significant impact on the temperature of the planet since they obstruct the loss of heat from the surface as it passes upwards. This effect, known as the greenhouse effect, causes the Earth’s surface to have an average temperature of 15C. Without it, the surface would be 15C below freezing. Ice cores drilled from ice sheets and glaciers in the Antarctic and Greenland provide a means of measuring past changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Each year the snowfall creates a layer that compacts to ice and traps bubbles of the contemporary air. The deepest ice cores extracted from the Antarctic are more than 3km long and contain a record stretching back 800,000 years. By melting the ice and measuring the ratios of different atomic isotopes in the water, a history of global temperature can be derived. The relationship between the trace gases and temperature can then be studied. During each recent cold phase, when on average global temperatures have decreased by 5C, and vast ice sheets have built up over northern high latitudes, the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere dipped to about 180 parts per million. In the warm phases it peaked at around 300 ppm. This year, the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere passed 400 ppm. The rise over the last century is already 100 ppm – the same as the natural change between an ice age and an interglacial warm period, but at a rate more than 100 times faster. And it is in the “warm” direction of increased concentration not experienced by the planet at any point over the last 800,000 years based on the ice core data, and probably not over the two million years judging by the geological record. This has occurred because the global carbon cycle has been disrupted. The cycle consists of large annual exchanges between the carbon reservoirs of the atmosphere, the land biosphere, the lithosphere (the rocky surface layer of the planet) and the ocean. The exchanges are much greater in magnitude than our own carbon emissions – but, prior to industrialisation, they were in balance. However, in 1712, the invention of the Newcomen steam engine started a chain reaction of innovation, technology and science that spread across the globe. This revolution built the modern world. It was fuelled using cheap, accessible and convenient fossil energy. This has led us to the point where we are currently burning 10,000 million tonnes of carbon per year – a figure that is increasing at a rate of 2% per year. To date, we have burned an estimated 530,000 million tonnes of carbon. A quarter of the resulting CO2 has been absorbed by vegetation on land, which has bloomed as a result, and just over a quarter by the ocean, which has become more acidic. The remainder will stay in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years because it takes that long for natural processes – mainly rock weathering – to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Consequently, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen by 40%. The energy imbalance revealed by the ocean, confirmed by rising temperatures and loss of ice, and explained by the disrupted carbon cycle, is evidently being driven by us. It is the unwitting result of our use of fossil fuels. The evidence seems compelling. But since the implications are sufficiently profound, a deeper evaluation is merited. This is the task given to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was set up in 1988 by the UN environment programme and the World Meteorological Organisation. Its job is to provide a comprehensive summary of the scientific data to inform the policy decisions of the UN framework convention on climate change. IPCC working group I reviews and assesses the physical science information relevant to human-induced climate change. Its most recent report – the fifth – was released in September 2013. It is arguably the most audited scientific document in history. The work was led by 209 scientists, who are regarded as the world experts in their fields. They were supported by more than 600 contributing authors from 32 countries and 50 review editors from 39 countries. Of the tens of thousands of publications sifted more than 9,200 were cited. The authors responded to 54,677 comments from 1,089 reviewers worldwide. So what do they conclude? The conclusions of the IPCC Concerning the atmosphere, each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the northern hemisphere the 30 years from 1983 to 2012 were likely to have been the warmest in the last 1,400 years. The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature measurements show a warming of 0.8C from 1850 to 2012. They note that despite the warming at and near the surface, the upper atmosphere has cooled, ruling out the Sun as the cause. They report that the rates of loss of ice from the world’s glaciers and from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have all increased dramatically. While glacier losses have increased globally by about 20%, the ice sheet losses increased by as much as 600% between the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. Summer minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic decreased over the last 30 years between 9% and 14% per decade. There is evidence that this level of ice retreat is unprecedented in the last 1,450 years. By contrast, winter sea ice extent in the Antarctic has increased slightly, at a rate of about 1.5% per decade. This appears to be driven by changes in the Southern Ocean winds, which have intensified in response to the planetary energy imbalance. They report that ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010. They confirm that the ocean has absorbed about 30% of the cumulative anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, causing it to become progressively more acidic. More recently, the IPCC released its overall synthesis report. This states: “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, [and] sea level has risen.” It observes that: “In recent decades, changes in the climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to the changing climate.” On the causes of climate change, the IPCC says: “It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 [to] 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.”  It continues: “The best estimate of human-induced contributions to warming is similar to the actual warming observed.” In other words, there is evidence that all the warming that has occurred since 1950 is due to human actions. It concludes: “Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, which together with adaptation can limit climate change risks.” John Kerry, the US secretary of state, summarised the working group I findings as follows: “Boil down the IPCC report and here’s what you find: climate change is real, it’s happening now, human beings are the cause of the transformation, and only action by human beings can save the world from its worst impacts.” The cut-off date for published material considered by IPCC working group I was July 2013. But there have been some important results since. Evidence from the Argo floats, a system of 3,500 buoys deployed throughout the world’s oceans, shows that despite an 18-year pause in the rate of surface and atmospheric temperature rise, energy has continued to accumulate in the oceans unabated, with the prospect that some of it will be released to the atmosphere in the future. New data from the CryoSat satellite show the recent rate of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has doubled in three years. Some experts have concluded that the loss of ice from the West Antarctic ice sheet is now irreversible and that this will raise sea level by 1 to 2 metres in as little as a few hundred years. Based on a combination of scientific analysis, assessments of the impacts and related value judgments, the nations negotiating under the terms of the UN framework convention have set a limit beyond which climate change will be “dangerous”. That limit is 2C above the pre-industrial average. We are currently at 0.8C. Two-thirds of that increase has occurred since 1980. In order to stay below the 2C “guardrail”, human carbon emissions have to drop to 50% of the present level by 2050 and thereafter drop to zero. This would mean leaving 75% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. They would become economically worthless. The temperature at which the system will stabilise is determined by the total quantity of carbon we emit to the atmosphere, not the rate at which it’s emitted. So reducing carbon emissions to zero will not lower temperature; it will just prevent the temperature rising beyond the 2C level. Temperature will then remain at that level for a very long time because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. This sets a limit on the total carbon that we can burn. The IPCC calculates this to be about 800 gigatons of carbon. They estimate that we have already burned 530 gigatons. This leaves 270 gigatons for us to use. At our current rate, which is 10 gigatons of carbon a year, we have 27 years left, after which time carbon emissions would need to cease. Suppose we begin reducing our emissions next year and don’t exceed the overall 800 gigaton limit; then CO2 concentration will stabilise at 450 parts per million. Temperature will take longer to stabilise because it responds to CO2 concentration – but it will eventually stabilise at 2C. The oceans will continue to warm and the ice will continue to melt – so the sea level will continue to rise. It will take hundreds of years but will eventually stabilise at a level, based on evidence from past warmings, about 2 to 3 metres higher than today. If we leave it longer to start reducing emissions, we will have to reduce them more rapidly to avoid exceeding the overall 800 gigaton limit. Calculations show that if we leave it until 2020 – only five years away – the subsequent reductions would be of the order of 6% per year to stay within the 2C limit. 6% may not sound much, but annual reductions of carbon emissions greater than 1% have happened only during economic recession or upheaval. The UK conversion from coal to gas and the French conversion to nuclear in the 1970s and 80s achieved reductions of 1% per year. A temporary 5% reduction was achieved in the Soviet Union when it collapsed. Japan recently achieved a 15% reduction when its nuclear power stations were shut down, and demand fell as a result of a national appeal, after the Fukushima disaster. The 6% annual rate of reduction required is global. We in the developed world have to reduce emissions even more rapidly to accommodate growth in the developing world. To achieve the necessary reduction will require a collaborative effort on a global scale. Time is running out The aim of next December’s meeting in Paris is to forge a deal to put the world onto a path to a 2C maximum rise. The new agreement aims to obtain credible and fair emission reductions and legally binding commitments from all countries – with the most advanced economies making the most ambitious commitments. In the lead-up to Paris 2015, Barack Obama and Chinese president Xi Jinping have announced joint measures to fight climate change. The US aims to reduce its carbon emissions to 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – nearly doubling its previous commitments. Despite not having signed up to Kyoto or Copenhagen, the US is already on track to cut its emissions by 17% between 2005 and 2020. China, partly driven by serious air pollution problems, has committed to cutting the proportion of energy it generates from coal and has set up pilot carbon markets and low carbon zones. It has set a date of 2030 for “peak” emissions and has pledged to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to around 20% by 2030, from less than 10% today. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has committed to expand solar energy to provide electricity to 300 million people who have no access to power at present. The EU has agreed a package to achieve a 40% reduction in domestic emissions. It aims to boost the use of renewable energy to 27% and to increase energy efficiency by at least 27%. The UK Climate Change Act, passed in 2008 with cross-party support, is the world’s first long-term, legally binding, national framework for reducing emissions – setting five-year carbon budgets to cut UK emissions by 80% by 2050. Around the world, in recent years, almost 500 climate-related laws have been passed in 66 of the world’s largest emitting countries. In 2005 the mayors of the worlds 40 largest “megacities” – including London – met and formed the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. They have taken 4,734 actions to tackle climate change, over three-quarters of which have been implemented. Many individuals have taken measures to reduce their own climate-related impacts by making changes in their personal, professional and public lives – installing solar panels, increasing the energy efficiency of their homes, vehicles and appliances, using public transport and avoiding unnecessary travel, changing diet and by choosing to forgo activities that generate emissions. They have encouraged changes to be made in their workplaces and written to their MPs. They have sought to educate themselves about the issue and to talk about it to their friends, families and communities. Around the world, renewable power capacity grew at its strongest ever pace in 2013 and now produces 22% of world energy. More than $250bn was invested in “green” generating systems in 2013, although the growth is expected to slacken, partly because western politicians are seeking to reduce financial incentives. The growth rate of windfarms and solar plants in China, India and an array of smaller developing nations is starting to outpace that in the richest ones. This explains why investors are increasingly confident and keen to put their money on alternative energy. But despite all these measures, global carbon emissions continue to rise. To achieve the necessary reduction in carbon emissions will require the invention and mass roll-out of new technologies that do not exist yet. However, my experiences as director of the Science Museum from 2007-10, exploring the legacy of technical innovation on public display and held in its reserve collection, and of working with engineers on space projects during the exhilarating era of the 70s and 80s, convinces me that human ingenuity is unbounded and that technological advances can be very rapid. My hope lies with the engineers. But the right conditions need to be in place for innovation to occur. Progress is hard when other economic drivers inhibit the transformation. Fossil fuels are estimated by the International Energy Agency to receive subsidies of $500bn per year, six times the incentives to develop renewables. Suppose we fail to take the action needed to stay below the 2C guardrail. The IPCC working group I predicts that by the end of the century, if measures to mitigate emissions are weak, we could have committed to more than a 4C rise. No nation would be immune to the impacts of that level of climate change. Our infrastructure was built for the climate system we inherited and is not designed to cope with the climate system we are provoking. Our food and water supplies, housing, industry – our entire wellbeing and prosperity – depend on access to energy. And our primary source, at present, is fossil fuel. So we are confronted with a need to totally transform the world’s energy system. At the same time we need to ensure energy security, equity, sustainability and growth. So what does the future hold? I look at my eldest grandchild who will reach the age I am now in 2071. I encourage her to be an engineer. We are all dependent on energy. Almost everything we do depends on it. There will be carbon atoms that we each generate today that will still be in the air in 2071, in the air that my granddaughter will breathe. Science can inform, but it cannot arbitrate, it cannot decide. Science can say that if we burn another half-trillion tons of carbon the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide will go up by another 100 ppm and that will almost certainly lead to a warming of the planet greater than 2C, with major disruption of the climate system and huge risks for the natural world and human wellbeing. But it can’t answer moral questions. Do we care about the poor? Do we care about future generations? Do we see the environment as part of the economy, or the economy as part of the environment? The whole point about climate change is that, despite having been revealed by science, it is not really about science. It is about what sort of world we want to live in and what kind of future we want to create. Chris Rapley CBE is professor of climate science at University College London and previously director of the Science Museum, London, and director of the British Antarctic Survey. He chairs the London Climate Change Partnership. In 2008 he was awarded the Edinburgh Science Medal for “a significant contribution to the understanding and wellbeing of humanity”. Duncan Macmillan is a writer, director and lecturer. His production of 1984, created with Robert Icke, played in the West End this year."
"It’s been an extraordinary autumn. Despite the battering from wind and rain in October and November, the leaves of many trees are still hanging on. It has really only been this week that most of the country has had cold frosty  nights. The chill will help shed the rest of the leaves. The autumn has lasted so long that the Woodland Trust has reported 2014 to have been one of the few years when there was enough time for leaves to develop a full tint of some of the more spectacular of the autumn colours – such as the red splash of the field maples, the only native maple in Britain.  Especially good leaf colours have appeared on the edge of woodlands where the trees and shrubs were exposed to more sunshine. But with lots of grey skies this month, many of the trees’ colours did not have much chance to shine brightly. What is clear is how autumn now, year by year, is being pushed back later and later over the year. Key to this change in the seasons is the trend for increasing temperatures, but rising levels of carbon dioxide may also be playing a part in delaying the autumn colours. Not only does carbon dioxide help drive climate change, but studies also suggest that CO2 is helping to keep leaves greener for longer. All of which raises the interesting question – what is going to happen to autumn in the future? As the season comes later, and as spring starts earlier, the winters are getting squeezed and not leaving much time for trees to lie dormant."
"Climate change is at last heading up the international agenda. With the climate science evidence now so overwhelming even some of the sceptics have been forced to change tack. There is no time to lose.  That’s why today’s announcement that the UK is to pledge up to £720 million into the Green Climate Fund to help the world’s poorest countries tackle climate change is so important.  The context for this major British funding pledge is the all-important climate summit to be held in December next year in Paris. This will be the most significant moment in global climate diplomacy since the disappointing Copenhagen summit in 2009 when Ed Miliband was doing my job. The good news is that the politics, economics and science are now all in a much stronger place.  In the UK, we may be experiencing the politics of division – whether from the Scottish Nationalists or Ukip. And our TV screens may be full of conflicts from Syria to Ukraine. Yet, remarkably, climate politics is experiencing a quiet but steady recognition of our common goals and shared interests. Last month, we saw European Union leaders make the world’s first significant pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade. The UK had been front and centre building support for the most ambitious target on the table – a commitment that by 2030 the EU will cut emissions by at least 40%. And we won.  This month, the US and China have responded. The fact they have come out with pledges to cut their emissions ahead not just of next year’s Paris summit but five months ahead of the deadline for such commitments was a pleasant surprise to many. It justified the two years’ work the UK put in to securing a timely EU deal and adds to the pressure on others to act.  Indeed, Britain is arguing hard for a proper analysis of all these emission reduction pledges, so we can see how far short the world is of where the science is telling us we needed to be.  Perhaps the most important feature of the global deal we are seeking is that every country will commit to play its part. For there can be no doubt that when it comes to climate change, we are all in it together. Yet the world’s poorest countries will need help to play their part. If they are to develop in a climate sustainable way, richer countries have to help them. And that’s where Britain’s pledge to the Green Climate Fund comes in. Our financial commitment is on a par with Germany’s and France’s and shows that, along with the US, Japan and other developed nations, we recognise our global responsibilities.  The UK’s pledge to the Green Climate Fund is already being attacked by the normal suspects, but this cash will literally save lives.  A major focus for the fund will be helping the world’s most vulnerable countries adapt their societies to the climate change that is already happening. That can mean everything from protecting low-lying islands and coastal settlements from the impact of rising sea levels to helping farmers struggling with lower crop yields caused by the weather effects of climate change. British scientists with world-leading skills in everything from weather forecasting to identifying which coffee beans will be more climate resilient than others will be part of our efforts to help the world’s poorest survive. Britain should be proud of all these efforts. Not only are we now one of the only nations to be hitting the UN’s target for development assistance of 0.7% of national income, but with this new Green Climate Fund pledge we will be tackling one of the current and future causes of poverty.  One of the most exciting opportunities created by renewable energy technologies like solar is the ability to help the world’s poorest develop faster – but more sustainably too. If we can speed up the deployment of clean energy technologies in developing countries with investments from the Green Climate Fund, hundreds of millions of people will be able to access electricity for the first time – with all the education, health, communication and entrepreneurial opportunities electricity enables.  Yet even with this Green Climate Fund pledge and all the recent progress we have seen in climate diplomacy, the negotiations for the global deal in Paris in 2015 will be tough. There is no guarantee will we get a deal – or that if we do, it will be strong enough.  That’s why next month’s annual UN climate talks in Peru will be more critical than usual. They must help build both momentum into the 2015 summit and develop the crucial international coalitions that will be needed to pull off an ambitious deal. British civil society has a fantastic record of campaigning to push politicians of all colours and countries to step up on climate. I want to encourage that campaigning to begin in earnest again – using everything from marches to social media. Next week, for example, ahead of Lima, people can take part in a global “tweetathon” on climate - the brainchild of the Department of Energy and Climate Change along with partners ranging from the Foreign Office to BT, from Unilever to the UN.  In the face of the politics of division, where the opponents of action on climate change prosper, it’s never been more important for individuals to stand up and be counted on the side for climate action. "
"It’s time for Tony – and Julie and Malcolm – to stop digging. The government is in a couple of truly untenable positions. It keeps digging itself in further.  Take climate change. Tony Abbott and senior ministers were deeply angry at Barack Obama’s show-stealing climate change speech during the G20. We know because they have been briefing News Ltd columnists to that effect all week – including graphic accounts of how they rang up afterwards and yelled at state department officials for failing to give a “heads up” that the president was going to “dump on” the PM.  Putting aside for one second the extraordinary position we are in when a speech that calls for an ambitious global climate deal and points out Australia has a lot to lose from a warming climate is seen as “dumping” on our prime minister, let’s think about how government ministers could have responded. They could have tried to defuse the argument – responding to Obama’s call by pointing out that Australia has promised a new longer-term emissions reduction target and will reveal it soon. In fact, as soon as they said that, they also chose to escalate the row with some embarrassingly stupid arguments. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was doing the digging on this one – taking a direct swipe at Obama by saying he and his interior secretary clearly hadn’t read a very excellent briefing provided to them about all the efforts Australia was taking to protect the Great Barrier Reef. “Of course the Great Barrier Reef will be preserved for generations to come. We don’t believe it is in danger,” Bishop said, with complete certainty. Perhaps as well as the report about how Australia is attempting to manage the impact on the reef of things like agricultural run-off and shipping activity from the development of enormous coal mines, Obama had also read the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which says (in chapter 25 - the one about Australasia): “Recent extreme climatic events show significant vulnerability of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability (very high confidence) … for example, high sea surface temperatures have repeatedly bleached coral reefs in northeastern Australia (since the late 1970s) and more recently in western Australia.” Maybe the president had read the bit where it said: “Some potential impacts can be delayed but now appear very difficult to avoid entirely, even with globally effective mitigation and planned adaptation” including “significant change in community composition and structure of coral reef systems in Australia, driven by increasing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification; the ability of corals to adapt naturally to rising temperatures and acidification appears limited and insufficient to offset the detrimental effects.” Maybe he was making the entirely obvious point that if the world does not continue, collectively, to reduce its greenhouse emissions, the reef will be harmed – no matter what decisions Australia takes about managing domestic impacts. Even the government’s own “outlook report”, from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, found climate change posed the most serious threat reef. Did they not send the president that? Obama’s $3bn commitment to the Green Climate Fund in Brisbane was a little harder for Abbott to dig himself out of – having previously likened the fund to Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), or “Bob Brown Bank”, which he is committed to abolish (the government recently instructed the CEFC prepare its accounts for the mid-year economic statement on the basis that it will stop making investments on 31 December and cease to exist on 30 June.) But Abbott could also have said he was thinking about a future contribution, which, Guardian Australia understands, the Department of Foreign Affairs actually was. But no. Without even a flicker of irony, Abbott and Bishop again dug in further, arguing one reason Australia didn’t intend to commit to the international Green Climate Fund was that it already had the domestic CEFC (neglecting to mention this was only because they haven’t been able to get rid of it yet). They also pointed to the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund – also for domestic emissions reductions and therefore not relevant to the argument, and to foreign aid programs targeting climate mitigation in the Pacific region. Now that even the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, – the closest thing Australia has to an ally for its climate stance (except maybe Saudi Arabia) – has contributed $300m to the fund, it really seems time to stop digging.  The government points to the fact that Australia met its first Kyoto emissions reduction target – OK, we got a special deal and were allowed to increase our emissions by 8% when everyone else except Iceland had to decrease theirs, but who besides us fact-obsessives is going to remember that? And it insists we will meet our 2020 target, and no one can prove otherwise. Given the task is now only one-third what it was when it set up its Direct Action fund, and given we can “carry over” the extra abatement we got by overshooting our first generous target – who knows, it may even be right.  But the arguments with which Australia is now trying to berate America are truly ridiculous. And they are just drawing more domestic and international attention to our policy absences and inadequacies. On the domestic front, there’s the truthfulness issue – upon which the last government fell and which appears to be poisoning public attitudes towards this one. If there is one thing that annoys voters even more than politicians telling lies, it’s those same politicians pointing to previously invisible fine print to try to pretend that they haven’t. And yet this is exactly what the Abbott government has been doing – over its budget spending cuts and now over its promise not to cut funding to the ABC. It is mounting the entirely untenable proposition that none of this contradicts promises made before the election. In the case of the ABC it was the communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, defending the indefensible in the interests of backing in the position of the government.  “Well – well, look, you know, I mean, I’ve defended the prime minister on this today and earlier in the week. I think you’ve got to take his comments, which – look, I mean, what he said, he said, and, you know, it’s there, it’s on the record. But you’ve got to take that in the context. And I can only assume that what Mr Abbott was referring to or was thinking about, anyway, was the proposition that there would be cuts in – with the intent of reducing ABC services and we’ve ruled that out,” he said, not sounding coherent or convincing. Trailing by 10 percentage points in two-party preferred terms, the government is not short of advice about how to retrieve its political situation as it takes stock at the end of the political year.  According to conservative commentator Andrew Bolt, it has to “change or die”. Some of his advice is probably good – to concentrate on the domestic agenda and to give up on some fights it cannot win. But Bolt also berates Abbott because “he’s given up the fights for free speech and workplace reform, and dares not openly challenge the [global] warming hysteria.” In other words, Bolt reckons the government should dig harder, be more ideological and intransigent. I disagree. I think it would be better, politically and in the interests of good policy and general sanity, for the government to stop digging for a while. "

"World leaders have forced Australia to include stronger language on climate change in the G20 communique, but Tony Abbott told the summit that as the leader of a major coal producer he would be “standing up for coal”. The references demanded by other leaders, including the US president, Barack Obama, were reluctantly accepted by Australia at the last minute. They included a call for contributions to the international green climate fund that the prime minister has previously derided and for the “phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”.  A European Union spokesman reportedly described the climate negotiations with Australia as being like “trench warfare”. Other officials said it had been “very difficult” and protracted. Speaking to the media after the summit, the Australian prme minister downplayed the importance of the “green climate fund” to which Obama pledged $3bn on Saturday and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, $1.5bn on Sunday. He took a similar line on the new greenhouse reduction pledges unveiled by Obama and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. He said all nations “support strong action … to address climate change”, but added: “We are all going to approach this in our own way and there are a range of [climate] funds which are there.” Obama and the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, both urged G20 countries to contribute to the green climate fund, which is seen as critical to a successful outcome at crucial climate negotiations in Paris next year. In the end, at Australia’s insistence, the communique called for contributions to financing funds “such as the green climate fund”. Obama said the US and Chinese agreement meant there was “no excuse for other nations” not to make similar commitments on greenhouse gas reductions.  But Abbott said by his reading the deal “means 80% of China’s power needs in 2030 are still going to be provided by coal”. He said coal was critical to lifting 1.3bn people out of poverty, and “what we need to do is to ensure that the coal-fired power stations we need are as efficient as possible”. The Australian treasurer, Joe Hockey, also downplayed the deal earlier on Sunday. “Barack Obama has to get any initiative on climate change through a hostile US Congres,” he said. “So far he hasn’t had great success.”  As Obama explained again on Sunday, the US “shaped that target based on existing authorities” to use Environment Protection Agency powers “rather than the need for additional congressional action”. Abbott began the closed-door discussion on energy on Sunday morning by telling the world leaders that “as the world’s largest producer of coal, I’d like to stand up for coal”, sources told Guardian Australia. Speaking to the press after the meeting, Abbott denied Australia had been forced into climate discussions, saying “the very first draft [of the G20 communique] talked about climate change, all the way through we have been talking about energy efficiency and climate change”. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the first draft did include climate change, but in very general terms. But European countries and the United States argued until late on Saturday to force the host country to strengthen the words - including the commitment to the green climate fund, which Abbott has previously said Australia would not support. Australia was also reluctant to include the reference to fossil fuel subsidies in the communique, but it was eventually included after forceful support from Obama. The communique calls on G20 members to “rationalise and phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. As the G20 progressed, the Queensland government was preparing to unveil new infrastructure spending to help the development of Australia’s largest coal mine. .Abbott, who recently said coal was “good for humanity”, also endorsed the mine, proposed by the Indian company Adani, at the leaders’ meeting. The Queensland premier, Campbell Newman, has said the new spending would help coal development in the Galilee basin, which has been under a cloud because of the declining coal price. The announcement is expected to be made during the visit of the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who is addressing federal parliament on Tuesday, and the chairman of the Adani group, Gautam Adani. “We are prepared to invest in core, common-user infrastructure. The role of government is to make targeted investments to get something going and exit in a few years’ time,” Newman said. “It will be open access [infrastructure]. We want a new coal basin to open.” In an interview from Brisbane with the Indian Express, Adani said the Australian government had given all environmental and regulatory clearances for the $7.5bn coal, rail and port project. The Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin is the one of the largest thermal coal mines in the world, and the largest in Australia. It requires a 388km rail line to a new terminal at Abbot Point. But the project has been under pressure as coal prices fall to five-year lows. Adani told the Indian Express a South Korean firm, Posco, had been given the contract to build the railway line and sources suggested the Newman government might be preparing to underwrite the project. The director of energy finance studies for the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, Tim Buckley, said the Newman government’s plans were “absolutely farcical”. “I have not spoken to a single person in finance who thinks this can proceed or that it is commercially viable. Eight major international banks have said they won’t go near it,” he said. Adani says it has already invested $2bn in Australia, but it has no equity here. It bought the rights to the Abbot Point port with loans from a syndicate headed by the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac, and another loan from the State Bank of India."

"G20 leaders have approved a package of 800 measures estimated to increase their economic output by 2.1% by 2018 if fully implemented. At the end of the two-day summit in Brisbane, Australia, leaders representing 85% of the world’s economy also called for “strong and effective action” on climate change, with countries urged to reveal new emissions reduction targets in the first few months of next year.  Australia, the host nation, had wanted to keep the summit focused on economic growth rather than climate change, but new commitments by China, the US and Japan helped build momentum for stronger global action to curb greenhouse gases. The host prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the summit had “very substantially delivered” on the goals of Australia’s presidency: boosting growth and employment, enhancing global economic resilience and strengthening global institutions. “We have signed off on a peer-reviewed growth package that, if implemented, will achieve a 2.1% increase in global growth over the next five years, on top of business as usual,” he said. “This year the G20 has delivered real and practical outcomes. Because of the efforts the G20 has made this year, culminating in the last 48 hours, people right around the world are going to be better off … through the achievement of inclusive growth and jobs.” G20 finance ministers and central bank governors who gathered in Sydney in February agreed to develop policies “to lift our collective GDP [gross domestic product] by more than 2% above the trajectory implied by current policies over the coming five years”. The communique, issued after the leaders’ summit in Brisbane on Sunday said the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had calculated the commitments “if fully implemented” would deliver an additional 2.1% to the GDP of G20 economies compared with baseline forecasts issued last year. “This will add more than US$2tn to the global economy and create millions of jobs,” the communique said. It said countries would hold one another to account for implementing the commitments spelled out in the Brisbane action plan and comprehensive growth strategies. But the IMF and OECD analysis sounded a note of caution, pointing to “the high degree of uncertainty entailed in quantifying the impact of members’ policies”. G20 members had set out “close to 1,000 individual structural policy commitments, of which more than 800 are new”.  They include trade measures and other product market changes, labour market changes, spending on research and development, tax changes, and public infrastructure. Many of the commitments included in the Australian action plan are not new announcements, they include the government’s paid parental leave scheme, deregulation of university fees, and a review of workplace laws. The IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said the IMF would monitor how well each country performed in implementing the promises and “dutifully report” back to the G20. It then would be up to countries to apply “peer pressure” to ensure the growth ambitions were achieved. Lagarde said she was pleased the G20 communique included a goal of reducing the gap in participation rates between men and women by 25% by 2025, estimated to bring more than 100 million women into the labour force. But she said the deadline was a long time away and she hoped it could be brought forward. The communique also contained a hotly debated passage on climate change, which expressed support for strong action and “mobilising finance for adaptation and mitigation, such as the Green Climate Fund” – to which the US has pledged $3bn and Japan $1.5bn. It also encouraged countries that were ready to pledge post-2020 emissions reduction targets to do so “well in advance” of the UN climate conference to be held in Paris next year.  G20 leaders agreed to create a “global infrastructure hub” with a four-year mandate to share knowledge on infrastructure projects and financing. The hub, to be based in Sydney, would work with governments, the private sector, development banks and international organisations. Abbott confirmed China would be the G20 host in 2016, after Turkey in 2015. He said the summit had been marked by “a spirit of collaboration from all of the leaders and all of their teams”. The G20 includes the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, including 19 countries plus the European Union."

"To a master traditional navigator like Tua Pittman from Raratonga in the Cook Islands, a canoe is much more than just a means of transport. “The canoe is our island, the crew members are the community and the navigator is the leader,” Pittman says.  He continues, explaining that the converse is also true. “An island is our canoe, the community are the crew members and the politicians and leaders are the navigators.” “On a canoe you are not just going from one destination to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. Navigation is using the philosophies of being a leader to show your crew members the light of life.” It has been a whirlwind week for the crews of the flotilla of four vaka (sailing canoes built with fibreglass hulls but styled on traditional designs) since arriving in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress. Tua’s journey began at the Cook Islands on September 25. The first leg took the islanders to Samoa then Fiji, Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast before heading south to Sydney. Around 100 crew members were involved in the various stages of the voyage and they aimed to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. Unfortunately, said Tua, the crews were forced to rely on modern navigation equipment on some occasions to reach Australia in time for the Congress. The official title of the expedition is the Mua Voyage and is a partnership between the IUCN Oceania Regional Office and five Pacific Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, Cook Islands and Fiji. The main goal of the 6,000 nautical mile (11,000km) trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress. In part the message said: “We see the signs of overexploitation. We no longer see the fish and other marine creatures in the size, diversity or abundance of the past.  “We witness the change as foreign fishing fleets ply our waters in a race to strip our resources. Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our mangrove and wetland spawning grounds are disappearing.  “Our ocean is vast but not limitless…. growing global populations and the relentless pursuit of unsustainable development is reducing the ability of our ocean to sustain life.” In spite of the effort and urgency behind the Pacific Islanders’ message to the delegates of the once-in-a-decade Congress, much of the final days of the marine part of the Congress has been taken up with trying to set a revised target for the amount of the ocean that needs to be protected in marine sanctuaries. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature: as of 2013 the amount of the world’s oceans in marine protected areas was not even three per cent and less than one per cent of that is ‘no take’. This was despite a target of 20-30% of no take areas set by the last World Parks Congress held in South Africa in 2003. World-leading marine scientist Professor Callum Roberts from the University of York was one of the scientists who helped set the 20-30% target in 2003. But he said it was not enough. “The global conservation union IUCN should now lift its target from 30 to 33%. New research strengthens the case for the 30% target set previously to now be raised. “Threats of climate change and overfishing have only increased in recent years, so a stronger resolve to maximise the benefits of no take sanctuaries must now be pursued. Any reduction in efforts at this stage and moment in history would be disastrous for our oceans.” After lengthy haggling and difficult negotiations the World Parks Congress delegates passed a motion that will dramatically shift the goals for global marine management. Instead of the 20-30% aspirational target the IUCN’s new official position is to: “Urgently increase the ocean area that is effectively and equitably managed in ecologically representative and well connected systems of MPAs [marine protected areas] or other effective conservation measures by 2030; these should include strictly protected areas that amount to at least 30% of each marine habitat and address both biodiversity and ecosystem services.”  While the federal government claims that 35% of Australian marine waters are in protected areas, this is in name only. Australia’s marine parks estate now covers 35% of Australia’s EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone), in law. But only 10% of that is operational and much of that is in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Of this 10%, less than half is highly protected no-take zones. Tua Pittman was delighted with the news that a strong resolution had passed the Congress regarding the planet’s oceans. “It’s just like a huge reward for all effort that we made to be here and to be heard. To hear they made that resolution is fantastic. It’s a start in the right direction.” Tua Pittman says that while much of the traditional navigational aids were things, such the sun, moon and stars that never changed and would, at least on a human scale, always be there, other impacts of environmental degradation were becoming clearer when voyaging across the Pacific. He said he was 55 and in his lifetime he was already beginning to see that it was much harder to catch fish on the open ocean. He also said that pollution was worsening, particularly as the canoes approached big cities such as Sydney. And the impacts of climate change were already beginning to seriously impact on Pacific Islanders. “The decisions of the big countries impact on the small countries twice, thrice four times more than it will impact developed, large nations. “Many times people don’t even know where our islands are and, from the eyes of a traditional navigator, our people have a very, very deep concern because we are talking about decisions made far away that impact on our homes.” The Mua Voyage had been a massive logistical undertaking, said Tua. It was not just a matter of jumping into canoes and heading out to sea. Years of preparation and navigational planning went into such a trip and it was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and acted.  He said, the leaders of wealthy countries need to start to think more like traditional navigators who recognise their vessels are mere specks in an enormous sea. Most importantly, and spoken like a true navigator, Tua says politicians must seek a different route to avoid the pending ecological crises that are beginning to befall the small island nations. “The world needs to find a different path.” • James Woodford is Guardian Australia’s ocean correspondent.

"You may not feel powerful, but you are. Students lobbying universities to withdraw endowment funds from fossil fuels are at the cutting edge of climate action. Divestment is the ethical issue of our time, as apartheid and the Vietnam war once were. Author and activist Bill McKibben helped to turbocharge student activists, after the disappointment of the Copenhagen Accord, through 350.org. Now 181 universities around the world are committed to divesting funds. On 9 October Glasgow became the first European academic institution to commit to divest. Will yours be next?  It’s daunting to go from freshers week into a pitched battle with the senior faculty, but consider this: the fossil-fuel industry has substantially funded climate-change denials, blocked the carbon price (a fee paid for making carbon emissions), taken the wind out of the sails of renewables, and made us more dependent on fossil fuels. What about your future? A university’s endowments can seem like small beer (Oxford has the largest endowment of UK academic institutions, at £3.8bn), but it’s not just about the divest – shifting assets away from the problem (fossil fuels) – but the invest into the solutions (renewable). To find solutions to climate change, globally we need to invest $1tn a year. It starts here. Who has your back if the faculty turns nasty? First, you’re not alone. It’s not just universities that are divesting: the British Medical Association urged healthcare advocates to divest, and the Rockerfeller Foundation, owners of Standard Oil, has committed to divesting $860m, which is huge. Practically, your support comes from peopleandplanet.org, a network of 15,000 UK students credited with putting “climate change on the desk of every vice-chancellor” and 350.org. Critics say that student activists rely on fossil-fuel energy to charge their phones and laptops and suggest that activism jeopardises research grants. Research funding has nothing to do with environmentalists – and the most vocal critics of divest activism are in the pocket of Big Oil. The fossil-fuel industry has a financial Achilles heel: the carbon bubble. This is the fear that its stocks have been highly overvalued, as the true costs of carbon dioxide in global warming have not been taken into account in stock market valuations. Clever fund managers know to get out now, as do the really smart students. For UK textile charity Traid, every waking moment is concerned with squeezing the potential out of our second-hand clothes to reduce waste and carbon emissions, to fund international projects and to educate people about the impact of textiles on the environment. From 17-23 November it’s hoping to turn this into a national obsession, with Traid’s first-ever secondhand week. You can take the Secondhand First Pledge to commit to sourcing part of your wardrobe from pre-loved clothes, learn how to sort like a professional, take inspiration from a Bin Doctor, customise like a fashion revolutionary, and repair like your great-grandmother did.

"The world’s fossil fuels will “obviously” have to stay in the ground in order to solve global warming, Barack Obama’s climate change envoy said on Monday. In the clearest sign to date the administration sees no long-range future for fossil fuel, the state department climate change envoy, Todd Stern, said the world would have no choice but to forgo developing reserves of oil, coal and gas.  The assertion, a week ahead of United Nations climate negotiations in Lima, will be seen as a further indication of Obama’s commitment to climate action, following an historic US-Chinese deal to curb emissions earlier this month. A global deal to fight climate change would necessarily require countries to abandon known reserves of oil, coal and gas, Stern told a forum at the Center for American Progress in Washington. “It is going to have to be a solution that leaves a lot of fossil fuel assets in the ground,” he said. “We are not going to get rid of fossil fuel overnight but we are not going to solve climate change on the basis of all the fossil fuels that are in the ground are going to have to come out. That’s pretty obvious.” Last week’s historic climate deal between the US and China, and a successful outcome to climate negotiations in Paris next year, would make it increasingly clear to world and business leaders that there would eventually be an expiry date on oil and coal. “Companies and investors all over are going to be starting at some point to be factoring in what the future is longer range for fossil fuel,” Stern said. The UN, in its landmark IPCC climate science report last year and in another report earlier this month, warned that the world is close to blowing through a carbon budget, which would lead to warming of above 2C. The UN Environment Programme warned last week that global emissions must peak in the next decade, fall by half by 2050, and then decline to zero to remain within that budget. Obama said in an interview last June that the US was going to have to start getting off fossil fuel - but he has also simultaneously pursued an “all of the above” energy strategy that has ramped up domestic oil and gas production. In an interview for the Year of Living Dangerously series, Obama said: “We’re not going to be able to burn it all. Over the course of the next several decades, we’re going to have to build a ramp from how we currently use energy to where we need to use energy. And we’re not going to suddenly turn off a switch and suddenly we’re no longer using fossil fuels, but we have to use this time wisely, so that you have a tapering off of fossil fuels replaced by clean energy sources that are not releasing carbon … But I very much believe in keeping that 2C target as a goal.” Such statements, coupled with Obama’s support for natural gas industry, have frustrated and confused some campaigners. At the same time, Obama has pursued an ambitious domestic and international climate change agenda – despite opposition from Republicans who now control both houses of Congress after the mid-term elections. In a surprise announcement, Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, announced last week they would take steps together to curb emissions. A few days later, on the eve of the G20 summit in Brisbane, Obama announced the US would give $3bn to an international fund to help poor countries cope with climate change. Stern, in comments to reporters following his appearance, said the moves had helped to build momentum ahead of the meetings in Lima. “You are not suddenly going to make the hard issues all vanish,” he said. “I don’t know whether you are going to see any shift in Lima, for example.” China and other countries would be watching closely to see whether Obama can move forward, with the Republican leadership in Congress already threatening to block the main pillar of his climate plan, cutting carbon pollution from power plants. But the envoy said the deal between the world’s two biggest carbon polluters – and antagonists as Stern called them – had improved the atmosphere going into the last stretch of negotiations for reaching a climate deal in Paris at the end of next year. “We will see what transpires but this is a very big step,” he said. “Generally if you are holding stock in the Paris negotiations your stock will have gone up after this announcement.”"
"British climate change sceptic Christopher Monckton has thrown his support behind the hard-right, anti-multiculturalism party Rise Up Australia, one of many micro-parties hoping to win a seat in Victoria’s upper house. Lord Monckton has been in Melbourne for the past three months specifically to help the party with their campaign for the 29 November election.  On Thursday night, Monckton was in the public gallery for the Casey council meeting to support councillor Rosalie Crestani, Rise Up’s upper house candidate for south-east metropolitan region. Crestani had a motion before the council proposing communications material supporting the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities be banned on the grounds it discriminated against heterosexuals.  The council rejected the motion.  Rise Up leader and evangelical Christian pastor Daniel Nalliah is the party’s lead candidate for the region. It is the first time his party has stood in a Victorian election. “I met Monckton three years ago when he came to Australia and said he opposed the carbon tax, and so several months ago I called him up and asked if he’d be willing to help with our campaign,” Nalliah said. “He kindly accepted and has been here three months working with me closely, advising on policy, how to run an election campaign, and how to run the party.” Nalliah, who once said the Black Saturday bushfires were punishment for Victoria’s decriminalisation of abortion, and whose church hosted the controversial World Congress of Families conference in August, says he is confident of securing the seat thanks to preference deals. Eight regions make up the Victorian upper house, with five people elected to represent each. Family First, Australian Christians, Democratic Labor Party, Shooters and Fishers and No Smart Meters all plan to direct first preferences to Rise Up. By agreeing to direct preferences towards one party, analysts believe micro parties stand a chance in the upper house, with the potential of holding the balance of power. With 21 parties running this year – almost double the number from the 2010 election – there has been ample opportunity for so-called “preference harvesting” between micro parties. It was this sort of deal-making that allowed Ricky Muir of the Motoring Enthusiasts party to be elected to the Senate in the federal election last year with just 0.5% of the primary vote. The regions where the micro-parties have the most chance include eastern Victoria, where the Liberal Democrats, Palmer United party, Rise Up, Australian Christians, Family First, Democratic Labor, No Smart Meters and Australian Cyclists are all directing their first preferences to the Shooters and Fishers. In northern Victoria, the Country Alliance have picked up a swath of preferences, while in Eastern metropolitan, the Australian Christians will have preferences directed their way from seven parties. In Western metropolitan and Northern metropolitan micro-party candidates also also have chances thanks to preference pooling. In state and federal elections, about 95% of people opt to vote above the line, with their preferences allocated according to the party’s choice. Unlike in the Senate, Victorians voting below the line need to rank only five candidates, theoretically making preference-harvesting less effective, but there is little awareness of this provision in the electorate."
"This article is about the future landscape of science in general, and climate science in particular.  Just a few days ago, the Chinese Academy of Sciences hosted a small workshop which involved scientists from around the world that work on a device called the Expendable Bathythermograph, or XBT for short. The obscurity of the conference speaks volumes; it didn’t get much, if any, press attention. This fact tells a lot about the host nation.   XBTs are devices that are used to measure ocean temperatures. They were developed many decades ago to help navies determine the depth of the thermocline. Submarines positioned below the thermocline are more able to avoid detection. The devices are released from the deck of a ship and they fall through the water, recording temperatures along the way. As they fall, they unspool a copper wire which is connected to a data collection device so that temperatures can be recorded. Each year, hundreds of thousands of these devices are dropped into the world’s oceans. A huge database, stretching back to the 1960s is available for climate studies. The problem is that the devices are designed to be, well, expendable and cheap. When their wire spool runs out, the wire breaks, and the torpedo-like device detaches from the ship and sinks to the ocean floor. The expendable nature of the device has forced the cost per device to be low.  As a result, no pressure sensors were installed on the devices so water depth cannot be determined directly. Depth has to be inferred from a correlation of prior experiments. If the correlation is not correct, a scientist will not accurately know the depth of the probe in the water and consequently, will not be able to calculate the energy of the ocean waters. Ocean heating is the hallmark of global warming. If we can’t use XBTs to get an accurate sense of ocean heating, we are flying blind. So, understanding the accuracy of XBT fall rates (the rate that they descend in the water) is one of the most important and difficult issues in all of climate science. Part of the difficulty is that devices have changed as the years have passed (both device size and weight). Also, fall rates depend on the temperature of the water (colder water is more viscous and thereby retards probe motion). In addition, the height from which the devices are launched impacts the speed of their entry into the water, and their subsequent descent. All of this makes for time and spatially varying fall rates – real mess. Despite this, only a small handful of scientists are actively working to improve XBT accuracy, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences decided to bring them all together. This unique group of individuals met for three days to try to hammer out a “best practices” standard. While we don’t know yet what the outcome is from this meeting, we see that China has taken a leading role as a scientific player. Approximately half the attendees were Chinese and travel funding was made available by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  While in many parts of the world, like Australia and the USA in particular, funding for basic research is decreasing, in China things are different. Funding is increasing in critical scientific areas. Perhaps more importantly, in China, scientists are respected. In my country, as well as in Canada, and Australia, whenever you tell people you are a scientist, you must prepare for a negative reaction.  Perhaps it is because we understand human evolution, the history of the universe, climate change, or the causes and effects of acid rain as just some examples. Understanding basic science is a threat to many people in my country. Just being a scientist means I represent those things that are an anathema. It is a very sad state when the people who are most needed to help us navigate our social problems are dismissed by a sizable population. This is not the case in China. My Chinese colleagues get support from their government, their media, and the larger society. They don’t have to wade through hate mail upon coming to the office in the morning. Mail that can always be identified by its terrible speeling an, punctuation! Yes, the center of intellectual capacity is clearly shifting toward China. That country has a forward looking view of the future. Not only in clean energy and climate, but in information systems, health care, nanotechnology, and other high-technology areas. I spoke to Dr. Jiang Zhu, the director of Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He told me,  Recently the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) rolled out a complete restructuring program in order to improve its management and efficiency of research. For example, CAS will establish 20-30 centers of excellence focused on world-leading basic research. This is an ambitious reform and moves in the right direction to produce more breakthroughs that are changing the world.  I work on clean and renewable energy solutions in the developing world, especially Africa. All the solar and wind products you buy in that continent come from China. This is just one example how vision in China has turned to progress outside of China. China is creating the energy economy of the future. They are also developing a reputation for technical quality and human ingenuity.  From where I stand, the future belongs to China. It will be a challenge for other countries to prioritize as well as China has. They have become the leader in many respects, we (the USA) are the followers. We are watching a Chinese scientific revolution before our very own eyes."
"The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, has brushed aside criticism from the Liberal premier of Western Australia that Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions targets are too soft. Colin Barnett has backed Barack Obama’s call for stronger emissions reductions targets, saying: “We can be bolder in Australia, including in WA”.  He said the US president’s speech to students on the sidelines of the G20 summit was “a call to arms, not only to Australia but to other countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific area”.  “Australia, and I think all of us, do need to lift their game,” Barnett told the West Australian newspaper. Hunt said Australia was already doing more to tackle climate change. “We have just passed one of the most significant pieces of climate legislation in Australian history. We are reducing emissions without a tax,” he said of the government’s Direct Action policy. He praised Australia for being one of the few countries that had met and exceeded targets pledged under the 1997 Kyoto protocol. “We achieved our targets and beat them by 6%. Other countries made pledges and then failed to meet them,” Hunt said. In the days before the G20 summit in Brisbane, China and the US announced a deal on cutting carbon emissions. Obama used his address to students at the University of Queensland to urge other countries to act on climate change before it was too late. “If China and the United States can agree on this, then the world can agree on this. We can get this done. And it is necessary for us to get it done,” Obama said on Sunday. “I have not had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef and I want to come back, and I want my daughters to be able to come back, and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit. And I want that there 50 years from now,” he said. Barnett said: “Obama appealed to those young people and their applause gave me a message that the younger generation is looking for more to be done on climate change – and I’ll tell you that chatting to a couple of politicians leaving afterwards, they had a similar view.”  He admitted it was in Western Australia’s interests as a producer of natural gas for the focus to shift from coal. “While it’s a bit of a West Australian view, for me the most effective thing that Australia can do is to ensure that more of our new power generation is at least gas-fired and not coal,” Barnett said. “That’s not popular on the east coast but it’s a costless and simple way to reduce emissions to have a power generation system in the future across Australia which is based on natural gas.” Barnett’s comments put further pressure on the prime minister, Tony Abbott, who again spoke in support of coal during a closed door meeting of G20 leaders. Australia was forced to adopt stronger language relating to climate change in the official G20 communique, despite earlier insisting that the meeting was predominantly an economic forum."

"The world must cut CO2 emissions to zero by 2070 at the latest to keep global warming below dangerous levels and prevent a global catastrophe, the UN warns. By 2100, all greenhouse gas emissions – including methane, nitrous oxide and ozone, as well as CO2 – must fall to zero, the United Nationals Environment Programme (Unep) report says, or the world will face what Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists have described as “severe, widespread and irreversible” effects from climate change.   The Unep report published on Wednesday is based on the idea that the planet has a finite ‘carbon budget’. Since emissions surged in the late 19th century, some 1,900 Gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 and 1,000 Gt of other greenhouse gases have already been emitted, leaving less than 1,000 Gt of CO2 left to emit before locking the planet in to dangerous temperature rises of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.  Jacqueline McGlade, Unep’s chief scientist, told the Guardian that scientific uncertainties about the remaining carbon budget had diminished and the real uncertainty now was whether politicians had the will to act.  “The big uncertainty is whether you can put enough policies in place from 2020-2030 - in the critical window - to allow the least-cost pathways [to lower emissions and temperatures] to still stand a chance of being followed,” she said. “The uncertainties have shifted from the science to the politics.” All scenarios in the Unep report now require some degree of ‘negative CO2 emissions’ in the second half of the century, through technologies such as carbon capture and storage or, possibly, controversial, planetary wide engineering of the climate known as geoengineering. Unep is “extremely interested” in the subject and is planning a report in the months ahead.  “Once you get behind the scaremongering headlines about the schemes that are planetary scale but over which you have no sense of control, there are other geoengineering ideas, going back to the basics of how to manipulate local water bodies and alter, for example, geothermal productivity,” McGlade said. “We haven’t even started to skim the surface of what we can do and we shouldn’t rule out the possibility that some of these geoengineering ideas could be extremely good innovations.” Consideration should also be given to compensatory schemes for investors in fossil fuels companies to address the ‘stranded assets’ issue, McGlade added.  She acknowledged “donor fatigue” ahead of a pledging conference for the Green Climate Fund tomorrow – which has so far racked up close to $10bn (£6.4bn) – and called for up to 20% of the final money pot to come from citizen bonds for local environment projects, with the remaining 80% split between public and private sources.  Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission’s vice-president for energy union told a Brussels press conference that the report would be of use in preparing bloc positions for next month’s Lima climate summit.   “I have never seen such a political momentum to get things done,” he said. “We are now at the political critical mass point where political leaders want to succeed with climate change policies, and a have a growing resolve to do so.” The EU has not, however, supported Unep’s call for zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2100. Christiana Figueres, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)’s executive secretary, said: “This important report underscores the reality that at some point in the second half of the century, we need to have achieved climate neutrality – or as some term it zero net or net zero – in terms of overall global emissions.” A key theme in the emissions gap study is the cost-effectiveness of taking early action and the dangers of not doing so.  “An increase in global temperature is proportional to the build-up of long-lasting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially CO2,” said Achim Steiner, Unep’s executive director. “Taking more action now reduces the need for more extreme action later to stay within safe emission limits.”   “In a business as usual scenario, where little progress is made in the development and implementation of global climate policies, global greenhouse gas emissions could rise to up to 87GT CO2e by 2050, way beyond safe limits,” he added. "
"The international body in charge of sea safety adopted measures on Friday to protect people and the environment during a predicted shipping rush in the Arctic. But environment groups and insurers said the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee had failed to address key issues including a proposed ban on heavy fuel oil and how to safeguard against cowboy operators. The committee, which met in London this week, signed off on the Polar Code and various amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea (Solas) convention. These changes, which include mandatory requirements for ship design, crew training and search and rescue protocols, are expected to be ratified by the full IMO next year and come into force in 2017.  Melting sea ice due to global warming and pressure to cut costs makes the Arctic commercially enticing to shipping companies who want to avoid the circuitous, pirate-ridden voyage from China to Europe via the Suez Canal. Tourism, fishing and fossil fuel operations are also looking toward one of the world’s most fragile and extreme environments. Evan Bloom, director of the US State Department’s Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs said: “More and more people are going to be in the Arctic for one reason or another. In the future there may be [more] fishing vessels... There will be more and more tourism. There will be more and more commerce.”  He says this increases the likelihood of something going wrong in a region where there is currently very little capability to respond in either a search and rescue or environmental clean-up capacity. Just four ships navigated the Northern Sea Route over Russia in 2010, but by 2013 the number had reached 71. This summer saw relatively heavy ice cover in the Arctic, causing numbers to drop. But the long-term trend is towards greatly expanded shipping across the northern extremes of Russia, Canada and even straight across the North Pole. According to insurer Allianz, Russia predicts a 30-fold increase in shipping by 2020 and an ice-free Northern Sea Route by 2050. China has suggested that by 2020, 5-15% of its trade value - close to $500bn - could pass through the Arctic. Sven Gerhard, head of hull and marine liabilities for Allianz said these predictions may be exagerrated. But there are going to be more shipping accidents in the Arctic. The new Polar Code will require ships to develop a Polar Operations Manual (POM) for each voyage, which is then reviewed and approved within the flag state. But cutting corners is tempting as the costs of ice-strengthening ships and training expert ice navigators are very large. There are some flag states insurers will not work with because they are seen as reckless. “The safety net is only as good as the POM and the POM is only as good as how it is enforced by the flag state. There are many who have both eyes closed,” said Gerhard. “It’s good to have a framework,” said WWF marine manager Simon Walmsley. “But how can you guarantee that those rules are adhered to? The risk is absolutely huge. One oil spill of a decent size will knock out so much in the Arctic. If you have a heavy fuel oil spill there are no recognised methods to clean under ice or during 24 hours of darkness. There is no response.”"

"A leading energy expert has warned that although the British government is right to proceed with new nuclear plants they risk becoming a “financial drain” unless they can be built on time and on budget. Steven Chu, the former US energy secretary and Nobel prizewinning physicist, believes using a variety of reactor designs – as the UK looks poised to do – is not the best way to keep costs down.  “Unless we can learn to build nuclear on schedule and on budget it will be a financial drain. Other countries have learned how to do this: South Korea has built 10 plants exactly the same and the tenth plant was only 60% of the cost of the original one. The cost came marching down because they just kept doing the same thing,” he told the Guardian. “That is true of all industries. If you build exactly the same its get cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. Everything different means it will cost more. You have to understand that. When the United States built its nuclear plants they were all different,” argued Chu who was President Obama’s energy secretary until April last year and is now a professor at Stanford University in California. Atomic plants being built in Finland and France are much more expensive than forecast and are suffering significant delays but EDF, the company planning to build Hinkley Point C reactors in Somerset, says it will learn from those mistakes. While EDF plans to use an “EPR” design at Hinkley and possibly at Sizewell in Suffolk, other developers in Britain are planning different models. Chu, who was in Britain giving this year’s Romanes Lecture at Oxford University, believes a key role for nuclear power will be to provide support for other low-carbon, but intermittent, power technologies such as wind and solar, of which he is a supporter. “In the US, within a decade, onshore wind without subsidy is going to be less expensive than natural gas – even with natural gas staying at its current price which is two-and-a-half times less expensive than natural gas in the UK. “I think England may be a different story in the sense that you have a lot of good wind resources but it’s a small country, and I know England is looking at another generation of nuclear reactors which I am in favour of: perhaps what we need is one more generation of nuclear reactors.” Chu, whose current work includes research into more powerful and effective batteries, says: “Sometimes you will get 100% wind but other times the wind will not be blowing and you do need back-up power and that is going to come from fossil fuel or nuclear. What we will be able to do by mid-century is 50% of electricity from renewables if Europe shares its renewable resources … We would still need to capture carbon from fossil fuel-generating plants, also from cement and steel (manufacturing) plants.” The Stanford professor is still worried that not enough progress is being made worldwide to tackle climate change but remains upbeat about Obama’s attempts to galvanise the US more, not least through the recent bilateral agreement with China. Would a Republican president in in 2016 represent a setback? “A Republican presidency would not necessarily be a setback. It was a rabid anti-communist [Richard Nixon] who opened up China. That same president started the Environmental Protection Agency which is not considered part of the Republican agenda. Another Republican president [George Bush senior] stopped underground nuclear testing in the United States. He also put a cap and trade system in place on some emissions from power plants. “Some leading Republicans support a carbon tax for instance. You start at $10-$15 per tonne and slowly make it rise to $60 or so. But you use those revenues for the people – you do not use those revenues for other government programmes. We have means of doing it, through higher social security cheques or helping the unemployed. You give it back to the American people.” Chu dismisses concerns that a price on carbon could damage energy-intensive businesses pointing out that most oil companies now carry a “ghost price” for carbon on the books. And he says tougher political action on climate change would bring new solutions itself. “As long as engineers know what is happening, if countries know that is happening then people will come up with technical solutions. Historically [solutions] arrive.” As for the chance of a binding climate change agreement between countries at next year’s vital talks in Paris he says: “I think there is forward momentum. I hope [Paris] is better than Copenhagen. Do I have significant hope there will be a binding agreement among all countries, probably not. But my guess is that China will put a price on carbon during this government. Central government knows there is a huge risk [from climate change] their country faces. “That is why they are working hard to diversify their energy supply and are the largest installer of wind and solar in the world as well as building 30-plus nuclear power plants and trying to develop their natural gas resources. So China is moving, major states in the US are moving but … I get nervous. We are not moving fast enough."

"Initially Australia didn’t want climate change in the G20 communique at all. Then it spent weeks fighting to keep the language vague. Now, Guardian Australia can reveal the original text of the end of summit statement, the revised text and the inside story of the G20 countries’ fight over its wording.  Australia’s treasurer, Joe Hockey, told the ABC Insiders program on Sunday morning that Australia did agree to include a paragraph on climate change in the first draft of the G20 communique. What he didn’t say is that Australian negotiators have resisted attempts to strengthen it ever since. The paragraph in the first draft, revealed last week by Guardian Australia, said this: “We support strong and effective action to address climate change, consistent with sustainable economic growth and certainty for business and investment. We reaffirm our resolve to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations framework convention on climate change that is applicable to all parties at the 21st conference of the parties in Paris in 2015.” The draft available Saturday evening – after weeks of attempts to strengthen it by US and European negotiators – read like this:  “We support strong and effective action to address climate change, consistent with the United Nations framework convention on climate change and its agreed outcomes. Our actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment. We will work together to adopt successfully a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the United Nations framework convention on climate change that is applicable to all parties at the 21st conference of the parties [COP] in Paris in 2015. We encourage parties that are ready to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance of COP21 – by the first quarter of 2015 by those parties ready to do so. [We reaffirm our support for mobilising finance for adaptation and mitigation, including the green climate fund.]” Hidden in all those words is a concession hard-won by US and the EU negotiators in weeks of talks – a call for countries to reveal their environmental targets (the “nationally determined contributions” in diplomat-speak) well ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015 and possibly by early next year. Australia accepted that change very reluctantly. The country has said it will reveal a target before Paris, but not when, or how it will be determine them, or by what policy it could achieve deeper cuts. The brackets around the last sentence show that even after the US president, Barack Obama, made a $3bn pledge to the green climate fund – designed to help poorer countries adapt to climate change and crucial to a successful outcome in Paris – support for it, as shown by the wording, was not agreed. Late on Saturday night Australia was resisting a reference to the green climate fund in the communique, and the decision had been passed up to the office of the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott. It seemed likely Australia would eventually agree, although Abbott has previously said he would not contribute to the green climate fund, labelling it an international version of the “Bob Brown bank” – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation – which he wants to abolish."

"Canada – one of the few countries previously in line with Australia’s opposition to the international Green Climate Fund – now appears to have changed its mind, with Tony Abbott’s close friend prime minister Stephen Harper saying he is preparing to make a contribution. Abbott has defied global pressure to commit to the fund, designed to help poor countries adapt to climate change, because Australia is already spending $2.5bn on its domestic Direct Action fund and providing $10bn in capital to a so-called “green bank” – which he is trying to abolish.  World leaders forced Australia to include stronger language about the Green Climate Fund in the G20 communique – and during the summit Barack Obama pledged the US would contribute $3bn to it and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, offered $1.5bn. But soon after the conference was over Abbott indicated it would make no immediate difference to Australia’s position. On Sunday Harper said Canada was preparing to make a contribution to the UN fund, the Globe and Mail and other Canadian media outlets reported. He did not nominate an amount. Last November, Abbott and Harper “made history” by jointly dissenting from support for the Green Climate Fund in a communique from the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. Speaking after a meeting on Sunday night with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, Abbott said Direct Action – which funds Australia’s domestic emissions reduction, not international efforts – was already “quite a substantial fund”. He also cited the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which he is committed to abolish. “We also have a Clean Energy Finance Corporation which was established by the former government and there is $10bn in capital which has been allocated to this,” he said. “In addition to those two funds a proportion of our overseas aid, particularly in the Pacific, is allocated for various environmental schemes including schemes to deal with climate change. So, we are doing a very great deal and I suppose given what we are doing we don’t intend, at this time, to do more.” Environment minister Greg Hunt tried to compare Obama’s $3bn commitment to the international fund to be spent in poor countries with Australia’s $2.5bn spending on its own domestic policy, saying that if the Direct Action fund was implemented in the US “on a like for like basis it would be the equivalent of a $25bn fund”. Neither Abbott nor Hunt ruled out making a contribution to the fund at some time in the future and it is understood the Department of Foreign Affairs, which leads Australia’s international climate negotiations, has been considering a donation. The fund is seen as a critical part of a successful outcome at the United Nations Paris conference next year, which will discuss a global emissions pact to take effect after 2020. But Abbott’s trenchant opposition to the fund is seen as an impediment to any contribution. He has publicly disparaged it as an international “Bob Brown bank” – another reference to the CEFC, which he wants to abolish but he also cites as evidence of Australia’s climate action. As revealed by Guardian Australia, Abbott told world leaders at the Brisbane summit that as the leader of a major coal producer he would be “standing up for coal”. The communique references demanded by other leaders, including Obama, were reluctantly accepted by Australia at the last minute. They included a call for contributions to the fund and for the “phasing out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. An EU spokesman reportedly described the climate negotiations with Australia as being like “trench warfare”. Other officials said it had been “very difficult” and protracted. Speaking to the media after the summit, Abbott downplayed the importance of the fund. He took a similar line on the greenhouse reduction pledges unveiled by Obama and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, immediately before the summit. He said all nations “support strong action … to address climate change”, but added: “We are all going to approach this in our own way and there are a range of [climate] funds which are there.” Obama and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, both urged G20 countries to contribute to the Green Climate Fund. In the end, at Australia’s insistence, the communique called for contributions to financing funds “such as the Green Climate Fund”. Hunt suggested a regional rainforest fund, to which Australia recently pledged $6m, could substitute for contributions to the Green Climate Fund."
"Coal-powered power stations, starting with Victoria’s most polluting, would be phased out from next year under a plan the Greens party will pursue if it wins the balance of power at next week’s state election. The announcement is the first time the Greens have been specific about their priorities if the party manages to be a pivotal force in a hung parliament, considered possible especially in the upper house.  Greens leader Christine Milne joined her state counterpart Greg Barber to announce the plan on Thursday. Milne said the party would prioritise the closure of Australia’s most polluting power stations, beginning with Victoria’s Hazelwood, Anglesea and one of Yallourn’s four units in 2015. The rest of Yallourn and Loy Yang B would be retired in 2023. Hazelwood in the Latrobe Valley is powered by nearby brown coal, and in 1995 was named the least efficient power station in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by WWF. The previous Labor state government announced a gradual phase-out, but negotiations were cancelled by the incoming Coalition government on the grounds that it was too expensive. Hazelwood alone provides 25% of Victoria’s base load power. “The closure of old Victorian power stations is inevitable,” said Milne. “Victoria has a choice between a series of abrupt business failures that will cost jobs and rattle the economy, or a planned phase-out that will preserve jobs and the state’s skills base.” If the Greens hold the balance of power – which would mean no major party had a majority of seats in the parliament – it would seek to amend the Electricity Industry Act and force the relevant minister to withdraw the stations’ generation licences. The Greens claim no compensation would be payable. The plan “will help Victoria smoothly transition away from coal-fired power without causing job losses, while setting up communities for the industries of the future”, Barber said. “The plan should be a priority for Victoria and the Greens will be using our position in the new state parliament to push for it.” So far neither the Coalition nor Labor have made climate change and the environment a focus in the campaign and have no plans to phase out coal-fired power stations. The Greens’ proposal would see decommissioned power plants and mines rehabilitated and replaced by solar farms and other renewable energy projects to create jobs. Citing the Australian Energy Market Operator, which manages the national electricity grid, the Greens say Victoria has more energy than it needs and could phase out some power stations without risking blackouts and price increases. It says it would use money from the National Stronger Regions Fund, a $1bn fund to provide for infrastructure in regional areas, to deliver a jobs taskforce for the Latrobe Valley. No costing was announced with the policy. Environment Victoria welcomed the announcement, saying more than 50% of the state’s greenhouse pollution came from a handful of brown coal power stations.  “The energy regulator is saying that at least one large and one small power station are superfluous to our energy needs. This begs the question: why we are allowing these unnecessary power stations to continue to pollute.”  Premier Denis Napthine said his government had increased the energy supply from renewable energy from 7% to 12% and would pursue further opportunities. “What we will do first and foremost is to make sure that we have a reliable supply of electricity for Victorian households and businesses and make sure it’s an affordable supply. Any major decision that threatened supply in this state needs to be seriously considered.” Labor did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for GDF Suez, which operates Hazelwood, said it would be inappropriate to comment but said that the company was watching the election with interest."

"  Britain will face a disaster if it adopts an “isolationist approach” to the environment, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, has warned as he announced the UK is to give £720m to an international fund to help poor countries cope with climate change.  In remarks aimed at rightwing Tories and Ukip supporters, as voters go to the polls in the Rochester and Strood byelection, Davey said a “little Englander approach” would be self defeating as climate change does not recognise borders. Davey was speaking to the Guardian on the eve of an announcement that Britain is to donate more than France and Germany to the UN’s Green Climate Fund which has a target of $10bn (£8bn). The UK commitment to the fund, seen as a vital step towards rich and poor nations sealing a deal to tackle global warming in 2015, is surpassed only by the US and Japan. The enthusiasm with which Davey has announced the UK contribution contrasts with reticence in Downing Street, where David Cameron is understood to be nervous about highlighting Britain’s contribution to tackling climate change as it faces the prospect of losing its second parliamentary seat to Ukip. The prime minister was at pains to point out at the recent G20 summit in Australia that the UK’s £720m contribution is not new money. Davey said the prime minister should be more robust in challenging climate change sceptics on the Tory right, such as the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, and Ukip suporters. The energy and climate change secretary told the Guardian: “A little Englander approach, an isolationist approach, is going to be a disaster for the people of Britain. Climate change does not recognise borders.” Experts warned recently that global warming would affect health, business and food production in the UK, with a senior military figure also warning that armed forces would be unable to provide global security if climate change goes unchecked. “There is a huge amount at stake,” said Davey. “Anyone who has followed the UN negotiations knows the poorest and most vulnerable countries on the planet are looking to developed countries to help them survive climate change. If we do not do this, I don’t think we will get a global deal. It is as simple as that.” He said: “[Critics] do not realise the vital work this money is for. This is about saving lives and we have duty to do this.” Examples, he said, were helping low-lying nations cope with rising sea levels and subsistence farmers cope with failing crops. The contribution to the GCF will come from an existing UK climate aid fund that will spend £3.9bn from 2011-16. Asked why the UK was offering the equivalent of $1.13bn, more than the $1bn pledged each by Germany and France, Davey said the UK would only pay the extra if other countries came forward to contribute. “We are doing that to encourage others to give,” he said. So far, 14 other nations including Mexico and South Korea have contributed to the GCF, bringing the total with the UK contribution to about $9bn. Australia, led by climate sceptic Tony Abbott, has refused to give money to the ECF. Davey said that the recent agreement of EU leaders to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 provided a chance to reject the politics of division. He said: “In the UK, we may be experiencing the politics of division – whether from the Scottish Nationalists or Ukip. And our TV screens may be full of conflicts from Syria to Ukraine. Yet, remarkably, climate politics is experiencing a quiet but steady recognition of our common goals and shared interests."
"The double whammy of global warming and a growing, ageing population will mean peoples’ exposure to deadly heatwaves will multiply tenfold this century, according to a new report from the Royal Society.  The researchers from the UK’s science academy warn the world is not prepared for the extreme weather which is already being exacerbated by climate change today.  The world’s population is expected to swell from 7bn today to a peak of 10bn by mid-century, and the new analysis examines for the first time how this boom will affect the number of people hit by extreme weather, if the relentless rise in carbon emissions is not reversed.  The combination of population growth and climate change means the impacts of flooding around the world will be increased fourfold and drought impact will be trebled. The report also warns that failure to prepare for more extreme weather would cause huge economic damage, meaning entire nations having their credit ratings downgraded and major companies going bust.  Heatwaves are the climate impact most exacerbated by population changes, because they are particularly dangerous for people over 65 and the global population is ageing quickly.  The greying populations of UK and western Europe mean the region is particularly affected by this multiplication affect. In 2003, a 20-day heatwave killed 52,000 people across Europe but. Without action on climate change, once-rare heatwaves will happen every other year by 2100.  The US, China and north Africa will also be among those suffering from the magnified impact of heatwaves. The combined climate-population damage from flooding and droughts will be felt heavily in western Europe, while India and sub-Saharan Africa will be struck by all three types of extreme weather. “Extreme weather has a huge impact on society and globally we are not resilient even now,” said Professor Georgina Mace, from University College London and who led the group of 24 physical, social and economic scientists. “This is why we have seen these horrible events [like typhoon Haiyan and hurricane Sandy] in the past few years, with many people affected. If we continue on our current trajectory the problem is likely to get much worse as our climate and population change.” The damages are severe in both harm to people and property, the report stated. Extreme-weather damage cost $1.4 trillion (£0.9 trillion) from 1980-2004, of which only a quarter was insured. People in the poorest nations make up just 11% of those exposed to hazards but suffered over half the deaths from disasters. Mace said the time to act to increase global resilience to extreme weather was now, as major international efforts to tackle climate change, disaster reduction and sustainable development all have deadlines in 2015.  “The good news is there are some solutions,” she said. She contrasted the 900,000 lives lost to floods in Odisha in India in 1999 with the 21 lost on 2013 when floods returned. Planning, defences and early warning systems had all been implemented after 1999. Rowan Douglas, one of the report team and chair of the research network run by Willis Insurance, said developed countries need to act too. “The UK is comparatively well prepared for extreme weather, but it absolutely cannot afford to be complacent about maintaining that position.” Despite the UK government’s own scientists concluding that flood risk is rising, flood defence spending since 2010 has been cut. Douglas said it was also vital that the cost of extreme weather damage is built into the world’s economic and financial systems, to ensure that long-term protection measures are seen as good value for money. He said the insurance industry had already been forced to change. “What was an existential risk to the insurance sector is now, at the least, a material risk for the financial wellbeing of the wider economy,” Douglas said. “The credit rating agencies are seriously exploring extending techniques used to stress test insurance companies against extreme weather and disaster risk to corporates and potentially nations. They recognise there is a risk now that needs to be properly managed.” Asked if countries or companies could have their credit ratings downgraded because they were not properly managing the risk of extreme weather to their economies or solvency, Douglas said: “Absolutely yes.” Prof Andrew Watkinson, at the University of East Anglia and not part of the research team, said: “This timely report reminds us that extreme weather events affect us all, that we are not as resilient to current extreme events as we could be, and that the nature of extreme events is likely to change in the future. At a time when deep cuts are being made in public spending it is essential that government does not lose sight of its key role in enabling resilience.”"

"It’s extraordinary how the financial markets that pride themselves on their data analysis and forecasting have such a blind spot when it comes to the impacts of climate change. I was reminded of this by a new report released today from the Royal Society, which calls on our global financial systems to start considering the risks posed by extreme weather, or risk condemning millions of people to die.  The failure of financial institutions to focus on the dangers comes despite increasing numbers of businesses and other organisations reporting that their operations are being hit by droughts and flooding. In fact, the Royal Society points out that between 1980 and 2004 the total cost of extreme weather came to $1.4tn (£8.8bn), of which just one quarter was insured. By the middle of the century, it is estimated that large coastal cities alone could face combined annual losses of $1tn (£6.3bn) as a result of flooding. The report, Resilience to Extreme Weather, is scathing of business surveys, economic forecasts and country briefings that guide investment decisions and credit ratings, but that focus only on established risks such as the availability of skilled labour, access to export markets, political and economic stability, and financial incentives.  It calls for changes to global financial accounting and regulation to ensure extreme weather risk is correctly accounted for and comes up with suggestions for how to do this. Using the experience gained in the reinsurance industry, it calls on public and private institutions to undergo stress tests, which would include reporting their maximum probable annual losses due to extreme events, against their current assets and operations. By bringing this information into the public domain and placing a value on resilience, the Royal Society hopes it will incentivise capital owners, ranging from homeowners and multinational corporations to cities and countries, to respond to the dangers. The report concludes:  Until these risks are accurately evaluated and reported, companies will have limited incentives to reduce them, and valuations and investment decisions will continue to be poorly informed. Although some disaster risk information is already disclosed and used by investors, the data and procedures for making assessments are not standardised, which can limit their usefulness. Ultimately, without financial reform, people’s resilience will be undermined in the future. At the recent climate talks in New York, the UNISDR, part of the UN Secretariat tasked with ensuring disaster risk reduction, convened a coalition of accounting organisations, asset managers, central banks, credit ratings agencies, risk modellers, financial regulators and science leaders in an attempt to create what it calls resilience accounting. The Royal Society believes a common set of measures and indicators could be relatively easily achieved within the next five years, at a very low cost relative to the costs inflicted by extreme weather. Rowan Douglas, a member of the report’s working group and chair of the Willis Research Network, said:  If two otherwise identical international companies have different resilience to extreme weather risks, then one should have a proportionately lower share price or valuation to reflect this higher financial risk. As the frequency and severity of extreme events is increasing, there is increasing exposure of assets to risk. This brings an ever larger disconnect between material risk and asset valuation. Unless financial reforms are made to correct this, we will condemn ourselves to building vulnerable cities in the coming decades at the cost of millions of lost lives and livelihoods and billions of lost dollars, often across regions and communities that can least afford these catastrophic setbacks. The fact that the financial markets have until now put their collective heads in the sand should come as no surprise. Actuarial professionals, whose very job it is to look after risk management in the financial sector and beyond, have continued to ignore climate change. I reported on this failure last year when the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries produced a report which showed that global warming and its associated challenges could wipe out the entire defined benefits pensions industry within 30 years if we don’t rapidly change course. The Resource Constraints research report, published by the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, concluded:  The more extreme scenarios modelled represent financial disaster; the assets of pension schemes will effectively be wiped out and pensions will be reduced to negligible levels. Currently, actuarial models are effectively discounting to zero the probability of economic growth being limited by resource constraints. If resource constraints are significant, this means that current models will persistently understate the value of liabilities.

"A mirror that sends heat into the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth. Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres by doing away with power-hungry cooling systems.  Around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the US goes on air conditioning, but the researchers’ calculations suggest that in some cases, the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling. In a rooftop comparison of the device in Stanford, California, scientists found that while a surface painted black reached 60C more than ambient temperature in sunlight, and bare aluminium reached 40C more, the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature. “If you cover significant parts of the roof with this mirror, you can see how much power it can save. You can significantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning,” said Shanhui Fan, an expert in photonics at Stanford University who led the development of the mirror. “In some situations the computations say you can completely offset the air conditioning.” Buildings warm up in a number of different ways. Hot water boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings. In hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. Then there is visible light and infra-red radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings. The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it reflects 97% of the visible light that falls on it. But more importantly, it works as a thermal radiator. When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a specific wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space. To make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to dump unwanted heat. The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. For example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. Use a bucket of hot coals and the result will the very different. The Stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink: the universe itself. The mirror is built from several layers of wafer-thin materials. The first layer is reflective silver. On top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. These layers improve the reflectivity, but also turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around 10 micrometres. Since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength, the heat passes straight out to space. The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres, or two thousandths of a millimetre. “The cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day,” the scientists write in Nature. In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at ambient temperature. Writing in the journal, Fan puts the installed cost of mirrors at between $20 and $70 per square metre and calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh per year on a three storey building. Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings – or other objects – simply by putting it in direct contact with them. Coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior. More likely, the mirror would be used to cool water or some other fluid that would then be pumped around the building. He ruled out the idea of using the mirrors to slow down global warming. “Roof space accounts for only a small portion of the Earth’s surface, so at this point we don’t think this would be a geoengineering solution. Rather, our contribution on the green house gas emission issue is simply to reduce electricity consumption,” he said. “I’m really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling,” said Marin Soljačić, a physicist at MIT. “You could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldn’t need it at all. You could put it on top of shopping malls. With a large enough surface you could get substantial cooling.”"
"Japan has pledged $1.5bn to help developing countries adapt to climate change, one day after the US earmarked $3bn for the same fund as part of efforts to build momentum for strong global action. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the US president, Barack Obama, announced the new commitment to the green climate fund after a trilateral meeting that also included the Australian leader, Tony Abbott.  Australian negotiators at the G20 summit in Brisbane have argued against including a call for contributions to the fund in the final communique, which was due to be issued on Sunday afternoon. The White House said the US and Japan were “making good on our commitment to support efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilience worldwide” by pledging a combined $4.5bn to the green climate fund. “This includes up to $3bn from the US and up to $1.5bn from Japan, subject to respective domestic procedures and based on strong contributions from other donors,” the statement said. “Our pledges build on those already announced by Germany, France, and other donors, which include developed and developing countries.” Other countries are due to make commitments to the fund at a pledging session in Berlin on Thursday. Obama delivered a speech on the sidelines of the G20 summit on Saturday, emphasising the need for all countries to take strong action on climate change and confirming the Guardian’s report on Friday about the $3bn US pledge. He said the fund would help vulnerable communities with early warning systems, stronger defences against storm surges and climate-resilient infrastructure, while supporting farmers to plant more durable crops. The White House said the US and Japan wanted to reveal their pledges promptly and at the leader level “to provide great momentum to the ongoing climate change negotiations toward a post-2020 agreement that is applicable to all, in which countries make ambitious and transparent commitments to reduce their emissions”. They wanted to “encourage all countries that are able to join us in pledging” to the fund, the White House said. A joint statement on the trilateral meeting of Abe, Obama and Abbott did not mention the fund, but said the countries wanted to strengthen their partnership to “ensure a peaceful, stable, and prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region”. This would include deepening security and defence cooperation. The three leaders “resolved to tackle pressing issues” such as developments in Ukraine. They condemned “Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea and its actions to destabilise eastern Ukraine” and expressed support for “bringing to justice those responsible for the downing of flight MH17” in July. The leaders also made general statements on the importance of defeating Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq and Syria, the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, and the nuclear threat from North Korea."

"Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced a climate bill in the US Senate last week. The American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act proposes to tax carbon pollution at the source or at the border for imports, and return 100% of the revenue to taxpayers. The tax would therefore be revenue-neutral, not increasing the size of government. A revenue-neutral carbon tax has become an increasingly popular proposal for tackling global warming. Liberals have long been on board with requiring that polluters pay for their carbon emissions, but in the United States and a few other countries where climate science is treated as a partisan issue, conservatives have been resistant to this concept.  Research has shown that fear of government regulations is one of the primary reasons conservatives tend to reject the overwhelming scientific evidence for human-caused global warming. A majority of Republicans accept the scientific reality when they realize there are free market solutions available. The American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act is a free market solution that, because it’s revenue-neutral, wouldn’t increase the size of government. All of the revenue generated would be returned to taxpayers through a variety of possible paths: Senators Whitehouse and Schatz are willing to negotiate these various options with Republicans. However, the bill faces a tough road. Many free market carbon pricing bills have been proposed in both the US House of Representatives and Senate, and none have been voted into law. For example, The first four bills listed above proposed carbon cap and trade systems. Boxer-Sanders proposed a carbon tax, but one that’s not revenue-neutral. Van Hollen introduced the first revenue-neutral carbon cap and trade system. ACES was the only effort to come close to becoming law. It passed the House of Representatives in 2009 by a vote of 219–212. The Senate version (Kerry and Lieberman’s Clean Jobs and American Power Act) had a majority of votes, but not the 60-vote super-majority needed to break through a filibuster. Despite the failed history of climate legislation in the US Congress, Senator Whitehouse is optimistic about his bill’s chances for two main reasons. First, he feels that since Republicans control both houses of Congress for the first time since 2006, they can’t just continue their strategy of obstructionism from the minority. They’re obligated to get something done, especially if they want to maintain control of the Senate in a 2016 election with a map far more favorable for the Democrats than in 2014. Second, the Environmental Protection Agency is proceeding with its regulation of carbon pollution from power plants. Republicans hate this government regulation, and the Whitehouse-Schatz bill is designed to potentially replace it with a free market, small government alternative. Passing a climate bill in Congress is Republicans’ only realistic shot at eliminating the government regulation of carbon pollution. It’s also important to remember that John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, authored a major climate bill just five years ago. Climate change hasn’t been a purely partisan issue in the GOP for very long, so perhaps the party could change tracks relatively quickly and start treating the issue with the seriousness it needs and deserves once again. The Whitehouse-Schatz bill is nevertheless a long shot. For example, Senator David Vitter (R-LA) responded to the proposed legislation by saying,  It’s not just energy prices that would skyrocket from a carbon tax, but the cost of nearly everything built in America would go up. And let’s not lose sight of how big of a dud cap and trade was in 2009, or as it came to be known — cap and tax. For some reason Democrats continue to ignore what a disaster these ideas have been for Europe. Senator Vitter’s objections are not strong ones. While a carbon tax would raise energy prices, that increase would be offset when the revenue is returned to taxpayers. Analysis of a similar revenue-neutral carbon tax proposal found that it could increase personal disposable income in most parts of the America and thus create jobs and modestly benefit the US economy. Senators Whitehouse and Schatz aren’t proposing a cap and trade system, but the 2009 legislation mentioned by Senator Vitter was no dud; it came within a few votes in the Senate of becoming law. The European Union also implemented a cap and trade system, not a tax. While the system has had its problems, Europe produces much less carbon pollution than the United States, while its economy has done equally well since the cap and trade system was launched in 2005. Senator Whitehouse is right that his bill probably has the best chance to become law of any climate legislation proposed in the past five years. The alternative for Republicans is to fight to undermine EPA regulations through funding cuts, with little chance of success given that they face a Presidential veto or another government shutdown if they choose this path. Republicans also face a generational gap on this issue, much like they did with gay marriage. When asked, “Should the federal government limit the release of greenhouse gases if it raised your monthly energy expenses by 20 dollars a month?,” 61% of Republicans between the ages of 18 and 49 answered yes. Republicans over the age of 50 split evenly in answering the question. Congressional Republicans are caught between a rock and a hard place. If they support any climate legislation, they risk alienating their hardcore ideological base, facing a primary challenge in the next election, and losing campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry. If they don’t, they risk alienating young voters and hurting their long-term election prospects, and they’ll keep the EPA carbon pollution regulations in place. Moreover, 2014 is likely to be the hottest year on record, and with an El Niño possibly forming, 2015 could be the second consecutive record-breaking year. The impacts of human-caused global warming will only become harder and harder to deny as extreme weather events become more intense and frequent. In other words, Congressional Republicans would risk their jobs by supporting Senator Whitehouse’s bill, and they would risk the long-term viability of the Republican Party, and of a liveable climate, by opposing it."

"The green climate fund will be part of any international emissions reduction deal in Paris next year, the French president said in Canberra on Wednesday. Tony Abbott, standing alongside François Hollande as he made the announcement, has said Australia will not be contributing to the fund.  The prime minister has committed only to considering further climate policies “in the coming months”. The fund promises money to help the poorest countries with climate adaptation and mitigation and is seen as vital to winning their backing for a new global deal. Abbott again pointed to Australia’s domestic $2.5bn emissions reduction fund and the $10bn clean energy finance corporation, which he is trying to abolish, as examples of what Australia is already doing. “We will be considering our position in terms of targets, in terms of contributions to various funds in coming months. But when it comes to funds, let me just make this observation,” the prime minister said. “We’ve just passed a law in our parliament to establish a $2.55bn fund over the next four years to purchase abatement. So, this is a very significant fiscal contribution to the task of global emissions reduction. “We’ve also got the clean energy finance corporation, a $10bn institution which is in the business of funding various projects which have economic and environmental outcomes. “Finally, a significant part of our aid contribution, our overseas aid, particularly in the Pacific, is climate mitigation. So, Australia is doing a lot and obviously we’ll consider what more we can do in the weeks and months ahead.” Abbott said it was “very important that we don’t have another disaster like [the 2009 climate conference] in Copenhagen. For Paris to be a success, we “can’t pursue environmental improvements at the expense of economic progress”, he said. Hollande stressed the importance of the green climate fund to the negotiations before Paris and for countries to bring forward their new emissions reduction pledges well ahead of the meeting, late next year. The green fund contributions already announced (which include a $3bn pledge by the US and a $1.5bn pledge by Japan revealed during the G20 summit) “show very clearly that if we want the emerging countries and the more fragile countries to participate in this global growth, we have to ... support them,” Hollande said. He said the new deal had to be “legally binding, and it has to … have some sort of link with the green fund”. Abbott said it was “good to hear Francois talking about a binding agreement coming out of Paris. What’s important is that the agreement is strong and effective and that the targets are met. That’s the point – targets have to be met and when it comes to [the Kyoto protocols] Australia more than met its reductions targets, and that can’t be said of other countries.” Australia did exceed its Kyoto targets – after negotiating an extremely generous deal at that meeting. Australia was one of only two countries allowed to increase its emissions by the Kyoto target year of 2012. Australian emissions were allowed to climb 8% compared with a 1990 baseline and Australia also negotiated a deal to include land use emissions, which credited a steep reduction in land clearing in Queensland that had already occurred when the deal was done. The Abbott government insists its Direct Action fund will be able to meet the next target - a 5% cut by 2020 – although analysts believe this will be difficult. Canada – one of the few countries previously in line with Australia’s opposition to the green climate fund – now appears to have changed its mind, with Abbott’s close friend prime minister Stephen Harper telling journalists at the G20 he was preparing to make a contribution. Last November, Abbott and Harper “made history” by jointly dissenting from support for the fund in a communique from the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. After his meeting with Hollande Abbott also said Australia would move quickly to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union, saying the agreements clinched with Japan, South Korea and China showed Australia was “capable of moving quickly ... more quickly than people might think.” The two leaders also discussed how to deal with citizens leaving to fight in Iraq and Syria."
"“No sun – no moon!/ No morn – no noon –/ No dawn – no dusk – no proper time of day./ No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease,/ No comfortable feel in any member –/ No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,/ No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds! –/ November!” So wrote British poet Thomas Hood in 1844, and today many of us still share his sentiments about this gloomy month. But it turns out that the November Hood wrote about was very different to the November we experience today. The Central England temperature record (originally published by Professor Gordon Manley in 1953) is an unblemished record of temperature for the Midlands region, stretching from 1659 to the present day. The average November temperature over the entire time period is 6.0°C. However, if the 20th century is taken in isolation the average November temperature rises to 6.5°C. Meanwhile, the Novembers of the 21st century average a balmy 7.4°C. And then we come to the rain. November is a relatively wet month and the average November rainfall for England and Wales for the period 1766 to 2013 is 93.7mm. But Hood’s experience of the month tended to be drier, with averages in the 70s and 80s, while 21st-century Novembers are averaging the upper 90s, thanks to a recent spate of soggy ones. So it seems that Hood’s experience was generally colder and drier than the Novembers of today. But the shortening days, bare branches and lack of wildlife remain the same; and, for many, Hood’s poem still rings true."
"Australia is one of just four nations not on track to meet emissions reduction promises, a UN report has warned, while a US-based research firm has poured scorn on Tony Abbott’s insistence that coal is “good for humanity.” A report by the UN Environment Programme states that the world should aim to be “carbon neutral” by 2070 at the latest. Exceeding a budget of just 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide would risk “severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible climate change impacts”.  In an analysis of each signatory to a UN goal to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels, the report found that just four nations – Australia, Canada, Mexico and the US – needed to do more to meet their respective emissions reduction targets by 2020. The UNEP analysis finds that Australia is set to emit 710 million tonnes of CO2 in 2020. This is well above the 555 million tonnes it would emit if it were to meet a goal of a 5% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, based on 2000 levels. The report notes that Australia’s Coalition government has “replaced carbon-pricing mechanism with Emissions Reduction Fund. This results in an increase in projected emissions for 2020.” After scrapping carbon pricing in July, emissions have risen in Australia, reversing a previous downward trend. The replacement Direct Action policy, which the government claims will be more effective and a lesser burden on cost of living pressures, will start voluntary payments to businesses to reduce emissions from the first quarter next year. Independent analysis has cast doubt on whether Direct Action will meet the 5% emissions reduction goal. The UNEP said countries could slash emissions through renewable energy and energy efficiency while maintaining economic growth. Achim Steiner, executive director of UNEP, said there are “many synergies between development and climate change mitigation goals. “Linking development policies with climate mitigation will help countries build the energy-efficient, low-carbon infrastructures of the future and achieve transformational change that echoes the true meaning of sustainable development.” In October, Abbott said coal was “good for humanity” because it would be used to lift millions of people out of poverty, In subsequent G20 talks, Abbott reportedly told international leaders he was “standing up for coal”. This position was directly challenged at the launch of the UNEP report in Washington DC. Andrew Steer, president of US development research organisation World Resources Institute, said Australia was wrong to view fossil fuels as the way to boost economic growth. Steer said better technology and more efficient uses of resources were the best paths to alleviate poverty, claiming that US$19tn would be invested in renewable energy globally over the next 15 years. “We can’t afford not to do it; the economic imperative is to act,” Steer said. The report presents just the latest climate change headache for the government. Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, has spoken out against a speech made by US president Barack Obama over the threat posed by climate change to the Great Barrier Reef. In an apparent contradiction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the government’s own Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Bishop said the reef was not in danger and that a decline in water quality had been reversed. Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, said the UNEP report was evidence that the Direct Action climate policy wouldn’t work. “Tony Abbott is taking Australia backwards, while the rest of the world moves forward,” he said. “The United Nations report demonstrates that under the carbon price mechanism, Australia’s carbon pollution reductions reduced by 7% – for the first time in history. “World leaders, including some of Australia’s largest trading partners, have pledged to increase their emissions reduction targets. Tony Abbott would rather pay polluters to pollute and keep his head in the sand.”"
"Who remembers that climate change was a top priority early in George W Bush’s first term as US president? Merchants of Doubt, a new documentary film released in US cinemas this week, reminds us that in June 2001 Bush and the Republican party were 100% committed to curbing carbon emissions causing global warming.   Six months later everything changed. The film shows Republican party leader John Boehner calling the idea of global warming “laughable”, said Merchants of Doubt director Robert Kenner.   With the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center occupying attention, Americans For Prosperity, a powerful, fossil-fuel lobby group founded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, launched a decade-long, multi-pronged campaign to sow doubt about the reality of climate change. By equating the findings of climate scientists as an attack on personal freedoms, they cleverly shifted the focus away from science to political opinion. “Creating a focus point away from what is actually going on is how magicians pull off their tricks,” said Kenner who directed the Oscar-nominated documentary Food Inc.  The deception has worked well. Few Americans know 97% of scientists agree climate change is caused by human activity and is happening now.  Inspired by the 2010 book of the same name, Kenner’s film is about deception and profiles many of the charming and always smiling professional deceivers who work for the tobacco, chemical, pharmaceutical, and fossil fuel industries. The tobacco industry knowingly and successfully deceived the public for 50 years about the connection between smoking and cancer, the 1988 tobacco lawsuit settlement revealed. In a pattern of manipulation clearly evident today in the manufactured ‘debate’ over climate change, the tobacco industry used media-friendly pseudo-experts, doctored ‘science’ studies and attacked the credibility of scientists or experts who said otherwise, Kenner said.  Peter Sparber, one the tobacco industry’s most successful deceivers, told Kenner that he could get the public to believe a garbage man knew more about science than prominent climate scientist James Hansen.  “If you can sell tobacco you can sell anything,” Sparber tells Kenner. Selling confusion and doubt around a complex issue like climate change was far easier than selling tobacco. Nearly all of those well-paid climate misinformers have no science background and often clear ties to industry lobby groups and yet are treated as expert commentators on climate science by media. It’s not just Fox News. Serious news outlets like CNN and the New York Times are complicit by featuring misinformers in news articles and on discussion panels, he said.  The film also focuses on the many self-described “grassroots” organisations that are actually promoting specific corporate and political interests. These organisations are often aided by, and passionately supported by, ordinary citizens who believe they are fighting for personal freedoms and libertarian or conservative values.   Kenner is hoping audiences “will realise they’ve been lied to” and develop better “bullshit detectors”.   "

"Groundbreaking 3D mapping of previously inaccessible areas of the Antarctic has found that the sea ice fringing the vast continent is thicker than previous thought. Two expeditions to Antarctica by scientists from the UK, USA and Australia analysed an area of ice spanning 500,000 metres squared, using a robot known as SeaBed. The survey discovered ice thickness average between 1.4m and 5.5m, with a maximum ice thickness of 16m. Scientists also discovered that 76% of the mapped ice was ‘deformed’ – meaning that huge slabs of ice have crashed into each other to create larger, denser bodies of ice. The team behind the research, published in Nature Geoscience, have hailed it as an important breakthrough in better understanding the vast icy wilderness. The findings will provide a starting point to further work to discover how ice thickness, as well as extent, is changing. Previously, measurements of Antarctic ice thickness were hindered by technological constraints. Ice breaking ships could only go so far into ice to measure depth, while no-one had drilled much more than 5.5m down into the ice to extract a core for analysis. SeaBed, an autonomous underwater vehicle (or AUV), was used by the research team to analyse ice thickness at an underwater depth of 20 to 30 metres. Driven in a “lawnmower” pattern, the two-metre long robot used upward-looking sonar to measure and map the underside of sea ice floes. Oceanography robots are usually focused on the sea floor. The mapping took place during two expeditions, in 2010 and 2012, that took researchers to the coastal areas of the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and Wilkes Land regions of Antarctica. The teams came from the British Antarctic Survey, the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies in Tasmania and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US. Dr Guy Williams, from IMAS, said the research is an important step in gauging changes to Antarctic ice. “Sea ice is an important indicator of the polar climate but measuring its thickness has been tricky,” said Williams, the report’s co-author. “Along with the satellite data, it was a bit like taking an X-ray of the ice, although we haven’t X-rayed much of it, just a postage stamp. “The key thing is that this is a game changer because it was previously very challenging to measure ice depth. We were limited to visual observation from the decks of ships or ice cores and take measures. “It was a lot of hard work and quite crude, which means we were biased towards thinner ice. It was a bit like a doctor diagnosing a condition by prodding the skin.” Williams said researchers will now make routine surveys of ice thickness to determine changes over a long period of time. As well as tracking alterations due to climate change, the research will be of interest to marine biologists due to the creatures, such as krill, that inhabit the region. “This is a big step forward in our knowledge but we’ll need to have longer missions in larger areas,” he said. “What we ultimately want is a team of autonomous robots that self deploy all across the Antarctic, like the spokes in a wheel.” Hanumant Singh, an engineering scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution whose lab designed, built and operated the AUV, said: “Putting an AUV together to map the underside of sea ice is challenging from a software, navigation and acoustic communications standpoint. “SeaBed’s manoeuvrability and stability made it ideal for this application where we were doing detailed floe-scale mapping and deploying, as well as recovering in close-packed ice conditions. “It would have been tough to do many of the missions we did, especially under the conditions we encountered, with some of the larger vehicles.”"

"Next year in Paris the world’s leaders need to find proper solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change, as Robin McKie explained (“Six vital steps world leaders must agree to take to protect Earth”, In Focus). But there is no mention that a price should be put on carbon. It is essential that the externalities of carbon are internalised in the price, as we often do not directly pay for the associated health and environmental costs. People who are not responsible for the pollution can suffer from the consequences and this is not fair. The revenue gained from carbon pricing can be used for the Green Climate Fund to lessen the impacts of climate change globally.  The key driver behind climate change is excessive consumption. Consumption creates higher energy demand, requires more resources and has a large impact on global pollution levels. Limiting consumption will not be solved by technology, which McKie mentions as the key factor to stop temperature rise, but requires political will and awareness among consumers. Instead of focusing on pollution from the production sides solely, the world’s leaders must take action to limit the effects of consumption on the environment, just as consumers need to be more aware how much they contribute to climate change through their behaviour. The problems will even be more severe with the increasing demand for energy and resources in the future, especially of the developing nations, so solutions are needed as soon as possible. Yanniek Huisman Rijswijk, The Netherlands Chris Rapley and Duncan Macmillan are absolutely right that, although climate change has been revealed by science, it’s not really about science (“Climate change is not just a matter of science. It’s about the world we want to live in, the future we want to create”, special report). They are also right that, despite all the technology we’ve thrown at the problem, emissions continue to rise. This is because no feasible technology will sufficiently decouple economic activity and environmental impact – the challenge is political rather than scientific. So it’s a shame that, in the face of all the evidence, Rapley sticks with the line that his hope “lies with the engineers”, and that he is encouraging his daughter to be one. When will scientists take the political plunge? Andrew Dobson  Spire, Keele University, Staffordshire Nobody wanted climate change. James Watt’s steam engine started it but, unlike slavery for example, those who brought it about didn’t know that what they were doing was harmful to people. Now we know. So from now on, we are faced with the decision to take effective action. We must join together and ask our leaders to do this. Generate electricity from renewable sources. Insulate homes to reduce demand for heating. Adopt agricultural practices that sequester more carbon than they produce. It’s all possible and we have to start doing it. Don’t waste time blaming people or feeling guilty, but do talk about it. Make governments start now to reduce and then reverse greenhouse gas emissions. It is their most fundamental duty to us. Jeanne Warren Oxford Your analysis on climate change concentrated on the usual relatively easy fixes and, like almost all articles on the subject, ignored the problem of rapidly increasing population. There is no crisis without people, and since having children is such a fundamental right, it seems easier to concentrate on renewables than seriously try to address this basic truth. It’s often said reassuringly that population size in developing nations is static or falling. Whether true or not, it also seems likely that the current 7 billion will be 9 billion in a few years, and presumably go on increasing, putting at greater risk food, space, water, shelter. Wouldn’t it be sensible for governments to start thinking about this, rather than wait for nature to fix things? Mark Dickinson Barnet, Herts"
"Climate change threatens the survival of the UK’s honey bee population, new academic research has claimed. An exotic parasite which targets the insects is set to flourish in northern Europe if the Earth continues to warm, scientists at Queen’s University, Belfast found. The study assessed the future threat posed by the gut parasite Nosema ceranae, which originates in Asia but can now be found worldwide. New evidence of the parasite’s superior competitive ability and the link between its population size and climate change has been published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Co-author of the study and adjunct reader at Queen’s School of Biological Sciences, Professor Robert Paxton said: “This emerging parasite is more susceptible to cold than its original close relative, possibly reflecting its presumed origin in east Asia. “In the face of rising global temperatures, our findings suggest that it will increase in prevalence and potentially lead to increased honey bee colony losses in Britain.” Co-researcher Myrsini Natsopoulou, from the Martin-Luther-Universitat Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, said: “Our results reveal not only that the exotic parasite is a better competitor than its original close relative, but that its widespread distribution and patterns of prevalence in nature depend on climatic conditions too”. This study, ‘Interspecific competition in honey bee intracellular gut parasites is asymmetric and favours the spread of an emerging infectious disease’ was funded by the Insect Pollinators Initiative."
"Thirty countries meeting in Berlin on Thursday pledged $9.3bn for a fund to help developing countries cut emissions and prepare for global warming, just shy of a $10bn target. The South Korea-based Green Climate Fund aims to help nations invest in clean energy and green technology and build up defences against rising seas and worsening storms, floods and droughts. German Environment Minister Gerd Mueller, after co-hosting the donors’ conference, hailed the achievement, saying humanity must fight climate change so “it doesn’t go the way of the dinosaurs”. Hela Cheikhrouhou, the fund’s executive director, praised the “game-changing” pledging conference which had raised a record amount for international climate finance in just five months. She said the money would be spent equally for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially for the most vulnerable nations, including small island nations and Africa’s poorest countries. Cheikhrouhou said raising the billions had created “renewed trust and enthusiasm” ahead of international talks in Peru next month, and in France a year later, on slashing worldwide carbon emissions. The fund is designed to help those countries least to blame for, but most at risk from, climate change with grants, loans and private capital for projects such as solar and wind farms, planting trees or disaster-proofing infrastructure. UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, has called for an initial capitalisation of at least $10bn by the end of the year, to be disbursed over four years from 2015. The United States days ago pledged $3bn and Japan $1.5bn. Germany and France and Britain have promised about $1bn each, and Sweden over $500m. Smaller amounts have been offered by countries including Switzerland, South Korea, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Mexico, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. Australia has ruled out contributing but Canada is expected to make a pledge. The fund is seen as a step toward a far more ambitious goal set at the Copenhagen climate summit five years ago – for the world to “mobilise” $100bn a year for broader climate finance by 2020. UN climate experts have cautioned there is no time to lose in the battle against global warming, which the world body’s chief Ban Ki-moon last week labelled “the defining issue of our times”. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned this month that time is running out to limit warming to 2C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. They said Earth is on a likely trajectory for at least 4C warming – a recipe for melting ice caps, extreme weather events, habitat and species loss and conflict for resources. The UN Emissions Gap report released on Wednesday reiterated that pollution is still rising and urged action for global carbon neutrality by mid-to-late century. “This report is telling us that we are pointing in the wrong direction – and time is running out for us to get back on track,” said Taryn Fransen of co-authors the World Resources Institute. After years that saw little progress in climate talks, the world’s two biggest economies and top polluters, China and the United States, earlier this month agreed to new targets. At a Beijing meeting, President Barack Obama committed the United States to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 26-28% by 2025 compared to two decades earlier. China, the world’s top polluter, agreed for the first time to slow emissions growth and ultimately reverse it after emissions peaking “around 2030.” The 28-state European Union, the third-largest greenhouse gas producer, has pledged to cut its emissions by at least 40% by 2030 from 1990 levels."
"If you thought there was a machine that could magically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and bury it underground, would you be less likely to worry about reducing your own carbon footprint? The question is not entirely hypothetical. Geoengineering is the catch-all term for a suite of technologies that could one day be used to alter the Earth’s climate and combat global warming. Most of them are unlikely to ever see the light of day: they are considered too risky, too unpredictable, or too reckless to be taken seriously by the scientific community.   But the warnings from scientists about the dangers of a warmer world (and the inadequacy of existing climate policies) have become shriller by the year. And as a result, the voices whispering that geoengineering could one day become a reality have grown harder to ignore.  As geoengineering has gradually moved on to the policy agenda, debates about the ethics of meddling with the global thermostat have become more prominent. Central among these is whether geoengineering might undermine fragile public and political support for the more pressing business of reducing carbon emissions. This is what is known by economists and philosophers as a ‘moral hazard’ argument: the phenomenon whereby people who feel insured against a particular risk are more likely to exhibit risky behaviour. Will the prospect of geoengineering make people feel ‘insured’ against the risks of climate change, and indulge in ‘riskier’ environmental behaviour themselves? In a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society on Monday, my colleague Nick Pidgeon and I attempted to answer that question. Using a nationally representative online survey, we provided 610 people with a ‘factsheet’ about geoengineering, and then asked them a series of questions.  One striking finding was that some people seem more susceptible to the ‘trap’ of the moral hazard than others. People who were wealthier, and who identified with self-focused values such as power and status, were more likely to agree with the statement “Knowing geoengineering is a possibility makes me feel less inclined to make changes in my own behaviour to tackle climate change.”  In general, people who are wealthier have bigger carbon footprints. Our findings suggest that people with bigger carbon footprints may treat geoengineering as an excuse to avoid personal behavioural changes. People in the study who held pro-environmental values didn’t see themselves as susceptible to the moral hazard, but feared that other people – and especially politicians – would take their eye off the ball if geoengineering was on the horizon. Perhaps unsurprisingly, climate change sceptics were not particularly worried that geoengineering would distract attention from other climate policies. After all, if someone doesn’t support policies to tackle climate change in the first place, then the moral hazard of geoengineering is really not a hazard at all.  Previous research has suggested, though, that geoengineering could be more appealing to sceptics than existing climate policies (as it doesn’t involve regulating industries or government intervention in people’s daily lives) or that it could even galvanise support for climate change among this group.  But our findings did not back this. Learning about geoengineering from the information provided in our study didn’t alter levels of concern about climate change among sceptical participants. This is the first time that any systematic evidence has been produced on how this key aspect of the geoengineering debate will shape the public discourse as it moves into the mainstream. What seems clear is that people with different values (and views on climate change) will respond to the logic of the moral hazard argument in very different ways.  For those deeply worried by society’s inadequate response to climate change, and doubtful of politicians’ commitment to the issue, the moral hazard of geoengineering confirms their worst fears.  But for people with an inconveniently large carbon footprint – or those who had no intention of reducing it in the first place – the prospect of geoengineering could be less a of a moral hazard and more of a ‘moral license’ to continue with business as usual.

"Climate change is a myth. We all know this, deep down. Some of you reading this may have been taken in by the fear-mongering governments or corrupt scientists so have been brainwashed into thinking climate change is a real thing that “threatens all of humanity” or some other nonsense, but it’s just that: nonsense. When you look closely at it, the so-called evidence for climate change, or “global warming” or “warmageddon” or “planetary death spiral” or whatever they’re calling it these days, it doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.  Take changes in sea level. They keep banging on about how the warming of the atmosphere causes rising sea levels, but if that was happening we’d have seen it by now! It’s been countless decades since they first started predicting this, but here we still are! But they persist in trying to convince us it’s a real threat, citing places that were supposedly “lost to the waves” and we’re supposed to believe that places like Atlantis, Miami or Skegness actually existed? You believe that rubbish and you probably believe we landed on Ganymede! And you’re an idiot, so there’s no hope for you.  And where does this rise in sea level supposedly come from – melting glacial ice? Like there was at any point massive blocks of ice just floating around in the ocean? You ever leave an ice cube in your drink last longer than five minutes? It melts, and yet we’re meant to believe these “ice caps” lasted millions of years. They’re not even trying to be convincing any more. And don’t get me started on this supposed food crisis. Charging £150 for a single loaf of bread? Are we supposed to believe this is due to widespread agricultural collapse brought about by climate change? Or, as is far more likely, is it a price-fixing conspiracy by the global bakery mega-corporation? When 78% of all food in this country is sold by Greggs, OF COURSE you’re going to see this sort of thing happening. It’s been nearly a century since he took office and I, like many, think Chancellor Farage was a great man, but he dropped the ball on that one.  It’s the same with these hypothetical mass extinctions, as if that’s anything to do with climate change. It’s just opportunistic cherry picking by these cynical and manipulative scientists. Harsh fact is, a lot of species go extinct, but that’s just nature. Dinosaurs went extinct millions of years before we humans ever appeared, are we supposed to take the blame for that too? Doesn’t mean I’m happy that we lost the elephants, tigers, pandas, salamanders, cows and poodles, but I don’t feel guilty about it either.  People tell me cows were once bred domestically. Can you imagine? This was supposedly stopped because they caused significant environmental damage due to methane and deforestation, but we all know it was orchestrated by the synthetic meat companies. They obviously got rid of all cattle to ensure their current global dominance. Just think; if they hadn’t killed all the cows, we’d still be slaughtering them today!  Then there’s this “extreme weather” nonsense. I’ve not noticed any changes in the weather outside of the norm. Clueless clime change believers keep telling me it’s a global change so that doesn’t mean anything, but I LIVE ON THE GLOBE, so I’d notice any changes wouldn’t I? Duh! But there haven’t been any changes, obviously. There are no more storms now than there was when I was a kid. I barely get struck by lightning more than once a month, maybe every three weeks at most, and it’s never done me any harm and I’ll kill anyone who says otherwise!  But it’s with these weather worries that these manipulative scientists really give the game away. Urging us to use more wind power but complaining about all the hurricanes we keep having? They got us all to convert to solar power decades ago but keep whining about prolonged sunny spells? MAKE YOUR MINDS UP!  Some of them even go so far as to say it’s climate change that’s causing forced migration of millions of people. But that’s clearly because everyone has solar cars and jetpacks and matter transporters now, so why would they stay in one place, with or without devastating environmental damage spurring them on.  It’s all a bit convenient, isn’t it, all this palaver over climate change? Weird how 99.9999% of all scientists purportedly agree that it’s definitely happening and our most powerful quantum computers are certain to over a million decimal places that it’s our fault? Weird how they’re saying this now, at exactly the same time when they need all the volunteers they can get for the moon and Mars colonies. What’s more likely; that human industrial activity actually does lead to climate change, or that it’s all a massive meticulous centuries-long ruse to convince people that leaving Earth is a good idea? Obviously, it’s the latter. These scientists have no shame or respect.  I can’t say I’m not tempted to go myself, though. I’d rather live on another planet, than on one where every aspect of your life is subject to rigorous scientific control. Nobody should have to put up with that crap.  Dean Burnett doesn’t actually agree with any of the claims in this piece, but don’t let that stop you commenting or shouting at him on Twitter @garwboy"
"By some projections, India’s financial capital, Mumbai, will experience “unprecedented heat” within the next two decades. Last June, the IPCC Fifth Assessment report warned of larger “near-term increases in seasonal mean and annual mean temperatures” in the region.  That spells longer, more frequent bouts of extreme heat, elevated minimum temperatures, and warmer winters. Last month, meanwhile, the journal Nature published a meta-analysis using 39 climate models to predict “dates of departures” when local temperatures would exceed historical extremes recorded over the previous 150 years. They figured Mumbai’s date with the inferno could come as early as 2034 if there was no change in global carbon output.  Though all of us are all sensitive to heat, and quick to react when it climbs above our comfort levels, our knowledge of how it might affect our health doesn’t really go beyond sunstrokes and fainting spells.  A 2008 paper by medical geographer Rais Akhtar and environmental epidemiologist Sari Kovats spells out the dubious gifts that climate-change exacerbated heat is likely to bring Asian cities.  This includes an uptick in deaths from cardio-respiratory disease, heat-related illness and death, increased rates of potential transmission of vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria, and a shrinking in the quantity and quality of available water, further amplifying the burden of disease. Researchers have also found that climate change-enhanced heat and humidity are conducive to the spread of falciparum malaria, the disease’s deadliest strain. No one is likely to suffer the ill effects of this heat more than the 7.25 million slum-dwellers who’ve made Mumbai their home, and who comprise well over half the city’s population.  “Slum-dwellers face a double burden: they face the crisis, and if they talk about it, they face evictions,” said Sheela Patel, a social worker who has helped the city’s shack and slum dwellers access suitable housing and infrastructure for two decades.  Akhtar notes that slums, due to density, lack of vegetation and materials used in construction, tend to be heat traps “exacerbated by the proximity of city structures, vehicle exhaust emissions, and industrial activity”. Slum dwellers are more vulnerable to the ravages of extreme heat for numerous reasons. “They have a higher exposure to heat since a very high number of them work outside, they have few adaptive measures since they live without air-conditioning in crowded homes frequently made of heat-absorbent materials, and they have no access to clean or even enough drinking water,” says Anjali Jaiswal, an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-authored the only existing India-specific study on the vulnerability of informal settlements to extreme heat, following the heat wave that hit Ahmedabad in May 2010.  According to a study Jaiswal co-authored this year, the heat wave, which saw temperatures hit 46.8 degrees, claimed an excess of 1,344 all-cause deaths – an estimated 43.1% spike compared to the same time of year in 2009 and 2011. This tragedy does have a happier postscript. In its wake, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, with the help of organisations including the NRDC and the Indian Institute of Public Health, devised a Heat Action Plan that was launched earlier this year.  “Ahmedabad is the only city with an early warning system for heat in South Asia because they saw infants and babies die, and then put the dots together during a crisis,” says Jaiswal. “Temperatures in Mumbai are already high, so we think an early warning system would benefit many, and save lives. But when we spoke with them about it [in 2011] we didn’t see much interest. It’s partly a question of political will.”  Sheela Patel says, “We talk about water conservation in the summer, not before the rains, we talk about mosquitoes when 400 people died of dengue. How about a response rather than a crisis? That’s the real headline.”"
"Lame duck at home, lion away. “We got beat,” Barack Obama said of the mid-term elections last week in which voters punished the Democrats, a result widely viewed as a damning critique of the president’s performance. Overseas, however, he remains capable of directing the agenda, placing climate change firmly at the centre of this weekend’s G20 negotiations. The president served up a confident – and at times defiant – foreign policy address at the University of Queensland Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 leaders’ summit. Obama hit all the right notes for his youthful Australian audience – largely school and university students – asking if anyone in the audience had any XXXX – the beer uniquely adored in Queensland. And he claimed to have picked up some of the local dialect, “Strine”, during childhood trips through Australia. “It’s good to be back in Australia, I love Australia, I really do. The only problem is every time I come here I’ve got sit in conference rooms and talk to politicians instead of going to the beach.” He said he was happy to be in “Brisvegas”, but worried about the country’s dangerous fauna, because “there are just a lot of things in Australia that can kill you”. The day after Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said Sydney was “nothing but bush” when the first fleet arrived in 1788, Obama conspicuously paid tribute to Aboriginal Australians. “I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land,” he said. The speech was preceded by a carnival-like atmosphere: hundreds queued happily outside in the heat, while others, without tickets, staked out with cameras the campus roundabout Obama’s advance team reportedly wanted removed, for (ultimately unrealised) fears the Cadillac he travels in – the Beast – would fail to negotiate it. Inside the hall, enormous US and Australian flags bookended either side of the stage, and a unconventional medley of country music and Stevie Wonder songs pealed from speakers. In anticipation, the event had the feel of a college campus pep rally, a campaign event for a man for whom there are simply no more jobs to run for, and few causes for which he has the political capital left to stump. Undaunted by domestic constraints, a confident Obama outlined the foreign policy challenges he sees as most critical in a modern “inter-connected world”. He highlighted North Korea’s nuclear program, China’s territorial and maritime disputes, and Russia’s belligerency in the Ukraine as pressing problems for the world to solve, as well as “the poverty and inequality that are a recipe for insecurity”. But Obama staked his speech on climate change. The subject drew the first of half-a-dozen interruptions for applause, as the president told his audience there was no greater challenge for Australia, for the Asia-Pacific, or for the world. Obama urged climate change sceptics to “look squarely at the science” and spruiked the emissions deal he inked with Chinese president Xi Jingping in Beijing on Thursday. “If China and America can agree on this, the world can agree on this. We can get this done. And it is necessary,” he said. Host nation Australia has fiercely resisted climate change being placed on the G20 agenda, but is finding itself further and further isolated on the issue. Obama appeared unworried about discomforting his host Abbott. Reaching a global binding climate agreement in Paris next year may be the final major act of Obama’s presidency. Presidents so deep into their second terms have, always, one eye on the horizon. Australia had a responsibility to act, Obama urged, or it would suffer the effects of climate change as much as anywhere. “Here in Australia it means longer droughts, more wildfires, it means the incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened. Worldwide, this past summer was the hottest on record. No nation is immune. Every nation has a responsibility to do its part.” As Obama left the hall, shaking hands with schoolchildren and at least one former governor general, the country music that preceded his arrival blared out once more. The song was Only in America, by Brooks and Dunn, a ballad about a boy dreaming of growing up to be president. It includes the line “staring at the faces in the rear-view mirror, looking at the promise of the promised land”. Obama has more of his presidency in the rear-view mirror than he does in front, but he appears intent on doing what he can, with what he has left."
"“The political consensus on climate change has frayed,” said Labour party leader Ed Miliband on Thursday evening, who as energy and climate change secretary guided the Climate Change Act through parliament virtually unopposed. “When times got tough, some people headed for the hills.” It’s not a great leap to infer that Miliband was referring to David Cameron, who has gone from hugging huskies in opposition to ditching “green crap” in office. As Miliband is the only alternative PM voters could chose, what he thinks about the environment and climate change matters. Judging by the speech he gave at the Green Alliance’s 35th birthday celebration, he is serious about both.  Visibly passionate, he began by saying climate change was an issue of equality: “It is the poorest and most vulnerable both around the world and in this country that suffer.”  Miliband then set out a series of points. First he said: “You cannot divorce green policy from economic policy”. This is vital as, in my opinion Cameron’s government have woefully undervalued the green economy, which grew throughout the recession and employs more people than teaching. At Labour party conference, one of Miliband’s pledges was to create a million green jobs. Miliband then said he believed in devolution and decentralisation and that some policies, such as improving the energy efficiency of the UK’s ageing and leaky homes, would be far more effectively delivered locally. Next Miliband said: “There can be no ambiguity about our place in the European Union if we want to tackle climate change.” He was speaking as the voters in Rochester were electing a second Ukip MP. He said the UK’s influence around the world on climate change was far greater as part of the EU. “If you are a party that is serious about climate change, you can’t be a party that wants to leave the EU.” Miliband extolled the virtues of parks and green spaces for people’s quality of life and then warned the audience not to take the political consensus on climate change for granted. Miliband was energy and climate change secretary for the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, which failed to seal a global deal. “That goes with the territory,” he said. “The history of social justice is you always have setbacks along the way.” With the next opportunity to do a global deal approaching – Paris in 2015 – he urged green campaigners in the room to apply political pressure (as he did when in office in 2008): “Push us to do more.” “We want the Paris summit to be a big moment when the world says this matters for our kids and for their kids,” he said. “There is no choice but for this movement to be successful.” I asked him afterwards about his passionate delivery. He said: “Well, you know, I believe this stuff.”"
"Funding for councils to deal with flooding has been slashed by a third by ministers, prompting community groups and Labour to say the government is going backwards on managing flood risk. Last winter, the wettest on record, saw devastating flooding across the country and forced David Cameron to reverse earlier cuts to flood defence budgets.   The revelation of the new cuts to council flood budgets in England comes as the Met Office’s three-month outlook indicates this winter is likely to be wetter than average. The government’s own report concluded in 2012 that flood risk is rising due to climate change.  County councils and unitary authorities have legal responsibilities as Lead Local Flood Authorities (LLFAs) such as playing “a lead role in emergency planning and recovery after a flood event”. The responsibilities also include creating flood risk management strategies, investigating the causes of significant floods and raising local awareness, according to the Local Government Association. But the £10m funding now set for 2015-16 is £5m less than in the previous year. “This is dire,” said Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the National Flood Forum, which represents community flood action groups. “LLFAs are at the heart of flood risk management. They are already under-resourced and this puts flood risk management backwards at the very point when a step change forwards is needed.” Mary Dhonau, a national flood campaigner, said: “Cameron stood there saying ‘lessons will be learned’ and ‘money was no object’ and then ministers go and make these sweeping cuts. He has clearly pressed the snooze button yet again and gone back to sleep. LLFAs are very much on the frontline.” She said the cuts would mean job losses among council flood staff. A spokeswoman for the Department of environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) said: “The funding to LLFAs was always going to be initially higher in order to allow them to gather information on local flood risk and understand how to manage the risk. The planned reduction does not affect emergency planning and recovery funding.” She added: “We absolutely recognise the importance of tackling flooding which is why we are investing £3.2bn in flood management and defences. This is more than ever before.” However, a National Audit Office (NAO) report published earlier in November concluded flood spending had actually fallen by 10% under the coalition government, increasing the risk of homes being flooded and leaving half the nation’s flood defences with “minimal” maintenance.  Furthermore, the NAO found that despite the higher initial funding, just 14% of LLFAs had managed to publish their flood risk strategies since being required to do so in 2011. “Their workload is absolutely enormous,” said Dhonau. Dan Rogerson, the Lib Dem flooding minister, said on 4 November: “With winter on its way, we need local authorities to play their part in this and ensure they are fully prepared to respond and give clear advice to residents and businesses on how to plan for emergencies.”  Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said: “The public will be looking to the government for assurances that we are better prepared for flooding this winter than we were last year. The news [of LLFA budget cuts] will do little to provide such assurances.” She said: “There is no doubt that flood risk management has gone backwards under this government. David Cameron abandoned the last Labour government’s robust plans for reducing flood risk, slashed the budgets, crossed his fingers and hoped for the best.” The nation’s preparedness for flooding is being debated in parliament on Wednesday. Climate change is increasing flood risk in Britain by driving more extreme weather events. The government’s official advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, calculate there is a £500m hole in the government budget for flood risk management, with damages of £3bn likely to be incurred in the future as a result."

"The United States and China sprang a surprise last week with their secretly-negotiated deal to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Although cheered as “historic milestone in the global fight against climate change,” “the real deal,” a “landmark,” “ambitious,” and “game-changer” by western media, the agreement received a less than enthusiastic response in India. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a research and advocacy NGO based in Delhi, called it a “self-serving and business-as-usual” deal and complained it was neither historic nor ambitious. The US and China had set targets that would cause a catastrophic 4C rise in global temperature, much higher than the 2C target set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Prakash Javadekar, the minister for environment, forests and climate change, called the deal “not so ambitious” but welcomed it as a “good beginning.” Last month, the EU agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. The US, however, has agreed to 26 to 28% reduction below 2005 levels by 2025. That’s only 15-17% below 1990 levels, less than half of EU’s commitment, said CSE. To meet the IPCC-set target, the US needs to cut at least 50-60% below 1990 levels.  The US-China pact may not save the planet, but at least the world’s top two polluters have made a commitment, however modest it may be.  Now that China, US and the EU have announced the cuts they intend to make, it appears to be India’s turn. The UK’s parliamentary under secretary of state for energy and climate change, Baroness Verma urged India to play a bigger role on climate change issues.  However, Chandra Bhushan, the deputy director of CSE said: if “India were to follow the principles of this deal, then we need not do anything till 2040 and beyond. Our per capita emissions in 2030 will be less than 4 tonnes CO2e [carbon dioxide equivalent] compared to 12 tonnes of the US and China.” Even if the US-China deal doesn’t force India to be proactive, it will certainly force it to reassess its choices. India has long allied itself with China at climate change negotiations, and the latter’s bilateral agreement with the US must have come as a shock. T. Jayaraman, a senior climate change analyst at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, told The Telegraph, “There is a lesson for India here. If we don’t [pay heed], we will be hung out to dry very soon — we’d always mistakenly assumed that China’s negotiating position would remain fixed and in line with India’s.”  A few days before the deal was announced, a prescient Suresh Prabhu, prime minister Modi’s aide for the G20 meeting in Brisbane, Australia, said India’s alignment with China in climate change negotiations was a tactical error that had hurt the country’s interests. Javadekar dismissed Prabhu’s diagnosis as his personal opinion. In the wake of the deal, how will India react? What percentage of emissions will the country pledge to cut and from when? There was some anticipation that India would reveal its cards at the recently concluded G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia. Perhaps India will reveal its commitment at the climate change summit in Lima, Peru, next month."
"More companies are likely to follow the German utility giant E.ON and shift their energy generation away from coal and nuclear to renewable power, the president of Germany’s Federal Environment Agency (UBA) has told the Guardian. E.ON’s surprise announcement on Monday, that it would split its operations to focus on clean energy, power grids and energy efficiency services, also increased the prospect of success for Germany’s ambitious Energiewende [Energy Transition] project, Maria Krautzberger said. Asked whether she expected similar announcements by other German firms, she replied: “Yes I do. RWE announced that they are thinking of shifting their energy generation towards renewables and EnBW is also discussing it, but E.ON is actually the biggest player so it is consequent that they are the first to make this announcement.” RWE last year announced plans to mothball some 3.1GW of fossil fuel plants, while EnBW said it would double planned asset sales to €3bn (£2.4bn) to free up cash for clean energy investments.  RWE yesterday clarified that it would not be splitting their core business in two, but both firms are struggling with falling demand created by a surge in home power generation from rooftop solar panels. More importantly, the Energiewende transformation is reconfiguring Germany’s power generating capacity, with a nuclear phase-out planned by 2022 and a renewables roll-out that is slated to provide 35-40% of electricity by 2025, rising to 55-60% by 2035 and at least 80% by 2050. E.ON’s move would be “a great influence on the Energiewende, making it more possible and probable,” Krautzberger said. “This is a structural change that gives you hope that our big approaches will have success. It is really something.” About a quarter of Germany’s electricity currently comes from renewables compared to 6.2% in the US and 4.8% in France. Maria van der Hoeven, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said that E.ON’s renewables push was a sign of things to come. “I think it is very encouraging that a big utility is changing course because when we look at the electricity pie, it is not growing,” she told the Guardian. “Demand is not growing in the EU and if you want to stay in business you have to do something about that. I think E.ON’s decision is a very interesting move.” A former economics minister in the Netherlands, Van der Hoeven added that she favoured the company’s decision to split its power generation and supply networks. “I did the unbundling in the Netherlands some years ago and I think it is very important,” she said. “It gives an opportunity to have better production of energy, and better distribution too,” she said. Van der Hoeven was speaking as the IEA launched a report into the energy policies of the EU countries, which calls for urgent improvement in the bloc’s internal energy market, through market coupling and the integration of power networks, particularly in the continent’s south and east. EU states should moderate their jealous prizing of national sovereignty where energy policy was concerned – particularly in the field of capacity mechanisms that guarantee the lights stay on – van der Hoeven said. “In our view, capacity mechanisms are a last resort. You have to look at other instruments first and if you want to have them, then please not at a national level,” she said. Over half of Europe’s ‘baseload capacity’ comes from nuclear or coal power and the IEA says that shifting that to renewables and gas will require pan-European balancing mechanisms to cover for windless and cloudy days, and a price signal to tip more investment into renewables. Moves to reform the EU’s Emissions Trading System with a flexible mechanism that could elevate prices “should have started yesterday,” van der Hoeven said. “Let’s start getting the carbon price up to €30-40 a tonne. You have to encourage investments away from coal use and towards renewables with less subsidies, and without a CO2 price signal it won’t happen.” “Everyone is talking about COP21 [the Paris climate summit in December 2015],” she added. “Wouldn’t that be a very nice moment to have some results to show?” "

"Australia has had its hottest spring and second hottest November on record. Bureau of Meteorology climate monitoring manager Karl Braganza says 2014 has had the latest in a long line of hot springs in the past decade. According to the BOM, 2013 was the country’s hottest year.  “Really, it was only 2010 that had a cool spring in the past 10 years or so. Nine out of the warmest springs on record have occurred since 2002,” Braganza said. Australia’s average seasonal temperature is derived by averaging the temperature data from weather stations, where records go back to 1910. The figure is then compared with the long-term average temperature, which measures the period from 1961 to 1990. Spring 2014’s average temperature of 24C exceeded the mean by 1.5C, Braganza said. “That departure, averaged over a whole three-month period, is actually really large. That means it was, on average, over 1.5C warmer, and that’s the largest seasonal departure that we’ve ever recorded,” he said. Heatwaves in NSW and Queensland were major factors in the result, Braganza said. The bureau is still finalising its figures, but he said mean temperatures in November were the second hottest on record. “This is similar to what we’ve seen in the past couple of years, when these high summer temperatures started to get going late in spring or early in December, which is about a month earlier than typical,” Braganza said. Low rainfall was linked to warmer-than-average temperatures in Australia and around the world, he said. “Rainfall on the soil acts like an evaporative cooler over the continent,” Braganza said. “Drought has been quite persistent in Queensland, stretching over the border to South Australia and NSW, and now in western Victoria and south-eastern SA and western Victoria, you’ve got re-emerging drought conditions as well. “So, when you look at that, you’re not so surprised that you’ll get record temperatures for spring as well.” Australia: +1.67C against average Queensland: +1.36C NSW: +2.21C Victoria: +1.53C Tasmania: +0.66C South Australia: +2.20C Western Australia: +1.82C Northern Territory: +1.13C Australia: -34% against average Queensland -52% NSW: -52% Victoria -38% Tasmania -27% South Australia -55% Western Australia: +35% Northern Territory: -51% Source: Bureau of Meteorology"
"  Britain has 10 of Europe’s top 50 “super-polluting” power stations and factories, helping to cost it more in health and environmental impacts than any other countries, except for Germany and Poland.   New air pollution figures from the European environment agency (EEA) suggest that a handful of power stations and industrial plants together cost the National Health Service and the wider UK economy over £10bn a year.   Of over 14,000 major industrial plants identified in Europe’s 27 countries, Drax power station in Selby and the Longannet plant at Kincardine in Scotland were ranked respectively 5th and 10th between 2008-2012.  Drax’s air pollution is calculated to have cost the economy £2.7-£6.34bn and Longannet £1.8-4.56bn. The Corus steel works in Redcar ranked 27th in Europe with Alcan Aluminium in Co Durham 34th. The 10 biggest British plants together were calculated to have at cost at least £12.6bn in air pollution damages between 2008-2012.   Eight of the 30 biggest sources of air pollution were in Germany, six in Poland, four in Romania and three each in Bulgaria and the Britain. Half of all the health and environmental costs were said to be caused by just 1% of the industrial plants, said the report.   The authors calculated the economic damage done not just by major air pollutants emitted from coal and gas power stations but also those from burning diesel and petrol in vehicles. It included the estimated cost to the health service of the premature deaths and respiratory problems caused by traffic and industry, as well as the damage done to buildings, and the money lost from crop damage and from soil and water pollution.  CO2, a major gas responsible for climate change, was costed according to its carbon price. For the air pollutants, the majority of costs were said to be due to the health impacts of people breathing in minute particles of unburned carbon.   According to the authors, “air pollution cost [European] society at least €59 billion, (£46bn) and possibly as much as €189 billion (£149bn) in 2012. The upper estimate is roughly the same as the GDP of Finland or half the GDP of Poland. In Britain, the cost is estimated to be between £31-99bn in the five years from 2008.”   “While we all benefit from industry and power generation, this analysis shows that the technologies used by these plants impose hidden costs on our health and the environment. Industry is also only part of the picture – it is important to recognise that other sectors, primarily transport and agriculture, also contribute to poor air quality,” said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA director.   The report recorded a small decrease in the economic damage done over the five years monitored in the report. This, said the authors, reflected lower emissions from European industry, attributed to both tighter air pollution laws, greater efficiency in factories and machines and the Europe-wide economic recession.   But the EEA warned that the total cost of damage to health and the environment from pollution by all sectors of the economy, including from ‘diffuse’ sources such as road transport and households, could be significantly higher.  In 2010, the European commission estimated that the external costs associated with only the main air pollutants ranged from £260- 740bn.  An EEA spokesman added that because air pollution crossed borders, all figures were calculated from sources of pollution. The wide range of damages, he said, reflected different countries’ ways of putting a value on the health impacts of air pollution as well as the different methods used to estimate CO2 related damage.

"Climate change is a serious threat to national security and last year’s winter storms highlighted the cost, damages and disruption that extreme weather can cause. Yet within the first six months of the coalition, David Cameron cut the flood protection budget by over £100m, leaving many communities, including the South West, overly exposed.  Ever since then the government has been playing catch up and that’s what today’s promise of £2.3billion for flood defence schemes is all about.  Communities at risk of flooding won’t buy this spin from David Cameron. The £2.3bn is not new money, instead it is another re-announcement of capital funding confirmed a year ago. As a result the Committee on Climate Change claims that the government’s plans will leave 80,000 additional properties at significant risk of flooding in the next five years alone. There were even reports over the weekend that these plans contain a £500m black hole. There are some heroic assumptions underlying these plans. The government has assumed it can raise £600m of the £2.3bn from its ‘partnership funding programme’, four times more than at present. The programme includes contributions from both the public and private sectors. Yet this has been a disaster.  Not only has the government failed to raise even the original target of £140m in this Parliament, it is having to rely on councils to meet three-quarters of the costs as the private sector sit on their hands. It is difficult to see how cash-strapped local authorities will be able to raise anything like £600m for flood defences in the next six years.  The reality is that flood risk management has gone backwards under this Tory-led government. Despite repeatedly telling us that they’re spending ‘more than ever’ and promising that “money is no object” they have been found out time and time again. Just last month the National Audit Office confirmed that David Cameron has cut flood defence spending by 10% in real terms since 2010.  This same short-term approach has been applied to the ongoing maintenance of flood defences which were cut by 20% in 2010. As a result the Committee on Climate Change has said that three-quarters of existing flood defences are not being maintained to their identified need. This will end up costing the taxpayer more in the long-term because maintaining existing flood defence systems can be among the most cost-effective use of resources.  Communities at risk of flooding deserve a proper long-term plan for infrastructure investment, including flooding. That is why Labour has called for an Independent National Infrastructure Commission to set out its flood defence spending in the context of a 25-30 year infrastructure plan. Taking climate change seriously is not something only to be done a few months before an election. Voters won’t be fooled by the prime minister who pledged to lead the “greenest government ever” and then instructed his aides to “cut the green crap”.  • Maria Eagle MP is Labour’s shadow environment secretary"

"What a change a few years makes. For those of us concerned about climate change, seven years ago marked a low-point. It was a time where no meaningful actions had been taken to reduce carbon pollution and prepare our nation and the world for the threat of global warming. Now, we celebrate a series of major plans and actions that have the potential for helping us avoid the worst climate risks. These past years have cemented Obama’s legacy as a climate-aware president. They have also cemented the opposition (as if more cement was needed) as either too weak-minded to understand basic physics or too cowardly, favoring political expediency over the fate of future generations. This is one of those issues on which history books hinge. This was the time the USA took a leadership role to simultaneously reduce carbon pollution, adapt to the unavoidable changes in the pipeline, and build the energy infrastructure to lead in the future’s energy economy.  What actions has the Obama administration taken? We can remember back to the increase in fuel efficiency standards for passenger vehicles and finalization of standards for commercial vehicles. These standards not only reduce carbon emissions but they lower costs to consumers and preserve the valuable resource petroleum.  Perhaps the most significant actions taken by the administration deal with pollution from existing and new coal power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency has developed a Clean Power Plant to reduce power-plant emissions. The plan allows flexibility in meeting emission reductions reflecting different conditions and power-portfolios across the country. The administration has set forth an international agreement to reduce very potent greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons. This agreement was exciting because it gave lie to the idea that USA action would put as at an economic disadvantage. What this agreement showed is that when the USA acts, other countries follow.  That point was powerfully made last week. China and the US announced a hugely important agreement to bend the curve of emissions, and quickly. Under the agreement, these two countries will dramatically increase their share of renewable energy production, a move that is expected to further increase employment in this future sector. For the US, this means approximately 27% reduction in carbon pollution by 2025. This action now puts pressure on other major polluters, in particular Canada, Australia, India and Brazil.  Additionally, the US has worked to modernize our electrical grid to increase energy efficiency and facilitate a more sensible mix of power generation sources in the future. The USA has also announced contributions to an international fund to spur developing world integration of clean energy. All of this culminated at the recent G20 summit in Australia. Other countries have seen how quickly action can happen, particularly when the world’s two largest emitters are in agreement. Of course President Obama’s role isn’t over. One issue still hanging over his presidency is the Keystone XL pipeline. A pipeline that, if approved, will increase exploitation of the world’s dirtiest fuel, will actually raise gasoline costs in the USA, and will result in the wrong signals for the future energy market. I certainly hope he will stop the pipeline and ensure his legacy. It would be a real shame if, after all his excellent actions, it is the pipeline he is remembered for.  On the other hand, the actions taken so far are as monumental as they are courageous. Courageous because President Obama’s actions, while helping average citizens, raise the ire of fossil fuel organizations that are happy to spend hundreds of millions of dollars against his party. And some in his own party have taken votes against his vision, not because they doubt the science, but because they are afraid of the political consequences. Where I’m from, we call that cowardice. In the end, when historians looks back on this presidency, they will judge him based on the challenging decisions faced during his tenure. Dealing with climate change is the grand challenge. The books will say Obama acted, in the face of great opposition, to build the future economy of the US in a way that didn’t sacrifice our children’s’ futures.  The history books will also remember those who opposed him, from either party. As the extreme weather we are already seeing grows in intensity, as we face increasing economic costs from the changing climate, people will ask, “what were they thinking?”. Certainly, those obstructionists will not be able to say they just didn’t know. They can’t say the scientists didn’t tell them; rather, they didn’t listen. The people who have stood in the way of dealing with climate change now own the consequences. Let’s not forget that."
"Victorian Labor has pledged to set an emissions reduction target separate from the federal government’s but has dashed the hopes of conservationists by refusing to commit to a new national park that could save the Leadbeater’s possum, the state faunal emblem. In a belatedly-released environment policy platform ahead of the Victorian election on Saturday, Labor said it will “review legislation and programs to commit to an achievable carbon emissions reduction target.” Victoria had a target to reduce its emissions by 20% by 2020, based on 2000 levels, but the policy was dumped by the state Coalition government in 2012. The federal government has a target of reducing emissions by 5% by 2020, on 2000 levels. A concerted push by environmentalists, including Sir David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, to create a new national park north of Melbourne has failed to sway Labor, however. The proposed Great Forest national park would cover vast areas of the central highlands region of Victoria, including some of the tallest, most carbon dense trees in the world. The area is home to the endangered Leadbeater’s possum, with scientists warning the species and ecosystem as a whole will soon collapse due to current logging practices and bushfire trends. The Labor platform commits to a “consensus approach in the establishment of any new national parks.” Labor would set up an “industry taskforce”, comprised of timber workers, unions, environmental groups and scientists to advise it. “A Labor government will consider any reasonable recommendations and proposals reached by consensus of the major stakeholders through the industry task force, but will not impose solutions,” it states. It is understood the CMFEU, an influential union ally of Labor, is opposed to any new national parks that may impact forestry jobs. The current Coalition government set up a similar advisory group, which recommended a minor reduction in logging but no new national park earlier this year. Prof David Lindenmayer, who has extensively studied the central highlands region, was scathing of the lack of a Labor plan for a new national park. “It’s a weasel word policy that’s about as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike,” he told Guardian Australia. “This would be a taskforce interested in the status quo, it’s the same old rubbish the Liberal government gave us. “The system is close to collapse so to sit around talking about consensus is rubbish. It’s a pathetic policy that doesn’t acknowledge the science. We don’t need more science here, I’ve been doing this for 31 years.” Lindenmayer said the timber industry should be transitioned to plantations rather than logging the next generation of old growth trees that provide habitat for species and store vast amounts of carbon. Recent research contributed to by Lindenmayer states that the trees currently logged in the central highlands each year contain as much carbon as one third of the emissions of Yallourn, one of the dirtiest coal plants in Victoria. “Under the federal government’s Direct Action plan, keeping those trees would mean tens of millions of dollars for carbon abatement,” Lindenmayer said. “When you think about the national park for more than two minutes, you realise what a good idea it is.” Amelia Young, campaigner at the Wilderness Society, said: “Time is running out for the Leadbeater’s possum. If Labor insists on pursuing the taskforce option and wants any chance of the saving the state’s animal emblem from extinction, it must commence this taskforce within the first 100 days of government.” The commitment to reinstate the emissions reduction target was better received by environment groups, although it’s uncertain what level Labor would set the target. The policy document also makes no mention of phasing out Victoria’s carbon-intensive brown coal plants. Mark Wakeham, chief executive of Environment Victoria, said the plan for a new emissions target was a “positive step.” “Australia is drifting on climate change so we need this kind of leadership from the state government,” he said. “We welcome Labor’s willingness to be in this space. We’d want a science-based target, certainly more than the 5% national target. “Coal continues to be the elephant in the room. Neither party wants to talk about the fact we have some of the dirtiest power in the world.” In its other environmental commitments, Labor said it would establish a new marine and coastal act and a new Yarra river protection act. Development plans for Point Nepean national park will be scrapped, along with the ability to issue 99-year leases for developers in national parks. Under Labor, restrictions on new wind farms will be eased, cattle grazing in the alpine region will be stopped and there will be an investigation into the Environment Protection Agency in relation to the Morwell mine fire. “It looks like Labor would wind back some of the worst attacks on the environment by the Coalition, but it has left a lot of work to do for itself on climate change,” Wakeham said.  Greg Barber, the leader of the Victorian Greens, said: “The policy contains nothing on coal, nothing on coal seam gas, nothing on forest logging and nothing on a Victorian renewable energy target. We are looking at another long four-year fight for environmentalists.”"
"Barack Obama has stared down both Republican hostility at home and the reluctance of his Australian G20 hosts to insist that the world can clinch a new climate change deal next year. The president used a speech on the sidelines of the G20 in Brisbane, Australia, to confirm what was revealed by the Guardian on Friday: that the US would be contributing $3bn to the Green Climate Fund that aims to help developing nations cope with the effects of global warming. And he insisted nowhere had more to lose from rising temperatures than the Asia Pacific region and Australia in particular. “No nation is immune and every nation has a responsibility to do its part,” Obama said. “You will recall at the beginning I said the US and Australia has a lot in common. Well one of the things we have in common is we produce a lot of carbon … which means we’ve got to step up.” In the backrooms of the G20 meeting, Australia was continuing to resist language in the official communique encouraging countries to make pledges to the Green Climate Fund, but to a rousing reception at a local university, Obama announced the $3bn US commitment. Obama said the new funding would help vulnerable communities with early-warning systems, stronger defences against storm surges, and climate-resilient infrastructure, while supporting farmers to plant more durable crops. He hailed the deal he struck in Beijing on Wednesday, saying China’s pledge to ensure its carbon emissions peaked by 2030 was historic. “The reason that’s so important is because if China as it develops adapts the same per capita carbon emissions as advanced economies like the US or Australia, this planet doesn’t stand a chance because they’ve got a lot more people,” Obama said. “So them setting up a target sends a powerful message to the world that all countries, whether you are a developed country, a developing country or somewhere in between, you’ve got to be able to overcome old divides, look squarely at the science and reach a strong global climate agreement next year.  “And if China and the US can agree on this then the world can agree on this, we can get this done and it is necessary for us to get it done.” Obama faces domestic political challenges implementing greater curbs on greenhouse gas emissions in the US after the Republicans won control of both houses of Congress in mid-term elections last week. Mitch McConnell, who will take over as the majority leader of the Senate, has called the China deal part of Obama’s “ideological war on coal” and signalled that Republicans would seek to ease the burden of power station emission regulations. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, told G20 counterparts earlier on Saturday they could raise any issue they liked during the leaders’ retreat.  Abbott has previously resisted calls to make climate change a substantive agenda item at the G20, arguing the summit should focus on economic issues including increasing global growth. Abbott himself referred to his government’s domestic policies, including the abolition in July of Australia’s carbon pricing scheme, when he spoke at the leaders’ retreat. Obama struck a markedly different tone in his speech to students and invited guests at the University of Queensland. “I know that there has been a healthy debate in this country about it,” the president said. “Here in the Asia Pacific nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about, and then acting on, climate change.  “Here a climate that increases in temperature will mean more extreme and frequent storms, more flooding, rising seas that submerge Pacific Islands.  “Here in Australia it means longer droughts, more wildfires. The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened. Worldwide this past summer was the hottest on record.” Obama said he had not yet had time to go to the Great Barrier Reef, but he wanted it to be protected so his daughters and generations to come could see the natural wonder. The president made a direct pitch to young people in the audience, urging them to speak up in support of strong action on climate change because they deserved to inherit a clean, healthy, sustainable world. He said it was natural “that those of us who start getting grey hair are a little set in their ways” and had entrenched interests. Companies had made investments in certain energy sources, the president said, so change could be “uncomfortable and difficult”.  “That’s why it’s so important for the next generation to be able to step in and say, you know, it doesn’t have to be this way,” Obama said. Earlier on Saturday the UN secretary general, Ban Ki Moon, said he had been briefed that the leaders were actively discussing the issue of a climate change, which he nominated as “the defining issue of our times” and therefore a natural topic of G20 discussion.  He called on the G20 to “take a lead” on climate and urged G20 countries to make “ambitious pledges” to the Green Climate Fund. China is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world. Its deal with the US, the second-largest emitter, has been seen as building momentum for strong post-2020 targets to be agreed at a UN climate conference in Paris next year. China’s vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, told reporters at the G20 on Saturday that China would work hard to ensure its emissions peaked before 2030. He said that if the Chinese economy developed too fast for the environment to sustain “we must make adjustments to our policies in a timely way so we can minimise the impact on our environment”."
"The $10bn (£6bn) in climate aid which Britain and other rich countries are expected to formally pledge this week represents a backsliding on earlier climate finance transfers, according to observers.  Countries are together expected to offer around $10bn to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) at a meeting in Berlin on Thursday, with the UK becoming one of the world’s largest contributors with an expected pledge of about $1bn. The $10bn total figure is at the bottom end of the $10-15bn target set by the UN last year for countries to meet before next month’s UN climate summit in Lima, Peru.  “We are not applauding the announcements [of pledges] yet,” said Meena Raman, an official observer on the GCF board, representing civil society from developing countries. “The devil will be in the details of these contributions – whether they come with conditions; whether they are grants or loans; and whether the amounts are earmarked for specific purposes.”  The contributions, which include $3bn from the US and $1.5bn from Japan, are to be spread over four years and could be a third lower a year than was pledged for developing countries at the UN climate summit in Cancun in 2010.  “It appears that the current pledges ... will be close to $10bn and for the four year period of 2015-2018. This is really not much given the scale of the challenge. In 2009 the [fast track] funds were supposed to be $30bn for three years (2010-2012) – or $10bn a year. $10bn over four years for the GCF is actually a backsliding of efforts,” said Raman. The GCF, a new UN institution expected to start disbursing money next year, will channel it primarily from developed to developing countries to help them adapt their cities and farming to the more severe floods, heatwaves and sea level rises that are being experienced with climate change, as well as cut their emissions. It is expected to be the world’s premier international climate fund, with a goal of making at least $100bn available a year by 2020. This is seen as the minimum amount of money that over 150 developing countries will need to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  Control of the fund is already proving highly contentious. Developing countries are concerned that in GCF board meetings rich countries have fought to be able to target their contributions to the fund’s private sector facility, which could help their own big corporations to profit from “green” investments in developing countries.  Developed countries have also wanted board-voting to be linked to contributions in the event of a lack of consensus in decision-making. This, say poor countries, would make the GCF similar to the World Bank which is widely seen to favour the interests of rich countries.  Other concerns are that rich countries will seek to direct most money to reduce emissions rather than help poorer countries adapt to climate change.  “The GCF is starting to look like a credible multilateral bank. But it needs to be hugely expanded,” said Kevin Watkins, director of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the UK’s leading independent thinktank on international development.  “There’s a tension here between mitigation and adaptation. There are a large number of low income countries who will [shortly] be dealing with serious adaptation issues. There is a risk that mitigation could trump adaptation, and push out the world’s poorest countries,” he said.  Many G20 countries including the UK, Saudi Arabia and Italy have yet to pledge money but observers are pleased that developing countries, including Mexico ($10m), South Korea ($100m) and Indonesia ($200,000) have offered money to the fund. With finance one of the keys to a successful climate deal in 2015, developing countries also want assurances that any money pledged will be newand additional, as the UN wants, and not recycled from existing aid budgets. The UK’s contribution will come from its International Climate Fund which it set up in 2012 to provide £3.87bn between April 2011 and March 2016. The US contribution is $1bn higher than the previous US commitment of $2bn but it is unclear whether the funding will have to be approved by the US Congress. Some GCF climate finance trackers are now far more optimistic that a global climate deal will be reached at a climate summit in Paris in 2015.  “These pledges bring us a giant step closer to reaching a global climate agreement in Paris. These financial commitments send a strong signal that countries are willing to step up to the plate at home and abroad to curb emissions and help communities prepare for the consequences of climate change,” said Athena Ballesteros, finance centre director of the World Resources Institute. But others questioned the scale of the pledges. “US military spending topped $575bn last year alone. While it’s welcome, a White House pledge of $3bn over four years to climate security is a drop in the bucket by comparison,” said Janet Redman, climate policy programme director at the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies.

"New South Wales and Victoria are ‘going backwards on renewable energy’, according to the latest report from the Climate Council. Within the report are detailed statistics on emissions, renewable energy production and investment for each state and territory in Australia. So how do the states match up?  On emissions, it’s not surprising to find the states with a higher population lead the way. When population is taken into account, the Northern Territory and Western Australia rank at the top. This is probably due to mining activity and their remoteness. All states and territories except the ACT are above the OECD average of 12.47 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person, though it’s worth pointing out that the ACT is reliant on other states for its electricity.  According to the Clean Energy Council, 14.76% of Australia’s electricity in 2013 came from renewable sources. The states with the highest emissions – NSW, Queensland and Victoria – have far higher ratios of fossil fuel to renewable energy production: The state with the highest ratio of renewable energy to fossil fuel energy was Tasmania because of a large increase in hydro power in 2013. South Australia also had a large proportion of renewable energy in the mix, and is now one of the leading states in terms of renewable energy capacity per person. The Climate Council report analysed renewable energy projects since 2001, and put South Australia on top: The capacity figure includes some projects under construction but not yet producing power, and is based on data from the Clean Energy Regulator. NSW, despite having the highest total emissions, has not significantly increased its investment in renewables since 2001. It is, however, still the state with the highest total installed renewable capacity (although this wasn’t reflected in the 2013 production figures above). South Australia’s high ratio is due to a large increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. It is now the state with the highest percentage of homes with solar PV systems installed: According to the Climate Council report, this increase is being encouraged by state-based policies, including a target for 50% of electricity to be produced from renewables by 2025.

"US meteorologists say the world in October continued to set heat records. They say despite a bitter US cold snap, the globe is rushing toward its warmest year on record. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday that last month was the hottest October on record. The 58.43F (14.74C) beat out October 2003. Five of the last six months have set monthly global heat records. July is the only exception. Nasa and Japan’s weather agency also called it the hottest October on record. NOAA says with only two months left in the year, 2014 has now surged ahead as the warmest year so far, beating 2010 and 1998. So far this year the world is averaging 58.62F (14.78C)."
"Eager to deflect the lame-duck label, President Barack Obama touted his unexpectedly productive swing through the Asia-Pacific region as a “strong week for American leadership” that resulted in deals with China and other regional powers on issues like climate change, trade and economic growth. But even before Air Force One departed Australia, where Obama attended the G20 economic forum, the president was eyeing confrontations in Washington with congressional Republicans on immigration and the Keystone XL oil pipeline.  The president showed no sign of backing down on his plans to issue executive orders on immigration that will shield possibly about 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally from deportation. Obama has pledged to act before the end of the year. He said his timing would not be affected by threats from some Republicans who say they will try to include measures to block the orders in must-pass spending bills – a step that could lead to a government shutdown. “I take Mitch McConnell at his word that the government is not going to shut down,” Obama said of the Kentucky Republican and incoming Senate majority leader who has previously rejected talk of a shutdown. Obama repeated his pledge to abandon his executive orders if House Republicans were to quickly hold a vote on comprehensive immigration legislation that passed the Senate earlier this year. Taking on another area of tension between the White House and Republicans, the president all but threatened to veto congressional legislation that seeks to force construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to Texas. The House passed a bill last week and the Senate is expected to move on the measure in the coming days. The Keystone pipeline has been a pet project for Republicans for the past several years. But now some members of Obama’s own Democratic party see a political incentive in forcing a vote, most notably Senator Mary Landrieu of oil- and gas-producing Louisiana who faces a December runoff with her Republican challenger in the midterm elections. Obama showed little sign of being willing to sign off on a bill in an attempt to give Landrieu a political lifeline. Instead, he reiterated his long-standing position that the only way the project could move forward is if a State Department review declared it environmentally sound. “We have to let the process play out,” he said. While Obama and Republican lawmakers talked of cooperation in the days after the GOP took control of the Senate in midterm elections this month, the confrontations over immigration and the pipeline appear to make it more likely that the two sides will fall back into the same pattern of gridlock that defined the president’s last four years in office. With that in mind, Obama has appeared to relish being away from Washington this week, embracing his ability to strike deals with foreign leaders that do not require approval from Congress. The crowning achievement of his trip was an agreement with China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, marking the first time Beijing has outlined such a plan. Obama also highlighted the agreement among the G20 leaders to boost global gross domestic product by more than $2tn over five years by investing in infrastructure and increasing trade."
