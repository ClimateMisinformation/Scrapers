Share this...FacebookTwitterUsing the old, worn out statistical trick of carefully selecting the start and end points of a data series, a blog site, run by a snidey Heidi Cullen, attempts to have readers believe that US winters are getting warmer. Steve Goddard explains how in just a few sentences.

This is transparent even to a junior high school science student.
Cooking the weather data and weather witch-hunting: This is the level of bankruptcy that alarmist climate science has devolved to. Can it get any sadder?
An average household in northern USA only needs to look at the heating bills for the last 10 years to see that Heidi’s claim is nothing more than a big snow job.
1974: Odds of warming “at best 1 in 10,000”!
Moreover, everyone knows the USA has been keeping weather data more than 100 years, and so it’s a mystery why Ms Cullen would go back to 1972, a time that happens to be right smack in the middle of a cold phase – a time when the media and scientists were biting their nails over a coming ice age.
In fact “leading” climate scientists in 1974 were putting the odds of future warming: “at best 1 in 10,000”!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe print edition of the Swiss Die WeltWoche has a story on the IPCC and accusations that climate scientists have misled policymakers: The Silence of the Climate Scientists, authored by Markus Schär.
In it Schär claims that “the IPCC lead by Thomas Stocker concealed good news in its report” and that “a new report shows that the warnings of climate change have to be called off.” 
Weltwoche writes that in view of the record Antarctic sea ice, 17 years of no global warming and cold records peppering the globe, it is obvious that “the climate models of climate scientists can’t be right“.
The Swiss news weekly cites a recent report by Nicholas ­Lewis and science journalist Marcel Crok that was recently released by the British think tank Global Warming Policy Foundation. In it Lewis and Crok claim the IPCC kept silent about important findings because “they contradicted their warnings of a climate catastrophe“.
Weltwoche describes Lewis and Crok as persons who don’t let themselves be labeled deniers and that the report’s foreword was written by renowned Georgia Tech Professor Judith Curry, “a leading atmospheric physicist who as a critic of climate science has advised the US Congress over the last weeks. For this reason the report stimulated attention worldwide, even if not in the media, who still prefer to warn of catastrophes“.
In the report’s foreword, Curry calls the GWPF report “technically sound, well-organized and readily comprehensible”.

Weltwoche writes how Lewis und Crok pointed to a number of recent studies indicating that CO2 climate sensitivity has “a far lesser value of between 1.5 and 2°C” and that “there is no reason for warnings of catastrophe.”
Weltwoche writes:
For this reason the IPCC people are silent about the recent papers in their summary for policymakers, refrain from providing the most probable values and instead spread the message that despite all the uncertainty, their certainty is greater than ever.”
According to Weltwoche IPCC lead author Thomas Stocker was rankled by claims in the GWPF report, accused them of cherry-picking and that he had no intention of responding to a “non-peer-reviewed paper published by a think tank.”
WeltWoche appears somewhat surprised by Stocker’s irritability, concluding:
­Lewis and Crok actually only did what the IPCC should have done: that is to look at the important studies and to draw the obvious conclusions from them. The lessons of their report are recommended for Stocker to consider.”

This short illustrated essay questions government efforts to combat global warming and climate change from three points of view:
1. The influence of CO2 on temperature
2. Decarbonisation outcomes
3. Politics
This essay examines quantifiable and hopefully non-contentious aspects of the question.
1. Influence of carbon dioxide CO2 on temperature
The temperature-increasing capacity of atmospheric CO2 is known and widely accepted to diminish as its concentration increases.
Global warming advocates and climate change skeptics both agree on this. IPCC published reports acknowledge that the effective temperature increase caused by growing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere radically diminishes with increasing concentrations. This information has been presented in the IPCC reports, yet it is well disguised for any lay reader, (TAR3, Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate) . It is not acknowledged in their Summary For Policymakers.

Figure 1: Logarithmic warming diminution of CO2.
The rapid diminution effect is an inconvenient fact for global warming advocates, nonetheless it is well understood within the climate science community, but it is certainly not much discussed. This logarithmic diminution effect is probably the reason why there was no runaway greenhouse warming caused by CO2 in earlier eons when CO2 levels were known to be at levels of several thousands ppmv.
– Up to 200 ppmv, the equivalent to about 82% of the temperature increasing effectiveness of CO2, is essential to sustain photosynthesis in plant life and thus the viability of all life on earth.
– A further 100 ppmv was the level prior to any industrialisation, this atmospheric CO2 made the survival of the biosphere possible. It was responsible for a further 5% of the CO2 greenhouse effect.
– Following that, a further 100 ppmv, (certainly man-made in part), adding 4.1% of the CO2 effectiveness brings to the current level 400 ppmv.
– CO2 at 400 pmmv is already committed and immutable. So CO2 has already reached about 90+% of its potential warming effect in the atmosphere.
Only 10% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a warming greenhouse gas now remains:
400-500 ppmv 3.25%
500-600 ppmv 2.65%
600-700 ppmv 2.05%
700-800 ppmv 1.44%
800-900 ppmv 0.84%
900-1000 ppmv 0.24%    Total 400-1000 ppmv 9.63%
Both skeptics and the IPCC publish different views of the reduced effect on temperature of as  CO2 concentration rises.  Theses alternates are closely equivalent proportionally but vary in the degree of warming that is attributable to CO2. The range is from 3.13°C to 14.55°C.  The graphics showing IPCC published views on the diminution below:

Figure 2: Temperature as a function of Co2 concentration.
A comparison between all four estimates are set out below in the context of the whole approx. 33°C greenhouse effect.  This graphic shows the remaining temperature effect of CO2 in orange that could be affected by global decarbonisation policies.

Figure 3: Greenhouse gas
It is anachronistic that some of the IPCC data sets shows very large proportions of the temperature effect attributable to CO2. The concomitant effect of those higher levels of CO2 warming is that the proportion of the total approx. 33°C then attributable the water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere is reduced so as to be unrealistically low.
Is it plausible that CO2, a minor trace gas in the atmosphere, currently at the level of ~400 ppm (0.04%) achieves such radical control of global temperature when compared to the substantial and powerful Greenhouse Effect of water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere?
Global warming advocates stipulate that all increases in the concentration of CO2 are solely man-made. This is not necessarily the case, as the biosphere and slightly warming oceans will outgas CO2. The man-made CO2 contribution at maximum is only a minor part of the CO2 transport within the atmosphere, at ~3% of the total [i]. The recent IPCC report now admits that probably increasing CO2 levels are only approx. 50% man-made.
There are the clearly divergent views of the amount of warming that can result from additional CO2 in future, but even in a worst case scenario whatever change that may happen in future can only ever have a marginal effect on global temperature.  
So any de-carbonization policy, however widely applied, trying to control CO2 emissions can only ever achieve a minor future temperature reduction.
Whatever political efforts are made to de-carbonize economies or to reduce man-made CO2 emissions, (and to be effective at temperature control those efforts would have to be universal and worldwide), those efforts can only now affect at most ~10-11% of the future warming potential of CO2.
So increasing CO2 in the atmosphere can not now inevitably lead directly to much more warming.  Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere cannot give rise to any dangerous temperature increase.  
Decarbonization policies could never have any useful impact to realistically control any rising world temperatures and the future world climate.
As the future temperature effect of increasing CO2 emissions is now so minor, there is no possibility of ever attaining the much vaunted political target of less than +2.0°C by the control of CO2 emissions.
It is likely that any current global warming is largely a natural process, is within normal limits and is probably beneficial.
The probability is that any current global warming is not man-made and, in any case, it could be not be influenced by any remedial action, however drastic, taken by a minority of nations.
In a rational world, that prospect should be greeted with unmitigated joy.
If it is so:

All concern over CO2 as a man-made pollutant can be entirely discounted.
It is not essential to disrupt the western world’s economy.
The cost to the European economy alone is considered to be approx. £165 billion per annum until the end of the century, not including the diversion of employment and industries to elsewhere.
This deliberate economic self harm can be avoided and the vast resources could be spent on much more worthwhile endeavours.
If warming is happening, it provides a more benign climate for the biosphere and mankind.
Any extra CO2 has already increased the fertility of all plant life on the planet.
If warming is occurring at all, a warmer climate within natural variation would provide a future of greater opportunity and prosperity for human development, especially so for the third world.

2 Decarbonisation Outcomes

To quantify what may be achieved by political action for de-carbonization by Western economies, this comparative table below shows the remaining effectiveness of each 100 ppm increment up to 1000 ppmv, with the total global warming in each of the four diminution assessments.

Figure 4: Little impact for  trillions of dollars in cost.
The table below shows the likely range of warming arising from these divergent (sceptical and IPCC) views, (without feedbacks), that would be averted with an increase of CO2 for the full increase from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm. This table assumes that the amount of CO2 released by each of the world’s nations or regions is reduced universally by some 20%: this is a radical reduction level but conceivable.

Figure 5: Temperature reduction by nations, regions.
The results above for countries and country groups show a range for whichever scenario of only a matter of a few thousandths to a few hundredths of a degree centigrade. However it is extremely unlikely that the developing world is going to submit to non-development on the grounds of reducing CO2 emissions. So it is very likely that the developing world’s CO2 emissions are going to escalate no matter what is undertaken by developed nations.
These figures show that whatever the developing world does in terms of increasing CO2 emissions, the outcome is likely to be non-beneficial.
The extreme, economically destructive and immensely costly efforts by participating nations to reduce temperature by de-carbonization should be seen in context:

The changing global temperature patterns, the current pause and probable impending cooling.
The rapidly growing CO2 emissions from the bulk of the world’s most populous nations as they continue their development.
The diminishing impact of any extra CO2 emissions on any temperature increase.
Normal daily temperature variations at any a single location range from 10°C to 20°C.
Normal annual variations value can be as much as 40°C to 50°C.
Europe as a whole only accounts for approx. 11% of world CO2 emissions.
The UK itself is now only about approx. 1.5% of world CO2 emissions.

As the margin of error for temperature measurements is about 1.0°C, the miniscule temperature effects shown above arise from the extreme economic efforts of those participating nations attempting to control their CO2 emissions.  Thus the outcomes in terms of controlling temperature can only be marginal, difficult to detect and thus irrelevant.
The committed nations by their actions alone, whatever the costs they have incurred themselves, may only have virtually an undetectable reduction on world temperature.  So it is clear that all the minor but extremely expensive attempts to limit CO2 emissions undertaken by a few convinced western nations will in the end be inconsequential.
Professor Judith Curry’s congressional testimony 14/1/2014 [i]:
Motivated by the precautionary principle to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change, attempts to modify the climate through reducing CO2 emissions may turn out to be futile.  The stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15+ years demonstrates that CO2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales.”
Professor Richard Lindzen UK parliament committee testimony 28/1/2014 on IPCC AR5 [ii]:
Whatever the UK decides to do will have no impact on your climate, but will have a profound impact on your economy.  (You are) Trying to solve a problem that may not be a problem by taking actions that you know will hurt your economy.”
and paraphrased “doing nothing for fifty years is a much better option than any active political measures to control climate.”
It remains absolutely clear that our planet is vastly damaged by many human activities such as:

Truly toxic environmental pollution, (whatever is asserted CO2 is neither toxic nor a pollutant).
Over fishing.
Rain forest clearance, especially for the production of biofuels [iii][iv].
Biosphere destructive industrial farming at all levels.
Wild habitat destruction throughout the biosphere.
Many green and renewable energy activities actually detrimental to the environment, etc.

The world indeed should be strenuously finding ways to improve these situations.
But the unwarranted concentration on reducing CO2 emissions has deflected even well-meaning green activists and green-indoctrinated politicians from these more immediate and more worthwhile objectives.
As global temperatures have already been showing stagnation or cooling [v] over the last seventeen years, the world should fear the real and detrimental effects of global cooling [vi] rather than being hysterical about limited, beneficial or now non-existent warming [vii].
3 The Politics
It is clear that all the minor but extremely expensive attempts by the few convinced western nations at the limitation of their own CO2 emissions are inconsequential.
The IPCC acknowledges that the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentrations exists, but it does not explain its consequences. Like the Medieval Warm Period that the IPCC attempted to eliminate with the hockey stick graph in 2001, the IPCC knows that wide public knowledge of the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentration would be entirely detrimental to their primary message.
It is increasingly clear that policymakers and global warming advocates have long been headed down the wrong path.
Matt Ridley has a clear opinion on this:
So we are doing real harm now to impede a change that will not produce net benefits for 70 years. That’s like having radiotherapy because you are feeling too well.”
Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it all [xv]:
Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early twenty-first century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree, and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections combined into implausible chains of inference, proceeded to contemplate a roll-back of the industrial age.”
On the other hand, a cooling world as both Hemispheres have seen in the years since the turn of the millennium leads to much more dire consequences for the biosphere and mankind, than any realistic amount of warming that could arise from man-made CO2 emissions. The damage can be seen from the current 2014 winter weather in North America, Asia and Siberia and the significant cooling winters across Europe up to 2013.
Cold is a much greater threat than any moderate amount of additional warmth that would ever result from the release of Man-made CO2. National policy makers and the United Nations are neither recognizing nor are they preparing for a cooling eventuality.
With a quietening sun, changing ocean circulation patterns and the growing evidence of much colder winter weather in both Hemispheres, that cooling could already be upon us [xvi]. The cooling climate could well last for many decades or even centuries.

"A not-so-quiet repair revolution is taking place in communities across Britain. Consumers, fed up with having to throw away broken phones, toasters and other appliances, are instead meeting to learn how to repair them and to extend the lifetime of their products. These repair “pop-up parties”, where like-minded people can improve or learn new skills in a supportive environment, can prevent still-useful products from ending up in the bin, while saving money.  Advances in technology and new applications, combined with faster product obsolescence, means that electrical and electronic equipment make up one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world. The growing demand for these products is also driving unprecedented levels of resource extraction to keep up with increased rates of manufacturing of everyday goods – something that the planet can hardly support.   The number of electrical appliances and devices in UK households tripled between 1970 and 2002 and it continues to grow – the average household now owns around 41 electrical items. Many products develop simple faults which are challenging for the amateur to repair, resulting in replacement products being purchased and equipment with small faults being disposed of. For many consumers, repair is now only an option for high cost items such as cars and personal computers, or for household fixtures such as heating systems – washing machines, kettles and toasters are easier just to throw away. The ability to repair goods is key to maintaining the functionality of products and delaying, or avoiding, their disposal. The government recognises the value of repair as part of a waste reduction strategy, and the Welsh and Scottish governments have also signalled strong backing for practical action that encourages a circular economy. In Sweden, there are plans to reduce the VAT on repair work from 25% to 12%, and in France there are penalties for “planned obsolescence”, intentionally producing goods with short lives. Germany and Spain have also been looking at the issue.  Community-based organisations are providing innovative approaches to the repair of a variety of products including clothing and electrical equipment. Access to information, spare parts and tools is available on websites like iFixit, which publishes guides that teach people “how to fix almost anything” and invites users to create new ones. The London-based Restart Project is a community-based repair initiative that runs a forum for motivated individuals to attempt repairs that extend the working lifetime of a variety of items, concentrating primarily on electrical and electronic equipment, and promotes awareness of recycling routes for items they can’t fix.  Restart also arranges pop-up events, where members of the public can take along broken electrical items and attempt to repair them with some support. Restart do not charge a membership fee, and admission to the events they organise is also free. Their aim is simply to enable repair to help extend the lifetime of electrical and electronic equipment and reduce the number of these items that become waste. Restart’s volunteers act as “repair coaches”.   They are also social gatherings, so even if repairs are unsuccessful, participants are still happy to go along and have a go. Restart also acts as an education tool: through a variety of media channels they distribute information and raise awareness about the environmental impacts of end-of-life products and signpost those with unsuccessful repairs to recycling schemes. Some local authorities have also shown support for these initiatives.  Despite the good work being done, the repair network is complex and fragmented – there could be more of them, more widely located, and better known to consumers. Some consumers lack the skills, knowledge or confidence to attempt repairs, even when the resources are available. In a recent study conducted in partnership with The Restart Project, we asked participants at pop-up repair events about their previous experiences of repair. We also asked them about their recycling behaviours and their experiences at the pop-ups. Over half the participants had previously attempted to repair items on their own with different levels of success.  Confidence appears to play an important role in willingness to attempt repairs. It’s often easy to learn how to repair and purchase the tools and parts online, but the compact design of electricals and electronics often makes it an unforgiving task. Pop-up repair events offer a supportive environment in which you can receive help and support completing repairs, building your confidence.  Participants also described a lack of trust in commercial repair services with nearly half of the participants unable to name a repairer they trusted. Several mentioned that the perceived cost of a repair would discourage them from using local, paid-for repair services.  Informal community-based enterprises such as The Restart Project appear ideally placed to develop local networks and respond to the gap in trust. We also identified that participants were less likely to recycle their electrical items than other waste such as paper, glass and tins. This is a problem because electrical items contain materials which require large energy inputs to create and transport. Nevertheless, pop-up repair events may be able to encourage correct disposal of broken and unwanted household items by telling people how best to dispose of them.  Pop-up repair events, such as those organised by Restart, have the potential to reinvigorate our enthusiasm for repair."
"Sea level rise is set to challenge human civilization for centuries to come, even if internationally agreed climate goals are met and planet-warming emissions are then immediately eliminated, researchers have found. The lag time between rising global temperatures and the knock-on impact of coastal inundation means that the world will be dealing with ever-rising sea levels into the 2300s, regardless of prompt action to address the climate crisis, according to the new study.  Even if governments meet their commitments from the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, the first 15-year period of the deal will still result in enough emissions that would cause sea levels to increase by around 20cm by the year 2300. This scenario, modeled by researchers, assumes that all countries make their promised emissions reductions by 2030 and then abruptly eliminate all planet-warming gases from that point onwards. In reality, only a small number of countries are on track to meet the Paris target of limiting global heating to 2C above the pre-industrial era. “Even with the Paris pledges there will be a large amount of sea level rise,” said Peter Clark, an Oregon State University climate scientist and co-author of the study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Sea level rise is going to be an ongoing problem for centuries to come, we will have to keep on adapting over and over again. It’s going to be a whole new expensive lifestyle, costing trillions of dollars. “Sea level has a very long memory, so even if we start cooling temperatures the seas will continue to rise. It’s a bit like trying to turn the Titanic around, rather than a speedboat.” Researchers used a computer model that simulates sea level rise in response to various emissions levels, looking both at historical emissions since 1750 and also what the emissions scenario would be from 2015 to 2030 if countries met their Paris agreement obligations. About half of the 20cm sea level rise can be attributed to the world’s top five greenhouse gas polluters – the US, China, India, Russia and the European Union – according to the researchers. The US was a key architect of the Paris deal but this week Donald Trump formally triggered its exit from the agreement. “Our results show that what we do today will have a huge effect in 2300. Twenty centimetres is very significant; it is basically as much sea-level rise as we’ve observed over the entire 20th century,” said Climate Analytics’ Alexander Nauels, lead author of the study. “To cause that with only 15 years of emissions is quite staggering.” The results reveal the daunting prospect of a near-endless advance of the seas, forcing countries to invest huge resources in defending key infrastructure or ceding certain areas to the tides. Many coastal cities around the world are already facing this challenge, with recent research finding that land currently home to 300 million people will flood at least once a year by 2050 unless carbon emissions are drastically slashed. As the world heats up, ocean water is expanding while land-based glaciers and the two great polar ice caps are melting away, causing the oceans to swell. According to the UN’s climate science panel, the global sea level rise could reach as much as 1.1 metres by the end of the century if emissions aren’t curbed. Clark pointed out the real situation could be even worse if the melting of the Antarctic turns out to be on the dire end of the spectrum of uncertainty. “People are going to become less inclined to live by the coast and there are going to be sea level rise refugees,” Clark said. “More severe cuts in emissions are certainly going to be required but the current Paris pledges aren’t enough to prevent the seas from rising for a long, long time.”"
"A controversial hydroelectric dam project in sub-Arctic Canada relies on local Innu people giving up their own lands. Nalcor Energy, the firm building two dams to produce the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador, along Canada’s north-eastern coast, talks enthusiastically about “boundless energy”. And why not? Hydroelectric power is seen as a renewable and relatively benign way to meet the ever-growing energy needs of industrialised societies. Nalcor, owned by its provincial government, says that its project will “significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions – equivalent to taking 3.2m vehicles off the road each year”. This sounds great. Yet beyond the impressive feats of engineering and the CAN$11 billion cost (£6.5 billion), what will it take to accomplish what is being imagined here?  Across the world, many areas sacrificed for hydroelectric generation belong to indigenous or land-based peoples who either have to be moved or live with drastic changes. The Three Gorges dam in China displaced 1.2m people and the Belo Monte dam in Brazil could displace up to 40,000. And back in the 1950s the Kariba dam project on the Zambesi river in Zambia precipitated an involuntary resettlement of some 57,000 people, including the Gwembe Tonga farmers and hunters, whose homes, gardens, burial and spiritual sites were flooded with virtually no consideration from the British colonial authorities. Opposition to “progress” may lead to imprisonment and in the case of Honduras and Guatemala, even to the suspected murder of indigenous opposition leaders and protesters.  Canada is a supposed world leader on human rights. Yet any country staking its economy upon energy production on the lands of indigenous peoples is likely at some level to disregard their rights. I have researched this over the past 20 years. Muskrat Falls is being constructed on the culturally important Mishta-shipu (“Big River”) on lands where there has been no treaty and which remain under unextinguished Aboriginal Title. The lands belong to the Innu peoples of the Labrador-Quebec peninsula. Yet Canadian authorities are proceeding with the project as they anticipate the Innu electorate will at some time in the future vote to extinguish ownership of their own land.  Contrary to standards in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on free, prior and informed consent, the Innu are given few meaningful choices other than to relinquish their lands.  Under the current land claims process they must either extinguish their aboriginal and land rights or, under the notorious certainty provision, agree not to exercise those rights. In the short-term, many Innu may enjoy some extra cash, self-government rights and business opportunities, but they will have to accept having most of their collective lands privatised. It’s not just me saying this: even the UN has been concerned for some time about the ease with which indigenous lands in Canada have been usurped. As recently as last year the Human Rights Council urged Canada to reconsider its process for consultation and consent. “Consent” in Canada is based on the mind-numbingly complex New Dawn Land Claims Agreement-in-Principle. Although the Innu Nation negotiating team contests the agreement, many Innu do not know its contents. On a recent visit earlier this year to the Innu villages, I found that only four of the 30 Innu adults I consulted had read any of the text. Previous trips also revealed little knowledge of the important provisions in the agreement. But the agreement to extinguish their ownership rights doesn’t really matter because the mega-project is a fait accompli. An environmental study commissioned by Nalcor downplayed the negative environmental effects of Muskrat Falls. The company admits that the dam will increase levels of toxic methylmercury in water and plankton but claims it will remain “in the natural ranges observed for lakes and rivers”. A subsequent modelling study by Harvard researchers predicted much higher concentrations of methylmercury in the waters surrounding Innu and neighbouring Inuit communities and predicted that “increases in methylmercury concentrations resulting from flooding associated with hydroelectric development will be greater than those expected from climate change”.  For people who continue to rely on fishing, this is shattering. A number of Innu and their supporters, alarmed by the likely impact, have now called for a complete rethink. They have organised protests at the site, where five Innu were dragged away, arrested and charged by police. Nalcor says the dam will bring stable electricity prices, clean energy and jobs. But though the jobs brought to the nearby Innu community of Sheshatshiu provided a quick injection of cash they also increased existing community problems. People there told me cocaine and alcohol abuse have increased because of the high pay and shift work patterns at Muskrat Falls, along with subsequent family destabilisation and child neglect. This adds to endemic health problems such as high diabetes and suicide rates that are 14 times higher than the Canadian average. Community infrastructure remains terrible – one village even lacks drinkable water.  The very high costs of living in Labrador have always been offset by subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering, but with Muskrat Falls now joining a network of other hydroelectric projects spanning Innu territories across the Labrador-Quebec peninsula, the continual violation of their rights is increasingly imperilling their ability to enjoy healthy and sustainable lifestyles. While international attention focuses on the trampling of indigenous rights in developing countries, we should not forget that Muskrat Falls joins a long history of dispossession in North America."
"When asked to name one of the great wildlife habitats of the world it is unlikely that many people would choose a series of woods and bogs by the M3 in Surrey. But while herds of wildebeest might not sweep majestically through Camberley, the Thames Basin Heaths area does hold important numbers of birds such as woodlarks, Dartford warblers and nightjars, making it one of the most significant wildlife habitats in southern England. However, the local MP for Surrey Heath, Michael Gove, is apparently not too impressed. The former British justice secretary and leading Brexit campaigner sees withdrawal from the EU as an opportunity to get rid of the very legislation which protects these birds. For Gove, European environmental law “massively increases the cost and the regulatory burden for housing development”. The presence of these species in his constituency has led the heaths to be designated a “Special Protection Area” under the EU Birds Directive. Some parts of the heaths hold ecosystems which are deemed to be of such importance that they are classed as “Special Areas of Conservation” under the EU Habitats Directive.  These areas form part of Natura 2000, a network of protected sites covering 18% of the European Union. It is the largest coordinated network of its type in the world. Many of these areas are not nature reserves or national parks, but areas of land in private ownership, making them vulnerable to exploitation. European legislation recognises that wildlife is no respecter of national boundaries and that a community-wide effort is necessary to ensure the protection of vulnerable flora and fauna. The Habitats Directive obliges governments to preserve Natura 2000 sites. Under Article 6.3, any project or plan taking place in one of these sites must be assessed to ensure it does not adversely affect the integrity of the scheme. In the case of the Thames Basin Heaths this means that no property can be built within a 400m buffer zone of the special protection area, and all housing developments within 5km must include provision for a “suitable alternative natural green space” – an area of open ground which people can use for recreation. The aim is to prevent the heaths becoming overwhelmed with people and dogs, which is particularly important for species such as nightjars which nest on the ground and are vulnerable to disturbance. But Gove has sided with the property developers. For him, these regulations are too great a burden. Some of what he says is fair: there is undoubtedly a need for more housing in the area – and it is equally true that providing “alternative green space” requires thought and expenditure on the part of the developers, which may ultimately be passed on to the purchasers. There’s no escaping the fact that environmental law can create a tension between construction and conservation. However these EU directives exist to protect important areas from exactly these pressures. In many cases the legislation does not prevent development, but instead requires developers to think about how damage can be mitigated and, in some cases, habitat improved. The RSPB cites a number of benefits to this approach, including the proven economic and health benefits of having sites rich in wildlife close to home. Despite David Davis’ promise that environmental protections will remain in place when the UK leaves the EU, wildlife protection after Brexit faces an uncertain future. The Great Repeal Bill is intended to incorporate existing European legislation into UK law, giving parliament the power to “amend, repeal or improve” laws at a later date. However the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, has indicated that only about two-thirds of existing environmental law will be transposed into UK law, leaving groups such as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust concerned about what will happen to the remainder.  The UK has a long history of proactive environmental legislation. Back in the 1950s, a backbench MP named Tufton Beamish introduced a private members bill which eventually passed into law as the Protection of Birds Act 1954. This was the forerunner of the Birds Directive and laid the foundations for the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which became the key source of domestic legal protection for UK plants and animals. Speaking in the House of Lords in support of the bill, Beamish observed: Town and country, farmers and naturalists, we are all in it together. Provided there is unstinted cooperation between all ministers whose responsibilities touch on any aspect of this many-sided subject, there will be no problem in proving that good husbandry and higher material standards of living are consistent with careful protection of our wildlife and our countryside. As Britain leaves the EU, we must remember this ideal. If Andrea Leadsom really does want to ensure that we are “the first generation to leave our environment better than we found it” then we will need a robust legislative framework. Laws which ensure our ecosystems are protected and improved should be celebrated – not treated as burdensome red tape."
"The world is on a path to climate disaster, with three-quarters of the commitments made by countries under the Paris agreement “totally inadequate”, according to a comprehensive expert analysis. Four nations produce half of all carbon emissions but the US has gone into reverse in tackling the climate emergency under Donald Trump while Russia has failed to make any commitment at all. Other major oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have set no targets to reduce emissions. China and India are cleaning up their energy systems but their surging economies mean emissions will continue to grow for a decade. Under the 2015 Paris deal, countries agreed to limit global heating to 2C, or 1.5C if possible. Each country makes a voluntary pledge of climate action, but to date these would result in global temperatures rising by a disastrous 3-4C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in 2018 that emissions, which are still rising, must fall by 50% by 2030 to be on track for 1.5C. Only the 28 countries of the European Union and a few others including Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine are on track. Of the 184 national Paris pledges made, 136 are judged insufficient in the report, published by the Universal Ecological Fund. Another problem is many pledges are unlikely to be met, due to the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, reversing environmental policies, or because poorer nations do not get the funding they need – the US and Australia have stopped making such contributions. “The current pledges made under the Paris agreement are totally inadequate to put us on a pathway to meet either the 1.5C or the 2C goal,” said the report’s author, Prof Sir Robert Watson, a former IPCC chair and scientific adviser to the UK and US governments. “With just 1C warming so far, we are already seeing some very significant effects. The effects at 3-4C will be very profound on people around the world.” “When you see a country like Russia not even putting a pledge on the table, it is extremely disturbing,” he said. “Saudi Arabia and Russia rely heavily on their fossil fuels but that is no excuse. Those that have not effectively made any pledges yet really should be shamed into being part of the solution.” Harvard University’s James McCarthy, a co-author of the report, said: “Failing to reduce emissions drastically and rapidly will result in an environmental and economic disaster from human-induced climate change.” Failing to halve emissions by 2030 means the number of hurricanes, severe storms, wildfires and droughts are likely double in number and intensity, the scientists said, costing $2bn (£1,55bn) a day within a decade. To avoid this, the scale of climate change action must double or triple, they said. The Paris agreement does allow for nations to ratchet up their commitments. “This report demonstrates we need to ratchet badly, and as quickly as possible,” said Watson. China and India should be applauded for improving their energy systems, he said, but their emissions must peak. However, Watson said it was difficult to expect leadership from these nations when those with the biggest historical emissions, like the US, were not doing so. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts The report concluded that countries that had pledged between 20-40% emission reductions by 2030 needed to do much better, including Australia, Canada and Japan. “Leaders need to adopt new policies to close coal-fired power plants and promote renewable and carbon-free power sources such as wind, solar and hydropower,” said McCarthy. That means closing 2,400 coal-fired power stations around the world in the next decade and tackling the 250 new coal-powered units that are under construction. Improved energy efficiency is also critical, said co-author Prof Nebojsa Nakicenovic, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, potentially saving households around the world $500bn a year in energy bills. From cars to homes to industry, he said, the potential of energy efficiency was so great that if implemented no extra energy would be required in 2030, despite the fact that global population was expected to be 1.2bn higher than today."
"The average global sea level has risen by more than 20cm since 1980 – that’s a rate of 0.5mm per month – according to new research from the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BCCC). These are frightening statistics for Europe’s vulnerable coastal cities including Barcelona, Istanbul, Dublin and others. With homes, infrastructure and indeed entire economies at stake, it’s crucial for authorities to understand the extent of the risk these cities are facing – and take steps to manage it.  To start with, it’s important to review such claims in detail, as predictions can vary greatly depending on such factors as the warming of the oceans and the melt rate of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. A closer inspection of the BCCC study shows that the authors misinterpreted the data, as the original source offers a much more conservative sea level rise of 20cm since 1880 – a rate of 1.5mm a year. This falls in the same ballpark as estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other recent research, making it a more credible figure.  Next, authorities need to understand the nature of the risk associated with sea level rise. While higher sea levels can mean that the ocean encroaches on developed coastal areas, this isn’t the only – or even the most serious – risk. Sea level rise is an important factor in climate change, which also heightens the risk from coastal storms and floods for European coastal cities.  Storminess and the intensity, or “magnitude”, of storms – rather than an increase in their frequency – is difficult to predict because of their natural variability. Predictions tend to rely on complex mathematical models for forecasting. In the UK, for example, scientists from the University of Reading and the Meteorological Office found an increase in the number of storms since 1910, in part due to climate change. But the array of models often show a range of results regarding frequency and magnitude from no change at all, to a more rapid increase throughout the 21st century. In fact, these storms could lead to greater coastal impact and erosion, as they cause a rapid rise in the average level of the sea, compared to that experienced because of long-term sea level rise.  Across Europe, cities, transport infrastructure and major industry are often located in the coastal zone. These coastal assets are vulnerable to the threat posed by sea level change and storminess. The extreme water level rise associated with storm surges is particularly worrying. A surge associated with a storm in 2005 added 1.5 metres to highest tide across northern Scotland and the Hebrides. And in 2013, a storm in southern England raised water levels at some locations by an additional 5-6 metres.  To protect Europe’s coastal cities from such disasters, the European Environment Agency suggests that authorities should find ways to improve resilience. This means finding ways to adapt to and lessen the impact of climate change, by investing in long-term, preventative measures.  This could mean anything from making improvements to urban planning with key consultation across a range of experts including climate scientists, coastal zone mangers and infrastructure managers, to increasing the number and size of green areas and limiting construction on floodplains.  Specifically, planners need to start moving away from hard engineering solutions such as sea walls and rock armour. Instead, they should consider working with natural processes to increase coastal resilience. For instance, many European coastal areas have extensive wetlands and beach systems, which can provide a natural “buffer” against the impact of sea level rise and intermittent storm surges.  Yet it can be difficult to persuade the inhabitants of coastal zones to have confidence in these “softer” solutions such as beach nourishment and wetland restoration. Education is key here, to explain how these measures can help. There’s still much progress to be made. Many cities are just beginning to develop and implement strategies to manage the impacts of climate change. These are long-term approaches, not short-term fixes, and as such, it will take time for authorities to gather the necessary political momentum and funds to invest toward mitigating coastal risks. A well-rounded approach which considers natural coastal processes, urban planning and economic vulnerability is crucial to building resilience, and protecting coastal cities from climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi at his Saturday Summary here  tells us what’s already known: The claim that November 2013 was the hottest month ever is fraudulent. He slams NASA and NOAA for picking data that solely suits an agenda.
At the 6-minute mark Bastardi shows the GISS temperature trend from 1999.

A clear cooling trend is shown…before alterations were made later. A few years later these alterations were made to show a slight warming. Bastardi writes: “They are tampering with data” […] November data “not even the warmest in four years.”

The NOAA claims the US was near normal, when in fact it was much colder.
Bastardi then goes on to say the USA has seen the biggest drop in temperature this year that it has ever had. The satellite data also show that temperatures for November were much cooler, see Saturday Summary video at the 9-minute mark. Joes asks: “Why doesn’t the media actually go look at what is going on here?”
Joe then reminds us that global sea ice is at the second highest level in the satellite era.

Near record sea ice hardly indicates record warmth.

"The UK’s biggest fund manager has spent nearly £300m this year increasing its shareholdings in companies it named and shamed for dragging their heels on climate action. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which has been one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, announced in June it was cutting five more companies from its environmentally and socially conscious funds for not doing enough to mitigate the climate emergency. But figures compiled by the Guardian show that LGIM as a whole actually spent about $367m (£285m) since January increasing its stake in those companies – the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer Metlife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPC) – even when accounting for the divestments made by its Future Worlds Funds. LGIM, which manages more than £1tn in assets, openly admits that it continues to hold stakes in companies excluded from those environmentally and socially focused funds, saying it gives them the opportunity to engage with the board and ultimately influence company behaviour. But the boost to LGIM’s overall shareholdings in those firms raises questions over whether companies should take LGIM’s threats seriously, particularly when it is spending millions of pounds to increase its holdings. The investment firm defended its position, saying the increased investment is because it is managing more money for clients overall, and that those clients were putting the bulk of the cash into passive index tracker funds. Index tracker funds are not actively managed but use algorithms to follow major stock exchange indices such as the FTSE All-Share that include companies such as ExxonMobil. “It is index providers, not asset managers, which select companies that are included in mainstream indices. LGIM continues to engage with the large index providers on this issue,” the spokesman said. But John Hardy, an organiser with the divestment campaign group Fossil Free UK, said: “It’s disappointing that a firm like LGIM, which has been a leader on this issue, continues to invest and give a social license to fossil fuel companies and those driving climate change.” He added: “We need to get to a point where there isn’t a difference between ‘Future Worlds Funds’ and tracker funds, where the moral argument and the financial argument are both showing that investment in those kind of companies not feasible and not welcome.” LGIM’s Future Worlds Funds are governed by its Climate Impact Pledge, which means it can exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. It led to LGIM dumping stakes in China Construction Bank, Rosneft Oil, Japan Post Holdings, Subaru, Loblaw and Sysco Corporation last year. But in the months leading up to its 2019 divestments, LGIM actually increased its holdings in all five companies, which it would cut loose later from funds in its its Future Worlds Funds. In March, it spent almost $410m increasing its stake in all of ExxonMobil, Metlife, Hormel, Kroger and KEPC. That figure more than makes up for the $50m worth of shares it dumped as part of the climate divestments in June, and resulted in a net investment across all five worth a combined $367m. LGIM remains a top 30 shareholder in all but one of those five firms, having recently sold another chunk of KEPC shares that relegated the fund manager to the firm’s 78th largest investor. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of investment campaign group ShareAction, said: “The analysis raises the issue of index funds which automatically channel capital into fossil fuels companies – this is far from a perfect model for socially conscious investors.” “What is crucial is that index fund managers use their voting rights as shareholders in fossil fuels companies to demand ambitious change from company boards and senior management, and to vote against the election of directors that fail to commit to transition. As ShareAction’s recent analysis of voting on climate-related resolutions shows, LGIM has indeed done this.” A recent report by ShareAction lauded LGIM for backing 82% of key shareholder climate votes, many of which were aimed at forcing world’s most polluting companies to cut their emissions. LGIM’s spokesman said: “Climate change is a very important topic for us and we have been working strenuously to bring about change in the companies in which we invest.” In line with its climate pledge, LGIM has used its shareholder powers to vote against corporate chairs of companies it believed failed to take adequate action on the climate crisis. Voting records seen by the Guardian show it voted against re-electing the top board members of companies including Volkswagen, Barrick Gold and Japan’s Tepco, which it believed were not doing enough to mitigate the climate emergency.

"Young activists interrupted the delivery of a controversial pipeline to a port in southern Washington at daybreak on Tuesday, once again taking the lead in the climate fight. Tuesday’s protest by Portland Rising Tide was part of a continuing effort to disrupt the opening of project that expands a pipeline running from Edmonton, Alberta, to the coast of British Columbia and would open export markets to hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Alberta tar sands.  Climbers flanked by kayaks chained themselves to a pier on the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington, intending to intercept the delivery of pipe manufactured in India for the project. The group of protesters included 22-year-old Kiran Oommen, a plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit Juliana v the US, which takes aim at the American government’s complicity in promoting a fossil fuel energy system and other practices that facilitate the climate crisis. Oommen, who is joined by 20 other young plaintiffs in the litigation, was among those who chained himself to a dock. By 8am, Oomen and other activists were being threatened with arrest as an arriving bulk carrier sounded its foghorn and a growing crowd of stalled workers gathered on the pier, one shouting: “Trump! Four more years!” Before climbing a ladder and chaining themselves to the pier, Oommen said past action to lobby, to vote and to use the courts to compel action on climate change had been unsuccessful so far. “The point that my generation is at, we don’t have time to wait for systems that haven’t worked for decades,” Oommen said. The linking of a Juliana plaintiff with direct action against fossil fuel infrastructure signifies more than individual frustration with inaction on climate. It denotes the rising sense of urgency among young people to remedy a crisis that afflicts them all. “I fear for my future. It’s zero hour and I can’t watch the Earth die around me. I don’t want to be 30 and telling my kids that I didn’t do anything,” said Lydia Stolt, who risked a college scholarship to be among those locked to the pier. Oommen’s four-year-old court case been the subject of repeated, and unusually aggressive, emergency petitions by the federal government intended to halt the suit, which has missed three trial dates so far. “Part of why I’m here is to just give them a little reminder that they can play with us in the system, but we don’t have to stay in the system to have our voices heard,” Oommen said. Tuesday’s action took aim at the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, a 1,150km (about 700-mile) Canadian project that will boost the capacity of oil transport from the Alberta tar sands to the coast of British Columbia. The $7.4bn expansion is projected to triple the 300,000 barrels of oil currently transported from Edmonton and would carry heavier oils with higher potential to emit greenhouse gas, making it what many activists consider a potential climate tipping point. The project was initially proposed by Kinder Morgan in 2012, and the Canadian government approved it, but it was delayed by opposition from First Nations and environmental groups and lawsuits from provincial and municipal governments in Canada. The project was acquired by the Canadian government, which continues to fund the expansion, in summer 2018. The action by Portland Rising Tide, the local affiliate of the North American direct action group, was the culmination of an international effort to track shipments of the pipe from India through the US into Canada. Greenpeace provided technical assistance, while support from the north came from Mosquito Fleet, an oil and gas direct action group, and First Nations peoples who oppose the pipeline. Cedar George-Parker, 22, a member of the Tulalip and Tsleil Waututh tribes, said First Nations communities had staunchly opposed the pipeline, which crosses indigenous lands. He said a study had determined a spill could sicken 1 million people within 24 hours. He also noted potential impacts on the salmon in the Fraser River watershed and orcas in the Salish Sea from increased tanker traffic. “In Tulalip, the orca is on the crescent [flag], so it’s who they are,” George-Parker said. “We have to do something to save them. They can’t speak English … they can’t go to the legislative building."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe calendar says it’s summertime in the Arctic. But looking at the latest weather forecast, you’d never know it. In fact it looks more like September.
Here’s what the temperature forecasting chart shows today:

The above chart based on the NCEP shows frosty days up ahead for the Arctic. Source: http://wxmaps.org
Ellesmere island, the 12th largest island in the world, will be about 5°C below normal over the coming week. A large part of the Arctic will be below freezing by early August, according to forecasts. This flies in the face of “accelerated warming” that is supposed to occur in the Arctic. Sea ice as a whole will come close to a modern low, but so has the temperature!
Steve Goddard at his website has written on multiple occasions about how it’s been the coldest summer in the Arctic on the (modern) record. Here’s the summer temperature chart for this year thus far:

"We’ve heard a lot about urgent climate action from “world leaders” in developed countries, yet actual concrete achievements have been limited. The rich world may soon be shown up by small, tropical island nations which have plenty of wind and sun and aren’t lumbered with outdated, base-load power plants to keep running. Plus these islands are among the countries most threatened by climate change. No wonder then that of the 15 nations to fully ratify the Paris climate agreement on the day it was signed in April 2016, 13 were tropical island states. Impressive developments in the sustainable energy sector are already evident across the Caribbean. Growing expertise in renewables, climate change and resilience, along with a 2014 study on the Barbados energy sector, all demonstrate the relative ease with which small island states could transition to 100% renewable energy systems.  Similar processes are also taking place among islands elsewhere in the tropics including Aruba, Seychelles, Mauritius and Pacific Island Countries. These changes could happen in a matter of years rather than the decades predicted for industrialised countries.  Small island states often have some of the highest electricity prices in the world. Unless they happen to be sat on big oil or coal reserves (and most aren’t), they’re forced to import their energy and can become “locked-in” to costly and polluting fossil fuels. It’s a big economic drag. However, Caribbean people are known for their optimistic outlook on life and this “locked-in” scenario could actually spur on these islands to being among the first countries in the world to transition to 100% clean energy systems – a special feat given that today most of these islands are powered almost entirely by fossil fuels. A country’s energy system is usually comprised of base-load and peaking-load power plants. Base-load plants cannot be ramped up or down very fast, but are able to provide cheap power. They include nuclear, coal plants and combined cycle gas turbines. Peaking-load power plants are able to quickly ramp up or down in order to meet the fluctuating demand of customers on the electricity grid. Examples include, hydroelectric plants, gas turbines and, pertinent to small island states, low speed diesel engines. Small islands derive most of their electricity from these low-speed diesel engines, which can work well as a backup for intermittent wind and solar power, until a suitable storage medium can be deployed, such as pumped-hydro.  Conversely, large industrialised countries are restricted by their existing large coal or nuclear power plants, many with decades left to run. So both technically and economically, small island energy systems have several advantages, when compared with large industrialised countries. Being in the tropics and experiencing trade winds, many small island states also have exceptional renewable resources. Over its lifetime, a solar PV system located in the tropics will produce over 50% more electricity than an identical system installed in the higher latitudes in say Europe or North America. The exposed windward coasts of these islands are often rural and experience enviable wind regimes; far from the tourists, wind energy experts already describe these islands as practically offshore wind platforms. Utility-scale wind has the added bonus that it can provide fresh stimulus to agriculture sectors suffering from declining sugar cane exports. Of course electricity forms only part of a country’s energy demand. On small islands, around 50% of the energy can be used by transport but again these states could speed ahead of the pack by electrifying their vehicles too.  Pump prices are high as all petrol is shipped in, so the relatively short journeys on small islands make them ideal for today’s short-range electric vehicles. In Barbados, 4% of all new vehicle sales are now electric – still a small slice of the market, but far above that in the US, China or almost all European nations, and up from 0% just a few years ago. Small island states have the potential to rapidly transition their energy systems to renewable energy. However the opportunity and rewards are still not clear to all. Barbados, one of the first countries to ratify the Paris climate agreement, will soon celebrate 50 years of independence. What better way to mark the moment than to achieve energy independence through a bold plan to power towards 100% renewables?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowki comments here on the recently published paper by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way, which suggests the Arctic has warmed more than first thought and that the so-called warming pause resulted from missing data.

Spiegel warns that eerily similar studies have been seen before, e.g. Steig et al, Mann et al.
Bojanowski reminds readers that “the calculation method is in dispute” and writes that reaction from the scientific community has been split, with the warmists uncritically welcoming it with glee, and skeptics being suspicious of the study’s methodology, “underscoring the weaknesses of the new analysis“. The overall tone of Bojanowski’s article is one of skepticism, reminding readers that such studies from “newcomer scientists” have been seen before.
Bojanowski explains how the study’s authors filled in the regions of missing temperature data in the Arctic, and that other scientists are skeptical of the method used, citing Judith Curry’s blog commentary. Spiegel writes:
Among other factors, Curry points out that measurement stations in the Arctic are primarily land-based, but that the now calculated region of the Arctic data void is covered mostly by sea ice and or water.”

The Spiegel science author then warns readers that we’ve seen this kind of statistical work in other studies and that there’s a “feeling of foreboding” surrounding the overall results. He writes:
Caution is advised – as other studies from the other side of the planet have shown. Since 2007 several prominently published calculations have shown that Antarctica as a whole would warm- much to the surprise of many experts because the southern continent is considered a climatological single, isolated case. The latest UN climate report determined there is minimal confidence in the concerned temperature calculations.”
Bojanowski writes that the study is “somewhat particular” because both authors are newcomers: “Cowtan researches in crystallography, Way is a student in geography; both also write for an internet site that would like to run down climate skeptics. The constellation does bring a feeling of foreboding.”
Bojanowski then reminds readers of another similar case: citing Michael Mann and his hockey stick chart, which was debunked by “outsiders” Ross McKitrick and Steve McIntyre. He also links to the Steig’s paper.
The difference, Bojanowski writes, is that Cowtan and Way are “open for a lively discussion” and that both don’t claim that their study is the final truth.

"The seasonal sea-ice retreat across the Arctic Ocean is perhaps one of the most conspicuous indicators of climate change. In September 2012, a new record was set for the time that we have been tracking sea ice with satellites: the minimum sea ice extent was some 50% below the climatic average for that month. Four years on, and the September 2016 record tied with 2007 for the second lowest sea ice extent since measurements began in 1978. The seasonal retreat of sea ice is largely because the atmosphere in the Arctic is heated under 24 hours of daylight in the summer, and this makes the ice melt. In the cold of the perpetual darkness of winter, the sea ice extent returns to its winter norm: the only heat available to slow sea ice growth is from winds and ocean currents moving warm air and water in from the south.  However, during the winter of 2016/17 the sea ice did not return to its winter norm. In fact, the sea ice extent was the lowest ever recorded for this time of year. Though the Arctic is not exactly in the UK’s backyard, the changes in sea ice coverage are thought to be at least partly responsible for the recent run of severe weather events experienced across the northern hemisphere. These include unusually cold winter weather across parts of Europe and the US, and deadly smogs in parts of China. The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world. As the difference between atmospheric temperatures in the Arctic and mid-latitudes (which includes the UK, part of North America, and a band of northern Europe and Asia) decreases, the speed at which weather systems (depressions) track across the Atlantic to northwestern Europe is reduced. This means that snow and rain can persist for longer, and high pressure systems are “harder to shift”, which can lead to further reductions in air quality. The largest oceanic heat input to the Arctic comes from water that has been in the Atlantic Ocean, and has travelled through the Fram Strait and around Svalbard. This “Atlantic water” circulates around the Arctic in an anti-clockwise direction. This water is currently the warmest it has been for 2,000 years and now contains enough heat to completely melt the sea ice within a couple of years.  However, while this water is warmer than the ambient Arctic water, it is also saltier, and so heavier, too. It sits at depths of 100 to 400 metres across much of the Arctic Ocean. This means that the Atlantic water heat is insulated from the surface by a layer of lighter, colder and fresher Arctic Ocean water which sits above it. Atlantic water contact with the sea surface – which then melts the sea ice impacting coverage and thickness – has previously been restricted to the region around Svalbard, where the Atlantic water enters the Arctic Ocean. However, new measurements reported by a team of international scientists have shown, for the first time, that previously insulated Atlantic water heat is now being stirred up to the sea surface. This results in enhanced sea ice melt, much further to the east, north of Siberia.     We previously measured the upward Atlantic water heat flux in this region in 2007 and 2008. At the time it was very modest. However, the new measurements estimate this flux to have increased by two to four times over the winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15. The result of this increase is that sea ice thickness has been reduced by between 18 and 40cm. This exceeds the impact of the atmospheric heat on sea ice melt alone (estimated to be 18cm).  The researchers attribute the change to a reduction in the vertical density gradient within the overlying Arctic water layer. The Atlantic water has moved closer to the sea surface, and created conditions much more like those found around Svalbard, where there is less sea ice. Lead researcher Igor Polyakov describes the change as the “atlantificiation” of this part of the Arctic Ocean. These important new results highlight the increasing role of heat coming from the Atlantic Ocean in driving sea ice retreat in the Arctic Ocean. They are a profound sign of the planet’s changing climate, and show that there is a link between retreating Arctic sea ice and the severe weather that has been witnessed in mid-latitude countries. Furthermore, they show that the impact of Atlantic water heat on sea ice is highly variable across the Arctic Ocean, with significant heat fluxes restricted to geographic “hot spots”. The identification of these hot spots will be key to improving how we forecast the weather in the northern hemisphere and understand how the retreat of Arctic sea ice impacts on it."
"You don’t have to live near an airport to be familiar with condensation trails, or “contrails”, slicing through the skies behind high-flying aircraft. They form due to aircraft exhausts and generally disappear fairly quickly.  However, under favourable conditions at the aircraft’s cruising altitude – too dry for clouds to form naturally yet cold enough for them to linger – these contrails may develop into more persistent contrail cirrus clouds or even widespread “cirrus fields” that are virtually indistinguishable from naturally occurring clouds. In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, colleagues and I have now found planes passing through these clouds actually make them “brighter” and cause them to reflect more sunlight back into space. It won’t make up for all the CO₂ emissions, but this discovery assists the general cooling effect of contrails and will need to be factored into assessments of the impact of aviation on the climate. Atmospheric scientists monitor cirrus clouds and contrails with the help of satellites. Feeding their observations into computer models show that the global climatic effect of contrails in a cloudless sky is rather small – though they certainly make a big difference locally. But what happens when aircraft fly through clouds that are already present in the atmosphere? We already know what happens when ships move underneath fields of low-level clouds: water vapour condenses around the aerosol particles emitted from the funnels. This causes an increase in the number of droplets in the clouds, while those droplets are also smaller than those under undisturbed conditions. This is called the first indirect aerosol effect or Twomey effect. Clouds with denser, smaller droplets have more surface area for sunlight to bounce off, leading to an increase in brightness along ship tracks that is visible in aerial and space-borne imagery. Cirrus clouds, in contrast to low-level water clouds, consist of ice crystals. But aircraft passing though them can be expected to have an effect all the same. Most likely, the soot particles emitted by the aircraft engines act as nuclei around which clouds grow. This leads to a larger number of ice crystals that, in turn, provide more surface area for incoming sunlight to hit. When investigating the effect of contrails, previous studies looked at line-shaped features in satellite images of clouds and matched them up with known flight tracks of aircraft. The problem is these observations are purely two-dimensional and lack any possibility to look deeper into the clouds. We instead looked for spots where flights from Hawaii to Seattle, San Francisco or Los Angeles would cross the ground track of a satellite that carries a special highly sensitive lidar (or “laser-radar”) instrument. Here we were most likely to see contrails.  Lidar allows us to easily identify cirrus clouds and to retrieve a profile of their optical properties, even from space. The extra vertical information means we are no longer restricted to a simple top-down view of these clouds, but can instead find the base and top of the cloud layer as well as its “optical thickness” – that is, how much light it scatters. The added data on flight tracks then tells us if an aircraft passed through a cirrus cloud before or after it was observed by the satellite. We found a significant increase in the optical thickness of the clouds close to an aircraft’s flight track compared to those further away. In other words, clouds inside flight corridors were more reflective or “brighter”. This means incoming sunlight is more likely to be reflected back into space if it is met by cirrus clouds that have been penetrated by high-flying aircraft.  Learning more about the effect of contrails that are embedded in existing cirrus clouds improves our understanding of the impact of aviation on the climate – which may prove vitally important as the size of the aviation sector continues to grow."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd DEATH by heat by 2100 if we don’t stop burning carbon now.
The ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) forecasts that the number of heat-wave days will double in just seven years, so reports CO2 Handel website here. The forecast appeared in Nature.
Recall that the PIK is the outlier panicky institute that insists sea levels may rise 2 meters by the year 2100 and believe that the planet is warming faster than ever, even though global temperatures have dropped slightly over the last decade. Its director is Professor Dr. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the chairman of the WBGU, a 12-man advisory committee of “renown scientists” who are calling for the rapid transformation of the global economy to one that is driven mostly by renewable energies. The WBGU also calls for a watering down of democracy, insisting that professors in academia must have the say on how the planet is governed.
Back to the subject of heat waves, the German Press Agency DPA writes:
Strong heat waves for this time of the year will double by 2020, calculates a team led by 2020 Dim Coumou of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (Pik). By 2040 such weather patterns will even quadruple. Droughts, heat waves, and storms could in turn enhance climate change in the future, the scientists add in the journal Nature.”
The scientists also add that “soil and plants absorbed up to 30 percent of the man-made carbon dioxide over the past 50 years and thus have slowed climate change.” But they say forests are no longer absorbing the CO2 as well, and so the climate is going to get a lot worse.
“Robust” fortune-telling

Based on models – that’s the good news because so far every PIK model projection has been completely wrong. The opposite of what they projected is actually happening in reality. No temperature increase in 15 years.
The PIK fortune-telling doesn’t stop at the year 2040; it even looks at the year 2100. Now that must be some really powerful fortune-telling. For you non-believers and skeptics, think again:
‘The Pik study delivers more robust results than of the earlier studies,’ comments Stefan Hagemann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg on inquiry. ‘What today is the exception, is what we will have to get used to in the future.'”
Dim Coucou claims that things are going to get a heck of a lot worse:
While today only 5% of the globe’s land surface sees heat extremes in the summer each month, that will go up to 85 percent. ‘In many regions the coldest summer months will become hotter than the hottest months today,’ Coumou says.”
Overall the German angst-spreading PIK scientists say it’s too late to prevent the massive heat waves foreseen for 2020 or 2040 – there’s just too much CO2 in the atmosphere. But if we act now and change our carbonic ways, then there’s still hope to avert the catastrophe that awaits our grandchildren in the year 2100, Coucou wants us to believe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here reports on the efforts by a gaggle of Senate Democrats to wake up America to the “risks” of climate change, But as FAZ Washington correspondent Patrick Welter reports, the event wound up having the bounce of a dead cat.
The FAZ writes: “The political happening was a bit bleak and infirm.”
Maybe it had something to do with the US experiencing one of it’s coldest and most brutal winters in memory thus making the whole thing seem a bit foolish. People weary of shoveling snow probably aren’t going to take warnings of warming too seriously. FAZ comments:
It can be assumed that the event on TV was no hit with viewers. The litany of complaints about climate change deniers, rising sea levels and flooding, threatening icy winters and large droughts quickly got tiresome with the viewers.”
Welter also writes that there wasn’t going to be any vote taken when all the talking was done because Obama has long since decided to circumvent Congress when it comes to regulating CO2, opting to do it through the EPA instead.
Welter then brings up America’s success in reducing CO2 emissions, all thanks to fracking – a technology that US environmentalists are also against. Welter concludes:
In a completely unscientific comparison, during the night the environmental protectionists in the Senate appeared somewhat infirm. […] In this marathon session more than two dozen senators would vent 15 hours long until Tuesday morning.”
While pretty much dismissing the event as a sideshow, Welter at the end of his report commits an huge unfortunate gaffe that reveals how little understanding he actually has of the climate change debate, framing it as “one between the opponents and supporters of environmental protection.” If Welter bothered to do a minimum of research, he’d find that there are many environmentalists on the side of the skeptics. Ultimately, only people who really view data critically and with skepticism are able to protect the environment.

"The Daily Mail calls it a “slime wave”. The Sun calls them “an army”. Either way, both papers have reported 500 billion slugs are set to invade British gardens, after a mild winter created perfect breeding conditions.  So is the UK really about to be overwhelmed by slimy slugs? The simple answer is no, but there could be something far worse in store. Headline numbers alone aren’t necessarily something to get in a lather over. A typical garden can contain several thousand slugs, and the “500 billion” figure is derived from estimates of maximum numbers per area. In any case, slug numbers can rise and fall a great deal across time and space, in natural cycles, and even astonishingly dramatic increases are not always cause for concern. Like waves crashing against a beach, the rise is often transient and local – usually slug numbers will drop back to normal, with the disturbance hardly noticed beyond a few local gardeners.  What is more problematic is the progressive, sustained and perhaps less spectacular rise in numbers which, tsunami-like, is maintained for far longer, and spreads widely throughout the countryside. This is Britain’s real slug invasion. So what can we do about it? The trigger seems innocuous enough in isolation: a few non-native slugs from continental Europe have accidentally been introduced. Several of these species have close relatives in the UK, so similar in fact that only specialists can tell them apart, and they can interbreed freely. Of course, many animals can create hybrids without presenting a threat, but what makes slugs different – and these hybrids so worrying – is their interesting and deviant sex lives. Slugs are hermaphrodites, which means the same individual exists as both sexes; they first develop as males, before experiencing a true hermaphrodite phase to become female. This means they can dispense with normal mating requirements, and this is where the consequences of “La difference” between British and continental species becomes significant. When slugs colonised the UK after the last ice age, they found an island recently covered with ice sheets, where the biological diversity remained poorer than continental Europe. In these circumstances, the ability to self-fertilise was a good evolutionary strategy, one which ensured reproduction even when slug populations were devasated by harsh weather.  A downside of such continued close inbreeding (and mating with oneself is as inbred as it gets) is a rapid loss of genetic variability, and some British slug species eventually came to consist of almost genetically identical individuals. This meant they were more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens that could rapidly evolve to overcome their defences. Meanwhile, in continental Europe, slugs were becoming more diverse, as balmier weather meant parasites and pathogens were a bigger issue than finding a mate. These slugs tended not to self-fertilise, and were genetically highly variable. This made at least some of them more resilient to attacks from parasites – a possibility not afforded to the inbred British slugs. Echoes of these different past environments resonate in contemporary species. British slugs, adapted to a variable climate and dearth of mates, have fallen into the clichéd “No sex please, we’re British” mould, producing fewer, bigger eggs later in life by self-fertilisation. Continental slugs, meanwhile, adapted to resist rapidly evolving enemies. Their strategy is therefore to produce many smaller eggs earlier in life, which maximises genetic diversity and compensates for losing many individuals to infection. These different adaptations weren’t an issue until humans disturbed the natural order by moving slugs back and forth as stowaways in commercial produce. As a result of this, we’ve seen widespread breeding between British and continental species. These new hybrid “super-slugs” are highly fertile, and their genetically diverse offspring are adapted to cope with both the British climate and parasites and pathogens, most of which remain in continental Europe anyway. Legislation aimed at environmental protection has led to the EU banning commercial use of molluscicides (pelleted chemicals which poison slugs but cause collateral damage to other wildlife). Instead, the emphasis is on using natural enemies like nematode worms, though these are generally ineffective against the larger invasive hybrids. Nonetheless, the increased slug biomass could still host important veterinary or agricultural parasites and pathogens, spreading more plant and animal diseases. Remarkably, despite their obvious presence in our gardens, we remain startlingly ignorant of the fundamental biology of slugs; evidenced by recent work which increased the number of identified British species by more than a fifth. So where are we going with this phenomenon? Studies have already found invasive slugs and snails can destabilise ecosystems and reduce biodiversity in the US and Scandinavia. Something similar is happening here in the UK. The good news is that our research suggests population sizes do eventually begin to decline, after 30 to 40 years. The ecosystem may eventually rebound from this slug invasion, but it remains to be seen how long it will take and what the lasting effects will be for the spread of diseases, ecosystem services, or British biodiversity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Bild newspaper here quotes German meteorologist Dominik Jung: “For the coming winter give a probability of 70:30% that it’s going to be a colder-than-normal winter.”

Jung is not the only meteorologist forecasting a colder-than-normal winter. Bild also reports that also Michael Klein of Donnerwetter.de expects better than even chances of bitter cold months: “The first trend points more to a colder-than-normal winter. At least it is not going to be mild.“
The southern Germany’s online Wasserburger Stimme reports here that the chances of an “extreme winter” are as high as ever this year. The site also quotes German meteorologist Dominik Jung, who says that winters in Central Europe in general began to become milder after the 1960s thanks to mild winds coming in off the Atlantic. Jung adds that the highpoint was reached in the 1990s. But: “In the last 5 years the winters have been normal or slightly colder than normal. The series of extremely mild winters appears to be over.”
A meteorologist who believes anything?
Jung feels that this winter could be a really harsh one – the sort not seen in 50 years. But cautions that such a forecast cannot be made with high certainty. Jung adds:
But the probability of a new XXL winter has increased considerably. New theories claim that extended ice melt at the North Pole could lead to significantly colder winters in Europe. It is not that the climate over the whole world will warm up. There are regions that will indeed get warmer, and there are also regions that will get cooler.”
Here Jung is subscribing to the after-the-fact nonsensical theory that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) desperately had to cook after being caught off guard by cold winters that took Europe by surprise. It’s a dubious theory based solely on IPCC-quality models with no data to support it.
Jung adds that the US NCEP models are also forecasting a slightly colder normal winter than usual (1961-1990 mean).
UK meteorologist predicts possibly “the worst for decades”
Forecasts of a harsh winter are also circulating in Britain. The online Express here bears the title: Worst winter for decades: Record-breaking snow predicted for November.” It writes:
Long-range forecasters blamed the position of a fast-flowing band of air known as the jet stream near Britain and high pressure for the extreme conditions. Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, said: ‘We are looking at a potentially paralysing winter, the worst for decades, which could at times grind the nation to a halt.'”

It’s hard to tell how much all of this is headline-grabbing. Some meteorologists may be getting carried away. My WAG is a more or less normal winter.
Greenpeace Arctic Activists Update
Complaints that the cell is too cold
The UK leftist Independent here writes that some of the 30 arrested Greenpeace activists are complaining of harsh conditions and that their cells are too cold. The Independent quotes the father of a detained activist:
‘There’s no regular access to such simple things as clean water, regular meals and a warm enough air temperature,’ Mr Golubok said.”
What do the activist expect from a Russian prison? Five-star resort accommodations, massages and a sauna?
Captain says he needs to go home because of heart problems
Meanwhile the English language Ria Novosti reports that the captain of the Arctic Sunrise ship Peter Wilcox now regrets going to the Arctic to protest:
RIA Novosti’s legal reporting agency RAPSI quoted Willcox as saying he had never faced such severe charges in 40 years of activism, and that he would have stayed in New York if he could choose to go back. […] Denial of Willcox’s appeal came despite his lawyer expressing concern over his health complications stemming from a heart condition.”
Oh, now suddenly he has heart problems. Strange how just a month ago his heart had been in good enough shape to allow him to venture off into the harsh Arctic conditions for a little protest and boat ramming.
Lavrov warns external parties “not to interfere”
Yesterday Ria Novosti here wrote that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that the environmental activists “clearly violated the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea” and that “the issue should be left in the hands of the courts“. He also warned external parties “not to interfere“.
Ria Novosti writes that “All 30 have appealed their detention, seeking release on bail or home arrest. The Murmansk Regional Court has rejected all 11 appeals it has heard so far, ordering the activists to remain behind bars until a hearing on November 24.”
Looks to me like none are going to be released on bail. There’s just too much material to sort through and no one wants to decide prematurely. Besides, the Russians have lots of time and there’s no hurry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Der Spiegel writes here that the EU is moving to abandon its ambitious climate protection targets. This, Spiegel writes, is now a real threat to Germany’s much ballyhooed Energiewende (energy transformation to renewable energies).
The EU used to be a leading, unrelenting proponent of CO2 emissions reduction, even often ostracizing other industrial nations like the USA for not following its lead on carbon emissions. Many EU countries even implemented laws and generous subsidies to promote large-scale renewable energy systems. But now, some ten years later, EU policymakers are waking up to the exorbitantly high costs of green energies and their unpredictable, uncontrollable supply.
Originally the EU’s target was to reach 27% renewable energy by the year 2020, and 40% by 2030 (Germany is even pushing for 60% by 2036). Today the EU insists it’s still sticking to that target but Spiegel writes that emissions cuts will be voluntary in the future:
Upon request from Commission president José Manuel Barroso, the EU member states will no longer receive concrete requirements for expanding renewable energies in the future.”
Moreover, Spiegel writes that the EU wants to begin clearing the way for fracking. The controversial method is now widely used in the USA and natural gas prices there are some 65% cheaper than in Europe as a result, thus creating a serious competitive disadvantage in key industries – such as chemicals.
Germany, a vocal proponent of rash CO2 reductions and climate protection, has reacted critically to the EU’s new intentions. German economics minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) criticized the EU and wrote that it “cannot afford to let this opportunity to get away.”
The Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) claims that more relaxed EU targets and less support for renewable energies could have real impacts on German climate policy: “In such a context it is going to get increasingly difficult for Germany to successfully maintain a national leadership position.”
In other words, as Europe abandons aggressive climate change policy, Germany eventually will be forced to follow.
In summary, Europe’s backing down from pushing through a radical green transformation of its economy appears to be in large part driven by the high costs to consumers and a worsening capability to compete globally. Rescued again by the free markets!

"Donald Trump wants to restrict or even abolish the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In particular, he is proposing to dramatically limit the federal agency’s power to regulate carbon dioxide emissions, instead putting the onus on individual states to self-regulate.  Although it sounds like a dire strategy, and emissions will probably increase, tougher regulations in blue states like California or New York should mitigate the inevitable oil and gas boom in Texas and the Midwest.  Far more worrying than a scale back of the EPA are existing policies, which already subsidise fossil fuels to an alarming extent. US markets are currently so distorted in favour of the most polluting energy sources that scrapping climate regulations will do relatively little to increase emissions, compared to the damage that is already being done. Trump’s anti-EPA proposals – if they are ever implemented – will be comparable to throwing a match on a burning building. Coal, oil, and natural gas – fossil fuels – are the key cause of climate change, yet they receive huge support from governments. I’ve developed a new method to extract the size of fossil-fuel subsidies by looking at how much these fuels are used by individual countries. By comparing actual energy use to a hypothetical amount a country “should” use in the absence of subsidies, we can extract the value of a country’s implicit subsidies. These benefits go far beyond the obvious tax breaks for coal, oil and gas firms. We are dealing here with entire economies set up to favour fossil fuel consumption over more energy-efficient or renewable alternatives. This manifests itself in a wide variety of “hidden subsidies”, ranging from cheaper loans for drilling companies to subsidised mortgages which push people to build bigger houses that use more energy.  One striking example is the exemption of roadways from property tax. In the US, almost all land pays some type of property tax – even federal forests pay states for tying up land in a particular use. The land on which roads are built, however, generally pays nothing. This results in lost revenues and encourages more driving, and more petrol burning. Add up the value of all these benefits and what do we get? In 2010, the most recent year in my analysis, fossil fuel subsidies in the US were worth a staggering US$170 billion. That amounted to 1.8% of GDP or US$1,400 per year for the average American family.  These subsidies have been rising since 1980, the earliest year I analysed, even as people became more aware of global warming. Ironically, there was an especially sharp rise just after America signed the Kyoto protocol in 1997 – an international treaty aimed at restricting carbon emissions. While probably unrelated, this nonetheless highlights that what governments say and do are two entirely different and often opposing things.  These subsidies are already contributing to higher emissions to a far greater extent than any potential EPA deregulation. Both directly and indirectly the government offers incentives to individuals and firms to use more energy and to burn more fossil fuels than they otherwise would.  Getting rid of these policies would improve efficiency and provide a reprieve to strained government budgets, while also lowering carbon emissions. My research shows that had the US eliminated all subsidies between 1980 and 2010, its emissions would have been 11% lower than they actually were. In fact, almost the entire increase in US carbon emissions over that period came from rising fossil-fuel subsidies which encouraged more energy use. Trump’s suggestion that he may seek to eliminate the EPA and its various regulations on vehicle or factory pollution would work like yet another subsidy. However, the effects pale in comparison to the damage already done and continuing to be done by existing subsidy programs implemented over the past 20 years under presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama."

By Ed Caryl
In the aftermath of the sole very strong tropical cyclone we experienced this year, all the catastrophists have since piled on claiming it was all caused by a warming world. They conveniently forget that one of their claims is that the polar regions are warming faster than the tropics. Of course temperature differences are what drive weather.
This is true of both tornadoes and cyclones. If the northern and southern temperate regions are warming faster than the tropics, then temperature differences should be falling, and storms should be decreasing in strength and number, not increasing.
So what is really happening?
Monthly accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) data were downloaded from Ryan Maue’s WeatherBell site here, and cyclone energy was totaled for the years from 1970 to the present. Next average annual cyclone energy was graphed by decade. Figure 1 is the result:

Figure 1 is the annual average Northern and Southern Hemisphere ACE for the decades since 1970 including the partial decade from 2010 to the present. 
Both northern and southern hemisphere ACE increased from the 1970’s through the 1990’s, then decreased after 1999. What were temperatures doing?

Figure 2 is the zonal warm season (May to October) temperature anomalies downloaded from GISS here, for the same five decades as in Figure 1. 
In Figure 2, for the first three decades, the mid-northern and southern latitudes lagged the tropics, warming faster only in the last two periods. If we chart the tropical temperatures minus the northern and southern mid-latitude temperatures, Figure 3 results.

Figure 3 is a chart of tropical temperatures from Figure 2 (from -19° to +19° latitude) minus the temperate zone temperatures from -21° to -45° and +21° to +45° latitude for each decade. The temperature anomalies between the two zones have been declining since 2000, just as ACE has. 
In both hemispheres, ACE follows the temperature difference between the tropics and the temperate zones. Compare Figure 1 and Figure 3. Since 2000, both temperature difference and ACE have been falling. In the southern hemisphere the temperature difference has always been negative, and so not surprisingly ACE has been low. It peaked in n the 1990’s when the temperature difference was highest. If the doomsayers had only looked at the data, they would have known they were wrong.
In fact, the doomsayers should be hollering that lower cyclone activity is real evidence of a warming planet. Of course that would be good news, but the doomsayers just don’t want any of that. No wonder the latest IPCC report claims there’s now data showing a link between extreme weather and warming. There is, but they don’t want you to see it.
What will happen in the future? The trends point to the tropics not warming further, the mid-latitudes continuing to warm, and the poles to cool. The trend is for ACE to decrease. And with the current 15-year warming pause showing no signs of abating, expect cyclone activity to stay at relatively low levels. Good news for every one!
Scream all you want, but the data tell the real story.

"Residents of Penzance, Cornwall, the UK’s first “plastic-free” town, were understandably piqued this week to find that 150 Christmas trees had been put up – every single one made of plastic. Local business chiefs behind the move defended their decision to opt for fake trees for the community and insisted they were more sustainable than the fresh alternative – which would later have to be burned – and could be dusted off and reused for many years.  Artificial trees used to be a manky wire frame with a bit of tinsel attached, typically left forgotten in the loft along with their tangled Christmas lights. But modern-day tree technology has leapt forward and uses injection moulding to create realistic sprigs. Even close up, the pricier artificial ones can fool most consumers into thinking they are real. But looks are not everything. With major retailers such as John Lewis reporting that “faux” or artificial trees typically made from plastic are now outselling traditional fresh trees, are the ersatz ones an environmental nightmare? According to the Carbon Trust, it is the manufacture of the plastic, from oil, that creates most – around two-thirds – of their carbon emissions. A further quarter is created by the industrial emissions produced when the tree itself is made. Their carbon footprint is boosted by the trees typically being shipped by container from China before arriving in the shops. Friends of the Earth is advising consumers who have fake trees to keep using them for as long as possible (and today’s versions will last for years) but to look into more environmentally friendly options when it comes to a replacement. Its tree campaigner Emi Murphy says: “Buying a potted tree with roots lets you grow it outside and use it again year after year, reducing its environmental impact and costing you less. A living tree will carry on absorbing carbon from the atmosphere for years to come. The other option to check out is the tree-rental service offered by many garden centres and plant nurseries.” Alternatively, string some fairy lights over a houseplant you already have. Meanwhile, Penzance could take inspiration from London’s fashion district Carnaby Street, which is promising a “world-first” sustainable ocean-style Christmas installation to be unveiled next week. Every element will use recycled and reusable materials. These include repurposed fishing netting to look like green kelp, more than 500m of post-use bubble wrap standing in for coral and more than 1,500 recycled plastic bottles for fish and bubbles. The finishing touches have been added in with over 100 litres of water-based eco-friendly, vegan paint. Eat your heart out, David Attenborough."
"The next government must bring forward the target for reaching net-zero carbon emissions by five years to 2045, phase out diesel and petrol cars by 2030 instead of 2040, and start devoting at least 5% of all government spending to the climate and the restoration of the UK’s natural environment, a broad coalition of civil society groups has demanded. They have written to the leaders of all the UK’s main political parties, citing the UK’s hosting of next year’s UN conference on the climate, known as COP26, as the catalyst for strengthening existing goals in line with scientific advice.  “[Next year] will be crucial for the future of our planet and presents opportunities for the UK to enhance its reputation as a global leader on these issues,” they wrote, on 17 October, before the general election was called. “Global leadership will depend on strong evidence of domestic delivery.” Alongside green groups such as Greenpeace, WWF and Friends of the Earth, the signatories include the Women’s Institute, the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, development charities including Oxfam and Tearfund, and religious organisations such as Islamic Relief, Quakers, GreenChristian and Cafod, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development. Another letter calling for a more ambitious environment act, reform to the farming sector that prioritises environmental protections, tougher commitments to end overfishing, and a closer relationship with the EU on green issues, was sent by organisations with 8 million members, including the National Trust, RSPB, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Woodland Trust and Greener UK. Separately, the UK’s largest business organisation, the CBI, called on the next government to “kick off a decade of climate change action”, demanding tougher regulations to make buildings more energy efficient, clear policies to drive the uptake of electric vehicles, a new post-Brexit carbon pricing regime for businesses, and a new strategy for carbon capture and storage. “We are asking the government to turn 2020 into a year of action,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI. “We have the deadline of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next November, so let’s use it to kickstart the UK’s net-zero plans and see how much we can achieve in the next 12 months.” Referring to the success of the London Olympics in 2012, which had a galvanising effect on the UK’s international sporting performance, she added: “[COP26] could be our climate change Olympics, reinforcing the UK’s position as a global climate leader, as well as showing the public at home, and the wider world, the scale and reach of UK low-carbon innovation and expertise.” All of the major parties are expected to set out commitments on the climate emergency and the environment as a key part of their election planning. The Conservatives made a U-turn on fracking at the weekend by pledging a moratorium that will in effect end fracking in the UK for the near future, though critics said it fell short of a permanent ban. John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK, said environmental issues must play a leading role in every party’s strategy: “As carbon emissions, global temperatures and sea levels continue to rise, public concern over the climate and nature emergency is also rising. Election manifestos must reflect this by providing clear and ambitious policies that will take us to a net-zero carbon world and restore nature as quickly as possible. This isn’t about winning over voters with warm words; it’s about committing to a tangible roadmap that will help save the planet from climate and ecological collapse.” Doctors are also increasingly concerned about the impacts of climate chaos, according to Richard Smith, chair of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, which represents more than 650,000 health professionals. “As the chief executive of NHS England has said, the climate emergency is a health emergency,” he said. “[And] air pollution is responsible for around 40,000 premature deaths each year, so the UK’s commitment to banning new petrol and diesel cars should be brought forward to 2030 to reduce pollution and save lives.” The climate emergency is also being taken up by organisations beyond dedicated green and conservation charities, including faith groups and charities with a community and volunteering focus. Lynne Stubbings, chair of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI), said her members were taking action locally, by planting trees and creating community gardens among other efforts, and wanted to see more action from the government.  “WI members are clear that we need urgent action to tackle climate change, stop our oceans and wildlife being destroyed by plastic pollution, and to protect our environment for the future,” she said. “The WI has been at the forefront of efforts to protect our environment since the 1920s with campaigns ranging from raising awareness of ocean pollution, to the scourge of litter and the need to tackle wasteful excess packaging.” The Green party welcomed the calls for greater emphasis on the climate and other environmental issues, and said faster action was needed. “Business has a crucial part to play in the urgent transformation we need to see and government should unleash its potential,” said its co-leader Jonathan Bartley. “The next decade will be vital to take the necessary steps to halt climate chaos. It is only through an alliance of state and non-state actors that we will be able to make the UK a world leader in the green revolution we need to see.”"
"Those in favour of Britain’s continued membership of the European Union – although strangely not the UK government’s official campaign to remain in – are increasingly highlighting the contribution Brussels has made to protecting the natural environment. There is some justification for this. During the 1970s and 80s Britain was famously disparaged as the “dirty man of Europe”, a polluting nation only persuaded and coerced into cleaning up its act by a succession of  EU regulations. A recent report by the House of Commons environmental audit committee argued membership had been positive for the UK environment and noted that “none of the witnesses to our inquiry, even those who made criticisms, made an environmental case for leaving the European Union”. I’m not here to argue for Brexit. But the EU’s green record is hardly unblemished. Indeed, in several key areas, European policies have slowed if not reversed the UK’s progress on environmental protection. And a major new EU-US trade agreement just around the corner could threaten much of what has been achieved. The UK’s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is significantly more ambitious than that required under current European rules. The EU’s pledge at last year’s Paris conference was modest enough that Britain had already effectively promised to cut emissions “at twice the rate of the EU as a whole”.  Given the privileged access that big energy and fossil fuel companies had to the EU’s top climate policy decision makers in the run-up to the Paris gathering, we shouldn’t be surprised by the underwhelming commitment. Should the UK vote to remain, its generous contribution towards Europe’s emissions pledge merely takes the pressure off other member states, resulting in no net global benefit. It’s a point raised in the Commons report itself. The EU is a big supporter of biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol. The European Commission’s website describes these fuels – manufactured on an industrial scale in Europe from crops such as rape, sunflower, wheat and maize – as “a renewable alternative to fossil fuels in the transport sector, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the EU’s security of supply”. The EU has set a target that by 2020, 10% of the transport fuel of every member comes from “renewable sources such as biofuels”. Burning crops rather than petrol sounds like a good idea. However, these biofuels don’t actually do much to reduce overall emissions, once you take into account the extra land turned over to crop cultivation and the greenhouse gases used in fertilisers. In addition, much of the biofuel used in the EU is imported from poorer countries, contributing to land grabbing in Africa and other places. Some experts have called this a new kind of biofuel-colonialism.  The EU’s support for the automotive industry further tarnishes its green credentials. Although Europe is to be congratulated for introducing tough vehicle exhaust emissions limits over the years, the cosy relationship with manufacturers when it comes to enforcement is hardly laudable. For decades carmakers – with Europe’s tacit connivance – have benefited from loopholes in testing procedures allowing vehicles onto the road which emit substantially more “real world” CO2 emissions than the rigged test cycles suggest. During the Volkswagen emissions scandal documents emerged revealing how leading member states including the UK had just months previously lobbied the commission to carry over these dodgy rules into new test procedures coming in to force in 2017. If VW hadn’t happened, those loopholes may still have been in place.  But perhaps the greatest potential blot in the EU’s green copybook is its impending monster trade deal with the US. A series of bilateral trade negotiations, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership aims to boost the economies of the EU and the US by removing or reducing barriers to trade and foreign investment. The political establishment and large businesses across Europe largely support TTIP, but critics distrust the secretive process by which it is being hammered out. They’re even more concerned that the deal will negatively affect small businesses and water down a swathe of hard-won social, safety, democratic – and, yes, environmental – protections in the name of economic growth. Sometimes, as with diesel emissions, US environment standards exceed those of the EU. But it’s not the norm. With more than 60% of all processed foods in the US containing genetically-modified organisms, American negotiators will be pushing hard to overturn the EU’s current ban on GM food imports, not to mention Europe’s strict pesticide rules and its favouring of the precautionary principle when it comes to assessing potentially toxic chemical substances, as enshrined in the EU’s REACH regulations A confidential draft of a “sustainable development chapter” of the TTIP negotiations, leaked in late 2015, contained vaguely phrased and non-binding commitments. This is merely paying lip service to the environment. The EU does have much to be proud of when it comes to environmental and social idealism – and it certainly talks a good talk – but recent history tells us that when the chips are down economic imperatives and big, polluting, businesses take precedence. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. After all, when the EU’s precursor organisation was founded in 1951, the environment wasn’t even mentioned. In those days it was known as the European Coal and Steel Community. What could be greener than that?"
"The death of Harambe the gorilla at Cincinnati Zoo, shot to protect a child who had fallen into his cage, has caused outrage. Some of the anger has now turned from “trigger-happy” staff towards zoos in general. Why, some are asking, is an endangered gorilla behind bars in the first place? In an ideal world, Harambe would live peacefully in Central Africa. There would be no deforestation, no poachers, and no diseases transmitted by humans and our livestock.  But in the real world, fewer than 900 mountain gorillas are left in the wild. And zoos are a necessary and vital part of efforts to conserve them and other endangered animals. Modern zoos aim to promote animal conservation, educate people, and support further wildlife research. The three are entwined to ensure the animals are housed to the highest possible standards of welfare. Staff are dedicated to providing species-specific housing, appropriate diets and husbandry to ensure that the animals’ lives are as natural as possible within captivity. Anti-zoo and animal rights groups such as CAPS, PETA or the Born Free foundation claim that zoos are inherently cruel. They highlight animals housed in small cages for “our entertainment” and claim all should be released back into the wild. But zoo design has moved a long way since the bad days of bare, concrete cages, and indeed innovative enclosures these days can closely replicate an animal’s wild habitats.  In fact, most zoo animals, including Harambe the gorilla, have been born and bred in captivity. They have never experienced “the wild”, which many people assume is a wonderful and safe place, despite destruction of natural habitats for palm oil, threats from  climate change or the increase in poaching. Zoo conservation work can be “in-situ”, where money, expertise and sometimes staff are provided to protect animals and their habitats in the wild.  Large, charismatic animals such as pandas, tigers or elephants draw the crowds. These flagship species help to raise the profile and funds for in-situ conservation efforts for the not so well known species. For example, there aren’t many visitors who would be passionate about protecting frogs or other amphibians yet zoos have been instrumental in preventing the loss of a large part of the world’s frog fauna. “Ex-situ” conservation, meanwhile, takes place outside of the animals’ natural habitats, usually back at the zoo and often involving international captive breeding programmes. These studbooks can outline suitable genetic matches for breeding, to maintain a sustainable captive population of a certain species and ensure genetic variation.  Species such as the golden lion tamarin, Arabian oryx, Przewalski’s horse, the European bison, and even the common dormouse have at some point been reliant upon captive breeding so as not to become as dead as the Dodo. In the UK at least, zoos must have a written education strategy and an active education programme. If you have been to an accredited zoo recently you will have noticed they use games and technology to go way beyond these basic requirements. Research within zoos often looks at animal behaviour or welfare, helping to ensure the animals are well housed and fed. Other research investigates the impact humans have on the zoo animals, from the visitor effect to the relationships which can be formed between the animals and their keepers. I recently investigated the human-animal relationship between zoo animals and the keepers.  Research also focuses on biological functioning of animals. Much of this is work that cannot be conducted in the wild if the animals live in remote or inhospitable areas. To take one recent example: Italian scientists who wanted to investigate the Vocal Repertoire of the African Penguin made recordings of a captive colony in a Turin zoo. Overall, zoos provide opportunities to observe and engage with exotic animals, many of which may be threatened with extinction in the wild. Seeing them up close can spark a passion for biology, conservation and the environment.  So next time you decide to visit a zoo, take a deeper look at the animal care and information that is provided for you. You may become a defender of zoos and the vital work they do. But please: don’t enter their enclosures."
"George Monbiot, columnist and author of several books on the climate crisis Before I worked for the Guardian, I tried writing for other newspapers, in the belief I should reach the unconverted. But I gradually discovered that all of them were intensely hostile to thoughtful explorations of ecological and climate breakdown. In total, I was commissioned to write 26 articles. All but two were spiked. Eventually I realised it was impossible to cover these crucial issues properly without supportive editors. Reluctantly at first, I started writing for the Guardian in the early 1990s. Across most of this period, it has been the only paper that has consistently supported powerful writing about the gathering collapse of our life support systems. Now, with your help, it is devoting unprecedented resources to the greatest predicament humankind has ever faced. Thanks to your support, I will keep writing about every aspect of our environmental crisis, always striving to dig deeper and to understand more.  Emily Holden, environment reporter for Guardian USAs the Guardian’s environment and climate crisis reporter in Washington DC, I write about how the Trump administration’s rollbacks of key public health and pollution protections will hurt Americans. I investigate how corporate power over public policy stalls climate progress at the national and state level. I have reported on environment policy across the country, tracking the build-out of the plastics industry in Appalachia and local resistance to chemicals manufacturing in Louisiana. For our Toxic America series, I tested my own body to demonstrate how many dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to in daily life. As a million species face extinction, I have traveled from the west coast to the Gulf of Mexico to chronicle the devastating toll human living takes on nature and to explain what Trump officials’ work to ease wildlife protections will mean for biodiversity.  Oliver Milman, environment reporter for Guardian US The media traditionally overlooks slow-moving emergencies so it’s inspiring that the Guardian has long covered the climate crisis in a thoughtful, comprehensive and, increasingly, an urgent way. That urgency is now playing out in real time, in a tumult of hurricanes, wildfires, heatwaves and protester rage. The US is a crucible for the decisions that led to the climate crisis as well as the disasters wrought by it, demanding that we not only report on the victims – disproportionately people of colour and the disadvantaged – of this unfolding catastrophe but also interrogate the policies that have led us to this point. I have sought to illuminate the actions of the Trump administration, easily the most destructive when it comes to climate than any previous US administration, and show how the climate crisis is playing out as an existential threat for many Americans on the margins. I’m currently looking at how global heating will shape the 2020 election, as well as some of the emerging solutions to the crisis. This is the defining issue of our time and we need to treat it as such. Matthew Taylor, environment correspondent We have just finished the Polluters project, which aimed to shine a light on the role of fossil fuel companies in the escalating climate crisis – and the financial, lobbying and political systems that underpin them. It was a huge collective effort with reporters, data journalists and editors working in countries around the world for the past six months. I teamed up with academics in the US to pull together data that revealed that just 20 fossil fuel companies are behind a third of global carbon emissions. I have also been investigating the plastics industry, uncovering how global fossil fuel corporations are investing $180bn in new plastic production companies, even as scientists discover plastic pollution in every aspect of our lives from the oceans to drinking water, food to the air we breathe – with unknown health implications. Another area of inquiry is air pollution and its impact on people’s day-to-day lives, particularly in big cities where cars dominate the public space. It was, in part, a realisation that the same fossil fuel companies were at the heart of each of these three major ecological crises – plastics, air pollution and global heating – that led to focus on the systemic nature of the crisis and the Polluters project. I have also been following the emergence of various environmental protest movements over the past 18 months – particularly Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes. I first heard about plans for XR in a central London cafe six months before it launched. One of the founders told me they would bring large parts of central London to a standstill for days on end with hundreds of people arrested for peaceful mass civil disobedience. Eighteen months later that has proved remarkably prescient, although what happens next is unclear. But when I saw some of those involved in the latest XR protests holding up copies of our Polluters project front page, it reminded me that the Guardian’s journalism can help shape and inform the debate around these huge crises we face. Adam Morton, environment editor, Guardian Australia Eastern Australia continues to suffer through the worse drought in living memory. Summer is weeks away, but parts of the country are sweltering and burning. Its most celebrated natural wonder is under grave threat. Scientists warn a local extinction crisis is worsening. Australians are increasingly concerned, yet politics continues to wreck itself over global heating, fights between and within parties over climate policy having played a part in the downfall of the previous five prime ministers. The government repeatedly claims to be acting, but has few policies, national emissions are rising year-on-year, vast new fossil fuel projects win support and leaders from the Pacific islands and elsewhere are dismissed when they call for more to be done. Exploring the changes being felt across the country and holding Australia’s political and business leaders to account are the major focus for Guardian Australia’s environment reporting team, which – with readers’ support – recently expanded from one to three, with an increased emphasis on investigations. We are also committed to telling the stories of people living on the frontline of climate change and spotlighting tales of hope: showing that, in a wealthy country with unmatched renewable resources, there are options beyond despair. Jillian Ambrose, energy correspondent It has taken only a few decades for the energy industry to power the world into a climate catastrophe. The Guardian’s Polluters series laid this bare: oil companies have understood the consequences of their actions decades ahead of the public, and they have actively fought to conceal the truth about the world’s fossil fuel addiction. This truth is now propelled by social media, and gaining ground in US court hearings and in climate talks across the globe. #TheyKnew. But the Polluters series also revealed that for Big Oil the destruction of the climate is still business as usual. By 2030 the world’s biggest oil producers plan to produce an extra 7m barrels of oil and gas everyday; knowingly putting the world on track for climbing global temperatures and deadly climate chaos. At the same time, UK government officials are using taxpayer money to finance fossil fuels abroad, locking developing countries into decades more of dependence on a dying industry. And the global investment industry stands poised to use people’s pensions pots to buy a stake in Saudi Aramco, easily the world’s biggest polluter. The energy industry, and its backers, must be held to account on its greenwashed PR promises and spin; where journalists shine a light, progressive leaders can take action to dismantle the structures that reward pollution with profits – and build something new.Patrick Barkham, natural history writer I can’t pretend that revealing how the long-tailed blue butterfly has bred rather well along England’s south coast this year is the world’s most important story. Writing about other species, and our relationships with them, can seem an insignificant dot among all the vital news reported by the Guardian. But we – both readers and writers – are joining the dots. The struggles and successes of other species in an age of extinction prick our conscience, tell us about the climate crisis and will ultimately determine whether our civilisation can endure. I’ve recently written about Sir David Attenborough’s career and ancient trees threatened by high-speed rail; I’m researching stories about regenerative farming and rewilding. We need to know what’s happening to plants and animals but we also need hope, and that’s provided by shining a light on solutions – the many human action that address our current predicament. Jon Watts, global environment editor Our natural life support systems are collapsing. That is a sentence nobody in their right mind would ever want to dwell on, but in different ways on different days, that’s what I spend most of my working life thinking and writing about. Fortunately for my mental health, I also get to talk to the brave and brilliant people who are fighting to change that. This year, I have reported on the environmental crisis from the Arctic to the Amazon, interviewed Greta Thunberg, covered climate protests across the world, collaborated on the Green Blood investigation into international mining crimes, and helped to pull together the Polluters series of stories that named and shamed the fossil fuel companies profiting from climate breakdown. In the coming two months, I will join a search for nature-based political solutions in Brazil and UN negotiations in Chile that aim to raise action on carbon emissions. Next year, there will be even more important climate and biodiversity summits in Glasgow and Kunming, as well as environmentally crucial elections in the US and elsewhere. This feels like a defining moment for humanity: Excited the issues are finally getting the attention they deserve. Worried the urgency is still not at the level required. Proud the Guardian and its supporters are taking the lead in stepping up the pace. Fiona Harvey, environment journalist If the climate crisis were the only environmental emergency facing us, we might be in with a good chance of solving it. But at the same time as moving to a low-carbon world, we have to grapple with pressing issues from the plastic scourge of the oceans to the pollution we are pouring into our children’s lungs, our failing water supplies, rapidly falling populations of vital fauna, our plundering of the oceans sending fish populations plummeting, and the challenge of feeding more than 9 billion people. We do not have the luxury of choosing which of these to concentrate on: they are all vital to our continued life on the planet, and that is why the Guardian devotes more reporting effort to these issues than any of the world’s other major media. These problems can all be solved and – contrary to alarmist claims from the extreme left and right – they can be solved without plunging us into a new dark age or reversing the benefits of modern life. Done right, we can improve life for all and create a happier and more equitable world as well as a healthier planet. Ignoring our pressing environmental problems solves nothing, and writing about them is the first step. The message is one of hope – but hope only works if we acknowledge and act on the need for change. Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter, Guardian US Environmental justice means equal access to clean air, land and water, and healthy food wherever we work, live, play, learn and pray – regardless of wealth, ethnicity, skin colour, gender, age and social class. In other words, we should all get to breath clean air, have enough water to drink, and be able to buy or grow healthy food. But the reality is that ecological hazards and climate disasters have the harshest impacts on people of colour, indigenous communities and those on low incomes. This isn’t new, but rising sea levels and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis, coupled with the roll back of environmental protection and climate resilience programmes by the Trump administration, means vulnerable communities face mounting threats. That’s why in my role as the Guardian’s first environmental justice reporter, I’ll be investigating the impact of classist and racist public policies, corporate interests and the climate crisis on communities across the US and beyond. Who breaths the most polluted air? Which communities struggle to access enough water? Where are the food deserts? Who are the environmental justice warriors fighting back against Big Business and state corruption? Which children have access to safe green spaces and which don’t? Environmental racism and discrimination cause and perpetuate health, social and economic inequalities. Help the Guardian expose the shocking, and champion the extraordinary through our year-long series Our Unequal Earth. Damien Gayle, reporter Without the logistical, editorial and financial support of the Guardian, I could not have spent two weeks carrying out thorough on-the-ground reporting of Extinction Rebellion’s “autumn uprising” protests in London this October. In-depth reporting is only possible with a newsroom able to give reporters the time they need to walk the streets and meet people face to face, a newsroom that isn’t commissioning us to hammer out six stories a day for the commercial team to throw adverts on to. And without billionaire backers, that kind of news organisation relies on the support of ordinary people like you. Continue to support us, and we can continue to cover the news and issues that you care about. Damian Carrington, environment editor The climate crisis and annihilation of wildlife around the world is finally breaking into the mainstream, as the impacts become obvious and the youth strikers call older generations to account. So I’m focusing on both the increasing dangers of climate breakdown and the solutions, including those that involve restoring nature and, with it, wildlife. The next year is critical, with key UN summits on climate and biodiversity. Human civilisation evolved in a period of settled climate conditions – its continuation requires stopping our own actions bringing that period to a chaotic end."

I particularly like the following he said:

To me it’s just plain cynicism to seize upon any event and then to use it as an example of a theory, which is not a way to prove it.”

The problem for the climate scientists is that they have got nothing left but anecdotes and witch-hunting. They are exposing themselves as charlatans. In essence, Krauthammer is calling the whole thing a scam.

"As a way to step up her commitment to the global fight against climate inaction, Jane Fonda has decided to start getting arrested – on what seems to be weekly basis. It’s a curious sentiment for her to feel like she should be doing more, considering her activist history eclipses pretty much the entirety of Hollywood’s, but it’s a genuinely heart-warming notion from our pinko grandmother. (Those pics of her picketing with Arundhati Roy and Naomi Klein? You really love to see it.) In recent photos, she is seen dressed immaculately in a Chanel coat, smiling while police take her away, raising her closed fists as high as she can, given the restraints binding them together.  The reaction, interestingly, has been mixed. Young people (ie those who haven’t grown up with an especially firm knowledge of now-aged Hollywood divas– I can’t relate) have taken to Twitter to critique the action. It’s performative, they write from the safety of their Brooklyn apartments – it’s problematic, it’s an irresponsible show of privilege as an older rich white woman … as if her privilege, and manoeuvring of it, isn’t the point. It’s quite the ouroboros – a tweet calling someone else performative can end up being performative in itself, but it’s par for the course with online discourse these days. It’s also a peculiar misreading of the optics behind Jane’s actions. At her age, garnering media attention and using the tools of recognisability is an effective way of connecting to her much older audience. It’s one that isn’t particularly known for positive contributions to environmental sustainability conversations, and one that might be uninterested in hearing from younger activists on the topic. It’s a shame that’s the case, but integrating older figures into our battles is nothing more than a smart tactical move. It’s time to start getting intergenerational instead of fixating solely on a single voice. Imagine being 81 years old and facing ostracisation and constant threats by multiple US governments and a powerful contingent of rightwingers, only for young leftwing people to call your activism superficial, and you might have some kind of understanding of how bad faith these criticisms sound. There are, of course, hundreds of celebrities who have tapped into the zeitgeist and the metrics of “wokeness” to appeal to new markets without doing anything significant to, say, change that market, or enact any kind of significant difference or shift in consciousness, so the suspicion is perhaps understandable. It’s nonetheless important for us to parse why legitimate actions are scorned, so that we may be more critical of the powerful, and less susceptible to the ever growing manipulations of modern day PR. The signifiers of wokeness – beyond being a once-useful term misappropriated from black American vernacular – apparently represent that of deeper thinking, inquiry and action, but can just as easily be used to paint a deceptive veneer. A true measure of character should be how high the stakes are. Will this opinion/collaboration/action lose followers, customers, or will it boost the brand?  I could think of no one more bold than our favourite Sagittarius, who risked her career to campaign against the Vietnam war. Her actions essentially lead to a blacklist. She orchestrated her return to the screen mostly so that she could raise more money for various social causes. To be back in the spotlight despite continuing distrust of her integrity takes guts. Yes, she’s wealthy – but it’s a wealth that has for the most part been distributed, whether being funnelled into socialist movements, Native American struggles, or the Black Panthers when they were at their most prominent. Profits from the film “9 to 5” were donated to union groups; profits from her workout tapes were distributed in similar ways. Even during the recent protests, she’s personally committed to bailing out anyone else who’s been arrested alongside her. Commenters have speculated that her getting arrested takes away attention from those protesting with her, many of whom are non-white and less able to defend themselves against those state forces which so often target and undermine the disenfranchised. Many celebrities (and non-celebrities for that matter) can be queasy when it comes to understanding their own whiteness – self-flagellating, deflecting, joking about it or ignoring it altogether, rather than distributing wealth, connections and access to those who may need it more (a point demonstrated by Oliver Reeson in their critique of Cyrus Grace Dunham’s new book).  If we’ve been given these protections, it might be more constructive to talk back at them, use them, putting our bodies between those who can’t do the same, undermining the reason that whiteness exists altogether. Activists have known this for years. Understanding the function of “arrestables” is common practice for those in frontline struggles. This isn’t performative – it’s a much needed show of solidarity, and one that can usurp the damage that state violence enacts upon so many of us. • Jonno Revanche is a writer and photographer based in Sydney and Adelaide"
"The Trump administration’s hostility towards climate action and research leaves a void in global climate politics. Could China step up? The world’s largest absolute emitter could certainly use US inaction as an excuse to backslide on its promises of greenery. But China could instead see this as an opportunity to project itself as our planet’s leading custodian. Evidence suggests the latter course is far more likely. Opening the annual National People’s Congress in March, premier Li Keqiang pledged to “make the sky blue again”. Both the report he presented and the legislation and decisions reached continued to stress environmental issues, albeit perhaps not as emphatically as in recent years.  Meanwhile, in January at the annual World Economic Forum pow-wow in Davos, president Xi Jinping took advantage of Trump’s economic nationalism to affirm China’s commitment to globalisation. As the US rejects the very idea of global responsibilities, China is thus apparently aiming to reap the rewards of positioning itself as the polar opposite.  This isn’t just empty rhetoric. Chinese investment overseas in green technology increased by 60% last year to US$32 billion. More importantly, the broader context of Chinese domestic politics has created strong incentives for further environmental efforts. This suggests an authentic medium to long-term commitment. And in China, it is the “dog” of domestic politics and regime legitimacy that wags the “tail” of geopolitical strategising. The environment is already a massive and potentially explosive issue within China. The increasingly powerful urban middle classes are becoming ever-more aware of environmental issues, particularly those that affect their health, such as air pollution or food, soil and water safety. The government’s key programme to make manufacturing more innovative is also intimately tied to environmental goals and the opportunities of “cleantech” such as electric cars). Even China’s digital giants including Alibaba and Tencent are more interested in the environment than their equivalents
in Silicon Valley. There are even broader factors at play too. As the country has grown in both domestic prosperity and global stature over the past 40 years it has gradually been compelled to address with ever-greater urgency its own central question. This is: how will China once again be the unquestioned centre of the world?  Restoring civilisational preeminence is easier said than done, however, especially given the starting place for these efforts. The past 200 years have seen a violent repudiation of traditional cultures and painful engagement with Western-dominated modernity. This remains a sensitive wound. For central to the Chinese concept of a unique “Chineseness” is both its unsurpassed cultural greatness and its unrivalled longevity.  Embryonic “soft power” efforts have proven problematic, which calls into question the universal appeal of Chinese culture. Meanwhile, traditional ideas such as Confucianism occupy only peripheral roles in contemporary life. This exposes both the comparative youth of modern China and the unresolved legacies of its traumatic breaks with its past. The situation creates twinned dissonances: between China’s actual and “rightful” standing in the world and between its actual and desired relation to its own traditional culture. Crucially, though, protecting the environment is seen by the government as a key opportunity in both cases. Hence Beijing’s leading slogan of “ecological civilization” – significantly a civilizational project that also, inseparably, has environmental sustainability at its heart.  The idea here is to draw on and renew distinctively Chinese ideas of Confucian harmony between humans and nature. This, it is hoped, could present a China to the world whose culture uniquely qualifies it to be the global environmental saviour. And it could reconnect the Chinese themselves to their traditional cultures, updated for a contemporary world of environmental responsibility. Progress is unlikely to be smooth. China’s one-party state does allow for the massive mobilisation of resources crucial to the major projects of sustainable transitions. But that same political structure – best described as “fragmented authoritarianism” – also makes it harder to foster cutting-edge innovation and harder to implement environmental regulations – and to involve different stakeholders in decision-making. As such, China still lags behind the US in the global game of cultural hegemony. Yet its grand project of “ecological civilization” is so important in contemporary domestic politics that the environment will likely be seen as China’s trump card for some time yet. If America chooses to play its hand badly in the meantime, this will simply be welcomed in Beijing as a further stroke of good luck."
"The research submarine Boaty McBoatface is about to be used for the first time. Boaty is world-famous thanks to its name: the result of a joke entry to a naming contest that went viral, but few know what the sub will actually do. Well, I am currently lead scientist on RRS James Clark Ross, Boaty’s parent ship, which just set sail from Chile. Here’s what we want to find out. Around the world, deeper ocean waters have been steadily warming over the past few decades, faster than we would expect simply through overall climate change. This suggests that global warming has triggered some sort of a change in deep sea circulation, which has sent extra heat into the lowest layers of the ocean. On its maiden voyage, Boaty will help us investigate why this is. The process begins in the seas near the Antarctic coast. As they are blasted by freezing winds blowing off the continent’s vast ice sheet, the waters become cold and dense, and sink into the abyss. Those waters then spread northward to the rest of the globe in streams that flow along the ocean floor.  Along the way, these deep water streams encounter several submarine mountain ranges, the very peaks of which can appear above the surface as islands like South Georgia (where Ernest Shackleton famously sailed to after becoming stranded in Antarctica). When the streams run into these mountains they meander around and across them, forming highly turbulent rapids and waterfalls along the way – very much like rivers do on the Earth’s surface.  We don’t yet know what causes the recent deep ocean warming, but the available evidence suggests that these rapids and waterfalls are at the heart of the issue. Scientists believe that strengthening winds over the Southern Ocean have caused the deep water streams to speed up, and become more turbulent in the areas where they have to negotiate mountains and ridges. More turbulence means increasingly vigorous mixing of cold deep waters with warmer water from the upper ocean, leading to overall warming at the bottom of the ocean. To test this hypothesis and identify how changing winds and deep ocean warming are linked, a team of UK and US scientists, including myself, has set off on a 52-day expedition to the Southern Ocean. We’ll focus on the Orkney Passage – a 3,000-metre deep, narrow gorge in a large submarine mountain range which about a quarter of all the deep water flowing northward from Antarctica squeezes through. As water flows through the passage we’ll get detailed measurements of its speed, temperature and turbulence. We’ll use a combination of vertical profilers deployed from the ship, instruments moored to the ocean floor, and the autonomous underwater vehicle Autosub Long Range – widely known, of course, as Boaty McBoatface. Boaty is a cutting-edge unmanned submarine that can perform missions that last several days, cover distances of hundreds of kilometres, and dive down to 6,000 metres. These subs mean scientists can access some of the most remote and hazardous environments in the ocean. Boaty’s mission will be to ride along the deep-water stream as it finds its way through the Orkney Passage, measuring every meander, rapid and waterfall in much greater detail than is possible with mainstream oceanographic instrumentation. The data collected by Boaty will be key to unravelling how the deep water turbulence in the passage is regulated by changing winds.  Our ultimate goal is to learn enough about what happens when deep water streams hit submarine mountain ranges to represent these processes (for the first time) in the models used to predict how our climate will evolve over the 21st century – and beyond."
"John Harris talks of capitalism blindsiding its opponents and distracting the public beyond the old opiates of the masses (Elections used to bring us solutions. The next one won’t, Journal, 4 November), but it seems he has been blindsided too. He says this election will be fought primarily around the issues of Brexit, austerity and Scottish independence, or a combination thereof. Nowhere in the piece is there a single mention of the role of the climate emergency, despite a poll just last week flagging that this was very much in the minds of the British public (Climate crisis: Emergency ‘to influence how people vote’, 30 October). With more than half of people in the UK saying that the climate crisis will influence how they vote, rising to nearly three-quarters in the under-25s, it seems to me that this great issue of our time may, in fact, play a key role in deciding who next gets to sit in No 10 – and so it should.Bill McGuireProfessor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards, University College London • Marina Hyde derides the “dangerous simplification” of others (Three leaders for ‘the people’ and against ‘the elite’. Oh dear, Journal, 2 November) but indulges in an equally dangerous simplification of her own, suggesting Labour’s “populism” is a mirror image of Tory and Brexit rhetoric. This kind of equivalence-mongering doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Most of the millions who vote Labour on 12 December will not be party members, supporters of Momentum, or Corbynistas; they will not have attended any rallies or meetings, or even watched the TV debates. They will be voting Labour because its policies – unsurprisingly for a democratic country’s main left-of-centre party – promise greater economic and social benefits to more people (and especially to the less wealthy) than those of its opponents. To call this “populism”, in the sense that Johnson and Farage are populist, is playing games with language.Jon GriffithHastings, East Sussex • Marina Hyde fails to separate the two “elites”: (1) The financial elite (the people who are perceived to have the major influence over the country’s capital) – these are the target for the left; (2) The intellectual elite (the people who are perceived to have the major influence over the country’s thought) – these are the target for the right. A separation of these two “elites” in political discourse is long overdue.Tony HinkinsFrodsham, Cheshire • There can be no fair democratic society without women’s equality central to it. The one factor that should make a difference to the vote is where each party stands on policies for gender equality and women’s empowerment, but your article omits this as a factor in predicting the election result (Confusing factors: An unpredictable race for No 10 has crucial hurdles for the whole field, 31 October). In 2010 the Conservatives abolished the Women’s National Commission (WNC), in breach of the UK’s international obligations under the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), leaving UK women with no institutional mechanism to represent us. We women and girls have suffered most from the Tory austerity cuts, and female MPs face brutal abuse. We are more than 50% of the population, and we will vote for the party that most supports women’s human rights and will restore the WNC, or its substitute, as required by international laws. We are ashamed, as we embark on the review of implementation of the BPfA 25 years after its adoption, that the UK is showing such indifference to this groundbreaking UN document to give women their human rights. The party that will support us women will have my vote.Margaret OwenDirector, Widows for Peace through Democracy • When it comes to voting intentions, forget about Workington Man who threatens to forgo the Labour party and vote for a rightwing Tory who will destroy the remains of his life. Since the last election there have been three and half years of young people entering the voting register. They will be the deciding factor in this election. They are more aware of the environment and the effect on their future. Look out for a lot of surprises.David WatsonNutley, East Sussex"
"The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has refused to accept an environmental award, saying the climate movement needed people in power to start to “listen” to “science” and not awards. The young climate activist, who has rallied millions to her “Fridays for Future” movement, was honoured at a Stockholm ceremony held by the Nordic Council, a regional body for inter-parliamentary cooperation.  She had been nominated for her efforts by both Sweden and Norway and won the organisation’s annual environment prize. But after it was announced, a representative for Thunberg told the audience that she would not accept the award or the prize sum of 350,000 Danish kroner (about $52,000 or €46,800), the TT news agency reported. She addressed the decision in a post on Instagram from the United States. “The climate movement does not need any more awards,” she wrote. “What we need is for our politicians and the people in power start to listen to the current, best available science.” While thanking the Nordic Council for the “huge honour”, she also criticised Nordic countries for not living up to their “great reputation” on climate issues. “There is no lack of bragging about this. There is no lack of beautiful words. But when it comes to our actual emissions and our ecological footprints per capita … then it’s a whole other story,” Thunberg said. Still only 16 years old, Thunberg rose to prominence after she started spending her Fridays outside Sweden’s parliament in August 2018, holding a sign reading “School strike for climate”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow we know what this is really all about: scaring the public into “rigorous climate policies”.
In my last post I mentioned that the English language Spiegel here has a comprehensive piece on the IPCC’s ideological struggle on whether or not to include the 15-year warming hiatus in the AR5 Summary Report.
Spiegel quotes Mike Hulme who says that the German delegation is “certainly more in the direction of ‘alarmist’” and thus are insisting that the warming hiatus not be mentioned. Why not? Spiegel tells us why (my emphasis):
German Green Party politician Hermann Ott, on the other hand, is satisfied with Germany’s conduct in the negotiations. Since Helmut Kohl’s government, Ott says, there has generally been consensus on the significance of climate protection, making it possible for “a great deal of continuity and a high level of expertise” to develop within Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment.
Despite resistance from many researchers, the German ministries insist that it is important not to detract from the effectiveness of climate change warnings by discussing the past 15 years’ lack of global warming. Doing so, they say, would result in a loss of the support necessary for pursuing rigorous climate policies. “Climate policy needs the element of fear,” Ott openly admits. “Otherwise, no politician would take on this topic.”
Unbelievable. Ott is saying that the German government and its Ministry of Environment, where his good friend Jochen Flasbarth is a director, needs a report that scares the public! We appreciate the honesty.
Also, someone needs to remind Hermann Ott that there hasn’t been any warming since Helmut Kohl’s government ended in 1998 – completely contradicting the models. In fact, there hasn’t been much warming since the IPCC’s second report from 1995!

"It’s hard to avoid stress, and the expectation that we are camels with unbreakable backs. I know this from personal experience as part of the “squeezed generation” with young children, an old parent and a demanding job. Often I joke to my kids that they are making my hair go grey to which they respond: “It’s better than going bald.” These two signs of ageing are also linked to stress. Human psychologists are lucky: they get to ask people what makes their hair go grey or fall out. Progress can be more difficult for people like me, who work on assessing the psychological well being of animals, as we cannot directly ask a dog or a parrot how they feel. But our knowledge of stress in humans is increasingly being deployed in the animal world. Studies on humans reveal that stress ages us more rapidly than time alone. As we age, the end portions of our chromosomes called “telomeres” get progressively shorter. The main function of these telomeres is to protect the coding sections of our genes from unravelling, just like the plastic ends on shoelaces. If telomeres become too short, chromosomes unravel and stop working, with dire health consequences. Studies have shown that negative life events such as violence, divorce or death of a close friend can increase the speed of telomere shortening, or attrition. When we see someone who looks old for their age we often remark, “they must have had a hard life”. In fact, what we are saying is that their biological age is much older than their chronological age. Animals that have had a “hard life” also suffer from accelerated telomere shortening. For example, social species of parrots kept as pets without members of their own species have shorter telomeres, as do bird chicks raised in a nest where they are the smallest individual and so have to compete harder for food. A hard life leaves scars on your entire genetic makeup, and this same process can reveal important information about an animal’s well being. Can anything be done about the premature ageing effects of stress? Even animal welfare scientists want to find the fountain of youth. One naïve solution would be to try and rear captive animals in a stress-free environment. But this won’t work. Just as moderate levels of stress give us humans the incentive to do things, so an animal that doesn’t experience any stress won’t have any incentive to behave naturally. Eventually a captive animal will be exposed to stress, with catastrophic consequences for its welfare.  Some say that providing captive animals with a stimulating environment in order to express their natural behaviour actually works because it gives them small, constant doses of stress. The real world, after all, is nicer than a plain concrete cage, but is hardly stress-free. It’s not clear, though, whether this stimulation could slow down telomere shortening. Healthy lifestyles can help. One study on human women found regular exercise, a good diet and stress-relieving activities such as meditation meant major negative life events led to less telomere shortening. It may even be the case that a healthy lifestyle increases telomere length. Thus, the lesson for animal welfare is that a little stress often may be good for you because it prepares you for highly stressful events. How humans respond to stressful events is determined partially by nurture (the environment) and partially by nature (our genes). Animal welfare scientists have long looked at the environment of animals as a means to improve their well being, but these human findings suggest we should look at genes as well. It should be possible to test whether animals with certain gene combinations are more prone to stress or not. This information could then be used to change how we look after animals or in the case of some species guide our selective breeding programmes. But there are many other areas where our animal knowledge lags far behind. I am particularly interested in sleep and animal welfare, for instance. When we go to the doctor feeling ill, we are almost invariably asked if we are sleeping well. Disrupted sleeping patterns are a good indication of stress in humans, but we don’t know much about how this affects other animals. At least not yet – I have a PhD student looking into it. Human well being is a complex subject determined not just by suffering, but also by positive experiences. Likewise, animal welfare is about the lifetime experiences of an animal. And me? At least going bald would solve the problem of my grey hair."
"Despite extensive media coverage, campaigns and scientists’ warnings, still the world is not fully aware of what coral bleaching is and why it is happening. Mention bleaching and some think that it is the death of the Great Barrier Reef’s coral, but the problem is much more widespread. “Bleaching” is when corals lose the highly productive algae (termed zooxanthellae) from their tissues due to stress from high sea temperatures and solar irradiation. The algae and coral have a symbiotic relationship: the algae remove the coral’s waste products while the coral gives the algae a safe environment to live in, and provides compounds for photosynthesis. Without the algae, the coral no longer has a sufficient source of food, meaning that it essentially starves to death. Due to its iconic status and numerous nearby scientific institutes, the Great Barrier Reef often receives the most attention when it comes to coral bleaching. But there are many other reefs across the globe that are experiencing the same problem. These reef provinces encompass undeveloped, remote and unpopulated areas, where, unlike near the Great Barrier Reef, monitoring and research is either non-existent, scarce or sporadic.  The Chagos Archipelago is a British overseas territory located in the middle of the Indian Ocean, consisting of 55 islands distributed across six atolls, and covering an area the size of France. It certainly fulfils the remote criterion: the Maldives are the next island group, 300 miles to the north, and it is more than 900 miles to the more substantial landmass of the Indian subcontinent. In total, the reefs and shallow banks cover some 60,000km² – nearly three times the size of Wales. For the past decade, we have been carrying out research in the Chagos Archipelago. What we have found is that although reefs vary in condition across the large archipelago, most were vibrant during earlier surveys and managed to rebound from the first major bleaching event in 1997/98 – when around 16% of the world’s coral was killed, and only about 10% of living coral was left to some 30m depth.  After the 2015 global bleaching event occurred, we knew that the Chagos Archipelago had been affected, but it was only during our 2016 survey that we found the bleaching had been as bad as it was in 1997/98. We were struck by the stark increase in dead coral, mostly the branching Acropora which form wide table-like structures, similar to a canopy, over large portions of the reef. We found that on reefs dominated by this coral type, more than 50% of the live coral which was present in 2015 has died in shallow areas. What is most alarming is that these surveys took place immediately before the 2016 bleaching event began in earnest, and went on to surpass 2015 in severity. The true condition of the reefs within the Chagos Archipelago at present is unknown, as we haven’t yet been able to revisit the study sites. We also don’t know when, or if, a 2017 bleaching event will occur on the Chagos Archipelago. But based on global sea temperature patterns so far, and early indications of bleaching starting on the Great Barrier Reef – which usually precedes events in the Indian Ocean – a 2017 event could begin in a matter of weeks. This could very well be the start of a new era for the coral reefs of the Indian Ocean and beyond. Of course, bleaching itself is not a new phenomenon, having been first recorded in 1911 in the Florida Keys, and is likely to have occurred, certainly at local scales, throughout the last several millennia of global reef growth. What is completely new, however, is this frequency of bleaching events: if a 2017 event materialises it will be part of an unprecedented “hat-trick” of yearly back-to-back mass coral bleachings. Corals may recover from mild and infrequent bleaching events, but will die from severe and repeated loss of their algal symbionts. Scientists warned in 1999 that if global warming patterns continued, reefs in the Indian Ocean could start to bleach every five to 10 years by 2010. Unfortunately, it appears these predictions have been met and may even be surpassed in the next decade. There is no easy way to stop coral bleaching. A frequent suggestion is to focus on removing localised impacts and stressors such as over-fishing and excess nutrient inputs from agriculture. However, the Chagos islands are already devoid of these pressures, and yet appear to be equally susceptible to the effects of global warming as more populated reef areas.  Though we don’t know if these reefs can bounce back from bleaching, based on the previous pattern following the 1998 global bleaching event – where up to 90% of corals died in some parts of the Chagos Archipelago – the reefs could take a decade or more to recover. But if these yearly repeat bleachings carry on, it could be like pressing the reset button on each trajectory of recovery just as it gets underway. Nonetheless, it could be argued that if anywhere has a chance of recovery the Chagos Archipelago does, and by continuing to research this location we may learn more about what factors promote and drive reef recovery in the process."
"Green politics is associated with the left these days, but that doesn’t rule out an eco-friendly turn at the opposite end of the spectrum. After all, nationalist worries over finite resources and talk of “threats to tradition” have been echoed throughout the history of the green movement. So, is a far right environmentalism possible? And if so, given climate change is hugely disruptive for any form of traditional nationalist idyll, how long before far right groups join the likes of Greenpeace on the frontlines? Modern forms of green activism emerged in the 1960s in a context of threats like acid rain or increasing pesticide use which transcended national boundaries. The EU in the early 1970s also began to grapple with environmental problems that could no longer be effectively managed by individual states. This form of green activism thus showed that the nation state had failed to protect citizens against environmental problems. As such, it drew upon an older tradition that in the 1800s reacted against the perceived attacks on humanity and nature by capitalist interests by calling for a return to the land.  This could give early environmentalism a left-wing flavour, as in the Winter Hill trespass of 1896 when thousands of people in Bolton reclaimed an ancient right of way through private land. But the disruption that modernisation brings also produced a range of responses that could be termed “green nationalism”. The far right respond to threats they perceive to custom, culture, identity and locales posed by cosmopolitan elites. They usually have settler value systems that express pessimism and victimhood, emphasise threats rather than opportunities and see conspiracies as explanations for the degradation of their personal and group life-chances and local environment.  This leads to a green nationalism of defensive parochialism in which degradation of local features are opposed because they negatively affect customs – such as tending allotments, or the retention of the village green – threaten the familiar locale, and represent the effects of distrusted outsiders.  How this plays out in practice seems to depend upon which outsiders they distrust. In the US there are Tea Party environmentalists who have been mobilised, for instance, by the impact of polluting energy companies. However, a tradition of blaming government not business, along with diversionary nationalist propaganda (Drill here! Drill now!) funded by wealthy oil barons, has meant these same activists are often vehement opponents of better environmental regulation. In contrast, far right groups in Britain seem simply to ignore the environmental threats posed by extreme energy extraction such as fracking. The landscape is a key element in national identity throughout the world. A defence of that landscape against perceived threats can so become an environmentalism focused on preserving the distinctive characteristics of a nation’s land, from the rolling green fields of England to the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland.  This has often been accompanied by other ways of reasserting identity. Myths of a pagan past in harmony with nature have been a feature of green nationalism, from its beginnings through to the Anastasia ecovillages in contemporary Russia where, unlike their equivalent hippy communes found in the West, sustainable living is combined with a “reactionary eco-nationalism”. Such myths give identity and meaning to some groups attracted to the far right, such as the skinhead movement that emerged in Britain in the 1960s, while also providing imagined alternatives to the drudgery associated with modern capitalism or the compromises of democracy. The other aspect of the green movement that is appropriated by the far right is the concern about the depletion of key resources by unchecked usage. At its most cynical, this can be a far right equivalent of business “greenwashing”. However, it also reflects a tendency to see economics and society as a zero-sum game in which every gain for others is a loss for the victimised groups they see themselves as. Concerns about finite resources therefore align with anxieties about immigration. Far right groups and their media supporters are swift to exploit fears of threats to the local animals allegedly posed by immigrants. Such baseless hostility is then compounded by the widespread and equally erroneous view that England’s green and pleasant land has already largely disappeared under concrete. Green causes are not usually the main motivating factor for those attracted to the far right. This does not mean, however, that their espousal is mere greenwashing.  The far right tends to think of green issues differently from their left-wing counterparts. Their approach focuses on the local, not the global, and reflects the centrality of landscape to national identities. Their defensive parochialism means that these threats are usually seen in cultural terms through the appropriation of victimhood, hence the tendency to focus upon immigration as opposed to the emphases of left-wing environmentalists.  Green issues tend to be seen by the far right through the distinct lenses of cultural identity and the land. That does not necessarily prevent, however, the emergence of a green nationalism."
"Scientists have just discovered massive amounts of a rare metal called tellurium, a key element in cutting-edge solar technology. As a solar expert who specialises in exactly this, I should be delighted. But here’s the catch: the deposit is found at the bottom of the sea, in an undisturbed part of the ocean.  People often have an idealised view of solar as the perfect clean energy source. Direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, no emissions, no oil spills or contamination, perfectly clean. This however overlooks the messy reality of how solar panels are produced. While the energy produced is indeed clean, some of the materials required to generate that power are toxic or rare. In the case of one particular technology, cadmium telluride-based solar cells, the cadmium is toxic and the telluride is hard to find. Cadmium telluride is one of the second generation “thin-film” solar cell technologies. It’s far better at absorbing light than silicon, on which most solar power is currently based, and as a result its absorbing layer doesn’t need to be as thick. A layer of cadmium telluride just one thousandth of a millimetre thick will absorb around 90% of the light that hits it. It’s cheap and quick to set up, compared to silicon, and uses less material. As a result, it’s the first thin-film technology to effectively make the leap from the research laboratory to mass production. Cadmium telluride solar modules now account for around 5% of global installations and, depending on how you do the sums, can produce lower cost power than silicon solar. But cadmium telluride’s Achilles heel is the tellurium itself, one of the rarest metals in the Earth’s crust. Serious questions must be asked about whether technology based on such a rare metal is worth pursuing on a massive scale.  There has always been a divide in opinion about this. The abundancy data for tellurium suggests a real issue, but the counter argument is that no-one has been actively looking for new reserves of the material. After all, platinum and gold are similarly rare but demand for jewellery and catalytic converters (the primary use of platinum) means in practice we are able to find plenty.  The discovery of a massive new tellurium deposit in an underwater mountain in the Atlantic Ocean certainly supports the “it will turn up eventually” theory. And this is a particularly rich ore, according to the British scientists involved in the MarineE-Tech project which found it. While most tellurium is extracted as a by-product of copper mining and so is relatively low yield, their seabed samples contain concentrations 50,000 times higher than on land. Extracting any of this will be formidably hard and very risky for the environment. The top of the mountain where the tellurium has been discovered is still a kilometre below the waves, and the nearest land is hundreds of miles away. Even on dry land, mining is never a good thing for the environment. It can uproot communities, decimate forests and leave huge scars on the landscape. It often leads to groundwater contamination, despite whatever safeguards are put in place.  And on the seabed? Given the technical challenges and the pristine ecosystems involved, I think most people can intuitively guess at the type of devastation that deep-sea mining could cause. No wonder it has yet to be implemented anywhere yet, despite plans off the coast of Papua New Guinea and elsewhere. Indeed, there’s no suggestion that tellurium mining is liable to occur at this latest site any time soon. However the mere presence of such resources, or the wind turbines or electric car batteries that rely on scarce materials or risky industrial processes, raises an interesting question. These are useful low-carbon technologies, but do they also have a requirement to be environmentally ethical?  There is often the perception that everyone working in renewable energy is a lovely tree-hugging, sandal-wearing leftie, but this isn’t the case. After all, this is now a huge industry, one that is aiming to eventually supplant fossil fuels, and there are valid concerns over whether such expansion will be accompanied by a softening of regulations. We know that solar power is ultimately a good thing, but do the ends always justify the means? Or, to put it more starkly: could we tolerate mass production of solar panels if it necessitated mining and drilling on a similar scale to the fossil fuels industry, along with the associated pitfalls?  To my mind the answer is undoubtedly yes, we have little choice. After all, mass solar would still wipe out our carbon emissions, helping curb global warming and the associated apocalypse.  What’s reassuring is that, even as solar becomes a truly mature industry, it has started from a more noble and environmentally sound place. Cadmium telluride modules for example include a cost to cover recycling, while scarce resources such as tellurium can be recovered from panels at the end of their 20-year or more lifespan (compare this with fossil fuels, where the materials that produce the power are irreparably lost in a bright flame and a cloud of carbon).  The impact of mining for solar panels will likely be minimal in comparison to the oil or coal industries, but it will not be zero. As renewable technology becomes more crucial, we perhaps need to start calibrating our expectations to account for this. At some point mining operations in search of solar or wind materials will cause damage or else some industrial production process will go awry and cause contamination. This may be the Faustian pact we have to accept, as the established alternatives are far worse. Unfortunately nothing is perfect."
"Britain was once full of elm trees. But the introduction of a microscopic fungus in the 20th century changed all of that. Over the course of two epidemics, 60m elms were lost, landscapes were irreversible changed and ecosystems altered forever.   Since then, UK forests have faced an onslaught of new invasions. These include Phytophthora ramorum, a “fungus-like” organism which attacks a number of trees including larch and some species of oak, and ash dieback, a disease first discovered in the UK in 2012 which caused such alarm that the government convened Cobra, an emergency response committee usually reserved for terrorist threats and other such national emergencies. As international trade and travel continues to increase, more plants are being shipped around the world, and more pests and diseases are showing up in unexpected places. This is a global issue, affecting agricultural crops and natural environments everywhere. Citrus industries in the US and Brazil have suffered from a spate of exotic diseases originating from South-East Asia; in Florida “citrus canker” arrived in 1995 and US$1 billion was spent trying to eradicate it. In 2005 the towel was thrown in on the eradication program and that same year a far more devastating disease, “citrus greening”, arrived and subsequently spread throughout the state.   Bananas across the world are threatened by a strain of “Panama disease”. Wheat has been hit by a new virulent form of stem rust disease that was first discovered in Uganda in 1999, and has since spread across Africa and the Middle East.  There are many more such examples but the latest threat to Europe may be the scariest yet: a bacteria known as Xylella fastidiosa. It’s thought to have arrived accidentally on coffee plants from Costa Rica. Xylella is spread by sap-feeding insects such as spittlebugs and invades a plant’s water distribution system, preventing essential water and nutrients from being transported around the plant. But here’s the really worrying part. Whereas many plant diseases are capable of infecting only a small number of host species, Xylella has a vast list of potential hosts plants, depending on the particular sub-species of the pathogen, such as oaks, citrus and olive trees. The EC’s emergency measures, 
including the removal of olive trees and other hosts, have caused public uproar and protests in the affected areas. There is some light among all this doom and gloom, however.  Advances in our ability to collect data on plant diseases, and then map them out, offers up the potential to harness spatial mapping technologies and computer modelling against these invading threats.   Unlike other types of invasive species (think Japanese knotweed, say, or rats on remote islands), plant diseases are incredibly good at evading detection. These microscopic organisms can inhabit plants for weeks, months or even years before even the first signs of the visual symptoms we need to spot them. To try and second guess where new epidemics might pop up, people are increasingly developing maps of disease risk. For example, the US Department of Agriculture combines a range of risk factors associated with different diseases. These can be meteorological drivers such as wind and rainfall, or socio-economic factors such as how connected residents in a particular community are to areas where a disease is already found. These maps can then be used to identify potential hotspots where surveillance efforts can be targeted and any new disease quickly stamped out. As spittlebugs can carry Xylella and thus demonstrate a local tree must be infected, researchers in Italy have combined these “spy insects” and real-time data from smartphones in the field to try and detect the disease even before the plants show any symptoms.  Similar smartphone tech has been adopted in the UK project “Opal”, for instance, which has a tree health survey app that enables members of the public to identify different diseases and report them. All this information and new opportunities to detect and map outbreaks provides vital instant data on how diseases are spreading. Plants don’t tell anyone when they get sick, so we have to actively search for new cases which is hard work. Better targeting of surveillance programs is incredibly important to find new epidemics and remove them before they get out of control. Together with Rothamsted Research and the US Department of Agriculture, colleagues and I at Salford are using spatial information on epidemics to help inform smart surveillance strategies. Researchers at Cambridge University have also developed state of the art computer models of invading diseases such as ash dieback and sudden oak death. This sort of work can predict in real-time where epidemics will develop and spread, and quickly identify areas of high risk. Plant disease epidemics represent a growing and important threat to agricultural economies, food security and natural environments. It’s clear that, with the world becoming a smaller place, opportunities for plant diseases to move around the globe are only going to increase. New ways of detecting and mapping plant disease are sorely needed from the scientific community to help combat these global emergencies."
"Jacinda Ardern’s landmark climate legislation has passed in New Zealand parliament, with historic cross-party support, committing the nation to reduce its carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and meet its commitments under the Paris climate accords. The climate change response (zero carbon) amendment bill passed on Thursday afternoon with the centre-right opposition National party throwing their support behind it late in the day, despite none of their proposed amendments being accepted. The bill passed 119 votes to one. We’ve led the world before in nuclear disarmament and in votes for women, now we are leading again. Climate change minister James Shaw said the bill, which commits New Zealand to keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees, provided a framework for the island country of nearly 5 million to adapt too, and prepare for the climate emergency. “We’ve led the world before in nuclear disarmament and in votes for women, now we are leading again.” Shaw said. “Climate change is the defining long-term issue of our generation that successive governments have failed to address. Today we take a significant step forward in our plan to reduce New Zealand’s emissions.” Prime minister Jacinda Ardern told MPs New Zealand was on the “right side of history”. She said: “I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time. “Undeniably, our sea levels are rising, and undeniably, we are experiencing extreme weather events – increasingly so. “Undeniably, the science tells us the impact there will be on flora and fauna, and yes also the spread of diseases in areas where we haven’t previously seen them.” The bill will enshrine a new 2050 greenhouse gas reduction target into law and require that future governments have plans to meet the target. It will also establish a climate change commission and ensure future government’s plan and budget for adaption and mitigation. The reduction target will have two seperate plans. One for biogenic methane, or that which is produced by living organisms, and another for all other greenhouse gases. The legislation has been applauded by environment groups around the globe, who said New Zealand was leading the world in its pragmatic and levelled approach to climate change. Forest & Bird chief executive Kevin Hague said the bill was only a first step. “Now we need to see a path to carbon neutrality that has protecting and restoring nature at its heart.” “The bill is only a first step on climate change. We need concrete, urgent, climate action to save our most vulnerable native species and restore native ecosystems.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language Spiegel magazine has lengthy piece on the crumbling climate science consensus. Yes folks, soon we’ll be hearing that 97% of all climate scientists say there is no consensus.
This Spiegel piece is tantamount to yet another cruise missile direct hit on alarmist climate science. The alarmist climate science bunker appears to have finally been breached. Now even IPCC scientists are abandoning ship.
The AR5 has not even yet been released and already it’s facing Cat 5 hurricane headwinds from major global media outlets. Keep in mind that Spiegel used to be as warmist as they came. Now they are as non-consensus as they come.
Warming Plateau? Climatologists Face Inconvenient Truth
Data shows global temperatures aren’t rising the way climate scientists have predicted. Now the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change faces a problem: publicize these findings and encourage skeptics — or hush up the figures.
For a quarter of a century now, environmental activists have been issuing predictions in the vein of the Catholic Church, warning people of the coming greenhouse effect armageddon. Environmentalists bleakly predict global warming will usher in plagues of biblical dimensions — perpetual droughts, deluge-like floods and hurricanes of unprecedented force.

"The government has halted fracking in England with immediate effect in a watershed moment for environmentalists and community activists. Ministers also warned shale gas companies it would not support future fracking projects, in a crushing blow to companies that had been hoping to capitalise on one of the new frontiers of growth in the fossil fuel industry. The decision draws a line under years of bitter opposition to the controversial extraction process in a major victory for green groups and local communities. The decision was taken after a new scientific study warned it was not possible to rule out “unacceptable” consequences for those living near fracking sites. The report, undertaken by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), also warned it was not possible to predict the magnitude of earthquakes fracking might trigger. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The government said it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that proves fracking could be safe. The UK’s only active fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire was brought to an immediate halt this summer after fracking triggered multiple earth tremors that breached the government’s earthquake limits. Andrea Leadsom, the business and energy secretary, said the government has always been clear that shale gas exploration in the UK must be carried out safely. “After reviewing the OGA’s report into recent seismic activity at Preston New Road, it is clear that we cannot rule out future unacceptable impacts on the local community. For this reason, I have concluded that we should put a moratorium on fracking in England with immediate effect,” she said. The moratorium marks a major U-turn for the Conservative party and the prime minister Boris Johnson, who once referred to fracking as “glorious news for humanity” and urged the UK to “leave no stone unturned, or unfracked” in pursuit of shale gas. The government ended its support for the struggling industry less than a week after a damning report from Whitehall’s spending watchdog found its plans to establish fracking across the UK was dragging years behind schedule and had cost the taxpayer at least £32m so far without producing any energy in return. Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said it has “been clear for some time that the government’s big bet on fracking is bust”. The decision has been welcomed as a “victory for common sense” by green groups and campaigners who have fought for almost a decade against the controversial fossil fuel extraction process. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said: “This moratorium is a tremendous victory for communities and the climate. For nearly a decade local people across the country have fought a David and Goliath battle against this powerful industry. We are proud to have been part of that fight.” Tom Fyans, from CPRE, said the countryside charity would “celebrate alongside the local communities, campaigners and environmentalists who have been campaigning valiantly to stop fracking for many years”. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface. The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled. In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests, legal challenges and planning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government's fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking. “This is a fantastic win for local democracy and everyone who cares about protecting the countryside from climate catastrophe and mass industrialisation,” he said. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, the shadow business and energy secretary, said the moratorium was a victory for local people and the government owed them an apology. She said: “When the Tory government overruled local democratic decisions to halt fracking, communities did not give up. When fracking protesters went to jail, communities did not give up. And now they have forced the government to U-turn. “The Tories owe the public an apology, and an explanation of how much public money they wasted while ignoring the science.” Long-Bailey said the government could yet allow fracking to restart. “The next Labour government will ban fracking – whereas the Tories will only call a temporary halt to it. You can’t trust a word the prime minister says.” The government revealed its fracking moratium alongside plans for a major review of the UK’s transition to a green economy. The Treasury said it will assess how the UK can make the most of the economic green shoots which are expected to emerge while moving towards a carbon neutral economy by 2050. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said the review was a vital next step” in delivering the government’s 2050 climate target while “supporting growth and lancing costs” to avoid “placing unfair burdens on families or businesses”. “We must all play a part in protecting the planet for future generations,” he added. The Treasury’s support for a green economy comes after Downing Street shot down claims made by the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, that tackling the climate crisis would cost £1tn and require spending cuts for schools, hospitals and the police force. In a swift rebuke, No 10 said plans to create a net zero-carbon economy would cost no more than the UK’s existing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The interim report will be published in the spring, ahead of a final report in the autumn before the global UN climate talks, which will take place in Glasgow. Simon Clarke, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said it was “humbling to launch this unprecedented review into how we end the UK’s contribution to climate change”. “Until recently people said that ‘Net Zero’ was impossible, but this work is a giant step towards making it happen, enabling us to set out a roadmap for an economy that is cleaner, more efficient, and works for everyone, while preserving our planet,” he said. • This article was corrected on 2 November 2019 to make clear that the government has halted, but not banned fracking as stated in an earlier version, and that the moratorium applies only to England as it is a devolved issue. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already have measures in place against fracking."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt yesterday’s online Spiegel, science journalist Axel Bojanowski reported on a discussion with ultra-alarmist, former NASA GISS director James Hansen.

Hansen believes that nuclear energy is the only way of effectively preventing global warming from fossil fuel greenhouse gases. He called the policy of scaling back nuclear power “a big mistake” and claimed that “environmental groups for fear of losing funding would prevent a successful fight against climate change by following a false energy policy”.
That “false energy policy” Hansen’s here refers to is the attempt to satisfy the world’s energy needs almost exclusively with renewable energy, mainly intermittent sun and wind. Hansen and some of his fellow scientists call that narrow approach unrealistic.
Spiegel quotes Hansen further on funding:
There are various funders who would stop their support of environmental organizations if they came out calling for nuclear power.”
Hansen is increasingly at odds with environmentalists:

The environmental organizations are against nuclear power even though only an increase in the use of the power is able to put the brakes on climate change.”
Hansen says that renewable energies will not be able to supply the world’s demand for energy and that they are “too expensive“. Spiegel quotes Hansen:
There is no realistic way to stabilize the climate where nuclear power is not a substantial part of it.”
Moreover, Hansen and three other leading scientists published an open letter last November calling for “the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems” and that the risks nuclear power” are orders of magnitude smaller than the risks associated with fossil fuels.”
Environmental groups, not surprisingly, have reacted harshly to Hansen’s remarks, calling Hansen’s funding claims “absurd” and that his energy arguments are “unsubstantiated. and that nuclear power has major safety issues.”
But Hansen counters, saying that “today’s generation of nuclear plants are considerably safer than older models“.
Environmentalists have put themselves in a catch 22 situation. By overblowing the consequences of fossil fuels, they have only succeeded in strengthening the arguments for a source of power they regard as being just as evil.

"The UK high court has ordered the government to publish its air quality plan by May 9. The move comes after the government was criticised for its last-minute attemps to delay the plan until after the general election on June 8, due to “purdah” rules which limit announcements during the election period. The court had previously ordered the government to urgently revise its strategy for dealing with air pollution, after legally-binding EU limits of toxic pollutants were breached in towns and cities across Britain.  In November 2016, the court ruled an earlier version of the plan was illegally poor, and it had failed to bring levels of nitrogen dioxide (known as NO₂) down to legal limits in “the shortest possible time”.  The latest ruling means the revised plan must be published by May 9, with the final policy published on the original deadline of July 31. The government now has the option of going to the court of appeal, and by the time any appeal is heard it would likely be beyond the election anyway. The problem is too urgent for such legal holdups. Each year there are around 40,000 deaths due to outdoor air pollution, and the UK has the second highest mortality rate in Europe associated with NO₂ emissions. In busy city centres, the mortality rates are higher. So what can be done about it? In cities, emissions from road transport are the biggest source of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particles known as particulate matter (PM). To tackle the problem a range of new measures are needed, some of which would be unpopular with many motorists (voters). Proposals would likely include higher rates of tax for the dirtiest cars and trucks, as well as clean air zones such as the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) in London. The ULEZ, which is due to come into force in 2019, will involve a £12.50 charge (in addition to the current congestion charge of £11.50) for the most polluting passenger vehicles. Of course, these higher charges will devalue the very diesel vehicles which had been promoted by previous governments. To help, the government has been considering a scrappage scheme (based on a similar scheme in France), where diesel owners would be offered incentives to trade their vehicles for less polluting models. Diesel vehicles were promoted throughout Europe in the 1990s as they are more efficient than petrol cars in terms of CO2 emissions, and thus emit fewer greenhouse gases. However, diesel vehicles emit higher levels of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, the emissions that affect human health. It’s true that diesel vehicles are now much cleaner than they were in 1992, when the first round of European emissions legislation (EURO I) came into force. The regulated level of harmful particulate emissions has reduced by about 97% in that time, with similar trends for NOx. Diesel engines still emit more NOx than petrol engines, and there are increasing numbers of diesels on British roads. Car makers have already implemented many of the most obvious and cost-effective measures such as diesel particulate filters. This means that that further reductions of diesel emissions are likely to be more gradual. This year to date more than 98% of new vehicles registered in the UK still have an internal combustion engine –  running on diesel or petrol fuels. While these newer vehicles are less polluting than older models, there are no safe levels for toxic pollutants such as airborne particulate matter. Fully electric vehicles will take time to catch on, just as the required charging infrastructure will take time to mature. Part of the problem is that drivers are anxious about the range of electric vehicles, which is typically around 100 miles. They needn’t be, in London 66% of car journeys are under 5km. Encouraging the uptake of electric vehicles in cities needs a widely available public network of charging points.  But, while the technology and infrastructure is improving, we don’t have time to wait for electric cars. The air quality problem needs immediate solutions. To clean up the air the government’s plan will need to include higher taxes on the dirtiest of vehicles, and low-emissions zones in most cities. This article was updated on April 28 to include the latest high court ruling."

Back in May we had extensive discussion about the unusually cold spring conditions, which broke some longstanding records in Fairbanks – including the latest date with daily mean temperature below freezing (May 18). With the early arrival of freezing conditions this month, it should be no surprise that the length of the continuous summer thaw season was the shortest on record in Fairbanks…

"As June draws to a close it’s time for what is surely now a Great British tradition, as 135,000 music fans pack their tents and wellies for the iconic Glastonbury Festival. Hailed by many as a spiritual gathering, as well a musical event, Glastonbury gives off an air of being at one with nature – but just how ecologically friendly can such a large-scale festival be? To answer this question, at least in part, Andrea Collins and I looked into the usefulness of ecological footprinting in managing the environmental impacts of large events. The ecological footprint of an activity is the land area required both to provide its resources and absorb its emissions in the long run. As a species we have exactly one planet’s worth of land available, so we need our global ecological footprint to be less than or equal to one planet’s worth of land. Unfortunately we have already overshot that target and, as it stands, we are all living on borrowed resources. Our research found that a three-day trip to the annual literary and arts festival at Hay-on-Wye, near the English border in mid Wales, had an ecological footprint 86% greater than the average three days spent at home. Of this, 33% was accounted for by accommodation and 61% by transport to the festival (91% of which was by private car).  The organisers of Hay Festival are working hard to encourage their clientele to travel more sustainably, however. We found that 15% of the total footprint could be cut if everybody shared a car with at least three other people; 28% would be cut if all festival-goers were to travel by coach and 21% of the total ecological impact would be cut if the very small proportion (2%) of visitors who travelled by aircraft didn’t come at all.  The UK in particular has far too large an ecological footprint anyway. If the rest of the world emulated the same lifestyle as the British Isles, our species would need 2.6 Earth-like planets to support the human race. Getting resource use down to a “one-planet living” level is going to take enormous efforts both in terms of technological progress and lifestyle change. Obviously this goes way beyond festivals – it is surely the biggest challenge to face the UK in the coming century – and the stakes are high, with the survival of our entire species depending on it. But these facts should not dampen the mood any more than rain does at Glastonbury (which, for the uninitiated, it doesn’t). To begin with, Glastonbury likely achieves a lower impact per head than the Hay festival, due to the larger proportion of people using public transport to get there (though that proportion could still improve) and the fact that everybody camps on site.  Camping will certainly have a lower ecological footprint than indoor accommodation, so long as the tents are reused rather than abandoned. After all, the manufacture of goods is one of the biggest ecological impacts our society has – and there is huge potential for reducing it if we only buy goods we need and don’t waste the ones we have. Leaving perfectly good tents behind  after the festival is a deplorably wasteful trend of recent years and one that the festival is trying to stop. More fundamentally though, asking how we can minimise our impact on the world will only ever reveal part of the picture, as it fails to ask what we’re aiming to achieve with our existence in the first place. If we want to view the future with any optimism at all, a better question to ask is: which choices can offer us the best lifestyle per unit of resources consumed? There is some interesting research on this, including the NEF’s Happy Planet Index. That particular league table is topped by Costa Rica which combines high life expectancy with a strong measure of reported well-being and a low ecological footprint. Glastonbury in particular has one major redeeming factor here: unlike most mainstream festivals, Glastonbury has a 60-acre Green Fields area, filled with everything from bicycle-powered smoothies to solar-powered soundsystems, promoting a wide variety of organisations focused on sustainability and hosting plenty of talks and debates. Other event organisers have implemented their own green policies, encouraging revellers to take more steps to be eco-friendly, but more can still be done. Several events – albeit on a smaller scale than the giant that is Glastonbury – make use of 100% renewable energy, use local suppliers as much as possible and encourage their staff to lower their travel footprint too. If having fun at a festival can have lasting impacts on our green behaviour, then it’s surely a worthwhile use of resources, so long as we actually continue to cut the ecological footprint wherever we can."

“Would you say the Antarctic has less ice than it used to?”
From NBC’s Meet The Press.
Er, Bill, that graphic you’re holding up is one of the Arctic, and not the Antarctic. Nye doesn’t even know north from south!
And concerning global sea ice, today it is at near normal levels. Nye cherry-picking the single data-point of September 2012 at the single location of the Arctic is not a persuasive argument – never mind him using the wrong chart.
Finally, I’ve never seen an issue with so much consensus be so hotly disputed. Why is that so? It is because, obviously, the claimed climate consensus is a complete myth.
I would have taken both Nye and Gregory apart with half of my regular average brain tied behind my back.

"When it comes to the environment, it’s hardly unusual for us to say one thing and do another. We may profess, when asked, that we care about recycling, pollution, climate change or wasting energy. We may have access to plenty of information about the environmental consequences of our actions. Yet often we fail to change how we act.  Social science has for many years been interested in this phenomenon, which researchers have called the “value-action gap”. In the 1970s, governments began to launch educational campaigns like the UK’s “Save it” energy conservation campaign. They assumed that giving people information about the environmental impacts of their decisions would lead them to question their priorities and change their behaviour. However, it quickly became clear that such approaches tended to fail.  In the 1980s, social psychologists began to research psychological and sociological factors that might explain why. One recognised factor is that if we don’t directly experience the consequences of our actions, we’re less likely to change how we act. The link between flying and climate change is not immediately visible, for example. More generally, environmental damage tends to emerge as a result of complex processes and only after an extended period of time. The lack of direct experience of harm means we are less emotionally involved in this damage and, as a result, we are less likely to feel a responsibility to change our behaviour.  Shared norms also constrain what we think is acceptable, desirable and possible. Cultural expectations about hospitality might make us turn up the heating higher before our family come to visit, for example.  In recent years, researchers have also investigated how shared social practices alter over time in conjunction with technological change. For example, the slow evolution of how we heat our homes or wash our clothes is influenced by new technologies and their commercial application. Biological washing powders make it possible to do laundry in colder water and thus use less energy. But people in developed countries generally own more clothes than their grandparents or parents, and wash them more often, which may cancel out these energy savings. The changing, complex relationships between how we do things and the devices we rely on are no less invisible to us in our daily lives than the environmental harm that may result from them. It’s therefore important to ensure domestic energy usage is made more visible, which explains the widespread interest in smart meters. But this brings us full circle, back to the question of whether more information can help us change our behaviour. An alternative might be to look at the influences at work within individual lives that can help change people’s ideas about “normality”.  Our Energy Biographies project examined how, as people go through different “lifecourse transitions” (like having children, moving house, retirement and so on), their ideas about what kinds and levels of energy use are normal change significantly. In interviews with people from different sites in Wales and London – including an eco-village, a large hospital and two different communities in Cardiff – we discovered that these ideas about “what’s normal” are indeed often shared. At the same time, they also reflect individual experiences and emotional attachments to ways of life.  In these interviews, domestic devices ranging from the mundane to the exotic, including kettles, patio heaters and hot-tubs, take on rich emotional significance, appearing as an essential part of what people consider to be lives worth living. We feel disconnected from the consequences of energy use, our research suggests, because this stuff becomes a naturalised part of our identities – something we don’t even consider trying to change.  At Lammas, a newly-established eco-village we studied, this situation was different. Residents there were engaged in a kind of collective experiment, remodelling everyday life to make it as sustainable as possible. Previously familiar practices (like doing the laundry) and ideas of normal energy use (like having games consoles or radios conveniently to hand) had to change. Emotional attachments, both to particular ways of doing things and to specific devices and appliances, were similarly placed in question. Over time, as a community hydropower generator and household solar panels came online, everyday appliances like washing machines and laptops were reintegrated into everyday life, but with a new appreciation for the resources needed to power them. Lammas represents a collective effort to build from scratch a whole community together with its energy infrastructure. In the process, hitherto overlooked feelings about the devices and practices through which people consume energy came into the foreground. Even in more mainstream settings, however, discussing energy in the community means that ideas about what is privately thought of as normal can be “tested”. This can help people to reassess their own levels of energy use, as well as making it possible to share experiences of success and failure in using less. Our own research shows how discussing renewable energy technologies with trusted neighbours can encourage their uptake. Maybe life in an eco-village like Lammas isn’t for everyone. But talking to your neighbours is less challenging, and may open up surprising conversations about how we can change how we use energy."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat would be the appropriate thing to say about a government that pours a monstrously disproportionate amount of money into an issue no one really cares about, and does so at the huge expense of the very issues that people really do care about? Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne and newnostradamusofthenorth.blogspot.
I’d say it’s just a question of time before serious economic and social instability erupts. It’s a socio-political disaster waiting to happen.
This is precisely the case in Europe. Hundreds of billions of euros are being pumped into environment and “climate protection” which a recent survey clearly shows is not at all the main concern of EU citizens. The survey tells us in no uncertain terms that the essential issues of economics and jobs are being seriously neglected and that the stability of the continent is at serious risk. People are genuinely worried about their jobs and the economy.

In a comprehensive European survey on issues that matter to citizens, climate and environment finished almost dead last, not even making the top 10.
The chart above compares sentiment from last spring to last autumn. Note that despite the IPCC’s dramatized and hyped release of its 5th assessment report last autumn, concern for climate and environment climbed only a mere 1 percent. Even dead cats have much more bounce.
Clearly, economics jobs and prices are far more important for European citizens, as the challenge for citizens to make ends meet are far more real than the abstract computer-generated “climate catastrophe”, which is allegedly due 100 years from now.

Only in the very rich countries do environment and climate have any meaning.
So why does the EU pour so many billions into a non-relevant issue when in some countries, like Greece, societies are on the verge of uprising because of economic hardship? On the surface it makes no sense. But closer examination shows us what happens to a society when its government becomes so irrationally obsessed with an irrelevant issue that it literally puts its existence at risk. Ideology and dogmatism are blind.
More astonishing is that despite the 2-decades long multi-multi billion euro climate campaign and persistent mass media blitz, climate still remains an irrelevant fringe issue. Unless you find yourself in North Korea, it goes to show that brainwashing is not easy to do in today’s decentralized multi-media environment. Mainstream media has lost its influence. The Internet media is playing a more important role then ever.
Another point the survey reveals is that climate is an issue, and only a moderate one at that, in mainly very rich countries where people have nothing better to worry about, e.g. Sweden and Germany. It’s about soothing guilt.
Of course everyone agrees environment is an essential issue. But pouring literally tens of billions into fictitious “climate protection” year after year while neglecting the real, pressing issues is becoming a dangerous game. The observed data do really tell us: the climate catastrophe is nothing more than a computer model-generated hallucination.
Hopefully eurocrats will quickly take the survey results very seriously and acknowledge that their economic problems are truly pressing and that neglecting them further will only increase the risk of serious social consequences and civic instability. The EU is keeping its socioeconomic powder kegs tinder dry.

"Mining giant Rio Tinto says its Australian Aluminium smelters, which employ more than 2,600 workers, are not sustainable at current power prices. The company runs three smelters in Australia, which are under financial pressure due to the high price of electricity, which makes up about a third of their costs, and the low price of aluminium due to a flood of cheap supply coming from Asian competitors. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, has recently championed the industry, saying Australia was “one of the best aluminium producers in the world” and claiming it needed a continued supply of “cheap baseload” electricity from coal. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If we turn our back on coal, you turn out the lights on aluminium, it’s as simple as that,” he told ABC Radio last week. However, speaking in London on Thursday night, the chief executive of Rio Tinto’s aluminium division, Alf Barrios, issued a blunt warning that current prices from coal-fired power were too high. He said this was despite “fantastic work” done by the team at the Australian smelter division, Pacific, to improve the performance of the plants.  “However power accounts for about a third of the global cost of the smelters and the smelters at Pacific do lack internationally competitive energy prices, which undermines the viability of these assets,” he said. “We are working very closely with the power suppliers and the governments to find a solution to this challenge. “I’m not going to speculate on the outcome but clearly the current situation is not sustainable.” The warning comes after Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastian Jacques warned in August that Australian smelters were “on thin ice” and follows the company flagging last week that it might close its New Zealand smelter. Barrios was speaking to reporters ahead of a quarterly update to investors that listed “low-carbon technology” as a priority for its aluminium business. The company’s head of economics, Vivek Tulpule, said the profitability of aluminium was “challenged by the quick and cheap expansion of supply to meet growth in demand”. “This underlines the value of our position in Canada with operating costs in the bottom decile of the cost curve supported by hydro power which will become increasingly important in a carbon-constrained world,” he said. The company is also exploring making greenhouse gas-free aluminium as part of a wider project to reduce its emissions."

Olson starts by saying that climate change as an issue “is truly important, and that it is a major tragedy how poorly it’s been handled.” and that it is up against one particularly nasty obstacle: “it’s the most boring subject on earth“.
AIT a failure – “for hard-core lefties”
Other interesting comments Olson makes include his belief that Al Gore’s AIT was only successful because of his personality, but that “the same movie starring any NASA scientist would have lost money” and that “there was almost no narrative structure to it. It failed to tell an interesting and compelling story.”
All in all, Olson says the film was mostly for “hard-core lefties” and that he was told by a movie distributor: “no more environmental documentaries!” Too bad DiCaprio didn’t listen.

In the interview Olson also believes that the skeptics have been very successful in their “all-out assault” on “the brand” and says that in 2009 with “Climate Gate” the skeptics “spun circles around the climate crowd“.
So boring “it makes a robot want to commit suicide”
The major problem with climate science, Olson seems to say, is that it is so damn boring: In the interview he describes papers on tree rings as follows as “boredom so purified and crystalized it’s in an unadulterated form that could make even a robot want to commit suicide.”
Overall Olson thinks it’s over and it’s too late: “the brand has been ruined” and tha the only thing that could resuce it is that the story be told by “media people, professional storytellers, actors, etc.” 
Not sure what Olson is getting at here. Haven’t movie distributors just made it clear that no one is interested in climate stories?
In summary the climate issue is boring people to death. As a result it’s going to be awfully damn tough to get people to listen to a dead-boring story for the hundredth time.

"Recently, San Francisco’s parks department tested a policy which allowed groups to pay to reserve areas of grass in Dolores Park. Although the authority hurriedly backtracked after an outcry from local residents, this incident represents a worrying global trend towards the privatisation of public spaces.  Across the world, parks, plazas and promenades – which were once in the hands of public authorities – are coming under the control of private corporations.  In some cases, you won’t even notice the difference. For instance, the recently regenerated area around Kings Cross in London features one of the largest open spaces in Europe; it is publicly accessible, but ownership remains in private hands.  In other cases, the consequences are more troubling. Earlier this year in Little Stoke, south Gloucestershire, the parish council became the first in the world to vote to charge Parkrun – a free running event that is organised in 12 countries – a fee to use its grounds. The run was subsequently cancelled.  Meanwhile, in London, an old adventure playground in Battersea Park has been replaced by an ordinary swings and slides park, and a new “Go Ape” tree-top adventure ground, which costs £18 for a small child to use. What’s more, open spaces are increasingly being created within gated communities, where access is restricted to those who can pay to live there. An extreme example of this can be seen in the branded housing projects, which are providing most new open space in Istanbul – a city where only 1.5% of the land is dedicated to public, green spaces. Part of the explanation for this trend is that local authorities are increasingly using existing public spaces to raise funds, by charging for events or leasing their spaces to companies. In many cases, cash-strapped authorities are suffering from public sector cuts, and trying to improve or maintain their open spaces by entering into deals with private organisations.  For instance, the UK government has introduced Business Improvement Districts, where local businesses pay a levy to secure extra developments or services in their area. But these arrangements have been criticised for prioritising commercial interests, rather than focusing on what will benefit the community.  Internationally, the public sector is under no obligation to provide public spaces, so in many cases, there’s no incentive for authorities to forgo opportunities to privatise them. What’s more, many local governments have realised that attractively designed and well-maintained spaces can help to attract investors and certain types of users (namely, people with spending power). Universities and public sector organisations around the North Sea are researching alternative approaches to privatisation, as part of a project called Making Places Profitable.  The Municipality of Emmen, in the Netherlands, experimented with a radical approach, giving power to the local people. Citizens were given responsibility for the management of public spaces, while local community councils were given budgetary controls, as well as the chance to test a locally-managed maintenance standard.  And in Hamburg, the publicly-owned waterfront regeneration company – HafenCity GmbH – required Unilever to open up the ground floor of its new world headquarters to the public, as a condition for planning permission. These experimental approaches are still few and far between, and their long-term impacts are not yet clear.  Yet it’s vital for cities to find ways to preserve, manage and create new public spaces. For one thing, the physical and mental health benefits of using green open spaces are becoming ever more apparent to researchers. But perhaps more importantly, public spaces are the essence of a city. They are physical manifestations of the public sphere; places where different voices in society can be heard, and where people from all walks of life can meet – free of charge."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s much ballyhooed Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) was supposed to show the whole world how switching over to green energy sources could reduce CO2 emissions, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, provide cheap electricity to citizens, and heroically rescue the planet.

Australia’s Tony Abbott says the hell with market-distorted, expensive, unreliable, poor-to-rich capital redistribution machine green energies. Cites German failure as reason to abandon them. Photo credit: MystifyMe Concert Photography (Troy) – Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
Ten years later, the very opposite has happened: Germany’s CO2 emissions have been increasing, electricity prices have skyrocketed, the green jobs bubble has popped, and tens of thousands of jobs have disappeared. Worse: tens of billions are being redistributed from the poor to the rich.
Other countries around the world have noticed and are thus having serious second thoughts about industrializing their landscapes with green energy systems like wind, solar and biogas. Germany has proven that green energy does not work well after all.
Spiegel reports here how Australia’s conservative government led by Tony Abbott is now using Germany’s failure as one of the main arguments for getting out of green energies and getting back to affordable and reliable coal power.
Spiegel, perturbed by Abbot’s direction, writes of his doing away with the CO2 emissions trading scheme and his plans to abolish the CO2 tax. Australian industry has been burdened by a 15 euro per tonne CO2 tax while in Europe it is only 5 euros. Spiegel writes:

The prices for raw materials are crumbling, auto manufacturers Ford and Holden, a GM arm, have announced plans to close factories. Mining companies such as BHPBilliton are rethinking their expansion plans. ‘The Australians have their backs up against the wall,’ says Heribert Dieter, expert at the Science and Policy Foundation in Berlin.”
What’s especially embarrassing for German greens and the green media like Spiegel is that countries around the world are now citing Germany’s failure in marshaling through the Energiewende as a reason to abandon the green path. Germany is showing the world how not to produce energy.
In Germany the mad rush to green energies has led to skyrocketing electricity costs, crony capitalism, massive redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich, and an unstable power supply. Moreover, energy-intensive companies are exempted from paying the green energy feed-in surcharges, and thus leaving the lowly consumers to foot the entire bill.
One German mid-size company I know in the local area covered its sprawling factory roof with thousands of square feet of solar panels and today sells the solar energy produced to power companies at an exorbitant price (approx. $0.50/kwh). Then, to power its factory, the company turns around and buys the very same power at a fraction of the price (roughly $0.20/kwh). What’s really perverse is that the same company is also exempt from paying the green energy feed-in surcharge, because it claimed excessive hardship from its “energy-intensive” manufacturing operations and associated energy costs. Twisted and distorted or what!
In summary: Germany’s energy market has been transformed into a grotesque market distortion and redistribution of wealth scheme from the poor to the rich. Abbott is absolutely right not to go down this socially and politically dubious path.
Spiegel sniffs that Abbott has simply brushed aside all the criticism from environmental organisations being fired his way. Spiegel writes “quotes translated from the German):
The premier does not let himself be misled, and reminds everyone that in Germany the costs for the Energiewende have exploded. The country that was once a model is now a dissuasive example. “We can’t afford to follow Germany’s example,” Ron Boswell, Senator of the state of Queensland is quoted as saying in ‘The Australian’. Because of its expansion of renewable energy sources, Germany has the highest energy prices in the world. “We would be better off learning from the United States,’ Boswell believes. There energy is about three times cheaper than in Australia.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel today describes a COP 19 UN climate conference that has descended into a stunning chaos. NGOs are fuming that governments are no longer taking IPCC science seriously, and are now boycotting in anger.
The situation is so bad that environmental activist groups have had enough and are walking out. According to Spiegel, Oxfam, Greenpeace, WWF, Nabu, BUND, Friends of the Earth and others are now boycotting the conference.
German environmental organization BUND-chairman Hubert Weiger says, “The governments of the industrial countries and also the German government in the end are allowing themselves to be directed almost exclusively by the interests of the large fossil energy companies.”
I wonder if the seemingly clueless activists have ever stopped to think about where governments get most of their revenue, let alone the power and energy they and we need for survival. Maybe it’s, errr, industry?
One thing that should be becoming clear to them: The countries are no longer impressed by the doomsday projections issued by a seemingly desperate climate science. Countries aren’t taking it seriously anymore. The sham is over. As a result, COP 19 is shaping up to be a debacle of grand dimensions.

According to Spiegel much anger is being directed at host country Poland. Denise Loga of the WWF says the UN conference “has descended into a climate circus“.
The environmental activist groups are also angry that rich industrial countries are refusing to pony up billions for “climate protection” for poor countries, and that industrial China is pretending to be a developing country in need of handouts. Spiegel writes that Australia and Japan are also targets of activist fury.
Spiegel writes that the activists are also seething over emerging countries like China, India and Brazil who “in a few years will surpass the entire historical output of CO2 western industrial countries.” My oh my – it’s just terrible that emerging countries are finally pulling themselves out of the decades-long, grinding poverty.
“Not a single issue that’s not in dispute”
According to the German delegation, there isn’t a single issue that is not in dispute, and it’s been like that since Day 1. There have been lots of declarations, which are nothing more than “repeats of old declarations“.

"For the millions of people who descend on Munich for the annual bash, Oktoberfest is a celebration of beer, bands and bratwurst. But as the dust settles for another year on the world’s largest folk festival, and die Bierleichen (“beer corpses”) return to the land of the living, environmental scientists have released the first analysis of methane emissions from the 16-day party.  Researchers at Technical University in Munich walked and cycled around the perimeter of the festival last year with mobile sensors aloft. The instruments found the event emitted nearly 1,500kg of methane – 10 times the amount that wafted off Boston, Massachusetts, in the same period. The scientists attributed most of Oktoberfest’s emissions to leaks and incomplete combustion in cooking and heating appliances. Though an appreciable part of the rise in the gas, about 10%, was attributed to the flatulence and burps of attendees. Jia Chen, who studies greenhouse gases in urban environments, said: “The observed methane concentrations cannot solely be explained by biogenic sources. “We have strong indications that fossil fuel methane emissions by gas grills and heating appliances are major sources.” After carbon dioxide, methane is the second most common greenhouse gas emitted by human activity. Though shorter-lived, it is more effective than carbon dioxide at heating the atmosphere and accounts for about 20% of global heating due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since 1750. Atmospheric levels of the gas have surged in recent years for reasons scientists cannot fully explain. Having noticed a spike in Munich’s methane levels during Oktoberfest in previous years, Chen and her colleagues decided to monitor the event to see whether major festivals made important contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. More than six million people visit Oktoberfest each year and make their way through more than seven million litres of beer, 100,000 litres of wine, half a million chickens and a quarter of a million sausages. To Chen’s surprise, on average, every square metre of Oktoberfest in 2018 released 6.7 micrograms of methane per second. Less than 10% was calculated to come from festivalgoers in the form of flatulence and burps, according to a paper submitted to the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Chen believes the work can help festival organisers draw up policies to reduce their methane emissions. The study concludes the releases of methane are high enough for major festivals to be considered greenhouse gas sources in local emissions inventories. “Large but time-limited festivals, like Oktoberfest, are sources that have not been accounted for in existing emission inventories, even though, as we have seen, the methane emissions are significant,” Chen said. “Inaccurate or incomplete emission inventories are a problem, because many decisionsare based on this data.” With people travelling to Oktoberfest from more than 50 countries, methane leaks from the Theresienwiese site are not the greatest environmental concern. But improving gas appliances to reduce methane emissions still makes sense, Chen said. “Small steps can bring us closer to achieving the world climate goals,” she added."
"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organised creatures. – Charles Darwin, The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms (1881) Not all wildlife is created equal in our eyes. Take the earthworm, which doesn’t have the widespread appeal of larger, more charismatic animals such as gorillas, tigers or pandas. Worms are never going to get a strong “cute response”, and they won’t ever be the face of a conservation campaign. But what Darwin rightly recognised is that – panda fans avert your eyes – worm conservation is much more important once we factor in their provision of what we now call “ecosystem services”, which are crucial to human survival. Darwin spent 39 years studying these animals for a good reason. In fact, earthworms have even been ranked the number one most influential species in the history of the planet – above dinosaurs and humans.  Ecologists consider earthworms “keystone species” because of how much they influence the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil. Here are five reasons why: 1) Earthworms are recyclers. They play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and fertilising the soil, simply through their constant eating and pooping (about 1.5 times their body weight a day). What comes out the other end – known as a worm cast – is full of nutrients and bacteria that are beneficial for plants. Scientists have measured up to five times the amount of key nutrients in worm casts compared to surrounding soil.  A study in Hawaii found that replacing a portion of standard fertiliser with vermicompost (compost from worm casts) increased yields of crops such as tomatoes and strawberries by 30%. It’s hard to generate industrial amounts of worm cast, of course, and vermicompost remains more expensive than commercial fertiliser. But it’s an intriguing example of how earthworms can help humans. 2) Earthworms are great “soil engineers”. As they move through the soil, earthworms loosen and mix it up, helping to aerate and drain it. This brings nutrients to the surface, making the soil more fertile, and helps prevent flooding and erosion. 3) Earthworms are barometers of soil health and toxicity. They’re very sensitive to soil pollutants such as pesticide residues or unwanted heavy metals (zinc, lead and so on), and they are badly affected by changes in land use such as deforestation to clear the way for intensive farming. This means the health of local worms is proving to be a useful tool to assess the impact of different land usage and pollutants.  4) Juicy earthworms are an important food source. They are protein-rich and feed a number of animals, such as the European badger. 5) Earthworms can help repair damaged soil and may provide solutions to man-made problems. Research suggests that earthworms could help to clean up land contaminated with toxic heavy metals such as lead. Other studies show how earthworms can speed up the restoration of degraded land in the tropics, while research in northern Vietnam found that reduced earthworm diversity due to land use change also had a significant knock on effect on soil fertility, water drainage and soil erosion. So, earthworms are our underground allies – if we treat them right. Earthworms make it possible for us to live on the planet, simply by eating and pooping, and ploughing up, ventilating and fertilising the soil along the way.  Climate change and human intervention are fast-tracking the world’s loss of biodiversity. The plight of the tiger in India and the orangutan in Indonesia are well known, but scientists are also becoming concerned about earthworms and other animals that we are less familiar with, but which we can’t afford to lose. If pandas go extinct, it will be very sad. But, a world without earthworms? Arguably without earthworms in our soils, life could vanish pretty quickly. We would have less food, more pollution, and more flooding. No matter how cute a panda looks, it is Darwin’s “lowly” earthworms that are doing dirty, but crucial, work in the soil below."
"Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is under fire from environmental groups over its proposal to decommission the Brent oilfield in the North Sea. The plans submitted to the government relate to four concrete and steel platforms which have been in service for 40 years.  The environmental groups, which include WWF Scotland and Greenpeace UK, are refusing to back Shell’s plans. They claim the company has not made enough information public to properly cross-reference its proposals against the internationally agreed OSPAR rules that are supposed to govern decommissioning.  Shell is one of a number of oil producers looking at decommissioning now that many North Sea oil and gas fields are reaching the end of their productive lives. Decommissioning is a massive, expensive and technically challenging task; and Brent is seen as a test case for the rest of the UK industry.  While the UK government mulls Shell’s proposals, there are a number of myths surrounding the decommissioning process that people need to be aware of. Shell said in its Brent proposal: “Shell and Esso will be paying the decommissioning costs. The tax relief we will get back is not a subsidy or a new cost to the taxpayer – it’s a refund – i.e. the tax has already been paid by Shell and Esso in previous years.” But by having tax rules that allow oil producers to reclaim taxes paid in previous years to cover the cost of decommissioning, the taxpayer does pay.  If decommissioning comes in at the approximate £50 billion estimate, the treasury (the taxpayer) will be down by around £25bn. If the costs are higher, the treasury will pay more – a huge risk to the taxpayer. As a result of this system, oil producers already reportedly became a net drain on the UK’s coffers for the first time in 2016, costing the taxpayer £396m.  Many marine habitat experts are saying there is little environmental benefit from removal. Indeed some of the decommissioning activities are expected to do more environmental harm than good. This is due to seabed disruption, noise and the removal process itself, which is very energy intensive and will therefore be a major source of harmful emissions.  If the architecture is left in place, it will naturally reef and arguably create an environmental positive. The reefing concept has been used extensively in the Gulf of Mexico with the Rigs to Reefs programme.  In an area which lacks natural reefs, this has enhanced the marine habitat for many species of fish. Admittedly some people have raised concerns about environmental damage from deteriorating metal and reefing disrupting the natural ecology, but one can certainly argue the positives outweigh any negatives.  As I have argued before, leaving this offshore infrastructure in place and using the savings from taxpayers’ money to fund green energy projects would be much more sensible. Alternatively, you could invest the money in recovering the country’s manufacturing base, NHS funding, education, marine conservation, improving flood defences or tackling poverty.  Numerous reports in the media have reflected claims like this. In reality, onshore activities are around 2%-3% of the overall decommissioning costs, and onshore jobs are only a fraction of that. The jobs are transient; once the task is complete, there is no follow-on activity.  If we chose the green energy option, it would provide many more sustainable jobs designing, fabricating and constructing the wind farms and other power sources; as well as continuous operations and maintenance jobs over their 30 to 40 year lifespans. The same could be said of many of my other suggested alternatives.  How can a decommissioning industry that produces nothing and uses billions of taxpayers’ money be good for the economy? It is about taking things to bits. While it’s true you create short-term employment and that the employees and service companies will pay taxes, you don’t build any factories or provide new infrastructure to serve society and the economy. Also, much of the removal money will go to the heavy-lift companies – the UK has none.  The Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), an executive agency of the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is also obliged to maximise the economic recovery of the country’s petroleum resources. How can the current plans for decommissioning be maximising economic recovery?  Again, to compare with my preferred option of leaving platforms in place and putting the money into green energy, this would clearly achieve more economic recovery. It would provide society and the economy with an essential commodity – power for industry, electric transport and heat for homes. The OGA has an objective of reducing decommissioning costs by around 35%, but the country can do far better – the authority should be lobbying Westminster accordingly.  When I raised the question of maximising economic recovery with OGA and BEIS, I was told their role is to ensure OSPAR is followed and not to challenge it. OSPAR is the mechanism by which 15 governments of the western coasts and catchments of Europe, together with the EU, cooperate to protect the marine environment of the northeast Atlantic. It broadly requires full removal of oil platforms at the end of their economic lives. As well intentioned as OSPAR is, the directives are taking the nation to a very poor outcome. We know so much more now than when the directives were agreed in 1998 – the consequences of global warming, for instance, hence the argument that green energy looks a better investment nowadays. Even OSPAR should be able to see green energy as having a much better outcome for the international community. Why is the UK not challenging the agreement?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA paper by Duke University physicist Nicola Scafetta has just appeared in the journal Energy & Environment titled: Solar and planetary oscillation control on climate change: hind-cast, forecast and a comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs.
It’s another blow to those claiming high CO2 climate sensitivity.
The abstract reads (my emphasis):
Global surface temperature records (e.g. HadCRUT4) since 1850 are characterized by climatic oscillations synchronous with specific solar, planetary and lunar harmonics superimposed on a background warming modulation. The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases). However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be used in the AR5 IPCC Report in 2013, fail to reconstruct the observed climatic oscillations. As an alternate, an empirical model is proposed that uses: (1) a specific set of decadal, multidecadal, secular and millennial astronomic harmonics to simulate the observed climatic oscillations; (2) a 0.45 attenuation of the GCM ensemble mean simulations to model the anthropogenic and volcano forcing effects. The proposed empirical model outperforms the GCMs by better hind-casting the observed 1850-2012 climatic patterns. It is found that: (1) about 50-60% of the warming observed since 1850 and since 1970 was induced by natural oscillations likely resulting from harmonic astronomical forcings that are not yet included in the GCMs; (2) a 2000-2040 approximately steady projected temperature; (3) a 2000-2100 projected warming ranging between 0.3°C and 1.6°C, which is significantly lower than the IPCC GCM ensemble mean projected warming of 1.1°C to 4.1°C; (4) an equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling centered in 1.35°C and varying between 0.9°C and 2.0°C.

"The world’s governments will meet in Madrid this December to discuss the climate emergency, it has been confirmed, after a last-minute intervention by the Spanish government to save the talks. The conference had been set to take place in Santiago, Chile, but the government of President Sebastian Pinera decided on Wednesday to call it off because of the unrest in the capital. Scores of people have been killed and injured in weeks of rioting over economic inequality and social problems.  After Chile withdrew, there was concern that the annual talks might have to be scaled down, postponed or even abandoned. However, on Friday afternoon, the UN’s top official on climate change, Patricia Espinosa, issued a terse statement that COP25 would go ahead on the original dates, 2-13 December, but in Madrid. Scientific warnings have become increasingly insistent that time is running out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stave off the worst damages of global heating. But international negotiations under the UN have been slow and plagued by upsets and backsliding, such as the US plans to withdraw from the Paris agreement, Brazil’s rejection of its commitments by President Jair Bolsonaro, and the rise of political populism in other regions. Katherine Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, said: “It’s a shame that COP25 won’t be held in Latin America to highlight some of the grave climate impacts that affect the region. But hopefully a Madrid summit will be able to keep those in mind. Credit should be given to the Spanish government for offering to help at such short notice … but it shows how important countries view the UN process for tackling climate change that they are prepared to do all they can to keep the talks on track.” Tasneem Essop, the interim executive director of the Climate Action Network, made up of many NGOs with an interest in the issue, said: “We hope all steps are going to be taken … to make access to this COP fair and inclusive. It is important that there is the full participation of climate activists and observers from different parts of the world to COP25 where important negotiations on the Paris agreement are due to be undertaken.” Some activists who had set sail for Chile from Europe were planning to continue their journey. Others, particularly those from smaller organisations and delegations from poor countries, were likely to find it hard to meet the costs of the venue change. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist who sparked the global student strikes, had travelled as far as Los Angeles without flying and was planning to continue to Santiago in time for the conference. On Friday she made a plea for help getting back to Europe in time for the conference. “It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way,” she tweeted. “Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November … If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.” This year’s talks are essential to putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice and to pave the way for a crunch conference in the UK next year at which the long-term response to the climate emergency will be decided. Many of the world’s national commitments to cut greenhouse gases are pegged to a 2020 deadline, and if new commitments are to be set then next year will be crucial."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany has always been viewed as one of the leaders in “fighting climate change”. But when you examine what the country has really accomplished in reducing CO2 emissions, we see that country’s actions tell another story.
And when you examine its current activities, one thing stands clear: Germany is no longer taking the futile fight against climate change seriously and has abandoned its efforts to fight nature, likely having realized that the climate is going to change naturally anyway and there’s nothing you can do about it – except adapt. Thus in most respects, Germany has de facto joined the ranks of Japan, Australia and Canada.
German climate scientist Mojib Latif, a loud proponent of radical CO2 reductions, has a commentary at Spiegel titled: The fight against greenhouse gases: Germany mutates into a climate protection obstructionist.
Latif writes that in 1995, under the leadership of Helmut Kohl, Germany unilaterally committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2005 (using 1990 as the reference period). The Kyoto Protocol then mandated that Europe’s largest economy only needed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 21% by 2012. That target was reached; Germany patted itself on the back and posed as a model for the rest of the world.
But as Latif points out, the target was reached not because of planned and executed efforts to do so, but thanks in large part to a one-time unique event: the collapse of East Germany and its notoriously outdated and dilapidated industry. Moreover, Germany’s economy shifted a large portion of its energy-intensive industry to foreign locations, thus merely offshoring its CO2 emissions (gray emissions). The result, Latif writes: Germany has in reality made little or no tangible progress in greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The 21% achievement was a book-keeping trick, and nothing more.
Latif writes:
Taking the reunification into account and gray emissions, when it comes to climate protection, Germany has hardly undertaken any serious efforts since the Kohl government announced its ambitious plans.”

Kohl’s announcement was made in 1995, meaning Germany has done practically nothing but blow hot air on climate for almost 20 years! What’s worse, Latif writes, is that Germany is now actively obstructing progress on global emissions reductions. This in reality, confirmed by its actions, puts the country in the same ranks as Japan, Canada, and Australia: countries who have realized that the situation is not that serious after all and that there isn’t a crisis.
The obstructive actions Latif cites include Germany’s obstruction of stricter CO2 upper limits for new cars, delay tactics to prevent a reform of CO2 emissions trading, its scaling back of subsidies for renewable energies, and its recent plans to bring coal-fired power plants back on line. Indeed Germany’s CO2 emissions have risen for the second year in a row, ironically because of the unusually cold winter. Latif writes:
This is a sad result for the self-named class leader in climate protection.
While Germany may appear quick to lecture other countries on their environmental and climatic responsibilities, the reality is completely different. Europe’s industrial engine has realized that fighting climate change is an excruciatingly expensive and senseless endeavor and that the science underpinning it isn’t what it was cracked up to be after all.

"This morning the high court ruled that the Metropolitan police acted unlawfully when it introduced an unprecedented, London-wide ban on Extinction Rebellion protests last month. Imposed late in the evening of Monday 14 October, the move involved an application of the Public Order Act so draconian that it would usually require the home secretary’s sign-off. The judgment invalidating that ban is clearly a victory for democratic process and the rule of law. The court agreed with our lawyers that the police had unlawfully overstepped the limits of their powers in a way that disproportionately curtailed the right to protest, and that while the police could impose conditions on protest gatherings, they could not prohibit them from happening altogether.  It is also a victory for those seeking to draw attention to what scientists have been telling us for decades: that the planet is warming, we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, we are responsible – and there is a limited amount of time to do something about it. The ban was not aimed at activists who mounted planes and trains, or stopped vehicles during the two-week International Rebellion in October. Those actions were likely illegal regardless of this ban, and taken with the intention of being arrested in a desperate attempt to jolt politicians out of their inertia. Instead the ban sought to criminalise anyone who wished to assemble under the banner of Extinction Rebellion in any way. A pair of picnickers or a few school children traipsing around their local park wearing XR insignia would have been guilty of a criminal offence and at risk of arrest. Indeed, we estimate that more than 300 people were detained using these powers. In the short term, this judgment sets a legal precedent that reaffirms the right to protest and invalidates the arrests of those detained under the ban, many of whom will have claims for compensation from the police for their wrongful arrest and detention. But in the longer term, it offers little solace. While the law has dug us out of this particular hole, nitpicking through the courts won’t be enough to forestall the climate and ecological emergency. The government’s attitude to climate protest reflects its wider approach to legislating for the protection of the planet. Just as it has sought to dodge the difficult decisions and hide behind the police to unlawfully ban Extinction Rebellion’s protests, the government continues to dodge the trade-offs that are required to fight the climate crisis, hiding instead behind targets that lie six full parliaments away – as far off in the future as the Berlin Wall is in the past. Rather than shirking responsibilities until it ends up in court, the government needs to confront those trade-offs now to interrupt catastrophe. The emergency we face requires system change, not incremental tinkering with the status quo. But a government that suspends fracking in the same week as it approves a new coalmine in Cumbria is clearly not interested in structural transformation. You need not take this from me – the government’s own Committee on Climate Change concluded this summer that: “UK action to curb greenhouse gas emissions is lagging far behind what is needed, even to meet previous, less stringent, emissions targets. Over the past year, the government has delivered just one of 25 critical policies needed to get emissions reductions back on track.” Non-violent peaceful protest is the last resort of people desperate to divert the trajectory of a system in which inequality rises with the oceans, which ignores the science and the scientists (11,000 of whom warned yesterday that we’re heading for “untold suffering due to the climate crisis”), and turns the mantra “keep calm and carry on” into a suicide note. The truth is that change is coming whatever we do. Our choice is what kind of transformation we want. We can choose a transformation that heeds the science, listens to citizens but levels with them too, shoulders our responsibilities to current and future generations and promises an improvement in our collective wellbeing. Or we can scrap for a few more years in the lingering twilight of business-as-usual – in which up to a million animal and plant species will become extinct – before descending swiftly into a politics of ecofascism forged in the crucible of scarce resources, droughts, floods, climate wars and forced migration. Against that kind of politics the courts that protected our rights today will not be able to defend us. It’s not too late for us to choose. In five weeks an election will decide who’s in power for half of the decade the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tells us we have left to limit climate catastrophe. The question all of us should be asking every parliamentary candidate between now and then is: where is your plan? • Tobias Garnett is a human rights lawyer and coordinator of Extinction Rebellion’s legal strategy team"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe purpose of the House Climate Change Hearing is to shed light on the question of: How much is man contributing to climate change, and how responsible is Obama’s energy policy?
So far the skeptics feel that the hearing has been successful in communicating their case to the public. The office of Rep. David McKinley P.E. (photo right) has distributed his remarks and graphics on the subject:
– CO2 is undeniably increasing.
– Some scientists and climatologists say their energy models reflect that CO2 levels coincide with temperature increases.
– But here’s a chart with 73 models and actual observations:

Not a single climate model has been correct so far. Warming has been minor. 
– Temperatures have been at a virtual standstill for the past 40 years while CO2 levels have increased.
– In fact Arctic sea ice has grown 60% despite increased CO2 levels.
– And if that was not enough, the ice surrounding Antarctica is also expanding.
– The United Nations’ reports also indicates that “most experts believe that by 2083, the benefits of climate change may still outweigh the harm.”

Chart provided by the office of DAVID B. MCKINLEY, P.E.
McKinley adds “that even if the U.S. stopped all its coal-fired power plants, CO2 levels would be reduced by merely two tenths of one percent globally” and that “the Obama Administration fails to tell the American people that 96% of emitted annually occurs naturally“. Also Obama does not tell us that its proposed regulations “would cast hundreds of thousands of workers out of work” while doing nothing noticeable for the environment.

Rep. McKinley also says “the rest of the world is not listening to the President’s energy policy” and that “China, India, Russia and Europe are all expanding their use of coal“.
Ensuring affordable energy to the poor is a moral imperative
Worse, McKinley points out that Obama’s proposed policy will hurt the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet:
Nations struggling to come out of poverty will continue to suffer, lives will be lost and children will be sick and perish as a result of the President’s support on this policy.”
McKinley adds that “one of the biggest moral responsibilities for the United States should be help emerging nations out of poverty” and that this can be done using “the most abundant and affordable source of power: coal“. Access to affordable energy is absolutely essential.
McKinley asks citizens:
Please take this message back to your agencies: This President must not prevent people around the globe from obtaining affordable, dependable energy; and threatening American workers and businesses with the loss of affordable energy from coal and natural gas is not an acceptable energy policy. Crushing America’s economy to reduce CO2 by 0.2% is an abuse of this Administration’s authority.”

"Donald Trump is moving to formally exit the Paris climate agreement, making the United States the only country in the world that will not participate in the pact, as global temperatures are set to rise 3C and worsening extreme weather will drive millions into poverty. The paperwork sent by the US government to withdraw begins a one-year process for exiting the deal agreed to at the UN climate change conference in Paris in 2015. The Trump administration will not be able to finalize its exit until a day after the presidential election in November 2020. The French presidential office said Emmanuel Macron and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would sign a pact in Beijing on Wednesday that makes reference to the “irreversibility” of the Paris climate accord. The Élysée palace official expressed disappointment at Trump’s move, saying: “We regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary.”The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced the development on Monday afternoon, saying the agreement would be an “unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses and taxpayers” and that the US has already reduced its heat-trapping emissions. But organizers of local city and state efforts to curb the crisis across America say the US is still trying to play a role in fighting the climate crisis, despite the actions of the federal government. Carl Pope, vice chair of the group America’s Pledge, said its members – who are vowing to keep fighting the climate emergency – produce more than half the country’s heat-trapping emissions and represent about 70% of the US gross domestic product. Another organization, the US Climate Alliance, includes the governors of 25 states, representing 55% of the US population. In the Paris agreement, the US agreed to cut its heat-trapping pollution at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. Dozens of countries are also pursuing goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But they represent only about 11% of the world’s climate footprint and exclude the biggest emitters: China, the US and India.  Staying on par with those more advanced countries would require the US government to eliminate pollution from coal and natural gas powered electricity plants, transportation, manufacturing facilities and agriculture. Local action by itself is not likely to be enough. “We don’t think it’s likely just with the states we have, we think we need the whole country to be moving together,” Pope said.  Criticism from prominent political and environmental figures was swift and forceful. The former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore said in a statement posted on Twitter: “No one person or party can stop our momentum to solve the climate crisis. But those who try will be remembered for their complacency, complicity, and mendacity in attempting to sacrifice the planet for their greed.” Gore, a Nobel prize co-recipient (with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) for his efforts to raise awareness of the climate crisis, described Trump’s policy as “reckless” but also noted that the withdrawal process cannot start until after the 2020 election. “Even if [Trump] follows through, it would take just 30 days for a new president to get us back in,” Gore added. “This decision is ultimately in the hands of the voters.” The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Trump’s move a “disastrous decision that sells out our children’s future”. Jean Su, energy director with the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, said: “America is the number one historical contributor to the climate emergency wreaking havoc in burning California, the flooded Southeast and the rest of the world.” “The next president must repay this extraordinary climate debt by rapidly moving America to 100% clean energy and financing the decarbonization of the Global South,” Su said, referring to the developing world. In addition, the Trump administration has also pulled US funding commitments to help the developing world cut pollution. John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, president Barack Obama’s secretaries of state and defense respectively, in a Washington Post op-ed, called it a “dark day for America”. “Climate change is already affecting every sector and region of the United States, as hundreds of top scientists from 13 federal agencies made clear in a report the White House itself released last year,” they said. “The past five years were the warmest ever recorded. Without steep pollution reductions, climate change will risk tens of thousands of US lives every year by the end of the century.” They called the Paris agreement, “a start, not a finish line,” but “the best ignition switch the world could agree on to spark international cooperation on this critical issue”. Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate environment panel, said: “Once again, President Trump is abandoning our global allies for the sake of misplaced political gain. Now America stands alone – nearly 200 countries have joined this global commitment to fighting climate change, even global pariahs like North Korea and civil war-torn countries like Syria.” Carper said Trump is abandoning “tremendous economic opportunity” and public health benefits. Trumphas alternately ignored or denied the climate crisis. His agencies are nixing regulations for power plants and cars, and bolstering fossil fuels whenever possible. He promised, to widespread dismay, to exit the Paris agreement during his campaign. The Democratic 2020 election frontrunners challenging Trump have all said they would set the country on a path to neutralize its climate pollution by 2050. Nate Hultman, director of the University of Maryland’s center for global sustainability and lead author of this year’s America’s Pledge report, pointed to new laws in New Mexico, Nevada, Washington, Maine, New York, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico for 100% clean energy targets. Hawaii and California already had such laws. Together, they represent 16% of the nation’s electricity, more than doubling the share from 2018, he said. “Another way to think about it is that Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement is supported in reality by only about 30% of the economy and 35% of the population,” Hultman said. Even once the US withdraws, the country can participate as an observer in international climate negotiations. But despite the efforts of subnational governments, recent analysis shows the US is still far off track from its commitments, regardless of whether Trump pulled out.  The US is also far from neutralizing climate emissions by the middle of the century, which as many experts say will be necessary for all countries in order to avert the worst of the crisis. “We can still get there with a serious shift in policy in the coming years,” said Kate Larsen, director of Rhodium’s international energy and climate research.

"Victoria police have defended the actions of their officers over two days of protests at a mining conference in Melbourne, after one protester was hospitalised and reporters covering the event were pushed by police and pepper-sprayed. A dozen climate change protesters have been arrested on day two of action outside a global mining conference in Melbourne, where activists glued themselves to the ground. Officers used capsicum spray to break up the blockade on Wednesday, which was designed to prevent conference delegates entering the Convention and Exhibition Centre. It led to 12 activists being arrested, the majority for intentionally obstructing an emergency services worker, as they blocked access including via disabled ramps. Two people who glued themselves to a carpark access ramp have since been removed while another woman who “locked on” to a handrail has come unstuck, police said. “Whilst we respect the rights of people to peacefully protest, the unlawful action undertaken today is a drain on police resources from across greater Melbourne,” a police statement reads, adding all actions taken by officers were in line with training. An unnamed protester said she’d been told to move back before police “went wild”. “My friend got arrested, I got pepper-sprayed, it was crazy,” she told 3AW. Channel 7 journalist Paul Dowsley tweeted he was “stunned” after video of him being pushed by police was tweeted by Australian journalist Tessa Akerman. Dowsley said he was ““obeying [police] direction to move to another area” at the time of the incident. Incredible. I was obeying their direction to move to another area. I’m stunned. https://t.co/YsZDIjc9jO Police contradicted the journalist’s version of events in a statement: “It is unfortunate that members of the public, including journalists, are not following instructions by members of Victoria police. “In this case, the reporter involved did not follow police instructions to move away from the area. This was a safety issue and Victoria Police believes an appropriate amount of force was used to move the reporter from the area.” Student journalist at Farrago, Ailish Hallinan, also tweeted she had been pepper sprayed by police during the protests, despite not being involved in the blockade. Today I was reporting on #IMARC for @FarragoMagazine. I was not involved in the blockade, just a student journalist peacefully observing. Yet I was still pepper sprayed by police. This police brutality MUST end. @VictoriaPolice pic.twitter.com/CAwufSQGyJ The premier, Daniel Andrews, has backed police efforts to bring order to the protest. Violence erupts as police detain one of the climbers ⁦@abcmelbourne⁩ ⁦@abcnews⁩ pic.twitter.com/usDwcsO9ov “I will always support the right of every Victorian, if they so choose, to peacefully protest. But there is a big difference between peaceful protest and what we saw yesterday and potentially today,” he said during question time in parliament. It comes after hundreds of police and protesters clashed on Tuesday outside the conference, with four officers injured and a protester hospitalised with leg injuries. Almost 50 people were arrested on Tuesday and police continue to dedicate hundreds of officers to the protest as the conference continues until Thursday. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, backed the police who he said were “trying to make sure that these ferals can’t stop people going about their lawful business in this state”. Organisers of the International Mining and Resources Conference (Imarc) insist it was “business as usual” inside the centre and protests had failed to disrupt the meeting, which was due to attract some 7,000 delegates from more than 100 countries. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, told the conference attendees to ignore the protests outside. “Don’t give an inch to the protesters outside on these points. I am happy for the Australian resources industry to take the Pepsi morality challenge against other businesses any day of the week.” Delegates heard about commitments within the industry to prioritise ethical sourcing and meet climate change goals, organisers said, having accused protesters of being misdirected in targeting the conference."
"Will our grandchildren look back, 50 years from now, at a time when human beings ate other animals as one in which their grandparents were “complicit in a bloodbath of unnecessary suffering”, a horror show of unremitting violence that is “wholly unimaginable” to them? That’s the intriguing premise of Carnage, a new feature-length BBC film which depicts a 2067 utopia where humans no longer raise animals for consumption. Carnage is a mockumentary, written and directed by comedian Simon Amstell, but let’s contemplate its premise seriously for a moment. Is a “post-meat” world possible? Could we manage a transition to a society where farmed animals are liberated and granted equal status, free to live equally among humans?  There are some good reasons why this is an unlikely vision of the future. For a start, the number of animals slaughtered globally is on the increase. Although this includes hunting, poaching, and unwanted pets, by far the biggest point of interaction between humans and other animals is industrial farming. The statistics are staggering: at least 55 billion animals are killed by the global farming industry each year, and this figure is growing every year. Despite marketing tales of animal welfare and “happy meat”, factory farming means violence, discomfort and suffering on an enormous scale. This is why Yuval Noah Harari, the author of Sapiens, a history of the human race, calls our treatment of domesticated animals in industrial farms “perhaps the worst crime in history”. If we turn to consumers’ willingness to eat meat, psychological research in this area appears to cast further doubt on the utopian vision of Carnage. Most people who eat meat express concern in relation to animal welfare, and experience unease when the death or discomfort of animals is associated with the meat on their plate.  Psychologists refer to this tension between beliefs and behaviour as “cognitive dissonance”. We want to reduce the discomfort of such dissonance, but human nature means we often seek the easiest ways of doing so. So rather than changing behaviour, we change our thinking, and develop strategies like minimising the harm of the offending behaviour (animals don’t have the capacity to suffer like we do; they do not matter; they have a good life); or denying one’s responsibility for it (I am doing what everyone does; it is necessary; I was made to eat meat – it is natural). Dissonance-reduction strategies often lead, paradoxically, to an increase in commitment to “morally troublesome behaviour” such as eating meat, to justify them. We then have to work harder to reduce dissonance, creating the need to defend one’s behaviour even more vigorously. This commitment becomes habitual, and part of our shared routines, traditions and social norms. It’s a circular process that can end up with exaggerated and socially-polarised views, reflected perhaps in familiar attempts to publicly ridicule veganism. On this reading of the psychology research, change on the scale envisioned by Carnage seems unlikely. There are grounds for optimism, however. A first challenge comes from growing health concerns related to eating meat, and an accompanying lifestyle movement that embraces a “plant-based diet”. Meat substitutes are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, as the tech industry recognises the potential market value of alternative protein sources.  This is matched by a resurgent concern for the welfare of nonhuman animals more generally. Examples include successful campaigns against captive orca whales and circus animals, the widespread questioning of the purpose of zoos, and a burgeoning legal movement defending the rights of animals in court. This trend is strengthened by growing recognition of the emotional, cognitive and social complexity of nonhuman animals. What might be the biggest factor of all, however, is the impact on the climate. Meat is an inefficient use of resources (as farm animals eat food that could go straight to humans), while cows famously fart out lots of methane. The UN says the large-scale industrial farming of animals is one of “the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global”. A global reduction in meat consumption is one of the best ways to fight climate change. And, as pressure for resources rise, so too might cost, leading to less meat eating. Taken in isolation, none of these trends suggests social change on the scale Carnage imagines. But together, they just might. It is a combination that could explain significant growth in the number of vegetarians and vegans for example. This increase is especially marked among younger people – an important point to consider in relation to our imagined 50-year trajectory. And let’s face it, the need to do anything we can to collectively reduce carbon emissions and alleviate the worst effects of climate change is only going to become more pressing as we approach 2067. The German government seems to have recognised this, recently banning meat from all official functions for environmental reasons. These trends suggest the interlocking psychological, social and cultural dynamics that keep us habitually and routinely eating meat might be beginning to loosen. Films like Carnage also contribute to this unravelling, opening up our imagination to alternative futures. If you watch it, I hope it raises a few laughs, but also offers some (plant-based) food for thought."
"When it comes to reducing carbon emissions, one of the biggest hurdles is the world’s addiction to flying. And this is only going to get more intense as developing countries grow bigger middle classes who want to explore the world for business and pleasure. In the UK, the climate change minister, Nick Hurd, has named transport as one of the two biggest environmental challenges. But while the government continues to invest in research and infrastructure for electric vehicles, clear action on addressing carbon dioxide for air transport has been lacking. Our researchin collaboration with Manchester Metropolitan University and Missouri University of Science and Technology has shown that greener aviation fuels could cut not only carbon emissions but also reduce wider air pollution and improve air quality – a key issue in the ongoing debate around Heathrow’s proposed expansion. The landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on addressing climate change did not include two sectors – aviation and maritime. This is despite aviation accounting for 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions. This figure is growing by around 3% a year. Attempts to decarbonise the aviation sector have been complicated.  The process has been delayed by governments trying to agree on how to account for emissions – if a Dutch airline takes off in America and lands in Brazil, which country should take the responsibility for those emissions? The good news is that, in the autumn of 2016, the world’s governments came together under the UN’s specialist agency for aviation, the ICAO and finally reached an agreement. But this agreement is still voluntary and allows airlines to “offset” their carbon emissions.  Beyond this, the industry has set itself a targetto achieve carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and to halve emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. This ambition can only be achieved by a combination of efforts including improvements in engine and airframes, such as new materials to make aircraft lighter, a more emissions-optimised approach to air traffic management and, crucially, by introducing greener alternatives to jet fuel. These alternative aviation fuels could offer the UK airline industry between 15% and 24% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050. The UK government is starting to take action, including issuing a consultation on whether to increase the obligation it puts on airlines to increase the level of so-called “renewable fuel” used currently. Running in parallel with this has been a consultation on the future growth of Heathrow airport – and, even in this, alternative fuels could play a part both in terms of lower CO2 emissions if alternative fuel use is increase, and because these fuels contain fewer particulates than conventional fuels.   Our research has shown that particulates from air travel could be reduced by up to 60% by using synthetically produced fuels from feedstocks such as old cooking oil. In simple terms, the oil-baring feedstock can be heated with a catalyst to change its structure and extract the useful chemicals to form a type of fuel that can be used to power jet aircraft. There are, of course, challenges which need to be overcome if the role of alternative aviation fuels in tackling climate change and air pollution is to be realised. Aviation fuel has not changed substantially since the 1960s. The focus of  improvements in the efficiency of engines and airframes has been on the continued improvements to technology to the point where we have a highly optimised system based on the use of traditional fuels. If the industry adopted fuels developed from non-conventional sources such as bio-crops this may, in turn, make it possible for the indsutry to make further improvements in engine and airframe technologies based on new fuels. There are three major challenges facing the industry. Safety: This is the most obvious problem to overcome. The approval process for new fuels is extremely rigorous – airlines will not use fuels unless they know they are completely safe and will not affect the operation and reliability of the aircraft. This process can take several years to complete. To date, only a handful of alternative production routes have been approvedand the sector’s experience of dealing with new molecules in the jet fuel is increasing. Better modelling and earlier testing of fuels should help reduce the time, and cost, of this approvals process and efforts such as the US FAA and the ASCENT programme which aim to accelerate the approvals process in the future. Economics: The technology for producing alternative aviation fuels is still relatively immature and at a small scale which means that the cost remains higher than for fuel from conventional sources. Further research and development – and increasing the scale of production – will address these issues, as will the introduction of regulations which reward and incentivise airlines to use these fuels. Sustainability: We need to ensure that the production of alternative fuels works for the environment and people in the regions where these are produced. So, for example, in the case of biofuels, these shouldn’t compete for land with vital food crops. The use of municipal waste or offgases from industrial processes are two alternatives which do not compete with land use are gaining some traction as alternative fuels. This is an issue that will only get more urgent as more people in developing economies choose to travel by air. We’ve already made a good start – since 2011, more than 2,200 commercial flights have used alternative fuels– but this has to be put in a context of more than 100,000 flights being made worldwide each day.  While the current agreement is voluntary, ICAO has managed to create one of the first global agreements to apply to a specific sector on carbon emissions. Industry and academia now need to deliver the advancements – supported, needless to say, by national governments. That will be crucial if we are to see greener skies overhead any time soon."
"Thailand’s famous “tiger temple” is finally being closed down, after nearly two decades of controversy. The popular tourist attraction near Bangkok allowed visitors to handle and pose with the animals – if you’ve seen one of your Facebook friends (or Tinder matches) cuddling up to a tiger, it was probably there. A raid by Thai police discovered 40 tiger cub carcasses preserved in freezers, while one monk was caught trying to flee with skins and fangs. Certain adults that had previously been micro-tagged were missing. Police have charged 22 people, including three Buddhist monks, with wildlife trafficking. Authorities are currently removing and resettling more than 100 tigers to safe locations across the country, amid allegations that the temple was only ever a front for the lucrative but illegal trade in tiger parts – which the temple’s managers deny. I first visited the site back in 2008, as part of a wider project tracking the expansion of tiger farms across China and South-East Asia. I wanted to investigate what captive tiger breeding meant for the dwindling population of the big cats in the wild. Claims of conservation value were everywhere. Multilingual signs said the “temple” was rescuing tigers from a poaching epidemic that was targeting Thailand and its last remaining wild spaces. Tourist money was supposedly vital for the tigers’ Buddhist monk guardians to care for their wards. Some of the tigers were paraded each day before being chained in an open-air display area, often in sweltering conditions, to indulge a growing tourist fad for selfies and intimate encounters with captive wildlife. Cubs were bottle-fed by monks, creating lucrative photo opportunities. Other tigers, unsuited to display, were kept out of sight in their cramped and unsanitary concrete enclosures. Investigations by NGOs claim the selfie-friendly tigers have gone through a rigorous form of “training” regime, employing a range of circus techniques, including beatings and punishments. One alleged method involved urine spray collected from other tigers. This is a particularly brutal practice when dealing with territorial animals – a rival’s urine is the ultimate tiger repellent. Allegations also persist that those animals selected for display were sedated and heavily chained in order to ensure the safety of tourists. The temple denies drugging its tigers. The temple was founded in the 1990s as a sanctuary for rescued animals, but soon expanded after setting up a tiger breeding programme. These “tiger stocks” have no real conservation value however, as we can’t be sure what subspecies they are and many will be hybrids. There’s basically zero potential for reintroduction into the wild. Tigers are notoriously difficult to “rewild” and even if it were possible, any habituation to humans would mean they’d pose a significant danger to people.  Therefore, as its big cat numbers have grown, so too have rumours as to the true nature of the facility.  Tiger parts and their derivatives have long been valued by the lucrative traditional Chinese medicine industry. Their bones can reach £300 per kg, while an entire skin is worth tens of thousands of dollars. A tiger penis costs around US$1,300. Tales of missing, unaccounted-for animals, have persisted. In April 2015 authorities raided the site following a tip-off by a whistleblowing vet who claimed at least three had recently gone missing. Earlier this year National Geographic and the NGO Cee4life alleged that, beneath its thin veneer of respectability, the tiger temple is merely a front for a more insidious and illegal trade in wildlife – a claim perhaps validated by the gruesome discoveries on the latest raid. However, the monks who run the temple deny the allegations. Although the removal of the tigers has been widely applauded, the “tiger temple” is but one of many, encompassing hundreds of tiger farms across the region that collectively contain untold thousands of big cats. Conditions in this wider network are equally barbaric, if not more so, although the rationale behind their existence is similar: conservation. Proponents of tiger farms argue that a legal supply of skins, bones or claws actually reduces the pressure on wild populations. It’s a fairly simplistic supply-side economic argument – flood the market with cheap farmed goods and there would apparently be no need for poachers.  Opponents of tiger farms point out the legal trade simply legitimises the products and means people also want cheaper skins from wild animals. Opponents want to directly reduce demand for these tiger parts and advocate zero tolerance for any form of illegal trading. The “tiger temple” has consistently drawn most of its criticism over animal welfare. However, should the trade angle be proven, it would clearly contravene domestic law introduced to comply with international obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This closure should be the first of many. Pressure can now be exerted on other ventures across Asia that turn tigers into exploitable commercial resources. Such facilities have no real conservation value and their sort of tourism is far from the responsible, educational experience that could make us truly appreciate wildlife – as wild animals.  The task now is to ensure that Thailand’s tiger crackdown is the beginning of a more concerted effort to outlaw animal cruelty and illegal trade wherever and whenever it exists. Otherwise, the entire episode may well turn out to be a wasted opportunity."
"Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil and former secretary of state in the Trump administration, has denied in court that the oil and gas giant committed fraud by concealing from investors the true financial impact of the climate crisis. Tillerson told the New York supreme court that Exxon had acted properly over disclosing its financial exposure to climate-related regulations while he was chief executive.  Leticia James, the New York state attorney general, is suing Exxon over claims it misled investors over the costs associated with the climate crisis. Exxon is accused of misleading investors over the business risks caused by regulations to address the climate crisis. The company is accused of covering up the costs it will incur from government rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The case represents just the second time a climate case has gone to trial in the US. Exxon has long been a target for environmentalists, not only for being a major contributor to the climate crisis but also over revelations that it knew for decades that burning oil and gas would dangerously heat the planet. New York’s lawsuit accuses Exxon of using a public “proxy cost” of up to $80 per ton of carbon emissions to account for regulations that would limit planet-warming emissions, while internally using figures of $40 a ton, or nothing at all, to allow it to make more environmentally damaging investments. An Exxon spokesman has previously said that it properly applies two different metrics – a “proxy cost”, intended to reflect the impact of all climate policies on global demand, and a greenhouse gas cost which relates to actual levies placed on fossil fuel projects in a certain jurisdiction. Under questioning, Tillerson said: “We don’t know how else to model what future policy impacts might be. But whatever policies are, ultimately they come back to either your revenues or your costs.” The former Exxon head, who served as US secretary of state in Donald Trump’s government for just over a year before being fired in March 2018, added: “If you go back to the history of this, this was all fairly new.” Tillerson said he did not remember the climate costs being a determining factor in any decision made during his decade-long tenure at the helm of Exxon, which ended in 2016. James’s office has sought to cast Tillerson as a central figure in the securities fraud case, with Kevin Wallace, acting head of the attorney general’s investor protection bureau, telling the court last week that the former chief executive was “deeply involved” in working out the impact of climate science upon Exxon’s business prospects. On Wednesday morning, Tillerson said several times that he did not recall email conversations with colleagues on the cost of carbon. During his time at Exxon, Tillerson used an email alias, calling himself “Wayne Tracker”. Tillerson did, however, say that he supports the Paris climate agreement, which Trump announced during Tillerson’s tenure as secretary of state that the US planned to withdraw from, and that he favoured a price on carbon emissions. Exxon has denied any wrongdoing over its pricing of carbon and accused the lawsuit of being politically motivated. The case is among the most high profile of around a dozen rather different lawsuits launched by jurisdictions across the US that are attempting to claim compensation from fossil fuel companies for the damage caused by rising sea levels, storms, heatwaves and other impacts stemming from the climate crisis. “The attention this case received certainly places a harsh light on Exxon which must make them uncomfortable,” said Michael Gerrard, an expert in climate law at Columbia University. “They tried for years to stop this case from happening. This is all at least as much about reputation as it is about money.” Climate activists staged protests at the start of the Exxon trial and have kept up their criticism of the company since then. “Rex Tillerson is a climate criminal,” said Dominique Thomas, north-east regional organizer of climate group 350.org. “Yesterday was the seventh anniversary of Superstorm Sandy; a grave reminder that the lies of people like Rex Tillerson cause that kind of climate destruction.”"
"Creeping desertification in China is swallowing thousands of square kilometres of productive soil every year. It’s a challenge of gigantic and unprecedented proportions.  The rate of desertification increased throughout the second half of last century and, although this trend has since stabilised, the situation remains very serious. More than a quarter of the entire country is now degraded or turning to desert, thanks to “overgrazing by livestock, over cultivation, excessive water use, or changes in climate”. The Gobi desert alone gobbles up 3,600km2 of grassland each year. China’s own State Forestry Administration has identified land desertification as the country’s most important ecological problem, and climate change will only make things worse. Ecological disasters have social effects. Desertification threatens the subsistence of about a third of China’s population, especially those in the country’s west and north, and could pose serious challenges to political and economic stability. It costs China roughly RMB 45 billion (US$6.9 billion) per year. Research shows that “for seriously desertified regions, the loss amounts to as much as 23.16% of … annual GDP”. The fact that one third of the country’s land area is eroded has led some 400m people to struggle to cope with a lack of productive soil, destabilised climatological conditions and severe water shortages. Droughts damage “about 160,000 square kilometres of cropland each year, double the area damaged in the 1950s”.  Blaming the desertification on overgrazing and bad cultivation, the state has since 2005 started to reallocate millions of people from dry and barren territories under its controversial and hotly-contested “ecological migration” programme. Deforestation has only made things worse. Greenpeace writes that only 3.34% of the country’s original forests remain intact, of which “only 0.1% is fully protected”.  Despite extraordinary efforts by the government to reduce the rate of erosion, culminating in the largest reforestation project ever undertaken, the government itself conceded in 2011 that the “desertification trend has not fundamentally reversed”. Dust and sand storms have intensified and now pose provocative geopolitical challenges. The Gobi desert which spans China and Mongolia is the world’s second largest dust source, after the Sahara. Whirling soil sediments are an annual plague in western China but also move all the way across the Pacific and beyond. Traces of China’s deserts have been found as far away as New Zealand or the French Alps, and “yellow dust” costs the Korean and Japanese economies billions of US dollars each year. Even worse off is Mongolia, which itself is facing desertification, and will be particularly affected by global warming. Inhaling this dust has devastating effects on the health of animals and humans alike. Asian dust has in the past decade been linked to both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases while more recent research discovered “a statistically significant association between Asian dust storms and daily mortality”.  Dust storms also transport toxic pollutants, bacteria, viruses, pollen and fungi. Microbiologists looked at a dust storm in South Korea and found big increases in aerial bacteria. Dust and sand storms don’t respect international borders, so it’s no wonder they have become a big worry for multilateral governance. Back in 2005 the Asian Development Bank, together with several UN agencies and regional countries, drew up a master plan to promote cooperative solutions. More recently, dust was on the agenda at a 2015 trilateral summit attended by South Korea, Japan and China. Environment ministers from the three countries meet each year and have established special working groups to “improve forecasting accuracy and to develop measures of vegetation restoration in source areas in China”. These are positive steps. China can’t pretend its desertification is its own problem as the effects on other countries are too obvious. Swirling dust storms have forced other states to take a direct interest in China’s desert sands. A version of this article also appears on the University of Nottingham’s China Policy Institute Blog."
"As a keen environmentalist, Paul Coleman has travelled the world, walking vast distances to plant trees and raise awareness about climate change. At the end of 2004, he had just finished a walk in Japan when he met Konomi Kikuchi. “I was giving a presentation that was being translated into Japanese for the audience,” he says. “I noticed she was laughing at my jokes before the translation.” Konomi, a writer, says she was inspired by the Briton’s mission to spread the message about the environment. The author of 11 books, she was keen to write about Paul and his life’s work on her blog. Shortly afterwards, Konomi’s editor read her blogpost and asked her to write a book about Paul. To celebrate its publication at the 2005 Expo in Nagoya, he planned to walk round the island of Okinawa. “I was fascinated by his character,” Konomi says. “So I asked if I could go with him on part of his trip.”  They ended up spending a week together. “I discovered that he has a great sense of humour and a big heart. He is so passionate about nature and the planet. It made me rethink the way I had been living my life.” Konomi loved exploring the outdoors. By the end of the week, Paul had fallen in love with her. “I realised her whole personality was wonderful. She’s very giving and has such a loving nature. She’s the whole package.” Konomi had recently come out of a relationship and wasn’t sure if she was ready for something new. “Paul was happy to take things slowly – or just be friends if that was what I wanted. He accepted me for who I was.” This acceptance encouraged her to take the plunge and their relationship progressed quickly. In September 2005, they were married in Japan. Several months later, Paul was invited by the Earth Day movement to take part in a three-month walk around China, Korea and Japan. “The trip was designed to unite the Earth Day movements in those three countries and send a message of goodwill,” he says. “We started at the Great Wall of China in January in temperatures of –15C, which was extremely challenging for Konomi.” She says she almost gave up but Paul encouraged her to persevere. “I was carrying all my makeup and cosmetics, which was making it even harder. Eventually, he persuaded me to ditch them to make my bag lighter. I’ve never worn makeup since!” When they married, Paul had promised that they would find the “most beautiful place in the world” to live. In 2007, they bought some land in Aysén, a remote area of Patagonia in Chile. Accessible only by ferry and five hours from the nearest city, the region is surrounded by glaciers and forests. “From the first moment, I fell in love with it,” says Konomi. Over the next few years, the couple built a home from scratch. “There is no road to the house so we carried all the materials on our backs,” says Paul. “It was his idea to build the house but I had total faith in him,” says Konomi. “If he could walk round the world, he could make this happen.” To create the sustainable lifestyle they dreamed of, the couple planted more than 1,000 native trees and built terraces, greenhouses and ponds to collect rainwater. Food is sourced from their land and they get fresh water from the stream. The couple now use their expertise to support local community projects. “We are trying to create a fully sustainable local economy,” says Paul. “At the moment a lot of food is imported, so it travels for many miles. If there’s a storm and supplies are cut off it means there is no food.” They have made plenty of friends there and enjoy exploring Patagonia in their spare time. “Every day is an adventure. It’s like living in a 1,000km national park,” says Paul. “Konomi and I are together for 24 hours a day but we are best friends. We have a wonderful life.” Want to share your story?

"High-profile disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima have given nuclear power a bad name. Despite 60 years of nuclear generation without major accidents in many countries including Britain and France, many people have serious concerns about the safety of nuclear energy and the impact of the radioactive waste it generates. The very high capital cost of building a plant is also seen as a significant barrier, particularly given recent low oil prices. Plans to build a new British plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset are facing fresh opposition after it emerged the estimated lifetime costs had risen to £37 billion. Yet the high priority of reducing carbon emissions thanks to climate change means nuclear power looks more important than ever. Luckily, the next generation of reactors could hold the answer. With more in-built safety systems and a way to reuse old fuel, they are set to make nuclear power safer and, potentially, cheaper. Human error and a natural disaster played major roles in the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents, respectively. But in both cases, the failures occurred when the plants could no longer keep the reactors cool enough. At Chernobyl this was because of deliberate action and human error, and at Fukushima because the backup generators to drive the cooling pumps had been destroyed as a result of the tsunami. An important reason why nuclear power is so expensive is the complex engineering, exacting standards, and advanced manufacturing technology that is used to ensure safe operation. For example, plants usually sits on a “nuclear island” of reinforced concrete that acts as a stable base for the plant and provides a barrier of last resort in case radioactive material is released. The pressure vessel at the core of the plant is made from carefully alloyed and fabricated steel to prevent it from becoming brittle from the decades’ worth of radiation it has to endure.  Today’s reactor designs also have far more safety features than older installations. These range from duplicate emergency cooling systems to prevent overheating even if some systems fail, through to so-called “core catchers” that would contain the reactor core in a worst-case meltdown event. Some designs will cool passively in the event of a loss of power to the cooling circuit (as happened at Fukushima). The heat from the core will gradually dissipate from the walls of the pressure vessel and through the cooling circuit by convection. The reactors that are being constructed today benefit from 60 years of experience gained in the design and operation of nuclear power plants around the world. But future reactor technologies –- so-called “Gen IV” designs – offer even better inherent safety. One of their key features are fully passive cooling systems so the reactor is never dependent on external power for safety. The reactor is carefully designed so that overheating actually reduces, rather than increases, the power output of the core. The core and cooling systems are not pressurised, and using liquids other than water for cooling prevents the risk of creating hydrogen: both of which drastically reduce the risk of explosions as occurred at Fukushima. Gen IV reactors will also allow more efficient use of nuclear fuel. The fuel in current reactor designs is used only once and then disposed of, which produces radioactive waste that will take hundreds of millennia to decay to a safe level. But this waste contains valuable resources of fissile material that can be reprocessed into new fuel. Burning this fuel in specialised “fast” reactors provides would be much more efficient and generate waste that decays safely within just a hundred years or so. It would also move us towards a closed fuel-cycle that would greatly extend the lifetime of the Earth’s uranium reserves. Another of the factors that makes nuclear power plants so expensive is that we haven’t built very many in recent years. This means that there is no industrial supply chain of companies with the expertise to manufacture the technology, reducing competition and limiting economies of scale. For the few plants that have been built, there have often been issues in construction quality as the project has progressed: with the concrete for the nuclear island, the welding of heat exchanger pipework, or the composition of the steel used for the pressure vessel. These have needed expensive fixes or investigation to assure regulators that safety hasn’t been compromised. So one way to reduce the costs of nuclear power plant is simply to build more of them. There are economies of scale in terms of having identical designs with the same requirements for construction, fuelling, operation and maintenance. In the UK in particular, attention is shifting towards so-called small modular reactors, or SMRs, that produce less power but that have lower upfront capital construction costs. Perhaps if the latest technology can also convince the public nuclear power has become safer, there will be the appetite to build enough plants to bring the costs down even more."

New study from the Geosciences Center Potsdam: There have been 18 flooding phases in upper Austria over the last 7000 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Tanslated, edited by P. Gosselin)
The pattern in society today is clear to see. Whenever a storm hits a region and submerges terrain in water, or if a drought destroys crops, then the one to blame is quickly found: It has got to be man and his debaucherous CO2-spewing lifestyle that is bringing the climate into a state of catastrophic instability. In former times witches and sorcerers were made responsible for meteorological extremes, and they were burned at the town square so that future bad weather could be prevented. Like today, back then no one really cared about scientific arguments.
But here one only needs to look over the scientific literature in order to recognize that storms and weather extremes have always been the case and things really aren’t any different today. Yet another new study has just come out showing this, appearing in the November 2013 edition of the Quaternary Science Reviews, by a team of scientists led by Tina Swierczynski of the Geoforschungszentrum (GFZ) Potsdam. The scientists examined sediment deposits taken from the Austrian Mondsee and they were able to identify the development of flooding phases of rivers in the region caused by heavy rainfalls in the spring and summers. The geological archive goes back more than 7000 years.
In total Tina Swierczynski and her colleagues found 271 flooding events that had occurred during 18 flood-rich phases, each having a duration of 30 – 50 years. The most important of these phases took place during the Neolithic (7100–7050 vyr BP and 6470–4450 vyr BP), the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age (3300–3250 and 2800–2750 vyr BP), the late Iron Age (2050–2000 vyr BP), throughout the Dark Ages Cold Period (1500–1200 vyr BP), and at the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (810–430 vyr BP). The scientists found that summer flood episodes in Lake Mondsee are generally more abundant during the last 1500 years, often coinciding with major advances of Alpine glaciers.
The study provides an historically important context that absolutely needs to be taken into account when assessing modern day flooding events. It is clear that there were always heavy rain phases in pre-industrial times. Therefore it also scientifically doubtful that the flooding events of today can be automatically connected to man-made climate change. Those who allow themselves to be seduced by the hypothesis of man-made climate are seriously under-estimating the potential of the natural fluctuation range of extreme weather occurrences.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems every time Stefan Rahmstorf makes a claim about climate, there’s almost always something very creative and acrobatic about the statistical approach he uses on which to base that claim. Rahmstorf seems to feel very much at home with the climate-Armageddon-theorists at his ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute.
===========================================
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Wringing his hands, Potsdam Climate Impact research Institute’s Stefan Rahmstorf keeps up his efforts to pour cold water on the warming pause. In an article at his Klimalounge blog on November 1, 2013 he posted a chart depicting the September temperatures over the last 130 years, represented by a bold red-colored moving average curve that shows no pause in warming (Figure 1). Rahmstorf has always said: The warming continues unabated.

Figure 1: Global September temperature for the last 130 years. Source: Klimalounge / Stefan Rahmstorf.
But wait, upon closer examination, September temperatures do show a plateau that is already more than 10 years long.
Weather Central Forum contributor DH7FB has taken a close look at the data and discovered where Rahmstorf used tricks to get warmer results. First with curve smoothing, if an especially long smoothing interval is used, then the plateau at the end disappears. Here Rahmstorf uses an enormously long period of more than 30 years without mentioning it in his blog. If one uses a smoothing period that is more common, say 5 years, then the warming pause becomes clearly visible also for September temperatures.

Using 5-year smoothing: light blue curve = September; bold blue mean = June, July, September, bold red = July-December. Source: wzforum.de/forum2/msg-2768981.
And why did Rahmstorf choose September and not some other month? DH7FB made a comparison with other monthly combinations and discovered that the Pinatubo-eruption in June 1991 had a significant impact on September and that it significantly steepened the global September mean value curve.
Reading tip: Take a look at the reader comments at Rahmstorf’s blog. It’s peppered with criticism.
==================================
It should be noted that in his blog article and comments, Rahmstorf repeatedly equates climate skeptics to the Tea Party, “the radical climate skeptical wing of the Republicans” and that “climate skeptic think tanks are financed mainly by the Koch brothers”.

New update: nofrakkingconsensus.com/look-again/
Greenpeace tweet from 17 September: “…we’ve got 4 boats in the water heading towards Gazprom’s Arctic rig. We’re going to try and stop the drilling.”
========================================
Online Spiegel today has an analysis by Benjamin Bidder and Christoph Seidler on the motives behind the detention of the 30 Greenpeace activists who tried to storm a Gazprom platform in September and the role of Russian politics. According to Spiegel, the story here is one of Russian energy behemoth Gazprom taking revenge on Europe for raids the EU had conducted on Gazprom European offices in 2011.
Spiegel reminds readers that Greenpeace was actually very much admired by Vladimir Putin, and that the environmentalist group until recently “enjoyed cover from the Kremlin“. Last year Greenpeace had even carried out a similar platform-climbing action in the Russian Arctic and had even used its strong connections to the Kremlin to facilitate the publicity-grabbing stunt. The stunt of 2012 was even led by Greenpeace director Kumi Naidoo himself (this year he stayed away). Spiegel also describes a number of special privileges Greenpeace seemed to enjoy with Putin’s government. Greenpeace seemed to have the Kremlin’s blessings.
But obviously something has gone terribly awry in the relations between Greenpeace, European environmentalism, and Russia. As the Greenpeace controversy sizzles, Putin is nowhere to be found on the issue and seems to have delegated the matter entirely to Russia’s justice authorities. Spiegel writes that the tone now appears to be one set by hardliners such as Alexander Prochanov, “one of the ideologues of Putin’s new, nationalistic course” who, according to Spiegel, openly said that they “regret not having blasted the dogs into the sky so that not a trace remains“. Another Russian politician accuses Greenpeace of “environmental extortion“.
So what happened?
Greenpeace claims that it all happened without warning. Spiegel writes that this year the FSB Russian special forces were waiting for the activists and were perfectly happy to watch them “impale themselves on an open knife“. Spiegel writes that according to Moscow-based CPI think-tank director Alexei Muchin, “Putin had nothing to do with it“. But for Gazprom, the “last bit of patience had been exhausted. The company not only wanted to send a message to Greenpeace, ‘but also to the European Union.’ The Commission among other actions had ordered raids of Gazprom offices“.
According to that linked Spiegel article from October 2011, with the Gazprom raids the EU wanted “to break Gazprom’s monopoly“, which was shown “by correspondence and documentation confiscated in an investigation within the scope of the raid from last Tuesday.”

One could speculate that this all seems to point to a very cunning trap set up by Moscow, whereby the Russians pretended to be still best of friends with Greenpeace even after the October, 2011 raid of Gazprom offices in Europe. This false charm in turn emboldened Greenpeace to believe they could get way with anything, even with protest activities in Russia. Finally, last month, Greenpeace activists ran straight into the trap and into FSB handcuffs.
This is all a very messy situation for Europe – and just how the Russians like it. For example Germany’s former socialist chancellor Gerhard Schroder sits on the board of a major Gazprom project, acting as one of the key facilitators who made the construction of the North European Gas Pipeline from Russia to Germany possible. Schroder, a close pal of Putin, was Germany’s chancellor from 1998 to 2005 in a coalition government with the German Green party. Does anyone expect Schroder to lift a finger against Gazprom? Moscow surely has that base covered to insure he never does, and one gets the sense that the Russians are at least a dozen moves ahead of Europe in this complex, multi-dimensional chess game.
What’s more, Spiegel adds that today Gazprom is very closely tied to the FSB, “The son of ex secret service director Nikolai Patruschev is Vice President of Gazprom Dobytscha Schelf, a subsidiary company for offshore production.” For the time being, Europe appears hopelessly outmatched in its chess game against Russia. They need to find a Bobby Fischer quickly.
In its latest move the EU now views the seizure of the Arctic Sunrise as a “hostile act“. Spiegel writes:
The ‘Arctic Sunrise’ is sailing under the Dutch flag and the government in Den Haag is losing patience.”
Dutch Foreign Minster Frans Timmermans has had his staff write a letter of complaint for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg, claiming that the storming of the Arctic Sunrise “was illegal” and that “the crew should be free until the matter is checked for human rights“. Spiegel adds:
We are giving the Russians time until Monday, says the Ministry. Then we will contact the judges in Hamburg. ‘We will be prepared.'”

"Without nature, humans could be neither healthy nor happy. And yet the natural world can be completely ransacked without causing even a tiny blip on our usual measures of economic progress or poverty. A major UN environmental meeting recently looked at launching an assessment of the different values that people attribute to nature, and what nature contributes to human societies. However, these high level discussions will be futile unless our measures of societal progress expand to explicitly include what nature does for human well-being and prosperity, especially for poor people. Nature matters to people’s well-being in many different ways. It obviously provides us with basic needs such as food, clean air and water, as well as protection from environmental hazards. There is also a clear relationship with both physical and mental well-being, especially for those who are fortunate enough to have access to green spaces. Beyond these instrumental roles, there is also evidence from around the world that nature is a more fundamental contributor to people’s sense of self. It is an integral part of what constitutes well-being, captured for some in the awe-inspiring moments when standing on top of a mountain, the breath-taking view of a beautiful river, or in the feeling of freedom associated with traversing a wide open landscape.  Despite the value we get from nature, our measures of progress and well-being remain much narrower, focused on what is visible and measurable. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been the most prominent approach since the end of World War II, with GDP seen as a useful snapshot of the state of the economy and people’s well-being. What these figures often hide are those things, like the role of nature, that are not measured in the monetary economy, but are an important part of daily life and can be crucial for sustaining future prosperity.  There are alternatives. One that has gained some momentum is the Inclusive Wealth Index, which takes into account broader measures of human and natural well-being – its most recent assessment suggested that conventional GDP figures had greatly exaggerated growth over the period 1992-2010. In international development, the UN’s Human Development Index and the “multidimensional poverty index” both recognise a larger set of issues, combining material standards with measures of health and education. But they still do not adequately incorporate the role of nature. Ignoring nature creates some perverse paradoxes. Measured GDP might actually increase as a consequence of a major environmental disaster, because of the economic activity created by the clean up and repair. Meanwhile, the environmental losses themselves don’t show up in economic measures. A country could get rich by cutting down all its primary forests (and many have), but the associated loss of habitat and wild species would not feature in national accounts. Governments continue to make decisions based on a key set of headline figures. These include GDP and per capita income, which reflect economic prosperity, and, in poorer countries, the extent and incidence of poverty. But we can do better: our ongoing research focuses on developing environmentally-adjusted measures of multidimensional poverty, based on the insight that people are typically poorer when they do not have access to nature.  Our research suggests that failing to consider these missing environmental aspects can result in an incomplete assessment of the multiple dimensions and underlying drivers of poverty. Consequently, the identification of the poor, as well as an understanding of what makes them poor, risks being partial, thereby posing a challenge to addressing poverty adequately. The current status quo fails people, especially the poor, and also threatens future prosperity by undervaluing nature. Those who benefit from the current approaches are typically global elites who profit from environmental destruction (which goes unrecognised).  The losers are those most dependent on nature for their livelihoods and those especially vulnerable to environmental change. Even if nature is valued, it is typically converted into money equivalents, which favours those who are able and willing to parcel out nature into small commoditised bundles, which can then be sold to the highest bidder. This fails to take into account the views of those who believe that nature matters in other ways or in its own right, who care about the beauty of nature and the sheer joy that it provides to many. The consequences of neglecting people’s varied views and aspirations have become apparent from recent political events in Europe and the US. Nature matters to our well-being, and people see their relationship with nature in many different ways. Recognising this is a crucial step towards building a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable society."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Telegraph here has the story about what was in my eyes one of the most abhorrent crimes ever committed by science…in this case the chemical castration of a brilliant mathematician and war hero only because his sexual preference went against what was considered the moral, psychiatric, medical and scientific consensus of the time, i.e. homosexuality was criminal and an act of miscreants. Homosexuals were viewed as a threat to society and thus had to be subjected to mind and body altering treatments. Scientists at the time all agreed and said it was necessary.
And people (skeptics) who challenged this “consensus” were immediately labeled immoral and were ridiculed. Sound familiar?
History is filled with many other similarly horrific examples…some very recent: lobotomy and eugenics to name just two. Others include human sacrifices to appease angry gods, or the burning of witches at the stake for storm-brewing. All were sanctioned by consensus.
These are the kinds of things that happen when science runs completely amok.
Today we have an elitist group claiming that global warming/climate-weirding is the consensus of the science and anyone who disagrees is equal to being a “Holocaust denier” and is immoral, or just plain ignorant.
Some zealots have even called for “Nuremburg-type trials” for the criminal “bastards who deny global warming”. Indeed an elitist group of green supremacists and political leaders are calling for global society to undergo an energy-lobotomy, one that would leave our global economy and society in a vegetable state.
Whenever the medical and science professions start appealing to the authority of consensus, then think back to the horrors this invariably has led to countless times in the past. History is filled to the brim!
Their claims to consensus only mean they are completely in the dark.

"A climate protester has been taken to hospital and more than 20 others have been arrested while blockading an international mining conference in Melbourne after violent clashes erupted between the group and police. From 6am on Tuesday, hundreds of activists from a dozen different groups began blocking entry to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. They faced off against police officers, who say they had been forced to arrest “in excess of 20 protesters” who were blocking the disabled and wheelchair access to the building and refusing to move on. Two people were also arrested for assaulting a police horse. “Police continue to arrest protesters blocking access to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre,” a spokeswoman said. “Exact arrest numbers will be provided when we have them.” One police officer received minor injuries during the arrests and was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital. A protester was also taken to hospital in a stable condition after she was injured by a police horse. Callum, a protester who did not want to give his surname, said police were being “extremely violent” towards the group. “They’ve used batons and are being aggressive,” he said. “The horses shouldn’t be here as they get extremely nervous and have hurt a woman.” Other protesters have accused police of being aggressive, placing one man in a headlock and pushing another to the floor, as well as using capsicum spray. “I think the police have been incredibly hostile … I’m quite shocked by how aggressive they’ve been,” a protest organiser, Emma Black told 3AW radio. The International Mining and Resources Conference is Australia’s largest annual industry event and attracts delegates from the resources, investing and technology sectors. More than 7,000 people from nearly 100 countries are expected to attend the three-day event. Among them is Craig Ian McGown, chairman at Pioneer Resources, who said a bottle of water had been emptied over him and he had been pushed and forced to walk 40 metres with a woman next to him shouting “shame”. “I’m just very confused by people having too much time off,” he said. “I’m just in attendance at the conference because my company is involved in major projects that can help the country move forward.” Conference organisers say the protest action is based on misconceptions about the mining industry. This year the the event will consider the importance of battery minerals, used in the emerging electric car market, and the growing importance of ethical investment for resource companies. Protesters plan to disrupt all three days of the conference and will be joined by the Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, on Tuesday and the federal Greens MP, Adam Bandt, on Wednesday. Despite initial concerns about traffic disruptions, VicRoads said traffic was flowing through nearby streets and trams were running. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, described the protests as “disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI see New York Times science journalist Andrew Revkin has applied his musical talent to record and release a song criticizing evil black carbon:

I’m still trying to figure out people like Revkin. They constantly rail against the very things that make their lives pleasant, safe and fulfilling. To me it’s as rational as hating African-Americans, yet loving jazz and blues music to death. Makes no sense!
They want everybody else to stop using carbon, yet seem to immensely enjoy the benefits the black stuff brings. Society today without the petroleum industry is like an ice cream cone without ice cream. Without lights, we’re back in the dark ages.
If you don’t like carbon, well then don’t use it. Don’t use any fossil fuel, don’t use anything made of plastics, and don’t buy from any vendors that use plastics or carbon fuels…i.e. like hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, food processors, airlines, taxis, etc.. We’d all love to see you yourself live without plastic and petroleum first, i.e. bathing in a cold river, running around, donning a piece of hide, eating bugs and berries filled with parasites, and squatting over a hole to do your biz.

Man used to live without carbon fossil fuel, and it really sucked. They lived to be about 20 – on average!
Anyway I hope you like the music, I like it. But a Neil Young he’ll never be.
I’ll buy his CD (minus one song), but only after he says thank you to the petroleum industry, who made it possible for him to compose and produce the music in the first place. We all live in this world together, and it’s time people start appreciating everyone else’s effort. Stop being idiot ingrates.
============================
UPDATE: Andrew left a reader comment, which I repost as follows (my emphasis):
I’ve got to differ with you on this being a song about evil. It describes clearly all the stuff carbon does for us (“it’ll spin your wheels, it’ll nuke your meals, it’ll turn your night to day..”) and the downsides (greenhouse buildup, the occasional oil war). I did shift the lyrics a few years back to take out “Satan.” That resulted in some jabs (appropriate). I explained why here (and I think this constitutes the “thank you” you talk about): http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/qa_andrew_revkin.php?page=all [F]olk music is a plastic and evolutionary process. Originally, it said, “Satan came along and said, ‘Hey, try lighting this.’ He opened the ground and showed us coal and oil.” And, you know, I thought a lot about that. I probably approached the song initially in the voice of your traditional, Bob Dylan rabble-rouser. And now I look back, and I think, you know, it’s not Satan; it’s normal. It’s just us. So I changed it to, “Someone came along and said, ‘Hey, try lighting this,’” which is much more human and real. And as many of my free-market, blog-commenter friends would say, look at all the benefits that have come from burning fossil fuels.”

"When scientists examine the impact of humans on the planet, the focus is mainly on the extinction of species. But increasingly researchers are looking at the idea that humans, through animal domestication, relocation and hunting, have become an evolutionary driving force that has led to new species, new traits and novel ecosystems. A new paper, recently published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, argues that if we are to preserve the biodiversity of life that we value, we need to understand both the nature of this human-driven creation – a process known as speciation – as well as the effects of human-driven extinctions. Look at humans’ effects on Earth’s plant life. Over recent decades, the amount of new plant growth each year across the world appears to have been relatively constant. However, between 25% and 38% of this fresh plant growth is appropriated by humans – for food and other purposes – reducing the amount available for millions of other species.  Thomas Crowther and colleagues at Yale University estimated that before the industrial revolution there were six trillion trees on Earth. There are now only three trillion. This deforestation and the conversion of land to produce food, fuel, fibre and fodder, combined with targeted hunting and harvesting, has resulted in a rate of species extinction some 100 to 1,000 times higher than would have been expected without human intervention. This probably constitutes the beginning of the sixth mass extinction in Earth’s history – an enormous impact on the planet and one reason why many scientists have declared that we have entered the Anthopocene Epoch.  Species removal isn’t a random process: a disproportionate number of those driven to extinction are the larger animals, both on land and at sea. This “megafauna extinction” began 50,000 years ago: unbelievably, half of all large-bodied mammals worldwide, equivalent to 4% of all mammal species, have been lost in that time. And extinctions are not just confined to mammals: since 1500 ACE there have been 784 documented extinctions, including 79 mammals, 129 birds, 21 reptiles, 34 amphibians, 81 fish, 359 invertebrates and 86 plants. Humans have also domesticated around 474 animals and 269 plants to meet their needs, and this has led to the emergence of new species. Of the world’s 40 most common agricultural crops, eight can be considered entirely new species, just as animal domestication has created new species of animals such as the dog and domestic pig. Animal domestication has also led to a major shift in animal distribution. According to Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba, of the weight of all the planet’s land mammals, humans make up 30%, domesticated animals make up 67%, and wild mammals just 3%. Organisms have also been transported around the world – including crops, domesticated animals, and pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. This movement has led to a small number of extraordinarily common species such as the brown rat, new hybrid species such as mules, and a general homogenisation of the animal and plant life found on Earth.  This biological relocation started in the 16th century when species from the Old World of Europe and Asia were exchanged with those in the New World (the Americas). This is known as the Colombian Exchange, which led to the globalisation of human food, with New World crops such as maize/corn, potatoes and manioc/cassava swapping places with Old World crops such as sugarcane and wheat. Domesticated animals swapped continents, too. Many of these plants and animals have since undergone rapid evolution in their new environments, leading to the emergence of new species. Accidental transfers from Europe occurred, too: smallpox, measles and typhus killed over 50m people in South and Central America during the colonisation of the New World. These exchanges continue today, and invasive species have become a major concern on all continents. Mark van Kleunen and colleagues at the University of Konstanz suggest that 4% of plant species have been relocated around the globe, equivalent to all the native plant species in Europe.  These changes are the first of their kind since the supercontinent Pangaea separated about 200m years ago, but in fact the extent of the current epoch’s trans-oceanic exchanges are unprecedented. Most ecosystems have been altered by humans, to the extent that the concept of a “natural” biome, completely free from human influence, is obsolete. This has led Erle Ellis at the University of Maryland to suggest that we consider them Anthromes – those ecosystems where most of characteristics have been reshaped by human activity. While many have undergone significant loss of biodiversity, through change they also create environments that allow opportunities for the emergence of new species. An interesting example is that of the common house mosquito (Culex pipiens) which has become adapted to London’s underground railway and established a subterranean population of mosquitoes distinct from any other on Earth. Now called the London Underground mosquito, it has diverged sufficiently from its cousins above ground that it can no longer interbreed with them and exhibits significantly different behaviour. So through breeding, harvesting and transport of crops and animals, and the impact of higher air and surface temperatures that result from greenhouse gas emissions, humans have, and continue to, alter the evolutionary process of the other species sharing this planet with us.  If we consider also the scientific development of diverse new biological products such as antibiotics, pesticides and novel genetically engineered organisms, humans have indeed become the world’s greatest evolutionary force capable of shaping our world by creating new species and destroying others. If we are to help preserve the millions of species on Earth, we must consider the impact of humans in terms of these creative and destructive forces."
"Chile’s embattled president has been forced to cancel two major international summits after government concessions failed to defuse weeks of violent protests that have seen thousands of arrests, left at least 20 dead and sent shock waves across Latin America. Sebastián Piñera made the announcement on Wednesday morning, telling reporters Chile would no longer be able to host November’s Apec trade summit and the COP25 UN climate conference the following month. World leaders including Donald Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, had been due to attend the first event while climate champions including the teenage activist Greta Thunberg were expected at the second. Piñera blamed the “difficult circumstances” Chile was facing for the decision and said his government’s primary concern had to be “fully restoring public order, security and social peace”. “This has been a very difficult decision – which has caused us great pain – because we understand perfectly the importance [of the events] for Chile and for the world,” Chile’s centre-right president said. “When a father has problems, he must always put his family before everything else. Similarly, a president must always put his own countrymen ahead of any other consideration,” Piñera added. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate change executive secretary, said the UN was “exploring alternative hosting options” for the climate summit after being informed of the decision in a letter from Chile’s environment minister. Piñera said he had warned other world leaders of the cancellation. Chile’s protests began in mid-October as a student-led fight  against a 3.7% hike in metro fares. But those demonstrations quickly swelled into a much broader mutiny against inequality, the cost of living and police repression. According to Chile’s Human Rights Institute, 3,535 people have been arrested since 17 October while 1,132 people have been taken to hospital – 38 of them with gunshot injuries. On 18 October Piñera declared a state of emergency after violence broke out on the streets of the capital, Santiago, later declaring the country “at war” with “evil” delinquents. After such moves failed to quell the unrest, Chile’s president tried to placate protesters with a conciliatory televised address in which he asked forgiveness for the “shortsightedness” of the country’s political leaders. Piñera also unveiled a string of progressive economic reforms, a cabinet reshuffle and the decision to end nightly curfews in an effort to calm tensions. But those concessions appear not to have been enough. Daily street marches continue to call for Piñera’s resignation. Schools and offices are functioning sporadically. Lines at supermarkets have eased but little remains of the routine that just two weeks ago led Piñera to declare Chile an “oasis” in an increasingly volatile region. On Saturday an estimated 1 million people poured on to the streets of Santiago for a peaceful protest that was reputedly the country’s largest since the dying days of Gen Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship in the late 1980s. “It is absolutely logical for no one to come. We’re in no shape to receive presidents at the moment. I support the decision,” said Marcia Ruiz, a 56-year-old protester who was outside La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace, on Wednesday. “The president lost control of this on day one,” Ruiz added. “It’s sad.” The last-minute decision to cancel the UN summit is a blow to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency and will fuel fears that a vicious cycle is emerging in which divisions between and within countries make it impossible for states to act together to deal with the underlying causes of unrest. It is also the second setback for international climate talks in less than a year. Brazil had been due to host COP25 but pulled out last year after the presidential election victory of the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, who has pursued an anti-globalist agenda. A UK government spokesperson said: “We understand Chile’s decision to withdraw from hosting COP25. We will work closely with Chile and other important partners to help ensure that the crucial work due to be undertaken at COP25 is not affected. The UK government remains committed to bringing world leaders together to tackle climate change in Glasgow in 2020.” Miguel Crispi, a sociologist and founder of the Chilean political party Democratic Revolution, said: “The cancellation of #COP25 is very bad news. It was a great opportunity to debate the climate crisis. This means the government is assuming that they can’t guarantee public order from now until December – and that is also worrying.” Peter Hartmann, the director of CODEFF Aysen, an environmental group organizing to protect the wild ecosystems of Chilean Patagonia, said: “It’s a shame because the summit was an opportunity for Chile to be more coherent in their environmental outlook and to bring international attention to the environmental issues in Chile.” Many activists will now be cancelling flights and hotels in Santiago but several groups are already on their way. School climate strikers from Europe are in the middle of the Atlantic on their way to South America. “We just heard COP25 has been cancelled. We will have a meeting about this now on board, please keep us updated and any ideas are welcome. They can cancel the COP but can’t cancel the movement!” the group tweeted."
"With a quarter of the world’s human population already living in regions that suffer from severe water scarcity for at least six months of the year, it is perhaps not surprising that the World Economic Forum recently rated water crises as the largest global risk in terms of potential impacts over the next decade. Electricity generation is a significant consumer of water: it consumes more than five times as much water globally as domestic uses (drinking, preparing food, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets and the rest) and more than five times as much water globally as industrial production. While electricity generation consumes far less water than food production globally, it is expected that there will be enormous changes in the water demands of electricity over the course of the 21st century. The International Energy Agency projected a rise of 85% in global water use for energy production between 2012 and 2032 alone.  These changes will be driven by a combination of factors. First, human population growth, which is estimated to rise from 7.4 billion people today to between 9.6 to 12.3 billion by 2100. Second, by improvements in access to energy for the 1.4 billion people who currently have no access to electricity and the billion people who currently only have access to unreliable electricity networks. And third, progressive electrification of transport and heating as part of efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Exactly how these changes in the water footprint of electricity are going to play out will depend on the national and international energy policies enacted over the next few decades. Historically, energy policies have been influenced by a multitude of factors (national availability of energy resources, financial costs, reliability of supply, security of supply and the like).  Following on from the Paris COP21 agreement, the carbon footprint of energy should have an increased influence on decision making in the sector. As can be seen from Figure 2, there are considerable differences in the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from different electricity generation technologies (g CO2eq/kWh), with average values ranging from just 4g CO2eq/kWh for hydropower to 1,001g CO2eq/kWh for coal, though there are significant regional and technological variations in values reported for the same energy source. While it is important to consider these factors in policy making within the energy sector, it would be a wasted opportunity if policy makers were to overlook the other environmental footprints of electricity generation – and in particular the water footprint – when making decisions on which technologies to support and prioritise. The fairest way to compare electricity sources in terms of their water demand, is to consider their lifecycle water footprint – the consumptive demand of water for construction and operation of the plant, fuel supply, waste disposal and site decommissioning, per unit of net energy produced. As can be seen from Figure 3, there are staggering differences in the water footprint of different electricity generation technologies. Minimum life cycle consumptive water footprints vary from 0.01 litres per kWh for wind energy, to 1.08 litres per kWh for storage-type hydroelectric power, though there are significant regional and technological variations in values reported for the same energy source. When these differences between sources are scaled up by the number of units of electricity required to meet the needs of the global population, the implications of the global water footprint of energy generation are phenomenal. Failure to plan and consider the water demands of energy will likely result in insecure and unreliable energy supplies and negative effects on the other important users of freshwater. We have recently observed the impacts of droughts on US energy supplies from thermoelectric plants and hydropower plants. If policy makers fail to take into account the links between energy and water, we may come to a point in many parts of the world where it is water availability that is the main determinant of the energy sources available for use.  This will inevitably force countries to make emergency decisions on the distribution of scarce water between generating electricity or producing food, maintaining health and sanitation, maintaining industrial production, and/or conserving nature."

"A citizens’ assembly is needed to reform Britain’s democracy because parliament has failed to deal with the chaos over Brexit, respond to climate change or shore up the economic system, according to 70 campaigners including the environmentalist Jonathon Porritt and the former Labour cabinet minister Hazel Blears.In a letter to the Guardian, they call on the government to set up a special people’s assembly to tackle the urgent problems with the UK’s democratic system.  Assembly members would be selected in the same random way that people are chosen for jury service and parliament would be mandated to act on its recommendations, they said. The letter, organised by Neal Lawson, the director of Compass, which campaigns for a more equal, sustainable and democractic society, said democracy was “precious, but right now it’s in a mess”.“The problems are there for all to see in the chaos over Brexit, in our inability to respond to the climate crisis and in an economic system that keeps failing,” the letter reads. “These are all symptoms of the same disorder. The way we make decisions isn’t working. Our democratic system is in urgent need of renewal. “Power is too far away from people. We need the power to make changes in our lives and our communities. But too often we don’t know who can help or who is responsible. “Parliament and elections are stuck in the past. The structures and systems are in urgent need of an upgrade. And under the current electoral system too many voters are ignored.” The letter says Britain should learn from examples around the world and convene a citizens’ assembly, which should be given the best advice and the space to think through the challenges facing democracy. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a democratic settlement that works for us all. It’s up to us,” it says. Others to endorse the letter include the Labour leader of Camden council, Georgia Gould, the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, Alexandra Runswick of Unlock Democracy and the executive director of the Equality Trust, Dr Wanda Wyporska. The concept of a constitutional convention and a citizens’ assembly was used successfully in Ireland to examine the country’s biggest political issues. The assembly was composed of a chair and 99 citizens, randomly selected to be electorally representative. It met at weekends 12 times over 18 months, and considered five subjects: abortion, climate change, the ageing population, how referendums are conducted and fixed-term parliaments.   "
"The hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985 by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey, who described how ozone levels above the Antarctic were steadily dropping compared to the previous decade. This was quickly recognised as a severe environmental problem – and the culprit was identified as the unchecked use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Soon after, the Montreal Protocol banning the use of CFCs was signed and came into effect in 1989. Now, 27 years later, we have published evidence that shows the ozone hole is beginning to close.  CFCs are a family of non-toxic, non-flammable chemical compounds developed in the 1930s as a safe alternative to dangerous substances such as ammonia for refrigeration and spray can propellants. As CFCs were thought to be risk-free, their use grew enormously.  The chlorine atom is the component of CFCs that is responsible for ozone destruction. Very little chlorine exists naturally in the upper atmosphere as it generally emerges near Earth’s surface – for example from salt (sodium chloride, or NaCl) in sea spray – in water-soluble forms that are “washed out” of the atmosphere by snow and rain. CFCs on the other hand are not water soluble, so are extremely efficient at carrying chlorine high into the stratosphere at the level of the ozone layer. Once in the stratosphere, ultraviolet radiation breaks free the chlorine atom to destroy ozone and react with other substances.  The reason there is an ozone hole in the Antarctic is that it is the coldest place on Earth – it is so cold that clouds form in the Antarctic stratosphere. Those clouds provide surfaces on which the man-made chlorine from the CFC may go on to destroy ozone much more efficiently. Together with sunlight, this special chemistry is what makes springtime (late August to October) ozone depletion worse in the Antarctic. Our study, led by Professor Susan Solomon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alongside colleagues from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, shows that the rapid worldwide agreement to sign and implement the Montreal Protocol has paid off. Signed by all the countries in the world, it was the first universally ratified treaty in United Nations history.  We show that the average size of the ozone hole above Antarctica each September has shrunk from about 20m square kilometres to 16m square kilometres since 2000. There are other metrics that indicate the ozone layer is on the mend – such as observations that the ozone hole is opening about 10 days later than in 2000. These observations became even more meaningful through our study’s computer model simulations which meant we were able to attribute more than half of the hole’s shrinking to the reduction in CFCs.  While a trend showing the hole is shrinking is evident, the size has varied from year to year. This is in part due to the effects of volcanic eruptions. For example, the fourth-largest ozone hole occurred in October 2015 following the eruption of Calbuco volcano in Chile. The mechanism by which volcanic eruptions affect ozone levels is well-known: eruptions emit sulphur dioxide, which is converted into tiny airborne particles (aerosols) that enhance chemical conditions for chlorine to destroy ozone.  What is surprising here is that Calbuco was a relatively modest eruption – this underscores the need to monitor and describe such volcanic events carefully in order to account for natural variability in documenting the recovery of the ozone layer. Regardless of the annual ups and downs of the size of the ozone hole, it’s now clear that banning CFCs through the Montreal Protocol almost 30 years ago was the right decision. Because of swift international action, that decision is now bearing fruit and the Antarctic ozone hole is starting to heal – perhaps to close completely by as early as the 2050s. But even while we are on the way to resolving one environmental issue, the next is already upon us: man-made climate change. While the ozone hole is a relatively contained problem and involved only a single CFC-producing industry, the factors contributing to climate change involve many huge, established worldwide industries worth many trillions of dollars. The task ahead of us is great, nonetheless, tackling the ozone hole problem shows what can be achieved if we collectively set our minds to solving a problem."
"The “new world” monkeys of South and Central America range from large muriquis to tiny pygmy marmosets. Some are cute and furry, others bald and bright red, and one even has an extraordinary moustache. Yet, with the exception of owl and howler monkeys, the 130 or so remaining species have one thing in common: a good chunk of the females, and all of the males, are colour blind. This is quite different from “old world” primates, including us Homo sapiens, who are routinely able to see the world in what we humans imagine as full colour. In evolutionary terms, colour blindness sounds like a disadvantage, one which should really have been eliminated by natural selection long ago. So how can we explain the continent of the colour blind monkeys? I have long wondered what makes primates in the region colour blind and visually diverse, and how evolutionary forces are acting to maintain this variation. We don’t yet know exactly what kept these seemingly disadvantaged monkeys alive and flourishing – but what is becoming clear is that colour blindness is an adaptation not a defect.  The first thing to understand is that what we humans consider “colour” is only a small portion of the spectrum. Our “trichromatic” vision is superior to most mammals, who typically share the “dichromatic” vision of new world monkeys and colour blind humans, yet fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and even insects are able to see a wider range, even into the UV spectrum. There is a whole world of colour out there that humans and our primate cousins are unaware of. Yet while the eyes of insects and mammals look very different, they work in a remarkably similar way. Both capture and process electromagnetic waves reflected from objects or radiated from luminous sources. Both their eyes contain cells called rods and cones. Rods are specialised for low light levels, providing a sort of night vision. Cones are responsible for colour vision, balancing blue, red, and green to provide the perception of the visual spectrum of light. A problem in any cone type causes problems with colour perception. In the most common form of colour blindness, people have difficulty distinguishing red from green. Our colour blind ancestors may have found it tough to recognise when someone was blushing, for instance, or they may have had trouble choosing a ripe fruit or spotting snakes with colourful warning marks.  Similarly, a South American primate might have difficulty identifying social signals such as the bright red head that indicates fitness in the bald-headed Uakari. They may find it tough to identify ripe food or colourful threats such as an orange-furred ocelot or jaguar up against a green forest background.  But colour blind vision might actually be an advantage in some situations. After all, colour signals can be overwhelming, leading us to pay more attention to colours than patterns. Predators can exploit this by using camouflage to ambush their prey, so the ability to spot a threat is significant.  Colour blind people don’t have this same overload and are often able to see through the deliberate “noise” of coloured camouflage to spot the deeper patterns. During World War II, colour blind men were employed to break through camouflaged enemy positions and thereby spot possible targets for bombing. A certain colour blindness may also help create patterns as well as spot them: Vincent Van Gogh was able to create amazingly complex colourful patterns yet his palette shows a striking resemblance to defective colour vision. Low light also negates the advantage of regular eyesight. Even a trichromat won’t see colours in dim light conditions, such as in dusk or dawn, and this is a relatively bigger disadvantage for people – or monkeys – used to seeing the world in “full” colour. The ability to break camouflage and better vision under the dim light are accepted as advantages of a dichromatic colour vision. This is backed up by research at Belfast Zoo and in the wild at a research station in Peru’s Amazon rainforest, which found colour blind tamarins were much better than their trichromatic cousins at catching camouflaged crickets that tried to mimic bark or leaves.  However, these factors alone do not explain the maintenance of new world monkeys’ colour blindness. While they explain that there are advantages in being dichromat or trichromat, it does not explain why individuals in the same group share both colour vision systems. This polymorphism in primate species is unique among mammals and clearly there are major advantages still to be discovered.  The more I study this topic, the more I realise how curious primate vision is; for example, tetrachromatic people able to see “invisible colours” have recently been discovered. It’s thrilling to imagine which benefits of “defective” colour vision are still to be discovered."
"Britain and Europe’s largest airport is not the most obvious target for an eco-friendly rebranding. Yet Heathrow Airport recently unveiled a new sustainability strategy, Heathrow 2.0, to counter growing opposition to its expansion plans. Both the government and an independent Airports Commission have backed proposals to construct a new third runway at London’s largest airport hub. But the plans remain highly contested, with ongoing concerns about noise pollution, air quality and rising carbon emissions. Heathrow expansion has become an emblematic issue in the fight against climate change. At first glance, it is tempting to dismiss the launch of Heathrow 2.0 as yet another attempt at greenwashing. Indeed, those in favour of the new runway have made sustained efforts to depoliticise the issue ever since the 2010-2015 coalition government declared its ambition to put the environment and local well-being ahead of Heathrow’s growth. An airport that exists above politics gives the illusion that no one has to choose between planes and pollution. In fact, the current plans to render its new runway carbon neutral echo the failed policy of “sustainable aviation” under the New Labour government. This strategy was quickly discredited by scientists and environmentalists, because of its “cake and eat it” narrative, in which we could fly more and still cope with rising carbon emissions. Nonetheless, such arguments pepper Heathrow’s new vision for corporate social responsibility. Much is made of the expected benefits of new technologies and innovations, the role of increased connectivity in creating jobs, the enjoyment we gain from the social benefits of flying, and the commitment to carbon offsetting schemes to address rising emissions. Heathrow 2.0 even aspires to “‘decouple’ aviation growth from climate change” – a key pillar of the ideology of sustainable aviation. Yet Heathrow’s strategy at least engages with the idea of sustainable development, through what it calls “responsibility”. It promises to improve its practices as an employer, committing to a London Living Wage, and it pledges to put an end to human and wildlife trafficking. It wants to produce a “zero-carbon airport” with reduced emissions and “polluter pays” policies. Heathrow 2.0 might even satisfy local demands for better noise protection. But it’s the detail that really matters. In important respects, the plans lack clarity and ambition. Strategic priorities like a “noise envelope” to cap the overall disturbance emanating from the airport are often stated, but not accompanied with clear targets. Similarly, it is questionable whether locals will be too enthusiastic about targets to reduce late running aircraft after 11.30pm from 330 in 2016 to 270 in 2017. Or whether they will welcome no arrivals before 4.30am without clarity over the agreement to ban night flights from 11pm to 6am. As Heathrow itself accepts, importantly, the airport cannot deliver on most of the claims it makes. Of course, a carbon neutral airport is a worthy ideal. But it is the flights themselves that cause most carbon emissions and account for much of the noise pollution, while traffic to and from the airport also creates air pollution. Heathrow cannot control or make guarantees about fixing any of this. Indeed, at the heart of these limits to Heathrow 2.0 is the failure of the May government. The airport is simply trying to fill the void left by Theresa May and transport secretary Chris Grayling, who have abandoned their responsibility to offer policy leadership in this field.  A recent Heathrow report by MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee criticised the government for its lax interpretation of air quality directives, its failure to address local health impacts, its overly ambitious targets for ultra-low emission vehicles, and its absence of detailed plans for road improvements and new rail access to the airport. The committee also criticised the government for watering down proposals for an independent aviation noise authority and for not being clear about how to bridge the gap between theoretical models to reduce emissions and actual policy. Most concerning is that this absence of leadership betrays the emergence of a new “post-sustainable” aviation, designed to accommodate the challenges of Brexit. Gone are the attempts by the previous government to put climate change before new airports. In their place, the vital justifications and mechanisms for an expansionist agenda are carefully being assembled.  The risk is that green concerns will be pushed further to the margins, as people are increasingly urged to believe that human progress and innovation are enough to meet environmental challenges. In this emerging discourse, the demands of economic growth trump those of the environment and social well-being."
"Remain and Leave are finally talking about the environment in the EU referendum campaign. Most environmental professionals and green charities have expressed strong support for staying in the EU over the past few months, while independent experts agree that membership has overall been good for the country’s environment. But some from the Leave side are starting to ask whether the EU is really as green as it used to be and indeed whether the environment would be better out altogether. What little environmental discussion there has been up to now has tended to focus on beaches and climate change from Remainers, and on the VW emissions scandal on the Leave side.  However the environmental relationship with the EU ranges far wider than these few issues. To illustrate this, here are four EU rules which are little-known outside of policy circles but which have benefited the UK’s environment: European treaties, last updated with the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, set out who has “competence” – that is, who can do what in different policy areas. Environment is a shared competence, like agriculture, fisheries or transport. This means that member states like the UK cannot act unilaterally in these areas. So the UK government cannot adopt a “British Agricultural Policy” in addition to the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy.  But the rules are different for the environment, as set out in Article 193: EU member states can adopt more ambitious rules that complement European environmental regulation. This means that EU rules guarantee a minimum level of protection (and hence a level-playing field) throughout the continent, but do not prevent more ambitious countries from doing more if they so wish. EU waste laws set clear targets which have been instrumental in increasing Britain’s recycling rates. When adopted in 1999, the directive required “fundamental change to previous UK practices”, and there have been especially big advances in recycling biodegradable waste (including food waste). If you have a food recycling bin in your house, it’s largely thanks to the EU. While the UK has met EU targets for recycling biodegradable waste, it is struggling to meet its overall 2020 recycling targets and the government is currently trying to weaken new 2030 targets that are under discussion. British governments have failed to meet EU targets for cutting air pollution, which causes 40,000 premature deaths each year. These are legally-binding targets for the UK; they are much harder to roll-back than national targets.  The environmental law firm, Client Earth, contested the lack of ambition in the UK’s plans to remedy pollution, arguing they fell short of EU legal requirements. In 2015 it won its case in the UK Supreme Court, forcing the government to redraw its plans. The legal battle is still ongoing. Crucially, as with recycling biodegradable waste, the UK government is leading efforts in Brussels to weaken the 2030 targets currently under discussion. Since the early 1990s the energy efficiency of major white goods like refrigerators or washing machines has been labelled by the EU, with stricter and clearer labels introduced in 2010. These labels help consumers identify the most energy-efficient items (which cost less to run), while minimum standards push inefficient goods out of the market. Having the same labels throughout the EU guarantees a level playing field. Energy efficiency is the main criteria for consumers replacing refrigerators or washing machines and the UK government estimates replacing white goods with more efficient versions will bring £850m annual savings and cut greenhouse gases by more than 7m tonnes a year. These four examples illustrate some essential characteristics of EU environmental rules. They do not stifle ambition: more ambitious environmental rules can be adopted by states, so long as they do not create barriers to trade within the EU.  They are also harder to change (and roll-back) than national policies, so insulating environmental protection from short-term political shifts. The air and waste examples above highlight how the current government is seeking to water down future EU rules: as these policies are set in Brussels, the UK has to convince its European partners to roll-back environmental standards. After a Brexit, the UK could do this on its own.   EU laws also provide rights to information and access to justice for British civil society to hold its government to account – whether via European or national courts – as illustrated with the air pollution case. So while the EU is far from perfect, it can protect hard-won environmental laws from a short-term “pro-growth” agenda and empowers civil society in the UK and across Europe."
"It seems miraculous that any butterflies can survive a month of rain, but as soon as the autumn sun emerges so do red admirals and the occasional painted lady, en route for the sunnier south. The 59 British species are perfectly adapted for our weather but adjusting to rapid climate change is more challenging, as two new studies led by scientists from the University of York show.  Relatively cool regions should gain more warmth-loving butterflies than they lose but many species are not moving north as widely or quickly as expected. One reason is some species are isolated on fragments of suitable habitat, unable to expand through a human-dominated landscape. Climate change has helped the versatile comma spread from Yorkshire to Aberdeen in two decades. But the silver-studded blue, which requires heathland or grassland, has been unable to move between these rare habitats and expand its range. Another reason is butterflies and moths are emerging in spring on average between one and six days earlier per decade. Flexible species with multiple breeding cycles, such as the speckled wood, benefit from “more” time. But single-generation specialists, such as the endangered high brown fritillary, are thrown out of sync with the plants they feed on. "

A number of leading Swiss publications have recently expressed doubts over the claims made by the IPCC and its scientists. The Tagesanzeiger interview is just the latest.
First Lawson calls the IPCC’s admission that the global temperature hasn’t risen in 15 years “notable” and that it shows the climate models are “inadequate”. “The empirical findings contradict the claims about the future being made by the IPCC. That’s not the way to do science.”
(Note: All quotes are translated from the German).
Lawson does not dispute that CO2 has a warming impact on climate, but that the real question is: how much? “On this there are many different opinions“. Lawson believes that the IPCC agenda is mostly in the hands of alarmists who believe CO2 is mostly driving the climate. But Lawson says there has to be other factors. “Without a doubt, the most important one is solar activity.”
IPCC presents excuses and speculation
Lawson calls the assumption that the oceans have soaked up the heat “pure speculation, an excuse from alarmists who are searching for a reason to explain why they erred”. He says that there are no measurements from the deep sea to support this, and also dismisses the notion that CO2 may have caused the Gulf Stream to change, calling it “nonsense”.
On Svensmark’s cosmic ray theory, Lawson says that CERN has neither been able to confirm nor refute the theory, and that the theory remains interesting.
When asked about global warming causing more storms, Lawson is emphatic, saying this is not the case and points to greedy insurance companies.
It is completely false. The number and strength of tropical storms over the last decades has not increased, even if the insurance companies always claim to the contrary in order to justify their increasing premiums.”
On sea level rise, Lawson sees no data showing sea level rise is going to speed up and warns that this is fraught with uncertainty as it is a very complex phenomena involving the movement of land masses. (Story continues below)

Introduction starts on page 1 with full story on page 2. 
====================================
Fossil fuels the most efficient
In the interview, it is also clear to Lawson that global warming does not entail only disadvantages, but also brings a number of advantages. He cites the fertilization effects on plant growth from higher Co2. He also points to mankind’s ability to adapt to changing climate conditions as being far better today than ever.
On the question of whether the world should wean itself off fossil fuels:
Countries like China and India should not do so under any circumstances because it would put their economic development in jeopardy. Fossil fuels are and will remain the most efficient.”
He adds that he thinks it’s possible that Europe will go it alone on renewable energy, and claims that its “competitiveness would suffer enormously. … Except for Europe, no one on the planet believes in the end of fossil fuels. Higher energy prices would by horrible, especially for the poor!”
No consensus
The Tagesanzeiger then asks why he thinks he knows better than the IPCC scientists. Here Lawson delivers a lethal blow to the notion of “consensus”, reminding the Tagesanzeiger that many scientists agree with his position, among them Freeman Dyson. He also reminds the Tagesanzeiger that many of the climate scientists are not from the field of climate, but from other fields. Lawson was also former energy minister, and so he thinks he understands energy far better than David Cameron or Al Gore. He accuses David Cameron of populism with the climate change issue and that Cameron fancies himself as a sort of planet rescuer. Lawson reminds us that also Margaret Thatcher also had emphatically rejected the alarmist theories.
On why climate alarmism and the calls to abolish CO2 are today still very much in vogue, Lawson concludes:
After the failure of communism, new arguments were needed in order to be able to discredit the market economy. Also the belief in man-made climate change to some extent involves religious tendencies.”

"Climate campaigners are taking Norway’s government back to court to oppose its plans to open the Arctic for oil drilling despite a public commitment to tackle the environmental crisis. Greenpeace Nordic and Norway’s Nature and Youth organisation will appeal on Tuesday against the government’s decision to allow oil exploration in parts of the Arctic Ocean on the grounds that it violates people’s rights to a safe and healthy environment.  The green groups are expected to argue that the decision would breach a constitutional law, known as section 112, that calls on the government to safeguard a healthy environment for existing and future generations. They also claim the plans would violate the Paris climate agreement. Norway has pledged to help tackle rising global carbon emissions by divesting fossil fuel investments from its trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, but the government has continued to support new oil projects. Total carbon emissions from the fossil fuel-rich country are forecast to climb by 16% this year compared with the year before, after oil companies drilled 130 oil and gas wells in 2019. The campaigners claim Norway’s total exported greenhouse gas emissions are 10 times bigger than the domestic emissions from its production. The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s. Frode Pleym, the head of Greenpeace Norway, said: “The Norwegian government can no longer ignore the dangerous impact its exported oil is having on the climate. Climate change knows no borders. Oil is oil, no matter where it is burned, and the government needs to cancel all drilling for new oil in the Arctic. Not acting now violates the Paris agreement and Norway’s own constitution. That is why we are back in court.” The green groups first took the government to court in Oslo in 2017 after years of lobbying against oil exploration in the Arctic. The co-plaintiffs will have the backing of Friends of the Earth Norway and the Norwegian Grandparents Climate Campaign. The appeal comes weeks after the UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, David Boyd, delivered a stinging rebuke of the Norwegian government’s oil expansion in a report calling for an end to the country’s search for new oil. “Norway should stop exploring for additional oil and gas reserves, stop expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, and harness Norwegian wealth and ingenuity to plan a just transition to a fossil fuel-free economy,” he said. “Norway, as one of the world’s wealthiest nations and one of the world’s leading producers of oil and gas, must accept substantial responsibility for leading efforts in mitigation, adaptation and addressing loss and damage.” Gaute Eiterjord, the head of Nature and Youth in Norway, said it was deeply concerning to see Norway’s government “bury its head in the sand”. “It is the government’s obligation to safeguard a safe and healthy environment. The young generation, in Norway and all over the world, is worried about the prospect of an unsafe future,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media today are raving over Angela Merkel’s “huge victory“, with some even calling it “historic” or even a “blowout”, as Drudge does.
But this isn’t so by any means. Merkel’s government LOST and will soon no longer be in power. The perception of media outlets from Great Britain and in the USA surely has been distorted by a dense fog across the English Channel and the Atlantic. Merkel’s government was defeated. Her current government failed to get the votes needed to continue.
Somewhere along the line Merkel forgot that her government was a team effort and involved other team players. Although her party scored lots of goals and made spectacular plays that wowed the viewers, her team lost. She is the MVP, but on the losing team.
Typical of Merkel: when the going gets tough, she abandons her partners, throws them under the bus, but not without first giving them a swift, hard kick to the face. Had Merkel’s CDU/CSU party received a scant half a percent of the vote less and her junior FDP a scant half a percent more, her government would be sitting firmly in power today. But no, Merkel and her players insisted on being stars and abandoned their team mates. This is going to come back around soon enough.
We saw the same pattern when she ditched Germany’s nuclear power in the wake of Fukushima, and later when she brutally threw Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen under the bus after his disastrous CDU election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia. Immediately Röttgen resigned his position as head of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and on 16 May 2012 he was fired by Merkel and replaced by Peter Altmaier as the Federal Minister for Environment.
So in the aftermath of yesterday’s elections, what’s left is superstar Merkel on a defeated team searching for a new coalition partner. Now it’s her turn to beg.

Merkel’s CDU/CSU party only has two options: 1) form a coalition with rival socialist SPD party, or 2) try to forge a coalition with the hostile Greens.
Should the runner-up SPD party agree to form a coalition with Merkel’s CDU/CSU, then look for such a government that will try to force through the “Energiewende” (transition to renewables) with renewed vigor. Her previous liberal, business-friendly FDP party was the only element in German politics who to some extent applied the emergency brakes on the out of control renewable energy subsidies and feed-in tariffs. An SPD coalition partner will surely let up on the brakes, if not completely abandon them. A huge, almost two thirds majority CDU/SPD government would practically allow them to ram through any energy policy desired.
Should the Greens agree to form a coalition with Merkel’s party, a very unlikely scenario, but not one that can be excluded with the opportunistic Merkel, then the Energiewende gas pedal would surely get pushed to the metal.
With the FDP liberal coalition partner gone and licking its wounds, there is nothing left (except a fleeting chance to some rationality) in place to slow down the Energiewende and climate policy.
There is one other remaining possibility: both the Greens and SPD will refuse to form a coalition with Merkel’s conservatives. That would leave superstar Merkel without a team to lead, and wishing she had not thown the FDP under the wheels.

"Consumers are in an unprecedented dilemma over food. On the one hand, they have never had it so good. Supermarkets have spread worldwide and are awash with food. On the other hand the rate that over-consumption of food is growing globally is unsustainable – and its effect on the environment are already being felt. For the consumer, it’s a rosy picture – food expenditure as a percentage of total domestic spending has fallen since World War II and farm output has increased sufficiently to be able to feed growing populations, if only problems of distribution were sorted out.  This new food system is generally seen as a triumph of modernity and efficiency. It liberated consumer tastes – true, this was mostly first experienced by the urban mass market and in the West, but thanks to the internet and better communications, the luxury (and inclination) for people to eat what they want, and when they want it, is now present even in deepest rural areas and is spreading worldwide. It is no wonder that, almost everywhere, politicians are content to leave food matters to the mighty food industries – confident they will drive progress, lower costs and keep consumers happy. This has been the consumerist food deal of the past half century. It has been a great story, too, but is now leading consumers into a dark place. Consumers are literally being kept in the dark about much that modern science now knows about the food system and its impacts on our world. The edifice of the food economy is built on sand which is being eroded beneath our feet.  Food is either the major or one of the major drivers of climate change, water stress, land use, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, deforestation, the depletion of fish stocks. And that’s just where the food comes from. Turning away from the land and sea towards consumption, the diets people eat today are now the single biggest factor in premature death worldwide, and a key indicator of cultural change and social inequalities. Patterns of eating developed over centuries in tune with local climates are being turned upside down almost overnight by massive marketing and advertising which aims to get the consumer when young. The rise and spread of obesity now dwarfs malnutrition. The drive for cheap meats – nirvana for people for whom meat was expensive and a treat – has legitimised routine and profligate use of antibiotics in farm factories, to the point where the effectiveness of antibiotics is now threatened. This despite warnings it would happen, not least from Sir Alexander Fleming in his 1945 Nobel Prize acceptance speech for discovery of penicillin. For all the razzmatazz of food modernity, food is still low-wage work, and is the biggest employer on the planet. The UN estimates at least 1.3 bn people work the land, a third of them for no wages, in self-sufficiency. And across the food system of the rich world, food is a low-wage employer. In the UK, for instance, food retail, food service, farm work and food manufacturing, all pay below the national average.  The squeeze on profit margins is tight, particularly on farming. Government figures show British farmers add £8.5 billion of Gross Value Added (GVA) to the UK food chain, while the GVA for manufacturers is £26.9 billion, retailers £30.2 billion and caterers £29.1 billion. Consumers’ money is taken off the land, yet a fantasy is peddled that food comes from farmers. Among scientists, there is a remarkable consensus that the current policy direction cannot continue. These contradictions are unbearable – literally so, because if the world continues the trend to eat like the West, the burdens on ecosystems, healthcare systems and finance will be unsupportable. That, at least, is the uncomfortable conclusion one must draw, when one looks at the evidence. But since when has the politics of consumption been about evidence? The few studies conducted into consumers’ response to this big picture about unsustainable diets show that consumers become a little indignant when they find out. A careful study by Which? found consumers asking: why weren’t we told about this? They want to know more. Rightly so, but how, and from whom?   Hard-pressed teachers turn to commerce for fact sheets. Parents are too often in the dark, if truth be told. Nor could any food label convey the depth and scale of what consumers really need to know. Giant food companies have replaced schools and parents as sources of public “education”. They are the Nanny Corporations, replacing the fictitious Nanny State. They filter what people are to know. Coca-Cola’s annual marketing budget is US$4billion (£3.18 billion), twice the entire World Health Organisation annual budget in 2014-15, and much more than its budget for non-communicable diseases ($0.32 billion) or for promoting health through the life-course ($0.39 billion). How can this by unlocked? Consumers buying food too often without knowing the consequences. Politicians distancing themselves from this unfolding disaster. Workers and companies vying with each other to produce more for less. This is crazy ecological economics – self-defeating food culture. It piles up burdens on public health. It’s obvious really – a new politics of food has to unfold in which academics treat consumers with dignity and tell them the truth. Politics follows the public, not the other way round. So it’s the public which must be helped. The neoliberal rhetoric is of consumer sovereignty, yet everywhere they are kept in the dark."
"Species that evolved far apart have been thrown together by worldwide transport, global warming, deforestation and farming. This is increasing the rate at which plant hybrids are being produced and these new species can dramatically affect local plants, animals and ecosystems. We don’t know exactly how many new hybrids there are throughout the world but we do know humans are responsible for a good chunk of them. A third of the wild hybrids found in the British Isles, for instance, have one or more foreign parents. Those foreign plants were brought there, knowingly or unknowingly, by humans. Ecosystems in emerging economies could be particularly at risk, where land use is changing rapidly and international trade is still accelerating, for example the Amazon rainforest or the mountains of south China which are among the world’s richest natural locations. New hybrids combine the characteristics of their parents and, in some cases, this can help them thrive as invasive species. Back in the late 19th century, a native grass along England’s southern coast mated with an introduced North American grass. The resulting “English cordgrass” has since spread around the world, helped by people who used it to stabilise sand dunes from Asia to Australia and back to North America. In some places, it has become a noxious invasive plant. Hybrids can also damage local plants by serving as bridges to exchange genes between native and non-native species. The influx of foreign genes can lead to a sort of genetic “melting pot” where the where the identity of the native species is blurred beyond recognition. Some call this “extinction by mating”. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Although the current rate is alarming, hybridisation is part of the natural world and has been slowly going on for millions of years. Many species of plants and animals hybridise naturally, and this exchange of genes between species could be behind of some of the most impressive examples of evolutionary change. The extraordinary diversity of the “cichlid” fish found in Africa’s great lakes is partly down to hybridisation, for instance, and research even suggests occasional hybridisation may boost diversity and trigger evolutionary change in the famous Darwin finches of the Galapagos. Plants are naturally “promiscuous” and hybridisation between closely related species is common. It can produce unexpected characteristics. For instance, hybrid sunflowers that evolved after their parents came into contact thousands of years ago can thrive in droughts and salty soil, which allowed them to colonise America’s deserts. New species take a long time to form and become established, of course, so it’s likely we won’t detect many of these human-induced hybrids for a while yet. But there are exceptions. Some new hybrid species have a mutation which cases them to double the amount of DNA in their cells. Genome doubling, or polyploidisation, results in an immediately “obese” genome in which each copy of the hybrid DNA is duplicated. Duplication of the DNA material can occur in a single generation – and thus the formation of new species is instantaneous in evolutionary terms.  As polyploid plants carry twice as many chromosomes as their parents, they can no longer reproduce with either. The polyploid hybrid is thus its own biological species and unlike regular hybrids it cannot be easily “mated” into extinction. Many common crops such as strawberries or potatoes are polyploids, but the process occurs in nature too. In fact, at least six new plant species have evolved in the past 200 years through hybridisation and genome doubling.  The most recent case is the “Scottish monkeyflower”, which was produced when non-native species from Chile and North America encountered each other in Britain. The hybrid of these two plants suffered a genome-doubling mutation, and a new species was formed. Curiously, the same hybrid appears to have evolved twice, entirely independently: once in southern Scotland and once in the Orkney Islands, ten miles off the country’s north coast. It’s important to remember that hybridisation between native and introduced species isn’t necessarily bad for conservation. Gene transfer could help native plants deal with global change by giving them a broader genetic “arsenal” which they can use to evolve rapidly to keep up with climate change. Hybridisation with non-native species could then be a form of evolutionary rescue. It remains to be seen whether all this hybridisation is good or bad news for global diversity. But one thing is certain. Humans have altered the biosphere to such an extent that there is no way back: the reshuffling of the world’s plants and animals cannot be undone – and hybrids are a natural consequence of these changes. Welcome to the new hybrid kingdom."
"Labor leader Anthony Albanese has pledged to tackle skills shortages and industrial relations reform if he wins government, as he seeks to reposition the party’s proposed action on climate change as a new jobs “revolution”. In the first of a series of vision statements aimed at resetting Labor’s policy agenda following the May election, the opposition leader has outlined the party’s jobs and skills agenda in a speech in Perth on Tuesday. Saying the party is “proudly and resolutely pro-growth”, Albanese has flagged the potential of clean energy jobs for a new manufacturing boom, while also emphasising the need to do more on skills reform. Labor in government would establish a new national organisation called Jobs and Skills Australia, Albanese said, which would be tasked with driving improved outcomes in the vocational education and training sector and strengthening workplace planning. The agency would be legislated and based on the model of Infrastructure Australia, with its functions including workforce and skills analysis and reviewing the adequacy of the training and vocational education system. “It will work with business and unions to harness insights from industry to ensure that training is meeting not just today’s needs but to anticipate how work is changing,” Albanese said. He says Australians worried about the future of work, need to be reassured that technological change will unlock new opportunities while still providing economic security. “The unprecedented pace of change and spread of new technologies are leaving many workers unsettled, and others left out of the labour market altogether.” Albanese said that to restore confidence in the labour market, workers needed to be helped to engage with technology and innovation in “an assured manner”, which would require “the single-minded pursuit of skills”. This would help address a mismatch between what workers have to offer and what employers need, with Albanese highlighting a recent Australian Industry Group survey that three quarters of businesses cannot find the skilled workers they need. “In short we have a labour market characterised by the mismatch between what workers have to offer, and what employers need,” Albanese said. He criticised the government for issuing half a million visas to foreign workers over the past six years. “Instead, what we should be doing – wherever possible – is training Australians for current and future jobs.” On the issue of job security and industrial relations reform, Albanese said the current industrial relations system was being “strained” by the emergence of new forms of employment arrangements, pointing to the rise of the gig economy as an example. “These Australians deserve a greater sense of security,” Albanese said. “It is time to have a conversation about new forms of worker protections, which can be made as flexible as the gig economy jobs they could cover, as well as benefit more traditional industries – ideas like portable entitlements.” The new skills pledge comes alongside a push by Albanese to recast Labor’s climate policy as part of a new industrial “revolution”, saying the shift to clean energy will underpin an Australian manufacturing boom that unlocks new jobs and export opportunities. “The world is decarbonising. With the right planning and vision, Australia can not only continue to be an energy exporting superpower, we can also enjoy a new manufacturing boom. This means jobs,” Albanese said. “Working towards a low-carbon future provides the opportunity to revitalise the Australian manufacturing sector – opportunities that are all about jobs.” The speech comes as Labor MPs jostle over how the party should reposition itself on climate policy after the shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, called for the opposition to abandon its emissions reduction target in favour of the coalition’s less ambitious plan to reduce emissions by 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. Labor had proposed an emissions reduction target of 45% in the same period. In a sign that Albanese wants to maintain the party’s action on climate change as a key point of difference with the coalition, he used Tuesday’s speech to emphasise the benefits of an ambitious emissions reduction policy for jobs in the renewable energy sector. Labelling climate change “one of the greatest challenges that we face today”, Albanese also says that countries which act to harness cheap renewable energy would also be able to transform into “manufacturing powerhouses”. “We have the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent, we also have some of the best wind and wave resources and we have some of the best engineers and scientists, breaking the barriers of what is possible with renewable energy,” Albanese said. “Australia can be the land of cheap and endless energy – energy that could power generations of metal manufacturing and other energy intensive manufacturing industries.” He points to the potential export opportunities of lithium, rare earths, iron and titanium as the “key ingredients” of the renewables revolution, saying the minerals would be in high demand in a low-carbon future. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Just as coal and iron ore fuelled the industrial economies of the 20th century, it is these minerals that will fuel the clean energy economies of the 21st,” Albanese said, pointing to the growing demand for lithium for electric vehicles, batteries and energy storage. But the Labor leader also assured “traditional industries” that they would benefit from the shift to renewables, saying the demand for metallurgical coal would continue, fuelled by growth in wind energy. Labor has been at pains to reconnect with coal communities since its election defeat, amid concern that blue-collar workers abandoned the party in its traditional stronghold seats. The former leader Bill Shorten has said since the election that he had misread “some of the mood”, particularly in the resources states of Queensland and Western Australia, saying voters saw some of the party’s policies as “being green-left, not for the worker, not for working people.” “It pains me to realise at the last election our presentation meant that some people felt we weren’t putting jobs first and foremost in everything we did,” Shorten said. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said there was a perception that Labor was “sending mixed messages on the coal industry” during the campaign, while Fitzgibbon has said it was a “huge error” for Labor not to talk about coal because of a fear that it would cost city seats. Albanese said that with more than 200 tonnes of metallurgical coal required to produce one wind turbine, growth in global wind generation over the next decade could see Australia exporting 15.5 million tonnes of coking coal to build turbines. “This is the equivalent of three years output from the Moranbah North coking coal mine in Queensland,” Albanese said. “Simply put, the road to a low-carbon future can be paved with hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, as well as supporting traditional jobs, including coalmining. Labor wants to lead that clean energy revolution.” The first of Albanese’s headland speeches comes as the party braces for the release of a review of the election that is being spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson to establish what went wrong in its campaign, with climate policy and the party’s position on the Adani coalmine expected to be scrutinised. Albanese has said the review will be a “line in the sand” for the party as it seeks to reassess all of its policies ahead of the next election, due in 2022. Along with the focus on green jobs, Albanese also called for the government to introduce an upgraded investment guarantee, saying it should form part of a “measured” economic stimulus package. “A bring-forward of infrastructure investment combined with increased business investment would create jobs in the short term as well as lift productivity.”"
"Zookeepers at Thiory Zoo, near Paris, recently arrived at work to find their four-year-old rhinoceros, Vince, dead from a gunshot to the head. The larger of his two horns had been cut off with a chainsaw. The poachers responsible had forced open one grill and two locked doors in order to get into the rhino’s enclosure. Police presume that the smaller horn was not taken, and the zoo’s other two rhinos were not killed, because the poachers either did not have time or were interrupted.  There is speculation that the poachers are “professionals” and the horn will be smuggled to Asia.  No matter how shocking and heartbreaking it is to hear about the murder of this rhino, it should come as little surprise. In their native habitats the five species of rhino are at best “near threatened” and at worst “critically endangered” because they are poached for their horns. According to the charity Save the Rhino the total worldwide population was around 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, there are just 29,000 left.  Vince’s species, the southern white rhino, is actually a conservation success story, as it has come back from the brink of extinction a century ago to an estimated population of at least 19,000. The good news ends there though. The black rhino population is estimated to be just over 5,000 individuals; the greater one-horn rhino over 3,500, and the Javan and Sumatran rhinos both under 100. Even the southern white’s numbers can’t protect it from poaching: if current death rates continue, it may become extinct in the wild by 2023. There are huge profits to be made from poaching rhinos. Demand from Asia, where there is a long history of rhino horn in traditional medicine, means each horn can fetch tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market. This makes it one of the most expensive commodities in the world – potentially more valuable per kilo than diamonds or cocaine.  But poaching in the wild is getting harder. Anti-poaching technology is getting smarter, wardens are being militarised, and there are simply fewer rhinos left to target. The logical next step is for poachers and organised crime to adapt and choose “soft” targets such as zoos, safari parks and sanctuaries. There’s evidence this is already happening: an Irish organised crime group, the Rathkeale Rovers, is allegedly responsible for 60 rhino horn thefts from natural history museums across Europe. Poaching in the west may not even be limited to “organised” crime groups. In the case of Vince the rhino, one grill, two locked doors and some surveillance cameras are not exactly sophisticated technology that “unorganised” criminals wouldn’t be able to get around.  But we shouldn’t be surprised if Vince’s killers turn out to be professionals. Organised crime, like most wildlife crime, adapts to conditions and looks for new opportunities to make money. Zoos seem to be ready targets where the benefits are very high and the risk of getting caught very low. The horn is probably on its way to Asia, but let’s not forget that Europe is one of the three top consumers of illegal wildlife. China and the US are the other two. So while Europeans may have a reputation for being wildlife and animal lovers, there is a dark side to the continent’s relationship with wildlife that is often ignored.  Zoos and safari parks should increase their security measures and vigilance as chances are rhinos will not be the only victims of poaching in Europe because of the illegal wildlife trade. And that’s regardless of whether the demand is from inside or outside of Europe and if the poachers are organised crime or not."
"According to some animal rights groups the grey squirrel is a victim of circumstance. They say it has been made a scapegoat for regional red squirrel population extinctions and claim that loss of the reds is caused entirely coincidentally by habitat change. They suggest the true facts are being hidden and scientific research being intentionally misinterpreted.  If so, then this conspiracy must extend to British legal provisions and EU directives both listing the grey squirrel as an invader to be controlled, right?  Well, no – put this argument to the test and you’ll see that the facts actually do stack up against the grey squirrel. The reality is that, while the grey squirrel is an important part of North American forest ecosystems, since being brought to Europe by the Victorians in 1876, the animal has had severe ecological and economic impacts on British woodlands.  Acrobatic and entertaining they may be, but the charge sheet against the grey squirrel is based on hundreds of peer-reviewed research papers. There really is no defence for it.  Today there are approximately 2.5m grey squirrels in Britain, but less than 140,000 reds. Grey squirrels out-compete native reds for food and space. They also dig up and consume seed that red squirrels have buried as a winter store. This behaviour reduces red squirrel skeletal growth rates and adult size, and greatly depresses juvenile survival rates too.  In addition, greys harbour infections – including squirrel pox, which can devastate red squirrel populations. They elevate local viral and nematode infection rates, and bring in new parasites, such as Strongyloides robustus, which are picked up by red squirrels. Occasionally a healthy red squirrel is found with squirrel pox antibodies – some researchers have suggested that this is evidence of them evolving resistance to the pox. Unfortunately, 63% of red squirrels dying from pox have also been found to have this antibody response present and there is no evidence that these antibodies confer immunity. Even if they did, research has also shown that antibodies are gone within 18 months and, irrespective of any resistance, red populations would be replaced by grey via competition anyway. Grey squirrels also damage and kill forest trees making it impossible for foresters to grow high-grade hardwood. This means such material is imported instead, bringing with it the risk of new tree pests and pathogens. Tree damage is most frequently seen on the branches and trunks of oak, beech and maple; bark is stripped by squirrels eager to consume the the sap underneath. Tree stems break or die following stripping, which in turn leads to changes in the structure and species composition of high canopy in amenity woodlands. Even songbirds are affected by grey squirrels. A recent study gave evidence of negative association between woodland songbird fledging rates and presence of grey squirrels – though it must be noted that this was not observed annually and only seen on some of the sites studied. Earlier studies didn’t find evidence to indicate greys affect bird population, but also didn’t exclude the possibility – even for bird species whose population is increasing overall.  Other animals may be affected by greys too: there has been some suggestion that squirrels compete with dormice for hazel nuts, though more research is needed to confirm the true impact. The Wildlife Trust has recently started to recruit 5,000 volunteers to monitor and control grey squirrel populations. However, a look beyond the headlines will reveal thousands of people are already legally trapping and shooting greys across the country to control their numbers. Volunteer groups cull 6,000 grey squirrels per year in the north of England, for example. Even in areas where reds are absent, locals control grey squirrels to protect woodlands or prevent damage to property. This is not some dramatic new approach by the Wildlife Trust, but is simply reinforcing an established national movement. The eradication of greys from the Welsh isle of Anglesey saw red squirrel numbers increase from 40 to 700 and there are other examples of grey control halting or reversing red squirrel decline. Research has also demonstrated that red squirrels do not prefer conifer to broadleaved habitat and are just as happy in either. Future control may involve giving the squirrels contraception, but will almost certainly not rely solely on this because of logistical barriers. The pine marten may assist in some landscapes too: one Irish study found a strong negative correlation between pine martens and greys in the woodlands studied. However, the use of trapping and shooting will inevitably continue as part of an integrated national approach. And so the grey squirrel stands guilty as charged. Their presence has decimated the British countryside since they were introduced from North America, and if we do not continue to control the species, the future for red squirrels and woodland ecosystems will be bleak."
"India is facing one of its most serious droughts in recent memory – official estimates suggest that at least 330m people are likely to be affected by acute shortages of water. As the subcontinent awaits the imminent arrival of the monsoon rains, bringing relief to those who have suffered the long, dry and exceptionally warm summer, the crisis affecting India’s water resources is high on the public agenda. Unprecedented drought demands unconventional responses, and there have been some fairly unusual attempts to address this year’s shortage. Perhaps most dramatic was the deployment of railway wagons to transport 500,000 litres of water per day across the Deccan plateau, with the train traversing more than 300km to provide relief to the district of Latur in Maharashtra state.  The need to shift water on this scale sheds light on the key issue that makes water planning in the Indian subcontinent so challenging. While the region gets considerable precipitation most years from the annual monsoon, the rain tends to fall in particular places – and for only a short period of time (about three months). This water needs to be stored, and made to last for the entire year.  In most years, it also means that there is often too much water in some places, resulting in as much distress due to flooding as there currently is due to drought. So there is a spatial challenge as well – water from the surplus regions needs to reach those with a shortfall, and the water train deployed in Maharashtra is one attempt to achieve this. The current crisis has led the Indian government to announce that it hopes to resurrect an ambitious plan to try and link the major river basins of the country, under the Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) Project. The scale and magnitude of this exercise, both financial (it is estimated to cost more than £100 billion) and in engineering terms (involving the transfer of 174 billion cubic metres of water annually) is unprecedented. Critics suggest that it is unlikely to work and is likely to create further ecological and social disruption, especially due to the uncertainties in weather and precipitation patterns due to climate change. There is a risk that other alternatives, perhaps less dramatic in their scope, might be neglected in the rush for the big headline-grabbing schemes. A specific way forward might be to work more directly with natural processes to secure the regeneration of water sources at the local level. In the dry plains, this involves the revitalisation of aquifers and the replenishment of groundwater through recharge during the monsoon, as has been attempted already in some regions. In the hilly areas, there is considerable scope for investment in spring recharge and source sustainability, as has been undertaken on a significant scale in the Himalayan state of Sikkim.  Our current research is examining the need to invest in source protection and sustainability in detail, especially in the Himalayas, which have been described as the “Water Towers of Asia”. Urbanisation trends in the region suggest that there will be a growing number of small towns and settlements that will need water infrastructure to meet their needs – and there is a critical need to secure these water sources.  Deforestation, land conversion and degradation, as well as urban encroachment due to illegal construction, pose major threats to the water bearing capacity of the Himalayan landscape. There is an urgent need to invest in the identification, protection and restoration of these “critical water zones”.  The Himalayan context also demonstrates the transboundary nature of the water issue. The Hindu Kush Himalayan region extends across eight countries, from Afghanistan to Myanmar, and supports ten major river systems, potentially affecting the lives of more than 1.5 billion people. Cooperation across political boundaries is vital to manage these fragile resources, further threatened by the uncertain impacts of climate change.  There is some hope, despite three major wars since independence, that India and Pakistan have managed to maintain some semblance of cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, which was negotiated in 1960. However, analysts suggest that regional conflict over water is going to worsen – and much depends on the role of China, which is the dominant upstream water controller in the region.  The other key response is managing water demand – and making explicit choices over alternative uses. This year, the shifting of Indian Premier League cricket matches away from water-scarce Maharashtra was a high-profile, though somewhat symbolic, example of an explicit prioritisation of water use.  More generally, though, managing water demands has rarely been prioritised. Water-thirsty crops – sugarcane, for example – dominate the landscape in the dry regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha in Maharashtra. Farmers receive subsidies on energy, which allow them to pump dry the already-depleted aquifers in other parts of the country. And, there are important issues of distributional equity – the poor in many urban contexts pay significantly more per litre for erratic and unreliable water, while their richer neighbours luxuriate in swimming pools and spend weekends on plush golf greens.  Water is an issue that cuts across all aspects of social and economic life in India. Compartmentalised responses are unlikely to be adequate to address the current crises. There is a need for an integrated approach, which addresses source sustainability, land use management, agricultural strategies, demand management and the distribution and pricing of water. With growing pressures due to climate change, migration and population growth, creative and imaginative governance is needed to manage this precious resource."
"The Green party has set its sights firmly on Bristol West in its drive to push its parliamentary representation up from one MP, but other target seats hang in the balance as activists await the outcome of negotiations with the Liberal Democrats over a pact to avoid splitting the pro-remain vote. At the party’s launch in Bristol on Wednesday, the climate emergency took centre stage and is likely to dominate the party’s manifesto, due out within a few days, with pledges to borrow £100bn to cut emissions and protect against the impacts of global heating.  But Siân Berry, the party’s co-leader and London mayoral candidate, made it clear that social justice was also high on the party’s agenda, and the biggest cheer in Bristol came for a promise to build affordable housing. Nationally, the Greens had their best ever year in this year’s local and European elections, rising to 362 local councillors and seven MEPs. But in the 2017 general election, the party’s share of the national vote more than halved to just 1.8%, compared with its record 3.8% in 2015. Carla Denyer, the Green candidate for Bristol West, thinks that fallback was largely because of the impact of the Brexit referendum on the 2017 result, but believes much has changed since then, particularly in voters’ perceptions of the Labour party. She said: “In the 2017 election a lot of people were Corbyn fans in Bristol but they are going off him. A lot of people believed in 2017 that Labour was a remain party. I think the political atmosphere is much closer now to 2015 than it was in 2017.” Activists believe Labour’s seemingly comfortable majority in Bristol West is less robust than it appears. In 2017, on a 77% turnout in this constituency that voted 79% for remain in the referendum, the Labour incumbent Thangam Debbonaire won a 37,000 majority – one of the biggest in the country – on a 30% swing to Labour. The Greens won fewer than 10,000 votes. But in 2015, Labour took the seat on a much smaller margin with 22,900 votes compared with 17,200 for the Greens in second place, with the Lib Dems trailing far behind. Denyer, a mechanical engineer and wind farm designer, told the Guardian voters were also thinking beyond Brexit, saying: “People are much more aware of the climate emergency now. Bristol wants to be a green city, and people all over the country recognise that we need a big change to deal with the climate.” Extinction Rebellion is estimated to have about 10,000 supporters in the Bristol area, and there has been strong local support for measures such as the council declaring a climate emergency, and the council’s decision to ban diesel cars from areas of the centre. Many people on the streets of Bristol seem receptive to environmental messages. Rachel Fountain, a local voter, said: “I think this election will be an environment election. Extinction Rebellion are very strong here. But there is also a social housing problem here, that will be an issue.” Nick Swales, a council worker, also cited the climate crisis and the environment as top issues for people in the area, though he predicted that Brexit would dominate the election. Alice Evelegh-Taylor, a lawyer walking her baby son through Queen Square, said she had always voted Liberal Democrat but would not this time because “they have gone bonkers” by pledging to revoke article 50. “I’ve never wanted to vote Labour and I could not vote for the Tories. The environment is a massive concern – I’d like to know if the Greens’ ideas are properly costed, though actually even if they are not, who cares? It’s the environment– we will have to find the money.”"

By Rudolf Kipp, Science Skeptical
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
“Payments for renewable energy will cost each household on average about 1 euro per month – that’s as much as one scoop of ice cream.”  That’s what Jürgen Trittin, former Federal Environment Minister, Green Party, said in July 2004 when Germany’s EEG renewable energy Feed-In Act) was enacted.
“Now it costs as much as every item on the entire ice cream menu,” said Peter Altmaier, current Federal Minister of Environment, September 2013 at the 8th German Energy Congress “Energy Economy in Transition”.
German feed-in rates skyrocketing
Recently a press release from power grid operators 50Hertz, Amprion, TenneT and TransnetBW (link) was issued. Here is what it announced:
(…) The EEG feed-in levy is to be paid for each kilowatt-hour consumed by all end-consumers. That means that the consumers will have to pay 6.240 cents per kilowatt hour in order to support renewable energies. Thus the costs for the EEG feed-in will increase almost 20 percent compared to a year earlier (5.277 cents per kilowatt-hour).
For the year 2014 another considerable increase in the generation of renewable electrical energy is projected. The increase of approximately 15 terawatt-hours(from about 135 TWh in 2013 to almost 150 TWh in 2014) is mainly from onshore wind, offshore wind, and photovoltaic.
The following chart depicts the cost development for consumers from the EEG feed-in tariff, from 2003 to 2014, (eeg-kwk.net):

The next figure shows the electric power price development in Germany (Statista):

So much for renewable energies staying affordable, as politicians promised us just some years ago.
What follows are more famous quotes from politicians and hustlers, all telling the consumers how renewable energy would stay cheap and affordable for every German. You be the judge on whether or not they were truthful.
2004 Greenpeace:
….The costs to be paid by consumers for the Feed-In Act (EEG fees)) will remain practically constant compared to the current level.”
2005 German Environment Ministry:
The increase in the EEG feed-in tariffs will reduce in the future and will not cost more than 3 euros a month, even with a very dynamic expansion. The feed-in rates will then start to go down by the middle of the next decade.”
In 2005 the EEG feed-In fees were only 0.68 cent/kwh. This year Germans are paying more than 250 euros per year.
2006 Engineering Office for new energies:
As a whole the current EEG feed-in cost of approximately 0.54 cents/kwh will increase to a maximum of 0.93 cents/kwh by 2017.”
Already in 2006 the EEG feed-in tariff was 0.88 cents/kwh. In 2014 it will 6.24 cents/kwh, i.e. 7 times higher!

2007 Solarportal 24:
Already today consumers are saving significantly more than they are paying for the EEG feed-in act. The huge supply of energy from wind, water, sun, bioenergy, and geothermal is leading to a dampening effect on the price of electricity, this according to the Federal Association of Renewable Energies, BEE.”
German Environment Ministry:
Because of the EEG feed-in act, the feed-in cost for electricity will rise a bit. According to the law that applies, it will increase to a maximum of about 1.4 cents/kwh by the year 2015, after which it will again drop.“
In 2013 the EEG fee will rise to a whopping 6.24 cents/kwh, and there is no end in sight for the spiraling costs.
2009 Federal Association of Renewable Energies:
The EEG feed-in will reach its maximum of approx. 1.4 cents/kwh by 2013/2014.”
Today we know that figure will rise to 6.24 cents/kwh next year with no slowdown in sight.
2010 German Ministry of Environment:
The EEG feed-in cost for 2011 according to a current study of the German Ministry of Environment (BMU) will be about 2.8 cents. The study looks at the ‘long-term scenarios and strategies for the expansion of renewable energies in Germany while taking the development in Europe and the globe into account’, and also sees no exploding EEG feed-in costs for the coming years.”
Reality: costs have exploded.
2011
Angela Merkel on September 6 in a government address:
The EEG feed-in costs must not rise more than today’s levels; today it is at about 3.5 cents/kwh. Over the long-term we want to significantly lower the payment for electricity coming from renewable energies.”
2012 
Eicke R. Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems:
The expansion of renewable energies will lead to very little price increases for the consumers.
(…) After 2020, however, we expect renewable energies to become an important share and will stabilize the prices, and thus we will experience a dampening in electricity prices.”
The EEG feed-in cost will surge to 6.24 cents/kwh next year. There are no signs of a price slowdown.
2013
Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier:
We are not paying for the transformation over to renewable energies from petty cash.”

"In the wake of the Brexit earthquake, experts are sifting through the rubble, assessing the damage, and checking the stability of remaining structures. Advocates of ambitious climate policy have been particularly active. Since the late 1990s, the UK has been a leader on climate change, both domestically, within the European Union, and through its active role in global negotiations.  But can this be maintained? At home in particular, can it follow the pithy advice of UN climate chief Christiana Figueres who, harking back to the wartime spirit, urged Britain to “stay calm and transform on”?  Yet even if the UK is able to keep its green policies broadly on track, committed politicians and activists should reflect on where best to focus their efforts given so much had been developed through Europe. What happens next will largely depend on how the government renegotiates the country’s relationship with the EU. Participation in the EU’s internal energy market has kept energy costs down and fostered UK energy security. Energy industry insiders regard it as crucial to the UK’s decarbonisation efforts. One increasingly discussed possibility is the “Norway option”: join the European Economic Area (EEA) and maintain access to the single market without EU membership, in exchange for following many European laws. Under this scenario, the UK would remain subject to the EU Emissions Trading System, the Fuel Quality Directive, and the Renewable Energy Directive among other climate and energy laws, while having no say in their development.  Alternatively, the UK could attempt to strike a complex series of bilateral deals with the EU, while remaining outside of the EEA (what some have termed the “Swiss model”). In this scenario such laws would not necessarily apply, and the UK would likely need to develop its own emissions regulations, renewable targets and so on. Climate legislation would then need to fight for parliamentary time against other priorities. Looser arrangements, involving reverting to World Trade Organisation rules, would present far greater levels of policy uncertainty. The best-case scenario is therefore likely to involve the UK retaining a close relationship with the EU within the EEA. Although advocates of climate and environmental protection are likely to speak out in favour of joining the EEA, it won’t be their concerns that ultimately decide the outcome. They would be well-advised to engage in some scenario planning both for life inside the EEA, and in a world outside where EU rules have no effective influence. Regardless of what the post-Brexit relationship looks like, the UK will no longer be able to participate directly in EU policy-making. Those wishing to maintain the UK’s reputation will have to content themselves with leadership by example, at best.  In a promising development that has eased fears of a post-Brexit “coup” by climate sceptics within the Conservative party, the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has announced that it will implement the Fifth Carbon Budget, as required by the 2008 Climate Change Act. This means a reduction of 57% in UK carbon emissions from 1990 levels for 2028-32 is now official government policy. Of course, this commitment will not implement itself, and ironically could still be undermined if the EU, now lacking one of its principal climate champions, lags behind in its own target setting. A decision by David Cameron to ratify the Paris agreement on the UK’s behalf before he steps down as prime minister would send a strong signal that the country will not be diverted from its path to decarbonisation. A continuing challenge will be that the Fifth Carbon Budget and other UK climate policies have been designed assuming that the UK would remain an EU member state. This again highlights the importance of some kind of EEA-based arrangement. In implementing the UK’s own domestic commitments, sustained investment and regulatory stability – of a kind that EU membership broadly provided – will be key. Government ministers must realise that these are severely compromised by the kind of unexpected energy policy “resets” witnessed from the incoming Conservative government after the last election. And in a volatile economic climate, institutions such as the Green Investment Bank may need to increase their efforts to finance investment in renewable energy projects. NGOs must respond to the likelihood that UK governments will be Conservative-led for the foreseeable future. Given that party’s often unconvincing commitment to climate protection, advocates would do well to frame their efforts not just in terms of climate, but of air quality and jobs too.  Some innovative solutions arguably have potential to mend some of the damage from the referendum. For example, the development of tidal lagoons in Wales has considerable potential both to cut emissions and create jobs. Ambitious deployment of such technology could, according to its advocates, contribute as much power as the proposed – but increasingly untenable – Hinkley C nuclear plant. The architecture of the UK’s pioneering Climate Change Act of 2008 has so far proved robust to the shock of Brexit. Ensuring that it remains so, and continues to deliver meaningful decarbonisation, will be an enduring concern for many in post-Brexit Britain, and for supporters of ambitious climate policy around the world."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSWR German Public radio had a segment today featuring the warmist director at Germany’s Ministry of Environment, Harry Lehmann, climate scientist Hans von Storch and Spiegel science reporter Axel Bojanowski.
LISTEN HERE IN GERMAN
What follows is my report on the segment.
SWR moderator Gábor Paál says right at the outset regarding the 15-year global warming stop, “Climate science is no longer certain like it was a few years earlier“.
Hans von Storch (HvS) says from 0:52 to 2:21 that the temperature has not developed like the models said it would, saying that there could be several explanations for that: 1) could be just a grand coincidence, 2) the models have gotten natural variations all wrong, 3) it could be that CO2’s assumed climate sensitivity is somewhat exaggerated, and 4) it could be that there is another factor out there that we never considered, like the sun. HvS adds that he sees himself and his fellow scientist “as hard pressed to explain what’s going on” and that this is so because “climate science is so highly politicized and because we have colleagues who claim things with great certainty that later turn out to be not so certain.”
At the 2:30 mark the warmist Ministry of Environment Dr. Harry Lehmann is asked if all the uncertainty is a problem for him. He responds with “yes and no“, and claims that there is a 90-95% certainty that there is manmade climate change and that policymakers have to act as a precaution. Surprisingly he admits that there has been a warming stop and that the models were wrong and that more research is necessary. But he insists climate protection measures are still necessary as before.
At the 3:50 mark geologist and Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski explains that the uncertainty in climate science is indeed headline news and that today there is an overdue need to discuss these uncertainties, which was something the media neglected in the past.
At the 4:42 mark on whether the oceans may be responsible, von Storch says that “this could be an explanation” but that the main problem is the models are failing to show what we are now observing. Hans von Storch states in no uncertain terms that climate scientists have not been taking the scientific approach of examining all potential hypotheses. Instead some climate scientists are motivated by certain special interests, and are choosing the hypothesis that best suits their needs, and are thus choking off real science. HvS adds: “We need to take the time to formulate the various hypotheses and to sort them out. This is going to take some time. And that may be inconvenient for the political business.” He adds in response to Fritz Vahrenholt’s The Neglected Sun book that “the sun is a candidate that needs to be checked over.”
At the 8:19 mark HvS makes his displeasure with politics clear in no uncertain terms. “As a scientist. I tell policymakers absolutely nothing. Politics does not result from science. Activists like to claim that it does.” Lehmann responds by claiming that politicians are obligated to act as a precaution based on the best science at hand so that the human species can survive in 15 years or 100 years time.
On the upcoming IPCC AR5, Bojanowski says that except for the sea level rise projection being pushed up, little has changed from AR4. On the 95% certainty that man is responsible for the climate change, Bojanowski says flat out: “This is naturally not a scientific number, but a number that was voted on by a few scientists” and this figure is based on very shaky ground.
Lehmann says that the deficiencies in the AR4 have since been resolved, but HvS is unconvinced, saying “that remains to be seen” and that the IPCC report is still vulnerable to activist scientists who fancy themselves as planet rescuers – there’s nothing in place to prevent that type of a conflict of interest. Bojanowski adds that the improvements to the IPCC process have only been partially implemented and that there is still a big problem with transparency and that we are still “dealing with a very difficult construct that we need to be critical of.”
At the 15:00 mark Bojanowski is asked about whether or not the 15-year pause is going to be mentioned in the upcoming summary report, to which he responds that this is being hotly disputed. HvS reminds Lehmann that especially he, as a director in the Environment Ministry, really needs to know about the 15-year pause and what the implications of this are for the future. It really needs to be mentioned. Lehmann insists: “Even though the models failed to foresee the 15- years pause, they do show that the climate change is man-made“. At this point HvS sits Lehmann down and schools him, reminding him: “Models don’t show climate change is man-made, data do. Not the models!” Von Storch adds that right now the models are not adequate for projecting the future because they only look at increased CO2 concentrations and not a host of other factors. At this point, HvS is tearing poor Lehmann apart, getting close to humiliating the poor environment director.

HvS goes on to explain to listeners that climate is “horribly complex matter” and that there are just so many variables that are poorly understood, citing clouds, aerosols and that the oceans are not even close to being modeled adequately. He says he expects research to yield surprises here.
Later there’s much discussion about the 2°C target. HvS tells listeners that it’s a political number that gladly gets used by politicians and activist scientists, and that it is not a scientific one. HvS advocates regions and countries developing their own adaptation strategies and that a centralized IPCC is not really what’s needed. Local regions know better what needs to be done to adapt to local climate changes. HvS advocates reductions in CO2, but what’s affordable for each area.
The discussion drags on for awhile about the effectiveness and value of the IPCC. Bojanowski mentions again that the IPCC process is far from transparent and that too much is taking place behind closed doors. This is not how science is supposed to be.
HvS believes a good scientific report includes both consensus and dissent. The IPCC strives only for the “best science”, and how does on differentiate between good and bad science? The exclusion of dissent is not the idea.
At the 32-minute mark, moderator Paál brings up the notorious brochure/ that Lehmann’s office published in May, which singled out and pilloried dissenting scientists and journalists. Paál correctly points out the brochure’s one-sidedness and asks why it failed to discuss the obvious uncertainties, and claimed the science was settled. “Why can’t your Ministry truthfully deal with the uncertainties?” But Lehmann insisted it does deal with uncertainties and that it serves as an information guide for the citizens. Paál: “But like I said, there was nothing about the warming phase in it“. Lehmann here shamelessly tries to weasel out, claiming that the warming pause discussion started only 2 years ago.
Concerning the brochure’s infamous pillory of skeptic journalists and scientists, Lehmann also tries to deny that they were pilloried. Hans von Storch immediately shot back “Yes they certainly were pilloried“. Again Lehmann tried to deny the brochure’s one-sidedness. Bojanowski interjected, saying “the brochure was not balanced” and he wonders what business is it for a federal ministry to “warn the public of certain journalists“.
Paál asks Lehmann if the federal Environment Ministry is more cozy with some institutes (like the Potsdam Institute) than with others. HvS answers: “Certainly”. Lehmann shamelessly denies that, too. Unbelievable. Then Lehmann flat out lies about his ties and function in support organizations of the Potsdam Institute.
On the subject of media quality, HvS feels the print media has been doing a good job on reporting climate, but that television leaves much less to be desired, saying some outlets are too focused on catastrophic images and alarmism. He also senses a public that is growing weary of the topic, that they are losing interest, and no longer want to be bothered with the dubious predictions of global downfall.
In then end von Storch sums up saying: “If the warming pause continues another five years, then perhaps our understanding of climate was more faulty than we thought.”
If this 45-minute SWR German public radio discussion was meant to be a debate, Lehmann lost it big time, at times looking foolish and lacking understanding of climate science. HvS definitely looked like he lost patience with the politicization of climate science. Bojanowski overall made a good impression of a careful and balanced science journalist who understood the material at hand.
German readers are invited to listen to and comment on the SWR interview.

"Thank you to all the readers and Guardian supporters around the world who have responded to our environmental pledge, in which we outlined five important journalistic and institutional steps we will take to play a leading role in reporting on the climate catastrophe. The response has been overwhelming, with thousands of you across more than 100 countries making the choice to support us with a contribution. Many of you have told us how much you value our commitment: to be truthful, resolute and undeterred in pursuing this important journalism. We made this pledge because we recognise the climate emergency as the defining issue of our lifetimes.  As Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote, “We have always led the way in environmental reporting … but now, more than ever, we believe the Guardian’s specialist team of reporters, editors and writers has a vital role to play in working with our readers to understand the unfolding climate crisis and all its ramifications.” Reader support means we are all becoming part of a global community with a shared set of values and a vision for a more hopeful world. It also means we can give reporting on the environment the urgent attention and prominence it demands. We can report on the climate crisis with consistent rigour and ground our journalism in scientific fact, never driven by political or commercial interests. Our independence makes this journalism possible and support from our readers helps protect that independence. In our pledge, we acknowledge that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We have made a commitment to continue our long-standing record of powerful environment reporting, which is known around the world. By this, we mean undertaking investigations into the economic and political structures that underpin the carbon economy, such as our recent series, The Polluters, and examining the role the climate crisis plays in many other critical issues – including inequality, migration and the battle over scarce resources. Alongside our journalistic commitments, we also looked at important steps we could take as an organisation. We committed to the Guardian achieving net zero emissions by 2030. Some of our senior environment correspondents have shared with us the mix of hope and despair they experience in the course of their roles. But despite the challenges, they are united in a shared sense of urgency, and the need for change. Reflecting on covering the climate crisis, Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, wrote this week: “I report from the Amazon to the Arctic on the disappearing wonders of a rapidly deteriorating world. Along with a growing number of colleagues, I investigate who is affected, who is to blame and who is fighting back. This is both depressing and exciting. The trends for the climate, the oceans, the forests and the soil are unrelentingly frightening. Humanity has never faced a more wicked problem than the collapse of these natural life support systems. Nobody is free of responsibility. Everybody has something to lose, especially those with the most power. The challenge is huge, urgent and beset with opponents. But change is happening nonetheless.” Thank you to our readers and supporters for joining us in facing this challenge. Your responses are galvanising, making us even surer of our approach. We share in the belief that factual, independent and open journalism is vital if we are to drive real change. If you’re able to, we hope you will consider supporting the Guardian today by making a single or recurring contribution or subscribing. Every reader contribution, however big or small, is so valuable for our future."

It’s the book they don’t want you to read.
The Neglected Sun is back on sale (at least in the UK) after the first printing was sold out.
Some readers wrote me saying that they were no longer able to order the book. I don’t know how many copies were printed this time around, but if you are planning to pick up copies to give away for Christmas, for someone’s birthday, or to educate some hysterical warmist, then do get them while you can.
The book makes a strong case against the one-sided IPCC AR5 report, whereby unbelievably its authors are now struggling with whether or not to mention the significantly 15 year warming pause that embarrassed their models.
The German version was released one and half years ago, and so far all the recent studies are confirming precisely what Vahrenholt and Lüning are claiming and showing: no warming, Co2 exaggerated, oceans play a major role, models are totally inadequate, etc.
Last I’ve heard, the IPCC AR5 authors will claim sea ice will be melting faster as temperature slows down. Now that’s confusion. Obviously they are bending over backwards to insert alarmism in the report.

"Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh was right to express her concerns that arts education is seen as a luxury (“Soap star attacks school arts funding ‘conspiracy’”, News). Her comments were in response to the findings of the Durham Commission on Creativity and Education, which reported concerns about the reduction of the status of arts subjects, including art and design, dance, drama and music, within schools following the introduction of the English baccalaureate in secondary education. With regards to music in particular, the all-party parliamentary group for music education’s report, Music Education: State of Nation, demonstrates how the narrow range of Ebacc subjects has prevented students from studying at some secondary schools; music is no longer taught at key stage 3 in more than half of state-funded secondary schools. By her admission, Hesmondhalgh was not born into financial privilege but into state privilege, where she had access to creative subjects in her state school. If the Ebacc policy is not to be scrapped, we hope the Department for Education takes notice of her example and of the advice of the Durham commission, and extends the Ebacc to include a sixth pillar for arts subjects. Otherwise, access to a well-rounded education and its benefits will be the preserve of the privileged few.Deborah Annetts, chief executiveIncorporated Society of MusiciansLondon W2Julie Hesmondhalgh is right. What gets kids up in the morning? “I’ve got PE today or art” or something creative to balance up the subjects they are less confident with. Kids are active and don’t we know it! They like doing things and gaining confidence and as a teacher I have seen this so many times. Children find what they are good at, confidence grows and this floods over into all their work. They need the creative subjects to balance up the academic curriculum. As less than 50% go on to university one could make the point that for the other half an academic curriculum is inappropriate.  The Tories are starving education of funds. It is quite deliberate – they want people to pay for their music, art, craft, drama, PE, which cuts out the poorer section of society.Peter BranfordBirch Green, Hertford, Herts Catherine Bennett’s criticism of Extinction Rebellion’s tactics is very clever but offers nothing useful in the way of suggestions about alternative means of raising public consciousness (“The Extinction Rebels have a noble cause. What they don’t need now is tactical stupidity”, Comment). I am white, middle class, well educated and affluent. I’ve devoted all of my time in the past six months and a considerable amount of money in legal and other costs to the Extinction Rebellion campaign. Could Catherine Bennett or anyone who shares her views please explain: (a) why they think it is helpful or reasonable to sneer at my sacrifices; (b) what they think could be done to attract a different demographic to the cause; and (c) why the people from those demographics who are not doing what they can to bring about change should themselves be exempt from criticism?Chris NeillGodalming, Surrey With respect to “The big picture” (New Review), photographer Simon Buckley was right in saying that “it appeals to the essence of what people believe Manchester is”. However, as another northerner, I would suggest that Stephen Fry looks further back to LS Lowry’s teacher, Adolphe Valette, whose “Manchester-scapes” are a better precedent for Buckley’s stunning photograph.Christine HawkesCambridge It is eventually time to have a go at fireworks again (“We all ooh and aah, bug isn’t everyone sick of fireworks now?”, Comment). I don’t like the thought of pets being frightened by bangers but it is the responsibility of owners to keep their pets safe during bonfire season. Bonfire is a very important matter here in Sussex. The bonfire societies are a wonderful way for children and young people to learn responsibility and they help ensure that a wonderful time is had in Lewes on 5 November. We are remembering a very important moment in our history and having fun as well. Why does everything have to be sanitised? Long may we be allowed to continue.Polly CranfieldBarcombe, Lewes Nick Cohen reminded us of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s egregious instruction to his staff always to put “esq” when addressing an envelope to a man (“The great men theory of history is no more. Meet the catastrophic men…” Comment). Ha! It just proves how phoney he is. No, Mr Rees-Mogg, a man is only an esquire if he is of a certain birth. You would have to check with Debrett’s to get the full requirements.Antonia TillLondon N1 Will Hutton, I am a working-class guy from a northern city and I completely disagree with you (“We marched with hope but few expectations. Yet history will side with us”, Comment). The reason I voted Leave wasn’t some misty-eyed imperial nostalgia or groundless faith. It was a hard-nosed “what’s in it for me?” assessment of where my best interests lie. And the answer is as far away from European integration as possible. You say leaving the EU will devastate the north and trash our economy? I say it already has. Automation took half the jobs so, given the labour market is already difficult, how does it help my prospects if uncontrolled immigration adds 600,000 people every year? Likewise for housing, school places, hospital appointments... Every service and resource is stretched further because the parliament supposed to represent and protect our citizens cares more about keeping big corporations happy with low taxes and a steady flow of cheap labour. Is it any wonder we hate them? Is it any wonder we want to put control of our lives back in our own hands and not in some Brussels office under a foreigner we neither know nor can remove from power? You say half the country didn’t vote for Brexit and that we should have a confirmatory vote to leave, but half the country did vote to leave and will do again. Remainers won’t quit and neither will Leavers, so the cycle of deadlock and national decay will only continue. One side has to win conclusively or this will never end without bloodshed and sorrow. Dan RaineyHull Further to your article about the BBC series World on Fire and Poland’s role in history (“Britain’s Poles hope war drama will reclaim their past”, Focus), I would like to draw your attention to two other watersheds that are often overlooked. They are the siege of Vienna in 1683 and the battle of Warsaw in 1920. The centenary of the latter, fought during the Polish-Soviet war, is imminent. Its historical and political significance has been conveniently forgotten by many, yet it saw a near-defeated Polish army turn the tables on the Red Army. It was the only land defeat suffered by the Soviet army in the 20th century. In both cases, Poland twice saved Europe from unwelcome invaders. BK PolachowskiGreasby, Wirral"

Henrik Svensmark wrote the book on cosmic rays, their possible effect on clouds, and thus effect on climate, as well as numerous papers on the subject. The CERN CLOUD experiment has looked for proof of the mechanism. A recent paper by Spencer and Braswell has looked at the relationship between clouds and temperature and found a nine month lag between a gap in cloudiness and El Niño temperature rises. Another pair of papers (Dragić et al) here and here, look at diurnal temperature variations within a few days of Forbush decreases. If cosmic ray variations result in cloud variation, which then result in temperature variation, then it is reasonable to examine the relationship between cosmic rays as seen in the surface neutron flux, and temperature.
Neutron flux data was downloaded from the Oulu University Cosmic Ray Station web site. This data is available back to 1964 in several file resolutions. Here is a plot with monthly resolution compared to the HADSST3 sea-surface temperature data set.


Figure 1 is the Oulu Neutron count plotted with HASSST3. The Neutron count has been inverted so that warming is upward in both plots. Each solar cycle has been plotted in a different color and the R-squared values computed for each cycle.
The first observation is that for the first 22 years, there is a relationship between neutron flux and sea-surface temperature. But after about 1986 that relationship breaks down.
The monthly data plot in Figure 1 does not resolve Forbush decreases because they generally last but a few days. Figure 2 is a daily data plot with the Forbush decreases highlighted. Again, the plot is inverted to indicate warming in the upward direction.

Figure 2 is a plot of daily neutron count data with the Forbush Decreases highlighted in red and green. The vertical scale is inverted. 
Twenty three Forbush decreases were found and daily data plotted together in Figure 3 with the peak of the decrease at the day zero. Neutron count data 30 days prior and 140 days after the Forbush decrease were plotted. The legend records the date at the beginning of each plot.

Figure 3 is a plot of 23 Forbush decreases recorded at Oulu since 1964.

Figure 4 is the average for all 23 Forbush Decreases. The vertical scale is NOT inverted in figures 3 and 4.
On average a Forbush decrease is about 14 days wide at the 10% point and 5 to 7 days wide at the 50% point. The average decrease in neutron flux is about 10%, but this can range widely from under 5% to over 20%.
The temperature data available on the web is generally available only as monthly or annual data. Temperature data was averaged for events in each solar cycle from two months prior to at least a year after each event. Forbush events occur randomly, and not at convenient month ends, so the nearest months to each event were plotted. This blurs the resolution somewhat. El Niño 3.4, GISSLOTI, and HADSST3 data were compared. The El Niño data is from NCAR. The GISSLOTI and HADSST3 monthly data from woodfortrees.

Figure 5 is a plot of the average temperature effects for Forbush events from 1964 to 1976, 1977 to 1986, 1987 to 1996, and 1997 to the present.
The temperature changes seen here are quite large, more than half a degree, but the averaged signal is quite noisy because there are so few events. The first period (Solar Cycle 20) shows a warming peak at four months, but the second period (Cycle 21) has the warming delayed until the seventh month and later. The last two periods show little pattern.
If the total period is split into just two portions, pre and post 1987, we get Figure 6.

Figure 6 is the temperature effect on the El Niño 3.4 area of Forbush events pre and post 1987.
Before 1987, a Forbush Event resulted in an ocean surface temperature rise in the El Niño 3.4 region of about a quarter of a degree on average, 4 to 7 months after the event, but only in the pre 1987 data.

Figure 7 is the temperature effect on GISTemp Land-Ocean Temperature Index Anomaly, pre and post 1987.
The full scale amplitude of both left and right scales is 0.2°. There is a 0.4° offset between the left and right scales. A peak at seven months is seen only in the pre-1987 data.

Figure 8 is the temperature effect on HADSST3 pre and post 1887. Left and right scales are the same amplitude, just offset 0.3°.
Again, only in pre-1987 data do we see a sea-surface temperature warming 4 to 7 months after Forbush events. Why should this be?
What changed in the late 1980’s? There seems to have been two steps in warming: the first with the spring of 1987 El Niño, the second with the spring 1997 super-El Niño. These El Niños were not started by any Forbush event.
They seem to have arisen from natural ENSO cycles. Perhaps sea surface temperatures simply reached a point where Forbush event cloud changes have little added effect.
We know that warming has stopped at the step of 1997. We see the cosmic ray/neutron flux levels increasing, which should result in cooling, yet we don’t observe cooling yet. The results above would seem to indicate that since 1987, natural ocean cycles may have overwhelmed cosmic ray affects. There seems to be a natural limit to sea surface temperatures at about 30°C, which is regularly reached in much of the tropical Pacific, and lack of clouds will not drive it higher. I would like to see input from Henrik Svensmark, Roy Spencer, Bob Tisdale, Willis Eschenbach or Nicola Scaffetta.

"A major new climate policy was announced by the UK government on June 30, almost unnoticed in the Brexit aftermath. The media’s focus on Westminster backstabbing meant the country’s latest “carbon budget”, widely heralded as unambiguously good news for the environment, hasn’t had the scrutiny it deserves.  The “Fifth Carbon Budget” effectively commits the UK to reducing emissions by 57% from 1990 levels by sometime between 2028 and 2032. These budgets serve as five-year “stepping stones” towards achieving an 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2050 – the ultimate aim of the 2008 Climate Change Act. Budgets are determined years in advance to enable the required policy planning.  A 57% cut sounds great doesn’t it? The problem is that the Paris climate agreement hugely increased levels of ambition. This budget no longer ensures the UK is doing its fair share globally to prevent dangerous climate change. To recap: in December 2015, 174 states and the EU signed an international agreement aiming to limit global temperature rises to “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”. It also called for intensified efforts to limit rises at 1.5°C, acknowledging that this would considerably reduce the risk of dangerous climate change.  But the UK government sets its carbon budgets in consultation with the advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which aims only for a 50% probability of achieving a 2°C limit. Hence, if every country followed the UK’s lead there is already an “about as likely as not” chance of a 2°C future. The increased ambition of the Paris agreement, in this sense, compels the UK government to revise its budgets and aim for more stringent targets.  The basic science behind carbon budgets is this: for every tonne of carbon emitted into the atmosphere, mostly thanks to fossil fuels, there is an equivalent rise in temperature. The IPCC estimates that we have already emitted 65% of the carbon that is likely to result in a 2°C rise. Lots of fossil fuels remain in the ground, and the more we burn, the more the world will warm. To keep warming below 2°C we need to ensure that our global emissions of carbon remain below a certain level, or “budget”. There’s no internationally-agreed approach to sharing the available carbon budget. However, many feel the UK should pursue more ambitious targets than most, reflecting its outsized historical responsibility for climate change.  The CCC’s advice is based on the principle of contraction and convergence, whereby the global carbon budget is distributed equally across nations in accordance with every person having an equal right to “carbon space” by 2050. UK emissions per capita would need to reduce, whereas emissions in the least industrialised countries would have room to grow, albeit not even close to current British levels. If the remaining global budget – one that would give us a 66% probability of staying below 2°C – is apportioned on an equal per capita basis determined by today’s population, we calculate the UK’s cumulative carbon budget from 2011 through until 2100 would be in the region of 9 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases. If the intention is to achieve 1.5°C, the budget would be significantly less. However, we estimate current UK carbon budgets will mean nearly 15 gigatonnes of emissions from 2011 onwards – that’s 60% higher than an equal share. So the UK is set to emit far more than its fair share, even under the latest budget restrictions. Yet on top of this, industrialised countries such as Britain tend to benefit from the way emissions are calculated: carbon budgets focus on the emissions produced, not consumed. While emissions produced within the UK’s territory – by its factories, power plants, cars and so on – are declining, emissions driven by UK consumption are rising. These consumption-based emissions include all the carbon released when making clothes, phones or cars imported to the UK, while excluding gases emitted in the production of British exports. As the UK consumes lots, but actually makes relatively little, its emissions are effectively outsourced. A government enquiry four years ago stated that “the UK has to address its consumption if it is to make an effective contribution to a global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions”, but this hasn’t materialised in practice. Neither the Paris agreement nor the individual national pledges explicitly refer to consumption emissions, while budgets are still attributed to a country’s territory. Yet Paris is too ambitious to be achieved without addressing demand through appropriate consumption-related policies.  The UK is already set to fail to meet its Fourth Carbon Budget with the shortfall increasing the fifth time round. After a £1 billion competition to incentivise carbon capture and storage (CCS) was abandoned, the country’s climate policies now rely largely on an unprecedented boost in wind farms, solar energy and biomass power, and are likely to require extracting carbon directly from the atmosphere using risky and unproven technologies.  While huge wind farms, tidal lagoons and so on are headline-grabbing projects, there needs to be much greater emphasis on the often-overlooked topic of reducing energy demand – it’s immediate, effective and low risk. There is a danger that climate and energy policy could be caught up in the political turmoil caused by the Brexit vote. Climate experts had already warned a vote to leave the EU would harm existing environmental policies, after all.  The government should not only continue honouring its existing commitments, but also intensify its level of ambition. This would allow the UK to ease worries generated by its exit and keep demonstrating its global leadership in climate change – even in the post-Brexit era."
"Environmentalists have heaped scorn on Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, after he said the climate crisis could have benefits such as warmer winters, lower heating bills and fewer deaths. Some called the comments silly and weird, others branded them irresponsible.  The taoiseach made the comments in Dublin last week at the launch of an upbeat progress report on the government’s climate action plan. “One thing we definitely face as a result of climate change is a warmer winter. We’re already experiencing warmer winters and that actually means using less energy because it’s warmer and people need less heating and it also means fewer deaths as a result of cold weather,” he said. “It’s interesting that when you do look at those things there is a ledger, and there are benefits and there are downsides. The downsides outweigh the benefits, but we need to be aware of them too.” Irish Doctors for the Environment, an advocacy group, wrote to Varadkar on Monday saying the climate crisis had an “overwhelmingly negative effect on human health”. It asked him to retract and “address the errors” in his speech. Other environmental campaigners expressed anger and disbelief. “That the taoiseach would make these comments while delivering a progress report on his government’s climate action plan exposes the extent to which that plan is a surface level response to a multi-faceted crisis, the scale of which they fail to comprehend,” said the Green party. “Millions are dying or being displaced right now. That will rise to hundreds of millions if the complacency of governments around the world continues. Our milder winters are punctuated by cold snaps that threaten our most vulnerable, including the thousands of people now homeless.” Oisín Coghlan, the director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, acknowledged Ireland could benefit in a narrow way but said the climate emergency’s wider impacts on the country and the rest of the world were overwhelmingly negative. Cara Augustenborg, an environmental scientist at University College Dublin, echoed that view, saying the few lives that might be spared from winter-related deaths paled in comparison to wider suffering. Extinction Rebellion Ireland called the comments shocking. “It’s time for civil disobedience,” the group said. The spat came as climate experts warned that a catastrophic storm during high tide will flood thousands of homes, businesses and landmark buildings in Dublin in the coming decades.  Peter Thorne, a lead author on the fifth assessment report of the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said Ireland had so far been able to “dodge a bullet” because storms have struck during low tides. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m (£216m) for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting renewable energy. The government unveiled an ambitious plan in June that outlined measures to curb emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In recent days the singer Cher and the actor Mark Ruffalo have added their voices to a campaign to stop Ireland becoming an entry point for fracked US gas. "
"The close correlation between diet and environment that has been demonstrated by Michael Clark at the University of Oxford (Healthy food choices best for people and planet, study shows, 29 October) is interesting and potentially important. I hope the researchers will extend their studies into the environmental impact of what is variously known as cultured, in vitro or lab-grown meat. These products are now reaching consumers and prices will fall. Ostensibly, they appear environmentally beneficial. The “meat” is grown from cell samples painlessly extracted from a small number of animals, so killing and long-distance freighting is eliminated. Methane from domestic ruminants will be drastically reduced. Forests need not be supplanted by grazing or soy production for animal feed. Land can be released for growing more plant-based food or to be returned to nature. If it can also be shown that environmental harm is curbed, the role these products can play will be crucial in reducing greenhouse gasses. More research is required as soon as possible.Patrick CosgroveChapel Lawn, Shropshire  • I take issue with your editorial on Extinction Rebellion (22 October) and whether it wishes to achieve “reform or revolution”. Neither, thank you. Our three aims are clear: truth-telling by government, rapid action towards zero-carbon emissions, and – for many of us the most important one – a citizens’ assembly charged with mapping out the best ways in which the UK can address the climate emergency. We believe a citizens’ assembly, like the Irish one that addressed abortion, can create a plan that most members of this country would buy into and act upon. It is disappointing that the government shows no sign of accepting this modest request – but it also disappointing that journalists are not putting pressure on ministers to explain their thinking (if any) on this. Mark Haworth-BoothSwimbridge, Devon • This article was amended on 31 October 2019. Due to an editing error, Mark Haworth-Booth’s letter listed one of Extinction Rebellion’s aims as “truth-telling to government”. That should have been “truth-telling by government”, as he originally wrote.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I would like to debunk the claim that we have to act now because there’s a “97% consensus”.
In debates I keep hearing the claim that “97% of scientists agree” on global warming science and thus, with such an overwhelming consensus, taking action is a no-brainer. For example Hollywood actor and college dropout George Clooney recently parroted the argument that if 97 of 100 doctors recommend a procedure and 3% don’t who are you going to listen to?
Would you listen to the 97 if you knew they had been wrong for 16 years and the remaining 3 had been right all along?
First of all, this “97%” of all climate scientists agree on global warming is bogus to begin with, and is based on a faulty paper by John Cook and Dana Nuccitelli. read here and here.
So in climate science and policy, should we listen to the “97%” and act now? Or should we listen to the outlier 3% fringe group? The answer to that question is: Don’t listen to the winner of the popular vote, rather listen to the group that is right. And it turns out that the “97%” have been wrong for the last 16 years and the 3% minority have been right.
97% have been wrong for 16 years
Let’s look at the models coming from the “97% consensus” and see how they are doing compared to the real observed data. Here’s a plot by Dr. Roy Spencer:

Source: www.drroyspencer.com/
Almost all the models from the “97%” have been flat out wrong.

But isn’t Dr. Roy Spencer one of those deniers? Don’t we need to look at a really objective source like the IPCC? Next is a chart from an early, untampered draft of the IPCC 5AR, with additional information from Dr. Ira Glickstein:

Source: wattsupwiththat.com/. “IPCC AR5 draft figure 1-4 with animated central Global Warming predictions from FAR (1990), SAR (1996), TAR (2001), and AR5 (2007).” Graphic by Dr. Ira Glickstein.
Once again we see the models from the “97%” have all been wrong.
There are other charts out there, and they all tell us the same story: The models have been wrong from the first day.
Observed data show that the 3% are right
Even the IPCC’s own chart shows that the models from the 97%” have all overstated future warming.
The next time someone uses the consensus argument, ask him/her if we should believe the 97% who are wrong, or the 3% who are proven right.
Science is not decided by a show hands. If that’s how science had been done in the past, then man would still be walking on four limbs. Science moves by one voice showing the consensus is wrong.

"Both Portugal and Germany have recently succeeded in meeting almost all of their power needs using renewable energy. But at the moment, the UK falls far short of this feat. In 2015, less than a quarter of the country’s energy was generated from renewable power sources such as wind, solar, hydro and bio-energy.  If the UK is to usher in an era of low carbon energy by bringing more renewables online, then its energy infrastructure needs a major overhaul. The energy grid must be smart, flexible and integrated – which means making it more open and accessible via the latest technology. With many existing fossil fuel power stations set to be decommissioned in the coming 10 years, and energy from UK coal hitting zero for the first time in 100 years, it’s time to start implementing “smart” energy infrastructure.  In particular, tantalising opportunities are presented by the Internet of Things. For example, heating and cooling, mains switches and charging points could be monitored and altered via a mobile phone, a laptop, or an intelligent algorithm, which understands the dynamics of the energy system and residents’ personal preferences. With the Internet of Things, people could monitor their energy usage and programme household loads – such as washing machines or dishwashers – to run during times when energy is cheapest, or when renewable generators provide more energy to the grid. People would no longer be passive consumers connected to an ageing, centralised grid. Instead, residents could become empowered users of a dynamic system, which enables them to participate more directly in how they use, store, distribute and generate energy.  In this scenario, it might even be possible to achieve 100% renewable energy use, like Portugal and Germany. But it would only work if energy companies such as suppliers, and utilities, had unlimited and coordinated control over energy demand. And to do this, we’d need to change the way that information about energy is used and visualised.  For instance, energy consumers could share their energy use data with the distributor or community energy initiative using smart meters. Then, these suppliers would aim to provide energy at times when you need it most. But they would also offer incentives, such as rebates, to encourage people to use energy in more efficient ways.  Take, for example, people living in rural areas, where there is less energy infrastructure, which is more vulnerable to faults or failures. These residents probably have their own sources of back-up power, but they could combine this with an array of solar panels or a small wind or hydro power turbine, and effectively live “off grid” until the energy network is restored. What’s more, rural communities could operate their own “microgrids”, allowing residents to share any surplus energy generated with their neighbours.  Behaviour change is also key to achieving a low carbon energy system. Communities and businesses need to be more thoughtful about the way they use energy, and when. This will be much easier when all users can be aware of what others are doing, to make energy demand more in sync with supply.   According to a 2016 report by the National Infrastructure Commission, introducing “smart power” would require an energy system which facilitates interconnection, storage and demand flexibility. It is estimated that such a system would save energy customers £8bn a year by 2030, help the UK meet its 2050 carbon targets, and secure the UK’s energy supply for generations.  But this infrastructure cannot be implemented without a deep understanding of the whole energy system. At the moment, energy policy is paralysed by uncertainty about what the future low carbon energy mix will be and which transition pathways will lead to that future. This includes uncertainty about how energy and carbon prices will fluctuate, plus when and where the technological breakthroughs will be made.  What’s more, automated energy systems and smart grids carry their own risks. They can be vulnerable to cyberattacks: Ukraine’s power grid was hacked in December 2015, leaving more than 230,000 residents without power. It’s also important that the energy system can account for uncertainty about weather patterns, which affects renewables. For example, changes in wind speed result in changes in power output. Power outages, in particular, often occur due to grid vulnerability to extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, which are expected to increase because of climate change. It will be crucial to ensure that energy infrastructure is resilient to these risks and uncertainties.  At the National Centre for Energy Systems Integration, based at Newcastle University, researchers will be working with Siemens and the UK Energy Research Centre to make the UK’s energy system safer and more efficient. We will be examining the energy system as a whole – gas, electricity, renewables, heating and cooling – to come up with new ways to give customers greater control of their energy use, while allowing the industry to meet tough new low carbon targets. Along with innovations in energy storage, renewable energy technology and distribution, “smart power” has an exciting role to play in the UK’s energy future."

Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment buries its own study that windmills kill wildlife on a massive scale. Photo: Espen Lie Dahl. Photo not from Germany, for illustration only.
And we warned them that the wind farms were inefficient, unpredictable, and especially deadly to airborne wildlife. That of course clashed with their climate -rescue fantasies and so they just poohed-poohed that accusation. In Germany they have since erected 25,000 turbines.
Now, just 3 days ago, the online daily Kreiszeitung here reported on a new study about the devastating impacts of wind turbines on birds and bats:
According to a study, wind turbines in Germany kill hundreds regularly, and quite possibly even thousands of bats. The study could be explosive because it could lead to limitations for the turbines. But the scientists are not permitted to reveal the details.”
Cover-up – plain and simple. According to the Kreiszeitung, the study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Environment (Germany’s equivalent of the EPA), and was carried out by scientists of the University of Hannover.
The study showed that the wind turbines between the Alps and the coasts killed tens of thousands of bats each year.”
The Kreiszeitung also quotes experts from the Society for the Preservation of Owls (EGE) to give readers an idea of the scale of killing taking place annually:
Based on the findings if you calculate for the current 25,000 wind turbines in Germany, a quarter million bats are killed every year.”

All this is going on in a country where construction of projects are routinely shut down in Germany so that birds aren’t disturbed from spring until mid summer during the mating season.
The embarrassing, but gory details of the study are being kept under tight wraps: “The scientists assured the windpark operators anonymity in the project, in which Germany’s branch leader Enercon assisted as a partner,  in exchange for their willingness for cooperation in the study.” The EGE Preservation of Owls Society is now demanding that the publicly funded results be released so that it can be determined exactly where the flying mammals are getting killed and so that appropriate action can be taken.
The EGE is citing Germany’s Nature Protection Act which forbids the killing of endangered species. This has turned into a really messy situation for the Federal Ministry of Environment. In a law-abiding society, permit applications for the construction of windparks in such regions would have to be rejected, and existing ones curtailed, or even shut down. But in an environmental tyranny based on tampered, clandestine science, the law simply gets trampled on. The Kreiszeitung writes:
What is explosive in this case: The German Federal Ministry of Environment (BMU) supported the study with 1.1 million euros. The accusation by the EGE Owl Society is now plain to see: The federal government gives tax money for a project, from which we discover that the studied windparks possibly must be subject to new requirements so that they conform to the law. But nothing is happening.”
The study is getting swept under the carpet. My guess is that another study (a dubious corrupt one) will be commissioned and it in turn will show that very few bats are being killed after all. And in the end, should the bats end up disappearing, then they’ll just blame it on climate change.
The Kreiszeitung ends its report by reminding readers that wind energy isn’t so rosy after all:
They don’t feed in power at a constant rate and thus still require baseload power from conventional power plants. Critics fear a forest of windmills covering the landscape. And for the wind power variant of offshore windparks, a cable would have to rip through the world heritage Wadden Sea. Offshore, there are hardly any bats but the construction noise is driving the whales away.”
By now it should be clear: The biggest threat to the environment are the dishonest bureaucrats who want us to believe they are saving it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe fallout surrounding the profound failures of the climate models used by the IPCC continues. If the German media is anything to go by, then IPCC science is virtually disintegrating before our very eyes.
Europe has always been a bulwark against climate skepticism. No more. The online German ‘Die Welt’ daily reports today that the upcoming IPCC AR5 is a de facto withdrawal of the scientific basis for climate regulation.
Die Welt writes that “global warming is currently advancing considerably more slowly than assumed a few years ago” and has stalled over the last 15 years and that “scientists are unable to explain why“.
Basis for climate regulation crumbles
Die Welt then adds that the failed models and prognoses of the climate scientists will have profound implications for policymakers:
The IPCC results likely not only usher in a small change in the direction of the climate discussion and a retreat from the loudest alarmism, they also withdraw the firm basis of assumptions, which policymakers had considered undisputed for European and national climate regulations.”

Until recently, policymakers had always fallen back on “settled science” to justify painful measures to revamp energy supply. But now that “settled science” is gone. Justifying the vandalism of the landscape with windparks and selling high priced, unstable renewable energies to a skeptical public is about to get a whole lot tougher.
So why hasn’t warming increased as projected earlier? Die Welt writes:
One reason for that, according to the report, is that the calculation of the global warming by carbon dioxide emissions in the computer models was too heavily weighted.”
Already politicians are now calling for a new policy approach with regards to climate policy.
“It is being admitted for the first time that the climate is warming less than predicted,” European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer is quoted by Die Welt. “It’s reason enough to refrain from making emissions trading more strict, to rethink the CO2 targets which are dangerous to the German automotive industry, and to stop further ecological bans of products.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHistory is chock full with doomsday scenarios, peddled by profiteering charlatans, scenarios that time and again keep getting postponed decades into the future. Man running out of oil in 20 years has been around for a century. The claim still keeps getting made even by people who really should know better. And every time the goal posts end up getting pushed back.
A German industrial news site PROCESS here reports that leading German consulting group Roland Berger has recently released a new study titled: “Are we running out of oil?”
The answer is “no”. Moreover, Roland Berger writes that the future is oil.
PROCESS writes: “The core message of the study on the topic of oil supply: Supply bottlenecks are not to be expected because of the increasing number of oil reserves.”
The doomsday scenario of depleted oil reserves gets postponed again. PROCESS writes that the price of oil is poised to fall below 70 dollars a barrel. The primary reason for the downward crude oil prices is the increasing number of global oil reserves that are resulting from improved drilling methods. The Roland Berger study writes that currently there are an estimated 2.6 trillion barrels of crude in easily accessible reserves and 3.3 trillion barrels in unconventional reserves like oil sands and shale.

Challenges faced by alternative energy will spur demand for crude oil
The study also writes that the supply of oil will be less subject to political instability due to a supply that is becoming increasingly diversified and that production will increase in non-OPEC nations. According to PROCESS, demand for oil worldwide will also increase, with strong consumption growth taking place in the Middle and Far East, particularly China.
One reason for the expected demand in oil? PROCESS write (my emphasis):
In view of the rapid GDP growth after the financial crisis, the minimal state regulation in emerging countries and the challenges that the operators of alternative energies have to deal with, the demand for crude oil will increase.”
In summary, a global caliber consulting group concludes that alternative energies aren’t going to be able to meet the needs. The future is oil.

"Air pollution is often seen as a local problem requiring local and regional solutions. Karachi, London, Lagos, Mexico City and Paris are just a few of the world’s cities grappling with poor air quality. With city-dwellers increasingly being asked to ditch the car – especially if it’s diesel – and use greener modes of transport, it’s easy to forget that air is also mobile. As a result, there’s very little attention being paid to the impact of cross-border air pollution on human health and well-being. Globally, air pollution caused by microscopic fine particles (PM₂.₅) kills 3.5m people each year. These particles can easily enter the respiratory tract. They rank fifth worldwide among all risks to health after high blood pressure, smoking and diet. Breathing filthy air can increase the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, stroke and affect mental health. And it is the vulnerable in society who suffer the most, with 300m children currently breathing in toxic air. Indoor and outdoor air pollution, together with second-hand smoke, causes 570,000 deaths in children under five years of age each year, due to respiratory infections such as pneumonia. The movement of air pollutants from transport and agricultural activities in one country can affect the air quality in another. Such as the smoke from Indonesian forest fires which has caused a toxic haze to descend over parts of Malaysia and Singapore. Another example is the atmospheric brown cloud – a transnational air pollution phenomenon which contains aerosols such as soot and dust that poses risks to human health and food security, especially in Asia. Cross-border air pollution has been an issue for some time: in the 1970-80s, the UK was nicknamed the “dirty man of Europe” for belching out industrial sulphur emissions, which contributed to acid rain in Europe – a reputation that the Greens fear will be regained after Brexit.  But it’s only recently that the scale of the air pollution effects of international trade has been assessed, with one study suggesting that around 400,000 premature deaths occurred in 2007 in a different region of the world than the one in which the air pollutants were emitted. Goods and services produced in one region for use by another region are responsible for 22% (762,400) of air pollution-related deaths worldwide. In particular, Chinese particle emissions were responsible for 64,800 premature deaths in other regions, including over 3,000 deaths in Western Europe and the US. By contrast, Chinese products bought in Western Europe and the US are linked to over 100,000 deaths in China in one year.  International trade has seen many developed countries transferring their manufacturing abroad, in order to take advantage of cheap labour and lax environmental standards in often less wealthy nations. As a result, air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, has effectively been exported to developing countries. So, while murky grey images of smog smothered Beijing or New Delhi may prompt others to ask why they don’t clean up their act, it’s important to remember that these cities are shouldering an enormous manufacturing burden, as much of the world’s goods and services are outsourced to China and India.  There is now a need for governments to switch from calculating greenhouse gas emissions based on production to one based on consumption of goods and services. This has important implications for global climate and air mitigation policies because as much as 20% to 25% of overall carbon dioxide emissions come from the production of goods and services which are traded internationally. Although there has been success in achieving better air quality over the past the six decades, this doesn’t erase the need to face up to big global environment challenges. Cities are responsible for around 70% of global greenhouse gases. While carbon dioxide has warming influences on the climate in the long term, short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon (a primary part of particulate matter), methane and ozone have warming influences on the climate in the near-term. Local action, such as banning diesel cars, addresses both air and climate pollutants. This can achieve immediate effects by reducing near-term warming and improving air quality levels. There are several international conventions to regulate air pollution and related issues. But for now, there’s no coherent legal framework which aims to protect the atmosphere. This has led to calls for a new Law of the Atmosphere to provide effective cooperation on air pollution and climate change at regional and global scales. As it stands, the likelihood of such a law gaining support is low, given the climate change scepticism exhibited by powerful world leaders such as presidents Trump and Putin. Everyone has the right to clean air. But air pollution requires no visas, and its devastating impact can be felt far from the source. No longer can the leaders of developed nations shy away from the fact that their citizens’ consumption and lifestyle choices have a significant impact on people in others part of the world. As consumers, we have the power and the responsibility to demand better environmental and social standards – so we can all breathe life, wherever we live."
"Leonardo DiCaprio has praised teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg as a “leader of our time” following their first meeting. DiCaprio, a prominent environmental campaigner, said 16-year-old Thunberg’s message should be a “wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over”. The Academy Award winner shared a picture of him and the Swedish student on Instagram, writing: “There are few times in human history where voices are amplified at such pivotal moments and in such transformational ways – but Greta Thunberg has become a leader of our time. “History will judge us for what we do today to help guarantee that future generations can enjoy the same livable planet that we have so clearly taken for granted. “I hope that Greta’s message is a wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over.” DiCaprio, 44, who most recently starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, said he was “optimistic about what the future holds” thanks to Thunberg and young activists like her. “It was an honour to spend time with Greta,” he said. “She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.” DiCaprio is a vocal climate change campaigner and highlighted the issue during his acceptance speech at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016. He said: “Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating.” "
"The ascent is vertical. Up, up and into the jet stream. If the conditions are not right up there it will come back down and wait. But if there is a good tailwind in the right direction it will begin an epic journey that will take it around the curvature of the Earth; from the Arctic Circle to the southern hemisphere. Using the sun and stars as a compass, and navigating by the Earth’s magnetic field, recognising landmarks, the far eastern curlew will fly nonstop to the Yellow Sea, where it fuels up on the mudflats of north-east China.  Then it will fly through days and nights across oceans to reach the Australian coastline, an exhausted wreck of a bird that is down to skin and bones. An endurance athlete of the animal kingdom, an aerodynamic wonder, a bird that flies 30,000km a year, flapping its wings all the way because it can’t or soar or glide, the eastern curlew is a phenomenon of the natural world. It is also critically endangered. It has lost 80% of its population in the past 30 years. We don’t always see what is right in front of us. Tidal mudflats seem featureless, aesthetically disappointing, empty space, devoid of glossy breaking waves. But hidden beneath the mud they are fully functioning ecosystems of hundreds of species of invertebrates, crabs, shellfish and worms. Were it not for its preposterously long curving protuberance of a beak, you might not notice the brown speckled bird with that beak deep in the mud, feeding. The eastern curlew is the largest of more than 100 shorebirds that traverse the globe every year. They travel on one of nine invisible flyways that converge in the Arctic region. It is sometimes called the moonbird because if it lasts its 20-year lifespan it would have flown the distance between the Earth and the moon. Now, if a proposed development goes ahead on the mudflats at Toondah Harbour in Brisbane, the eastern curlew will, after flying 12,000km, arrive to find part of its habitat for six months each year taken over by a $1.4bn, 42-hectare marina and 3,500 apartment complex. Toondah is part of Moreton Bay, which is listed under the Ramsar convention on wetlands – an international treaty that protects important wetlands around the world. As well as 50,000 waterbirds, including 30 migratory species, it is the habitat of dugongs and turtles. For tens of thousands of years the eastern curlew has travelled on the east Asian-Australasian flyway to get here. Along with 55 other migratory species it passes through 22 countries along the way. The flyways – super highways – take birds to Africa, Europe, the Americas. Says Randall Wood, a director who is travelling and researching Flyways, a film about globally migrating shorebirds: “The birds link all those countries. It is a beautiful story of resilience, endurance and versatility.” The world record for marathon flying is now held by the smaller bar-tailed godwit, which has been tracked travelling 11,000km from Alaska to New Zealand at an average of 50km/h, in a big arc and without stopping, in only eight days. “Fuel is stored in the body as fat,” Wood says. “They use a combination of fat and animo acid drawn from muscle depletion, so they are literally digesting their muscles on route. What [scientists] are not sure about is how they are able to fly as far as they do with the fuel that they have got. The math doesn’t add up. It is known that the eastern curlew shrivels organs like its reproductive system, which it doesn’t use while flying, to almost nothing to save a few grams of weight. Harry Saddler, who wrote the book The Eastern Curlew, says: “Before they leave they will feed frantically and put on 80% of their bodyweight again in fat. When they are getting ready to fly they are like balloons that are bursting and you wonder how they can get off the ground.” Migrating birds’ ability to predict long-term weather forecasts, says Wood, “is better than the very, very best computer models we have got. They can tell months out when a storm is going to come. They will actually time their departures to literally slingshot themselves out to sea on the tail of a storm and propel themselves across oceans.”  A whimbrel, says Amanda Lilleyman, a research associate at Charles Darwin University, was “tracked moving 200km out of the way of the eye of the cyclone before the cyclone hit”. As eastern curlews get ready to leave for their breeding grounds in Siberia in April, their plumage change. “They get these fresh flight feathers to take them back up north,” says Lilleyman. They will also be growing brighter feathers to attract mates. Having gone to all the trouble of the energy-intensive migration to Siberia, says Saddler, “They get straight down to business because they are only there for six weeks. The male tries to impress the female by doing 15-metre-high flights while calling the whole time.” The chicks feed themselves from the moment they are hatched and are start their first migration at six weeks. It is what they face on their migration that gives us the bird’s eye view of the world we have created. “Many scientists call the eastern curlew a sentinel species,” Wood says. “They are telling us about the state of the world globally in ways that many other species just aren’t.  “Shorebirds face a perfect storm. They are facing compounding impacts from climate change, extensive coastal development, extreme habitat loss, the rise of megacities in Asia, light pollution, wind turbines, pesticide use on broad-acre farms, hunters who shoot them, and competing with farmers for water.” The climate crisis has taken its toll on another shorebird, the great knot, whose numbers have been getting smaller and smaller. “Because,” says Saddler, “the Arctic summer begins three weeks earlier than it used to. They are still flying to their traditional timetable but, by the time they get up there, the insect boom has been and gone. The chicks hatch and there is not enough food so they are malnourished, they don’t grow as large, the bills don’t grow as long.  “So when they eventually manage to migrate and get to the mudflat to refuel and feed, they can’t reach the depth of the clams any more, so they feed on roots and plants which are much less nutritious. It just has this cascading effect down the line.” The most endangered bird of all is the tiny spoon-billed sandpiper, which travels down from Russia to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. It is thought that there are just 200 breeding pairs left. One weather event on its way and it will be gone forever. “These birds aren’t going to be saved by captivity,” Saddler says, “because they are hardwired to fly 10,000km a year.” The flyways are only as strong as their weakest link. “Every country on the migration route is in the chain,” Saddler sats. “It doesn’t matter if one link in the chain is strong, if another link is smashed there is no chain any more.” And the weakest link is Australia. Like Toondah Harbour, Lake Wollumboola on the south coast of New South Wales is an internationally significant site that is slated for rezoning – into a development of a possible 600 homes. “Eastern curlews are extraordinary creatures and the fact that we are allowing this species to go extinct under our watch is a total violation of the treaty,” Wood says. The eastern curlew is very site-specific; it always returns to the same place. When South Korea built the world’s longest seawall, Saddler says: “It killed the entire estuary. The birds didn’t go somewhere else, they landed where the estuary should have been and the food was no longer there and they died. When they land they simply don’t have the energy left to go to other food sources. With that one construction the great knot went from least concern to endangered.” Every time one is frightened into flight by a human or a dog, Saddler says, that “is a wingbeat that is robbed from the upcoming migration. They don’t wander around because they need to save all the energy they can get.” Even China, Saddler says, after many years of rapacious development and land reclamation, has “had a huge turn of attitude. China has got a new green policy. They have just had huge swathes of land nominated for world heritage status on the coast. They are forging ahead with the conservation movement in China – we are stepping in the opposite direction.” He adds: “This perpetual growth model of the economy is fundamentally incompatible with life on Earth.” There are estimated to be about 25,000 eastern curlews left which, given the dangers they face migrating, is not a lot. But everyone, Saddler says, including scientists around the world, “who is working on shorebirds is deeply and extraordinarily passionate about them”. Says Wood: “We think we can lose a species here and there and perhaps we can but what they are actually showing us is a barometer of global health – and we ignore that at our peril. There is a ticking clock here and it is an extinction story and we are marching towards it.”"
"A gorilla at Cincinnati Zoo has been shot dead after a boy fell into his enclosure. When I told my wife, a former vice director of a zoo, she first asked if the boy was okay and then said how terrible for the keeper who shot the gorilla. I hadn’t thought about it from the perspective of the zoo keeper who pulled the trigger. But my wife is right: it must have been a terrible thing for that person, something that may haunt them for the rest of their life. From this perspective, the case reminds me of the ending of John Steinbeck’s novel Of Mice and Men when George has to kill his friend Lennie out of love rather than Lennie be killed by a lynch mob. Except that Harambe the gorilla, unlike Lennie, had not accidentally killed anyone. Watching the video of Harambe dragging the young boy through the moat was frightening and whether this was done to harm the child or not, it is clear that the boy’s injuries could have been far worse. Yet Harambe was simply doing what any male gorilla would do when confronted with an intruder in his territory. Captive gorillas are trained by their keepers to go to their indoor enclosure on command, but in such an emotionally-charged situation this training does not always work. The two female gorillas responded to the calls of their keepers to go inside, but Harambe did not. When our adrenaline levels are sky high, I’m sure we have all failed to do what we are told. Previous cases have ended without bloodshed, such as the 1986 incident when a boy fell into the gorilla enclosure at Jersey Zoo in the Channel Islands. The male gorilla, Jambo, famously stood over the unconscious child and protected him, perhaps realising his motionlessness meant he was in distress. The keepers thus took a calculated risk based on their knowledge of Jambo’s personality and behaviour, and climbed into the enclosure to rescue the boy. It is hard to imagine that zoo staff in the US – with its obsession with litigation – would dare enter an enclosure in such a situation.  What other options did the zoo staff have? In the past the threat of a dart gun could scare an animal away, or keepers would enter the enclosure with CO2 fire extinguishers. However, these days most zoo animals are trained to comply with veterinary and husbandry procedures, so many won’t even recognise a dart gun, while extinguishers are now considered too risky to the health of animals and anyone in the pen with them. So, advances zoos have made through husbandry training mean that some “old” tricks no longer work. “Carrots” have been so effective we’ve forgotten about the “sticks”. If you’re wondering why an instantaneous tranquiliser was not used, the answer is simple: there is no such thing. It takes several minutes for tranquilisers to send a large animal to sleep. Plus once an animal is very agitated and has massive amounts of adrenaline flowing through its veins the tranquilising drug may be ineffective. It would be hard to judge the correct dose – too little could result in no effect and too much could result in killing the animal through an overdose. Basically, the zoo is now in a lose-lose situation. For me, the big questions concern humans not gorillas. How was it possible for the child to climb through the enclosure’s barrier? This shouldn’t have happened, even if the parents were not paying attention. And second, what motivated the child to do this? Perhaps he was unable to see the gorillas and his parents did not pick him up to see – so he decided to find a solution to the problem. But zoo enclosures should be designed so that children of all ages and heights can see while standing on their own two feet or sitting in their pushchair. The situation was tragic for all concerned, but especially for the keeper who shot the gorilla – zoo staff, after all, do their job because they love animals. So this keeper killed Harambe because he felt he had no choice. We can all say “what if” but now is the time to learn the lessons."
"Scientists have warned about the dangers of plastic pollution and microplastics in the environment for a while now. But most people still aren’t convinced of the link between carelessly discarding a water bottle and damage in the seas. After all, plastic in the ocean doesn’t have the powerful symbolism of nuclear plants or oil spills: most of it is below the waves, often invisible to the naked eye. A new documentary feature film, A Plastic Ocean, wants to change all that. It follows several popular films on the oceans that have successfully shifted attitudes and even shaped legislation. The End of the Line triggered a wave of media attention on unsustainable fishing practices, while SeaWorld finally agreed to halt its orca breeding programme after the “Blackfish effect”.  I’m a media sociologist specialising in science communication. As part of my research I recently spoke to the movie’s producer, former BBC Blue Planet producer Jo Ruxton. She discusses the film, and her hopes that it will create a cultural shift in public perceptions and behaviour concerning plastic pollution. Lesley Henderson: You’ve always been interested in the ocean through your work as a filmmaker and have spent several years living on islands around the world. Was there something specific that prompted you to create this film? Jo Ruxton: I’d heard about the so-called “Great Pacific Garbage Patch”, a floating continent twice the size of Texas and ten metres deep. I started looking into it but couldn’t find any pictures or anything on Google Earth. I went out to the centre of the North Pacific to look for it on an expedition with scientists and volunteers and but we still couldn’t see it. Then we started to do surface plankton trawls about 400 miles off San Francisco just to see what was in there. The closer we got to the centre the more plastic we found. Every trawl was coming up jam-packed with plastics but when you actually looked out on the water you could hardly see anything. There were a few floating bits around but it certainly wasn’t a ten metre deep continent.  I talked to the scientists and found out that plastic becomes very brittle in sea water because it’s subjected to sunlight, waves and salt and it takes about 20 years to get from the coast to the centre. It breaks up until it’s smaller and smaller and now of course it’s mixing with the plankton. That to me was a much more insidious story because if it’s mixing with the plankton it’s clearly getting into the food chain which can’t be good for the plankton and the fish that are feeding on it. LH: So were there particular visual challenges of filming microplastics? How did you overcome these? JR: It’s the images that sell a film, if you don’t have those, you’re dead in the water. So we thought, what about the effects on big charismatic animals, the baleen whales that feed on plankton? We used interesting scientists: seeing a woman walk along the side of the jetty with a crossbow slung over her shoulder and finding out she’s a professor about to go and shoot dolphins to take blubber samples makes you sit up and watch.   Another scientist was doing night dives and trawls looking at lantern fish travelling up from the depths and finding pieces of plastic in their stomachs. The visual images of squid hunting at night in torch light are quite special. To get people interested it was a case of finding the right animals, getting the images, and getting some fun stuff in there including “boys toys” like a submersible. LH: How did you approach presenting the scientific information about the risks to human health posed by microplastics? JR: We used lay people (champion free diver Tanya Streeter and journalist Craig Leeson) to ask the questions. Though we’ve really simplified the science, every statement we make has been backed by peer-reviewed papers. This link between chemicals leaching out of plastics and plastics attracting chemicals was particularly difficult to explain. Tuvalu was the most important sequence: here was a place drowning under its own plastic waste. They’re just burning it, and kids are playing with bonfires as they come home from school. We filmed a family group of 30 and five had cancer and two more had died of it in the previous 18 months. We know that furans and dioxins have been linked to cancer and we know that those gases are produced when we burn plastic but no one’s linked the two. LH: In the film you show deposit schemes in Germany where people receive money for recycling plastic bottles – was part of your aim to try to create value for plastic? JR: The movie has for key messages: it’s about health, value, charismatic animals and it’s about the environment. I care about all four but even if people don’t care about their own health they might care about money, if they don’t care about people and the environment then they care about money. LH: Why a feature documentary film rather than other forms of media or education? JR: There are a lot of short films on the internet but I think there is now more of an appetite for big environmental films. The End of the Line brought huge change, the whole Hugh’s Fish Fight changed policy in Europe, Blackfish too – it’s not just the tree huggers who are going to see it. An Inconvenient Truth was basically a power point presentation but was powerful enough to get a lot of people sitting up and thinking.  So why not have one about plastic pollution? It is a growing concern, we’re finding out more and more about it and perhaps this is the way forward. I can go and give lectures to 100 people at a time but a successful film can reach many more people. LH: How do you envisage that audiences will engage with A Plastic Ocean? JR: I think it will be an eye opener. One of the reasons environmental films are so hard to get commissioned is because they’re very doom and gloom. It’s people who already care who come and watch them and they come out feeling like they’ve been punched in the stomach and guilty every time they eat a fish or start the car up. But the last 20 minutes of this film is dedicated to “what we can do” in terms of legislation, technology, or changes in our behaviour. LH: So what you’re trying to do is trigger a cultural change? JR: Yes cultural change is probably the biggest thing along with legislation. If there is an oil spill it’s all hands on deck to clean it up and restore the habitat. If plastic was reclassified as hazardous that’s exactly what we would be doing: restoring habitats and doing something positive with all that plastic."
"It touches the food we eat and the air we breathe, the clothes we wear and possibly the device you’re using to read these words. But slavery today is a paradox. It is hidden away as never before, but its effects are everywhere. If slavery were a country it would have the population of Canada and the GDP of Kuwait, but its CO2 emissions would rank third globally after China and the US. The latest measures of global slavery conservatively estimate there are about 36m slaves worldwide, spread across virtually all countries. The UN says slavery generates some US$150 billion annually. These numbers seem immense, but the number of slaves represents only a small amount of the global population. While US$150 billion is a tiny fraction of the global economy and is spread across several million local criminal enterprises. In all of human history, slavery has never been such a small part of our shared existence. Slavery is illegal in every country, it is condemned by every faith, and business and government leaders are unanimous in rejecting it. Slavery has been pushed to the very edges of our global society, but it is still destroying lives and the natural world at an alarming rate because the criminal gangs who employ slave labour are often involved in pollution and deforestation as part of their work. As part of my research, I met 19-year-old Shumir in a village at the bottom of Bangladesh. Just the night before he had escaped from slavery by stowing away in a fishing boat. He was lured into slavery, he said: A recruiter told my parents he would give them 2000 taka [US$29] if they’d let me come and work on a fish camp … The man said the work was easy, and there was plenty of food to eat. My parents needed the money and I wanted to help, so I left with the recruiter.  It was a lie. Shumir and dozens of other boys would often work 24 hours straight. “The longer I worked,” he told me, “I’d get exhausted and clumsy. Sometimes I’d cut myself with the gutting knife or slip and fall from the drying rack. Whenever I made a mistake the boss would hit me”.  Yet more feared than the bosses were the tigers. Every boy I met from the fish camps reported having witnessed or having known another child slave who had been eaten by a tiger. These accounts came about because criminal slaveholders had carved fish processing camps from the forests of the Sundarbans UNESCO World Heritage Site – a natural habitat for protected Bengal tigers in the area. This vast area of protected mangrove forest is also the largest carbon sink in Asia – which basically means that it absorbs more carbon that it releases and is particularly key to the environment. The forest also functions as a crucial buffer protecting coastal towns from cyclones. Invaded by criminal gangs, their slaves clear cut the forest, feeding CO2 into the atmosphere and set the collision course of slave children and protected tigers. The profits driving this destruction come from the global market for shrimp and pet food, but it doesn’t have to be this way. The fish camp where Shumir was enslaved is just one of thousands of slave-based enterprises in agriculture, mining, brick making, timbering, charcoal making, and other businesses spread around the world’s equatorial belt, the vast majority of which cause pollution and deforestation as part of their everyday work. But understanding the link between slavery and climate change can help to solve both problems. In Brazil I met a former slave named Jose Barros who had previously worked down the mines. He turned his life around in 2005 when he was granted access – but not ownership – to 100 acres of Amazonian forest. This was assisted by a local cooperative of small farmers organised by the Pastoral Land Commission – an offshoot of the catholic church in Brazil. As part of their project to tackle both slavery and climate change they provided Barros with cocoa seedlings that he planted beneath the big canopy trees. In return he had to leave 60% of the forest intact. When the cocoa pods began to grow, “that’s when our lives began to change”. He told me how he sold about 1,000 kilos of cocoa and for the first time ever was able to buy more than just the food his family needed. His children went to school and their lives improved dramatically. The forest is now preserved and guarded. Barros plants new trees and harvests other cash crops like Brazil nuts that grow naturally.  A concerted effort to end slavery around the world is a big investment, but one that can have a huge global impact. Enforcement of the anti-slavery laws that are on the books in every country would immediately diminish CO2 emissions and species loss. In developing countries ending slavery can stimulate the economy, ward off the threat of rising sea levels or destructive deforestation, and preserve endangered species. Freed slaves can also be paid to replant the forests they were forced to cut. This would not only help to rehabilitate the land, but it would also help to give work and a wage to some of the people who need this most in the world."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPredictions of the climate’s development in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels started in earnest over 25 years ago. James Hansen led the way beginning in 1988. In Germany the director of the prestigious Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology Hartmut Grassl was vocal.

Around 1990 former Max Planck Institute of Meteorology director Hartmut Grassl (left) and former NASA GISS director James Hansen predicted global temperatures would rise 1.5°C by 2020.
Both men played instrumental roles in getting governments to take action against the emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2. Since 1990 global CO2 emissions have actually even surpassed the worst case scenarios of the climate science community, meaning temperatures indeed should have increased even more then what the two scientists projected.
Both Hansen (1988) and Grassl (1990) predicted that global temperatures would rise about 1.5° by 2020, under business-as-usual CO2 emissions. Today plotted observed temperature data show that their predictions completely overshot and even resemble the ravings of an end-of-world lunatic, see the following chart, bold red line. This is nothing short of embarrassing,

Chart above depicts Hansen’s and Grassl’s predictions from 1988 and 1990 respectively. Other model predictions also overshot actual observed temperatures, which are given by the HADCRUT4 surface and UAH lower troposphere curves. Original chart: www.drroyspencer.com/wrong/.

 In 2012, Die kalte Sonne site here researched Grassl’s earlier predictions and found this quote from 1990:
Already in the next 30 years the earth will warm up with high probability by one to two degrees Celsius.”
The plot above is the average of that, i.e. 1.5°C, which corresponds to Hansen’s 1988 bleak outlook. Moreover Grassl in 1994 already declared the debate over:
On the scientific side, the process of indications when it comes to the subject of the greenhouse effect is over, the guilty verdict is in. It is no longer about getting more evidence, rather it is about reducing the sentence a bit. The global mean temperatures will rise between 1 and 2°C in the next decades.”
Hansen at the time was pretty much saying the same thing.
Both men have gone on to receive many medals and awards for their work, and still continue today being taken seriously by policymakers and media outlets. How much longer that can be sustained is a question climate science critics are watching very closely.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I posted on a new study from Nicola Scafetta, which found indications that the sun plays a far greater role in climate change and that CO2 climate sensitivity is pegged too high.
A number of large studies have come out over the last couple of years and months showing the same. No wonder the IPCC is under pressure to scale back its projected temperature rise by the year 2100.
The Economist here has seen an unpublished draft copy of the 5th Assessment Report. Some excerpts from the Economist article (my emphasis):
According to one table from the unpublished report, which was seen by The Economist (above), at CO2 concentrations of between 425 parts per million and 485 ppm, temperatures in 2100 would be 1.3-1.7°C above their pre-industrial levels. That seems lower than the IPCC’s previous assessment, made in 2007. […]
It is clear that some IPCC scientists think the projected rise in CO2 levels might not have such a big warming effect as was once thought.

In the new draft, the lower end of the range has been reduced to 1.5°C and the “most likely” figure has been scrapped. That seems to reflect a growing sense that climate sensitivity may have been overestimated in the past and that the science is too uncertain to justify a single estimate of future rises. If this does turn out to be the case, it would have significant implications for policy.”

Of course the IPCC will continue to insist that a catastrophe is coming, unless we hand the reigns of power and decision-making over to environmental elitists. It’ll be interesting to see if they disappear the following graphic, which appeared in a leaked draft late last year:
 
My bet is that it will not see the light of day in the final report. The 5th assessment report will be the IPCC’s last chance.

Germany’s Energiewende and renewable feed-in act are often touted as huge, jobs-creating success stories. But as the prices for electricity skyrocket into the stratosphere and renewable energy companies bite the dust all over Europe, it’s turning out that the green jobs wonder is nothing short of a fraud.
Germany’s Wirtschaftswoche (Business Week) here writes that Professor Fritz Vahrenholt calls the green jobs machine a “labeling fraud”. The bottle doesn’t contain anything what the label says.
Fritz Vahrenholt, former CEO of German power company RWE renewable energy arm, contests the claims made by green industry lobbyists that green energies are a jobs machine. Vahrenholt tells Wirtschaftswoche:
With green jobs, what we have here is labeling fraud.”

Vahrenholt calls the claimed jobs number a product of “naïve calculations”. And according to the statistics office of the German federal government, only 4719 workers remain employed in the production of solar cells and modules.
Yet according to the Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft – BSW – (Federal Association for Solar Business), the number for the entire industry is “around 60,000”.
But this number is wildly exaggerated says other experts and Vahrenholt. Even according to the Centre for Solar Marketing in Berlin says:
Even when you use the very broad definition of the BSW, you can only come up with a maximum of 35,000 employees in the solar industry.”
Anyone looking at a list of solar bankruptcies taking place over the last two years can see that the solar industry is an economic catastrophe.

Also among the distinguished speakers are geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning (above), co-author of the book “The Neglected Sun” and co-publisher of the German skeptic climate science site Die kalte Sonne.
Recently I had the chance to get some of his insights on the climate issue. First question I asked was why he thought there has been a pause in global warming. He believes the answer is the combination of the downward phase of ocean cycles and lower solar activity, and he expects the plateau or a drop to continue until the 2030s. It is not a surprise that the oceans are now ‘eating heat’, he says.

Lüning then says it’s pretty clear that the global climate of the last 1000 years has been primarily driven by solar activity and ocean cycles and that “the body of evidence supporting this is massive and overwhelming”.
Dr. Lüning has not been very impressed by the IPCC climate models (97% of them have markedly overestimated the projected warming) and I asked him if he thought the models were getting better with time as we keep hearing that they are being “fine-tuned”. Dr. Lüning doesn’t believe so. “They continue to overestimate CO2 and volcanoes and seriously underestimate solar and ocean cycles.” On CO2 climate sensitivity, he thinks a doubling will lead to a temperature increase of only 1.0 to 1.5°C.
I also asked him about energy policy in Germany and the news that an expert commission recently concluded that the German Energiewende has been extremely costly and ineffective and thus if he thought a slowdown in Germany’s renewable energy sector was ahead? He answered: “Yes. Very likely. We cannot risk losing competitiveness altogether. Now is a good moment to correct the direction.”
Finally I asked what message he wished to convey at the EIKE conference:
Study the climate of the past to identify the processes that influence today’s and tomorrow’s climate.”
And with that I’d say you can expect to see an exciting scientific presentation by Dr. Lüning, and from all the other speakers for that matter, at the 7th EIKE Climate Conference in Mannheim next month.

By now, well informed people are aware that there has been no warming for the last 16 or so years. Why should this be if CO2 has increased by 8% in that time? We are told by 97% of climate researchers, that CO2 doubling must warm us by 2 to 4.5 degrees C, so that 8% increase should have resulted in something like 0.2 to 0.3° C warming in the last two decades. Despite the best efforts of the data manipulators, that hasn’t happened. What is going on?
It has not occurred to many researchers that climate sensitivity to CO2 is not a constant. As Willis Eschenbach has pointed out in several articles, here, here, here, and most importantly, here, climate sensitivity is variable over short times, long times, and areas. It varies by time of day, being high in the morning when the sun is warming the atmosphere at the highest rate, and lower in the afternoon when rising air results in cumulus clouds and thunderstorms. It varies by latitude, being low or even negative in the tropics, where there are more thunderstorms, and higher at mid-latitudes. It is generally higher over land than over oceans, though there are extremely negative local spots over some tropical rain forests.

Figure 1 from Willis Eschenbach here.
Climate sensitivity also seems to be variable over long time scales. We know that both CO2 and water vapor are involved in the process, and we know that the effect of both is logarithmic. For CO2, as it increases in the atmosphere, the effect becomes less and less. Most of the greenhouse effect takes place at concentrations less than 200 ppm.
We also know that atmospheric humidity has been decreasing as CO2 is increasing, offsetting CO2 warming with water vapor cooling.

Figure 2: CO2 and humidity over time (600 mbar altitude).
If we let MODTRAN calculate the resulting outbound long wave radiation (OLR) we see why we had cooling in the 60’s and 70’s and warming in the 80’s and 90’s. We also see the leveling in the last decade.

Figure 3: Computed OLR inverted so that warming is upward and cooling downward.
This decrease in humidity has more than offset the increase in CO2 and has decreased the climate sensitivity due to CO2 over time. This is also seen in computations of climate sensitivity versus temperature.

Figure 4: Computation of climate sensitivity from CO2 change and temperature change over 60-year time intervals to bridge AMO/PDO cycles.
Figure 4 shows that climate sensitivity has dropped from the 3 to 4°C per CO2 doubling range in the mid-20th century to below 2°C in the 1980’s, and to the 1.6 to 1.7°C range seen today. This explains the range and decreasing values seen in recent attempts to measure climate sensitivity. Water vapor is the thermostat, not CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a lot going on today as the IPCC continues to clash violently with climate reality.
We’ve always suspected that governments had contracted out the results to begin with. In the beginning, the scientists played along. After all the observations nicely followed the model projections for almost 2 decades. But the wanted results are no longer possible to deliver and the observations have long since diverged from the model projections. Now bitter disputes are breaking out between client and provider as a result.
Today Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here reports:
Dispute with scientists […] Against the will of many scientists, especially delegates of the German government want to keep the pause in global warming of the last 15 years out of the IPCC Report’s summary.”
Hat tip: Ike.
Obviously “many scientists” are starting to have serious second thoughts and are getting queasy about assuming the role of science prostitute, assigned by sleazy pimping governments. This is understandable for any self-respecting scientist. After all, who is ready to go down in history as purchased whore, crackpot scientist?

Picture this: What we have are German politicians from the Ministry of Environment, who have little science background, literally schooling the expert scientists on what the results should be and which ones are important. What’s now happening in Stockholm is the brazen politicization and corruption of science. The picture speaks for itself. That’s why I write using the crude analogies of pimps and (potential) whores.
SPIEGEL writes:
Leading scientists are contradicting the political delegates. Jochem Marotzke, President of the German Climate Consortium and the leading scientific representative at the negotiations in Stockholm promises: ‘We are going to confront this issue head on.’ The UN IPCC has to accept a discussion about the temperature stop.”
New SPIEGEL survey: only 39% fear global warming!
The SPIEGEL report in general conveys a growing sense of desperation among German delegates. The flagship news magazine writes of waning public concern when it comes to climate change, writing of a “dramatic change in public opinion” shown by a new survey commissioned by SPIEGEL:
Germans no longer have any fear of the impacts of climate change. While in 2006 a clear majority of Germans (62 percent) feared global warming, now it’s only a minority of 39 percent.”

"Twitter’s plan to ban all political advertising risked muzzling climate activists while giving polluters free rein to promote themselves, the US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said. “Twitter’s new ad policy will allow fossil fuel companies to buy ads defending themselves and spreading misleading info but won’t allow organisations fighting the climate crisis to buy ads holding those companies accountable,” she tweeted, linking to an environmental newsletter.   The announcement by Twitter was generally well received by critics of the state of online political advertising. The company’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, had taken a sideswipe at Facebook, tweeting: “It’s not credible for us to say ‘we’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad … well … they can say whatever they want’.” But a follow-up from Twitter’s general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, revealed that the company was considering extending the ban beyond political advertising to “issue ads”. Gadde said the company was considering outlawing “ads that advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance (such as climate change, healthcare, immigration, national security and taxes)”. The mention of climate change stoked concerns that the rules could allow oil companies to promote the benefits of fossil fuels while barring critics from noting the related carbon dioxide emissions and the contribution to the climate crisis. Dorsey responded to Warren’s criticism by saying that the new rules were not yet in place and would not be revealed publicly until 15 November – 10 days after elections in the US and a little under a month before the UK general election. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, backed Warren, saying: “[Her point] is one of the key issues many miss about banning political ads on any platform. You can’t ban these ads without significantly inhibiting the ability of activists, labour groups and organisers to make their cases too.” Since he was promoted last year, Mosseri, who had been Instagram’s vice-president of product, has become one of the public faces of Facebook (Instagram’s owner), actively wading into policy debates on Twitter in a way Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, do not."
"A large chunk of chalk recently collapsed into the sea from the Seven Sisters cliffs, a world-renowned beauty spot located on England’s East Sussex coastline. To many, they are a quintessentially English landmark – and the British press was quick to show concern. The usual questions that follow these types of events involve the rate at which the coastline is eroding and potential risks to the public.  Answering these questions is difficult from a scientific perspective – sets of data regarding rock fall are often not available and those that are available are often incomplete. Approximately 53% of England and Wales’ coastline exhibit cliffs and shore platforms. These cliffs retreat through episodic rock falls that can range in size from small pebbles to hundreds of thousands of cubic metres. Analysis of historical aerial photographs can go some way to establishing the rate of retreat over decades. However, this approach does not provide information on individual rock fall events. Since the turn of the millennium, the evolution of sea cliffs has received greater attention from earth scientists. The interaction of the local climate, waves and tidal range with cliff materials makes changes in these land forms difficult to predict over large areas. In order to develop an understanding of the relative frequency of rock fall events of differing magnitudes, an inventory of events through time is required. This can then be used to both predict future change as well as establish the potential risk posed by rock falls to both the public and to infrastructure. The way forward therefore seems to involve mapping technology that is capable of capturing both large and small rock falls as they occur along a section of coast. This kind of high-precision monitoring has improved our understanding of the rates of cliff erosion by measuring volumetric change between extremely detailed 3D models of the cliff face. These data have typically been acquired through change detection between sequential datasets using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), a time-of-flight laser system capable of reliably detecting rockfalls about the size of a fist at a range of several hundred meters. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of cliff erosion and has been put to good use in experimental programs around the world. However, TLS is both extremely costly in terms of equipment and quite labour intensive. An alternate way of collecting data with similar characteristics to TLS is known as digital photogrammetry. This method has the advantage of virtually instantaneous data capture and, when used in conjunction with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology – drones – offers the potential to provide high-resolution topographical information over large areas.  A pilot study undertaken at Telscombe Cliffs to the east of Brighton using an off-the-shelf multirotor UAV and a 36 mega-pixel digital camera has produced promising results with rockfall detection capabilities similar to those demonstrated by TLS. An example of the type of 3D model generated from these data is shown above.   Data used to create the model was collected during an eight-minute flight. The only real limit to the length of coastline that can be monitored in this way is the endurance of the UAV and the data storage capacity of the camera.  With high-endurance UAV platforms and camera systems it would seem feasible to map the undefended sea cliffs of England and Wales in their entirety at a relatively low cost. Repeat surveys taken annually over decades would then form the basis for a comprehensive rock fall inventory and could be used to answer the questions of risk management and cliff erosion that currently remain unanswered."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe original motivation behind Copernicus Publishing director Martin Rasmussen’s decision to shut down the new journal Pattern Recognition Physics (see here, here and here) had nothing to do with the alleged “nepotistic” behavior among editors and peer-reviewers, but appears to have had everything to do with politically incorrect questioning of IPCC orthodoxy.
You can see how Rasmussen’s accusations appeared on PRP on the morning of January 17, 2014 at Bigcitylib.blogspot.com.
Note how the…
In addition, the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis, which we regard as malpractice in scientific publishing and not in accordance with our  publication ethics we expect to be followed by the editors”
…that you now see here was added later.
The “nepotism” accusation was a dubious at best, mostly entails personal intrigue and was added later to cover up the real motivation. It is only a side show to distract from the real reason behind the magazine’s shut down.
Clearly this really gets down to suppressing alternative views that threaten the popular global warming science. It’s a sad example of Germany succumbing to behavior of darker times.
Please restrict comments to the issue of suppressing alternative scientific explanations and the efforts involved therein and the merits of the science presented in the banned journal.
Roger of Tallbloke’s Talkshop recently had an interesting post on the suppression of science that’s well worth reading. The harboring of disagreement with a particular science is not a reason for shutting it down.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal sea ice is supposed to be melting away. We are often led to believe that it is at or near record lows. It’s global warming after all, and everyone knows that warmth melts ice. But if ice is growing, maybe it’s a sign that things are cooling down.
From the chart that follows we do see that global sea ice did take a small hit in the 2000s, especially the Arctic. However the trend for the last three years is definitely a strong upward one.

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/global.daily.ice.area.jpg
Moreover, mean global sea ice over the 2013 year was above average, and that for the first time in 9 years (since 2004). If we look closely we also see that global sea ice is little different than it was in 1986, i.e. 27 years ago, which was just a few years after satellite measurements began.
Ice thickness is also increasing in the Arctic:

Share this...FacebookTwitterFiery hell and Biblical floods: This is what’s in store for mankind in the future, so suggests chief climate modeler Stefan Rahmstorf of the ultra-alarmist and catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in an interview with the German Press Agency (DPA) here.
As sure signs of the approaching climate catastrophe, the DPA cites “floods in Great Britain, icy frost in USA, extreme snowfall in Japan, and droughts in Australia. Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf warns of the consequences of climate change.”
Already we get the sense that some climate science institutes fancy themselves as prophets who possess credible visions of future doom and gloom. Unbelievable as it may seem, once again we see scientists returning to the Dark Ages, a time when priests sought out witches on whom to blame bad, famine-causing weather on. We’re back, at least in Potsdam, to the Medieval witch hunts and burnings.
So how dramatic is the situation today? Rahmstorf says in the interview:
Again and again we have to deal with weather extremes like heat waves and heavy rains, which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change.”
Rahmstorf then tells the DPA that the climate change is all caused by human CO2-induced global warming and that…(my emphasis)
The number of heat records in the monthly mean values is today already five times higher than one would expect it to be during a stable climate.”
Here Rahmstorf is actually implying that humans could see a stable climate – if only they simply changed their behavior or if governments took bold action aimed at controlling the behavior of humans. This is nonsense and reminds us of the Medieval belief that bad storms and weather could be prevented if only “witches and sorcerers” were burned in public.

Rahmstorf also claims that sea level rise is accelerating due to the melting of the large ice masses on Greenland and Antarctica”. He adds:
It is depressing how man is running into the crisis with open eyes without resorting to already determined counter-measures. Foremost great efforts by governments would be necessary.”
Rahmstorf concedes models have little predictive value
Rahmstorf claims that swift action in the form of “great efforts” by governments is warranted by hard science and data. So we can assume that they have a pretty good idea of what to expect in the future. However, at the end of the interview, Rahmstorf is forced to admit that they don’t have an idea of what the future holds.
Model simulations are able to show how a possible future might look like. However, it is very difficult regionally to make reliable conclusions as we run against the limits of what is possible with climate models today. You can only fathom the possibilities.
That’s the disadvantage of leaving the known, stable climate of the past and charging into waters where the old data of experience are no longer applicable. Man is living with increasing uncertainty and has to anticipate more surprises.”
True. And some of the big surprises include the massive cold and snow gripping the northern hemisphere, 17 years of no global warming, and record sea ice in Antarctica.

"When we hear about the horrors of industrial livestock farming – the pollution, the waste, the miserable lives of billions of animals – it is hard not to feel a twinge of guilt and conclude that we should eat less meat.  Yet most of us probably won’t. Instead, we will mumble something about meat being tasty, that “everyone” eats it, and that we only buy “grass fed” beef.  Over the next year, more than 50 billion land animals will be raised and slaughtered for food around the world. Most of them will be reared in conditions that cause them to suffer unnecessarily while also harming people and the environment in significant ways.  This raises serious ethical problems. We’ve compiled a list of arguments against eating meat to help you decide for yourself what to put on your plate. Livestock farming has a vast environmental footprint. It contributes to land and water degradation, biodiversity loss, acid rain, coral reef degeneration and deforestation.  Nowhere is this impact more apparent than climate change – livestock farming contributes 18% of human produced greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. This is more than all emissions from ships, planes, trucks, cars and all other transport put together.  Climate change alone poses multiple risks to health and well-being through increased risk of extreme weather events – such as floods, droughts and heatwaves – and has been described as the greatest threat to human health in the 21st century. Reducing consumption of animal products is essential if we are to meet global greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets – which are necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.  Meat production is highly inefficient – this is particularly true when it comes to red meat. To produce one kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of grain – to feed the animal – and roughly 15,000 litres of water. Pork is a little less intensive and chicken less still.  The scale of the problem can also be seen in land use: around 30% of the earth’s land surface is currently used for livestock farming. Since food, water and land are scarce in many parts of the world, this represents an inefficient use of resources.  Feeding grain to livestock increases global demand and drives up grain prices, making it harder for the world’s poor to feed themselves. Grain could instead be used to feed people, and water used to irrigate crops.  If all grain were fed to humans instead of animals, we could feed an extra 3.5 billion people. In short, industrial livestock farming is not only inefficient but also not equitable. If we accept, as many people do, that animals are sentient creatures whose needs and interests matter, then we should ensure these needs and interests are at least minimally met and that we do not cause them to suffer unnecessarily.  Industrial livestock farming falls well short of this minimal standard. Most meat, dairy and eggs are produced in ways that largely or completely ignore animal welfare – failing to provide sufficient space to move around, contact with other animals, and access to the outdoors.  In short, industrial farming causes animals to suffer without good justification. At the production level, industrial livestock farming relies heavily on antibiotic use to accelerate weight gain and control infection – in the US, 80% of all antibiotics are consumed by the livestock industry.  This contributes to the growing public health problem of antibiotic resistance. Already, more than 23,000 people are estimated to die every year in the US alone from resistant bacteria. As this figure continues to rise, it becomes hard to overstate the threat of this emerging crisis.  High meat consumption – especially of red and processed meat – typical of most rich industrialised countries is linked with poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and various cancers.  These diseases represent a major portion of the global disease burden so reducing consumption could offer substantial public health benefits.  Currently, the average meat intake for someone living in a high-income country is 200-250g a day, far higher than the 80-90g recommended by the United Nations. Switching to a more plant-based diet could save up to 8m lives a year worldwide by 2050 and lead to healthcare related savings and avoided climate change damages of up to $1.5 trillion.  Most people agree that as a basic rule an action that promotes the overall happiness of others is morally good, while an action that causes harm or suffering without good justification is morally wrong.  Meat eating is wrong not because there is something special about pigs or chickens or dogs or cats, but because of the harm it causes, whether that harm is caused to animals, humans, or the wider environment.  Most people living in industrialised countries have historically unprecedented dietary choice. And if our nutritional needs can now be met by consuming foods that are less harmful, then we ought to choose these over foods that are known to cause more harm.  Eating less meat and animal products is one of the easiest things we can do to live more ethically."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowly, almost imperceptibly, but surely, the once diehard the-science-is-settled mainstream media are conceding that the climate debate isn’t over after all – and likely not by a long shot. And if you pay attention, you can see them quietly opening that back door for the quick exit.
The cracking started long ago, and now chips and pieces of the global warming science are starting to fall on the floor around us.
Earlier today the BBC featured a short report “Has the Sun gone to sleep?”
This report looks at the implications of a protracted quiet solar period, potentially lasting decades. Global cooling is turning out to be a real possibility, now even at the BBC!
Today we know a huge body of historical observations shows there is a pronounced relationship between cold winters in Europe and low solar activity. Moreover there’s a huge body of persuasive evidence, comprising mainly proxy datasets, that show the phenomenon is not regional, but global. As much as the BBC tries to play that down, the video holds a couple of big surprises.
Mirrors the Maunder Minimum!
The BBC starts by telling its viewers that the current solar maximum “is eerily quiet“. Solar physicist Professor Richard Harrison says the sun hasn’t been this quiet in 100 years and that the current activity mirrors the activity of the 17th century – the Maunder Minimum, the time of the dreadful Little Ice Age. What we have here is the BBC telling viewers to associate low solar activity with potential cold.
At the 3-minute mark, the BBC reporter asks the key question: “Does a decline in solar activity mean plunging temperatures for decades to come?” For an answer the BBC interviews three scientists.
Could impact the climate – “not fully understood”
Scientist Dr Lucie Green actually thinks that low solar activity could affect the climate, but she isn’t sure “to what extent“, and then even points out that varying amounts of solar radiation impact the globe’s upper atmosphere and that this is something scientists “don’t fully understand“. Therefore, don’t rule anything out.

“Fastest solar decline in 10,000 years”!
At the 4:17 mark, Mike Lockwood says we are witnessing the fastest decline in 10,000 years. He then claims that there’s a close to 20% chance that we may be actually entering a Maunder-like minimum. As one of the scientists who is more than 95% sure that man is now causing the climate change, 20% seems to be a very high figure and so we might suspect Lockwood’s true probability figure to be much higher than 20%.
Note how Lockwood does his best to portray solar impacts on climate as being regional phenomena, affecting the Jet Stream and Europe’s climate, but not the global mean climate. Lockwood here is not being completely forthcoming.
Sun now on par with human activity?
At the 5:26 mark the BBC journalist asks the right question, and the answer the BBC provided truly surprised me. Question:
The relationship between solar activity and weather on earth is complicated. But if solar activity continues to fall, could the temperature on earth as a whole get cooler? Could there be implications for global warming?”
The answer, provided by Dr. Lucie Green:
On the one hand you’ve perhaps got the cooling sun, but on the other hand you’ve got human activity that can counter that. And I think it is quite difficult to say actually how these two are going to compete and then what the consequences are for the global climate.”
Wow. The BBC has really opened the door, perhaps looking to upgrade the impact of solar activity to be on par with human activity. That’s huge compared to what the IPCC scientists claim about the impact of solar activity (negligible). You almost get the feeling that even the BBC is starting to have doubts about the supposed coming warming, and are opening up to the possibility of cooling.

"Squid, octopus and cuttlefish populations are booming across the world. These fast-growing, adaptable creatures are perfectly equipped to exploit the gaps left by extreme climate changes and overfishing, according to a study colleagues and I published in the journal Current Biology. Humans have reached and in many cases surpassed sustainable fishing limits, as our growing population demands more food. In terms of the food web, we tend to start from the top and fish “downwards”. Fishermen fish out the top predators first, including large sharks, tuna and whales, and then medium size fish such as cod, hake and halibut that usually live long and grow slowly. The vacant space left by fish may be occupied by other species, with rapidly proliferating animals having a clear advantage. And these animals are cephalopods. Squid, octopus and cuttlefish live in the “fast lane”, growing quickly and typically living for only one or two years. They produce lots of eggs, and their eggs have relatively low mortality rates, whether thanks to patient brooding by an octopus mother or the protective mucous that covers embryonic squid. These traits enable cephalopods to adapt rapidly to changes in the environment which have become even more pronounced in recent decades thanks to human activity. These are elusive creatures, notoriously difficult to count. To get a better estimate of their overall abundance, we looked at what we call catch rates – how many were caught per vessel per unit of time – over the past six decades. We used an extensive dataset of 35 different species (52% squid, 31% octopus and 17% cuttlefish) from all major oceanic regions. Most were “target” species deliberately sought by fishermen, others were non-target or bycatch species. We used data from both regular commercial fisheries and specific research surveys. Everywhere we looked we found a substantial and statistically significant increase. Bottom-dwelling octopus and cuttlefish who live relatively static lives are thriving, as are squid that hover over the bottom, along with those in the open ocean that may travel thousands of kilometres from spawning to feeding sites. At a time when life in the oceans is threatened, cephalopods seem able to buck the trend. The “jumbo squid” represents one of the most striking examples. Also known as the Humboldt squid, it typically weighs around 1-2 kg and has an annual life cycle. It lives in the warm waters of the eastern Pacific and has supported small-scale fishing in Mexico, Chile and Peru. However, a strong hot season of El Niño followed by a cold season of La Niña can do funny things to these squid. The colder waters during a La Niña delay their maturation and allow them to survive into the next year, giving them a two-year life cycle. But during this second year they continue to grow fast meaning that by the end of their two years they attain much larger sizes. In fact, these climate events have triggered the establishment of large bi-annual groups of squid weighing 25-40 kg – ten times their normal size.  After the El Niño/La-Niña events of 1997-2000 these squid began to make their way up the Pacific coast to northern California reaching Alaska, leading to the recent development of one of the world’s largest squid fisheries. The total annual catch of 600,000 to 1m tonnes has become extremely important for coastal livelihoods of eastern Pacific countries. However, as the jumbo squid’s “switch” from one to two year life cycles depends on ambient water temperature, another strong El Niño event may cause almost complete disappearance of the large group, returning the populations to their “normal condition” as a medium size annual breeder. This has happened recently in Mexico’s Gulf of California causing havoc to local squid fisheries, and it may also happen in Peru and Chile, another region where a strong El-Niño event is currently occurring.  The boom in squid, octopus and cuttlefish will have interesting consequences both for their own ecosystem and for human society. On the one hand, it could benefit the sharks, whales and large fish which are reliant on them for food, along with certain fishermen. However, cephalopod populations are much less stable than fish with longer lives. Usually they follow a “boom and bust” strategy, varying in biomass by several orders of magnitude from year to year, changes that are notoriously difficult to predict. Fishing profits can vary hugely in line with fluctuating populations, and high conservation and economic risks are often exacerbated by the relative lack of co-operation and communication among industry participants.  As fisheries continue to refocus their efforts towards cephalopods, it becomes critically important to manage stocks appropriately so they do not face the same fate as many fish in the recent past."
"The provision of clean, safe drinking water in much of the world is one of the most significant public health achievements of the past century – and one of the foundation stones of a healthy society. In the developed world, most people are able to take this service for granted and pay very little for it. But even if there is not a large economic cost, a global environmental cost is being paid for the luxury of this service. Water systems extract large quantities of water from the environment, require energy, chemicals and infrastructure to treat and pump water to our houses, then require more energy and infrastructure to remove waste, treat it, and return some of that water to the environment complete with contaminants (at low levels, but still present).   In the UK, water services are based on legacy infrastructure systems; the country lives off Victorian engineering. These systems are ageing and deteriorating and will require unprecedented investment to be fit for the future. Therefore the country needs to reimagine its water services to deliver water sustainably via systems that are affordable, adaptable and resilient.  Global population growth is threatening the security of water supply and when coupled with the impacts of climate change, it is clear that our historical approach to the provision of water may not remain feasible. Increasingly stringent drinking water quality and environmental discharge standards protect us from pollutants but require increasingly complex and energy-consuming treatment. Leakage of water from ageing infrastructure wastes more of this precious resource, yet the costs of replacing that infrastructure seem insurmountable.  Perhaps it is time to reconsider the one-size-fits-all approach of large centralised infrastructure and instead pursue a suite of solutions tailored to local needs. Could it be possible to have water systems that have no adverse impact on the environment, or better yet – water systems with positive impacts for people, society, the environment and the economy? Such a transformation of water systems will require new technology but also new ways for people to interact with water. Research into treatment technologies such as low-pressure membrane systems that will work under gravity flow without pumps could have great potential for treating a variety of water sources at a variety of scales.  But will people want to install a device in their homes to create drinking water from, for example, rainwater in their neighbourhood pond? And what regulatory and policy frameworks would be required to enable this? There is a need for such devices to be engineered to be fail-safe to protect public health in the event of equipment malfunction.  Mobilisation of people could offer great transformative potential for our water systems. For example, engineering researchers are working to design treatment systems to remove fats, oils and grease from sewers before they cause major blockages, known as “fatbergs”.  However, such technology would not be required if all users of the system jointly protected the infrastructure by disposing of fats in another way.   So the sustainable water systems of the future also need the disruptive innovation of collective mobilisation to deliver and support transformation. 
Energy-saving measures are being implemented throughout urban water systems including pumping at non-peak times and recovering heat from wastewater. But there is potential for a closer linkage between the water and energy systems by considering the synergies between distribution systems for both utilities.  The drive to install renewable energy is stressing the electric grid and distribution systems, which were not designed to handle the decentralised sources and variable inputs that characterise renewables such as solar and wind power. The opportunity exists for water systems, which operate at the neighbourhood level just like electricity networks, to be configured to act as energy storage systems to offset the variability in electric power generation to store heat or energy in the form of pressurised water. Research is ongoing to determine the full potential and optimal scales for such interactions between water and electric grids but could offer a way to optimise existing infrastructure for both utilities.  These examples give some insight into how technology will be essential to transform our current unsustainable systems to deliver adaptable and resilient water services across a range of futures and contexts. Large, centralised infrastructure may still be required in densely populated areas – in these situations disruptive solutions need to work with the existing systems because high population density does not allow for land-intensive solutions and legacy infrastructure is too expensive to just abandon.  Given the 50-to-100-year service life for water infrastructure, a change in philosophy is needed now to avoid another century of unsustainable water service. Such disruptive innovations, when combined in a way to suit each distinct context, could deliver sustainable water solutions for all – from megacities to remote rural communities, to the rapidly developing parts of the world."
"I am a farmer, the third generation to grow crops and pedigree beef cattle on my family’s modest farm on the edge of the picturesque Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire. Summer and autumn is primarily given over to long days of harvesting and planting crops while our 150 traditional longhorn cattle munch at grass; in the long winter nights, they come indoors to shelter and chew at hay harvested and stored in the spring. Most of you reading this, I would wager, are not directly associated with agriculture. It might therefore be assumed that there’s a gulf between our plains of existence, that we do not and cannot understand each other. I believe this is a false assumption.  In recent months many farmers have felt a genuine sense of beleaguerment; the tectonics of our world have shifted perceptibly. While a hard Brexit poses an existential threat to our livelihoods and heritage (the chill winds of which are already being felt), we are also baffled as to why we have come under sustained assault from much of the media for farming’s contribution to climate change. The echo chamber of the virtuous seems to have decreed that modern agriculture deserves a good hiding for its sins; real, exaggerated and imagined. Demand for help from charities specialising in aid for farmers, both mental and financial, is increasing. Yet when it comes to our food, we all appreciate that we live in a world of finite resources, within a warming atmosphere, and that a sustainable approach to our food production is – in the long run – the only responsible approach. Trust me, farmers are at the coalface when it comes to the worsening consequences of the climate crisis. We feel the effects in our everyday lives. Where our understandings may diverge, however, is in the reality of what sustainable food production really means for your shopping basket, your diet and for food policy in this country. Red meat is currently the bête noire of the environmentalist movement. As a farmer, it’s impossible to go a day without being assailed by criticism of this oldest of farming practices. But it isn’t out of personal or professional pride that I take exception to the false, binary narrative that switching to a “plant-based diet” is necessary to avert climate disaster. It’s frankly a facile misrepresentation of the evidence. Take the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on land use and climate change. Meat consumption was only one element of a balanced look at global agriculture, but it has become a clarion call to western veganism – despite the IPCC promoting the “opportunities and benefits of resilient, sustainable and low greenhouse gas-emission (GHG) animal-sourced food”. As the report says, there are vast global variations in the sustainability of food production. In the UK, we happen to be world-class. Ruminants such as cattle emit methane; they are a source of GHGs. But permanent pasture – accounting for 70% of farmland in the UK, on which nothing else can be grown – is also a GHG sink. Grassland absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere as the grass grows, and sequesters it in the soil as organic matter; the more it’s grazed and trampled by livestock, the more it absorbs. In the UK, 10 million hectares of grassland hold 600 million tonnes of CO2 and sequester another 2.4m tonnes per year. UK agriculture as a whole contributes some 10% of the UK’s GHG emissions – but this takes no account of our ability to also act as a sink. This dichotomy makes farming unique in the economy. British livestock production is among the most sustainable in the world; 85% of the water consumed by our sheep and cattle falls as rain on our abundant grass – which our temperate climate is perfectly suited to growing. This grass constitutes 90% of the feed consumed by our cattle and sheep. Our carbon footprint is 2.5 times lower than the global average, and our methane emissions have dropped by 10% in the past 30 years. Is British production perfect? No, and we look to improve it in the coming years: Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union, recently committed to the ambition of a net-zero target for agriculture by 2040, 10 years earlier than the government’s own aim.  Contrast this with livestock produced elsewhere, for example in the Amazon basin. Is it sustainable to consume cattle bred on land recently cleared of rainforest, or fed grain that is grown on that same land? Of course not. Yet in July, more than 1,400 sq km of rainforest – an area larger than Greater London – were cleared in Brazil alone. This is environmental nihilism on a grand scale. By the same token, it makes no sense to shun sustainably produced British meat in favour of a “plant-based diet” of avocados or almonds grown in some of the driest places on Earth using blue water sucked from rivers, lakes or aquifers. In the UK, despite alarmist headlines about the mass extinction of wildlife as a result of modern “intensive” farming, the truth is more nuanced. As the State of Nature 2019 report made clear, climate change, urbanisation, pollution, invasive species, predation – all are contributory factors to biodiversity loss. Any loss resulting from agriculture can be traced back decades – even centuries – to very different times. British farmers have never been more environmentally proactive, in recent years planting 10,000 hectares of wildflowers and planting or restoring 30,000km of farmland hedges. Can British farmers do more to reverse declines? Of course. But can the same be said of food producers currently clearing untouched spaces around the world? A truly sustainable food system must be a triumvirate of producer, consumer and state. It’s an inescapable fact that British consumers are overwhelmingly concerned with the price of their household food above all else, despite enjoying the third most affordable shopping basket in the world, accounting for less than 10% of average household income. Indeed, a recent European Food Safety Authority study found that British shoppers are significantly more concerned with price than the EU28 average, while their concerns over sustainability came a distant last. And herein lies the paradox for our food system: sustainable food has a monetary cost that few are willing to pay. Farmers cannot act alone as the social and environmental conscience of the nation, not while they receive just 7% of the agri-food value chain. In past decades, support payments from the common agricultural policy (CAP) have underwritten our cheap food culture and kept prices low – along with the market dominance of the large supermarkets. CAP support currently constitutes 61% of the average farm’s income, and all that UK farmers really know about the post-Brexit trading environment is that these payments are set to disappear, while standards and environmental protections are set to increase. To the challenge of higher standards, farmers say bring it on. But we have to operate on a level playing field. Sustainable British agriculture will most likely be sold down the river in any quick free trade agreements, our markets opened to the cheapest, most unsustainable and environmentally damaging foodstuffs from around the world. The result: sustainable, quality British produce becomes the preserve of the well-off, while the poorest make do with the global dregs, which it would be illegal to produce here – and which have a cost greater than money. We must do better than this. Sustainably produced, quality, high-welfare British food must be a choice for all. But to achieve this, farmers, consumers and government must make climate-friendly food a priority. Our future depends on it. • Joe Stanley is a farmer and conservationist"
"Muddy, mosquito-ridden mangrove swamps are difficult places to live. Few species of plants or invertebrates bother. As a result there aren’t many specialist mangrove-dwellers among the world’s mammals, and these forests, highly threatened halfway houses between land and sea, tend to be neglected by wildlife conservationists.  But what about non-specialist animals? Do species more typically found in regular forests also use mangroves if the opportunity arises? Surprisingly, that’s a question we have very few answers to, but one I set out to investigate for one of the most charismatic and threatened of all animal groups: Madagascar’s lemurs. And I was amazed by what I found. I have long been fascinated by both mangroves and lemurs, but these two interests collided one magical evening in March 2015. My wife and I were carrying out a bird survey at Antsahampano, deep in the mangroves of north-west Madagascar, for the marine conservation organisation Blue Ventures. We camped the night on a small sandy island offshore and, as we always do, went for a night walk after dinner to see what we could find.  We certainly weren’t expecting any lemurs – after all, we were about 3km from the nearest dry land, with nothing but mangroves in between – and we saw little but crabs for most of the way. But just as the rain started falling and we turned back for camp, we spotted the characteristic glimmer of a mammal’s eyes high in a tree, reflected in our torchlight. A fruit bat, I assumed, but as we got closer it turned out to be a northern giant mouse lemur, an endangered species with the wonderful scientific name Mirza zaza, found only in this part of Madagascar.  We were astonished. A lemur? All the way out here in the mangrove? I had already searched the existing literature and knew that only four lemur species had ever been reported in mangroves before, so this sighting really pricked my interest. It occurred to me that perhaps others had seen lemurs in mangroves too but their observations might never have made it into the scientific literature. And so I decided to crowd source. I put together a database of people who might possibly have ventured into Madagascar’s mangroves – not just primatologists, but hotel owners, guides, and conservationists too. In all I gathered more than 1,200 names, and I emailed them all to ask if they’d ever seen a lemur in a mangrove. Nearly 60 replied, and I published their observations in a recent study in the International Journal of Primatology. It seems at least 23 species of lemur have been recorded in mangroves, including at least one from each of the five lemur families. If that sounds a lot then bear in mind that, of Madagascar’s 105 lemur species, only 43 of them live in areas that even contain mangroves.  Lemurs seem to use mangroves for a variety of different reasons. Nocturnal species such as Claire’s mouse lemur and Grewcock’s sportive lemur use them to sleep in during the day, while the famous ring-tailed lemur rests in their shade to avoid the midday sun. Some species use mangroves as habitat corridors to move between patches of terrestrial forest, while others seasonally feed on the flowers or fruit of mangrove trees. On the neighbouring island of Mayotte in the Comoros, the introduced brown lemur has even been seen extracting mud from deep inside crab burrows at low tide, presumably to supplement its diet with minerals. Unfortunately most of the records reported to me were just brief observations, so we still know very little about the importance of mangroves in sustaining lemur populations. One theory is that the animals in mangroves are only there because they are sustained by those in neighbouring forests in a sort of “spill-over” effect. However several of the sightings I reported, such as the northern giant mouse lemur we saw at Antsahampano, were in areas where all the neighbouring forest has been cleared. This suggests mangroves may actually be able to support self-sustaining populations. So why is this important? Well, lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals on Earth, with as many as 94% of all species at risk of extinction. For example, of the 23 species reported to use mangroves in this study, four count as “critically endangered” on the official Red List, 13 are “endangered” and three are listed as “vulnerable”. One of the reasons scientists classify these species as threatened is because there is so little forest available to them, but if they are also able to use mangroves then they may not be quite as rare as we thought. The problem is, the mangroves are disappearing too – often just as fast as the neighbouring forests. Many conservation organisations have turned their attentions towards mangroves in recent years. For example, Blue Ventures is working to give local communities in and around Antsahampano the legal rights to manage their mangroves sustainably, and to develop community-based ecotourism to help generate incentives for conservation.  Such work makes sense: after all, mangroves protect coastlines from erosion, provide feeding grounds and nurseries for commercially important fish and prawns, and store incredible amounts of carbon to help fight climate change. Yet while these are all excellent reasons to conserve Madagascar’s coastal swamp forests, it’s nice to know that, in doing so, such organisations are also helping to conserve the habitat of some of the world’s cutest critters."
"Investment in greenhouse gas emission reduction fell last year despite the growing urgency of the climate crisis, and the benefits of outlays were cancelled out by investments globally in fossil fuels and other dirty industries, finds a report by the Climate Policy Initiative. Global climate finance hit a record high of $612bn (£476bn) in 2017, according to CPI advisers, but fell back 11% after that bumper year to $546bn in 2018.  Less public money for low-carbon transport and lower private-sector investment in renewable energy were the causes of the drop. However, the average investment for 2017 and 2018 was 25% higher than for the period 2015 and 2016. “Given the urgency of the climate challenge it is a positive sign that we have passed the half trillion dollar mark of investment towards climate change activities,” said Barbara Buchner, executive director of climate finance at CPI, which published its assessment on Thursday. The study, entitled Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019, found that investment at least more than three times as high as current levels would be needed annually until 2050 to clean up the world’s energy generation systems. On top of that, adapting to the impacts of climate breakdown is likely to cost more than $180bn a year from 2020. However, only $30bn a year was spent in the last two years, an increase of about a third on 2015 and 2016 levels. Buchner said: “[Current investment] is simply not enough, especially as investments in polluting industries continue to effectively cancel out these efforts to address climate change. Leaders should be focused on total economic transformation.” On the plus side, the analysts said, money spent on renewable energy and low-carbon transport now went much further in cutting emissions, as the costs of such technology had dropped rapidly. Investment in cutting emissions in developing countries was $356bn in 2017-18, compared with $270bn for the previous two-year period. More than half of climate finance globally comes from the private sector. Climate finance is one of the key pillars of international climate-change negotiations, and the role of rich countries in assisting poor countries with investment will be a vexed topic of discussion at the COP25 UN climate talks in December, which are in Madrid following civil unrest in Chile. Buchner said: “There are some bright spots, but our study is very clear – governments, development finance institutions and investors need to make a major shift in how they invest if they want to avoid climate change.”"
"Hundreds of John Lewis delivery trucks will begin running on cow power from 2021 as the retailer weans its fleet off polluting diesel fuel and switches to carbon-neutral cow manure. The retailer will begin using renewable biomethane made from manure slurry for almost 300 John Lewis and Waitrose delivery vans under new plans from its fuel supplier to swap rotting vegetables for poo power at no extra cost.  John Lewis currently runs 80 vans on biomethane from food waste, but plans to expand its green fleet by up to 200 vans within the next 18 months before switching to manure. The company’s fuel supplier, CNG Fuels, said it also planned to use the manure-based fuel to supply the 200-strong fleet of trucks used by courier service Hermes, as well as the delivery vans of Asda and Argos. A spokesman for CNG said the majority of the manure used to make the fuel would be sourced from cows, but the slurry might include human sewage too. According to the heavy vehicle fuelling specialist, using biomethane made from food scraps reduces the carbon emissions of delivery vans by 85% compared with those running on diesel. But biofuel made from manure is considered carbon-neutral under EU law because it helps stop methane – a greenhouse gas which is 28 times more potent than CO2 – being released into the atmosphere. The supplier is also looking at ways to update its network of heavy vehicle fuelling stations to include low-carbon hydrogen and powerful battery charging options. Philip Fjeld, the chief executive of CNG Fuels, said: “Renewable biomethane sourced from manure is currently the best low-carbon solution for HGVs, but we want to be ready to support our customers when other technologies are commercially viable for freight transport.” Heavy goods vehicles account for 4.2% of UK carbon emissions, so decarbonising the sector is essential to meet the UK’s goal of achieving Net Zero by 2050. John Lewis announced last year that it planned to switch all its heavy delivery trucks to biomethane-powered versions by 2028. The overhaul will include rolling out over 500 state-of-the-art Waitrose & Partners and John Lewis & Partners delivery trucks powered by renewable biomethane fuel. Once converted, the new fleet will save more than 49,000 tonnes of carbon emissions every year, or the equivalent carbon footprint of just over 6,000 UK households."

"The Morrison government has quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and given it less than a month to come up with recommendations. In what is being seen by observers as an acknowledgment that its main climate change policy, the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, is failing to cut national pollution, the government has appointed a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it. The panel is headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia and a former chief executive of Origin Energy. It was appointed by the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, in mid-October but has not been made public. Business sources say the Morrison government, via officials, has been privately sounding out various groups about an overhaul of the fund for months. But stakeholders were taken aback when the King panel approached them to provide detailed comments on options in less than two weeks. A letter from King to interest groups, seen by Guardian Australia, apologises implicitly for the compressed timeframe, acknowledging “it may not be possible to fully consult across your membership before providing your response”. But he argues there will be time for follow-up discussions as a final report is prepared. The letter was sent with a discussion paper headed “Expert panel examining opportunities for further abatement” that critiques and sets out options “to enhance” the fund. The panel has been established despite Morrison and Taylor maintaining they have set out “to the last tonne” of carbon dioxide how Australia will meet the 2030 emissions target announced before the Paris climate conference. In reality, national emissions have risen each year since 2015 and most analyses suggest the government will not reach the goal, a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels, under current policies. The discussion paper, first reported by Footprint, says the emissions reduction fund has been successful in generating carbon offsets from native vegetation and landfill projects, largely because they cost relatively little and do not require businesses to make substantial operational changes. But it says the scheme has done little to cut emissions through energy efficiency projects and from industry, agriculture and transport, in part due to high upfront and transaction costs. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers’ support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The paper says the government is looking at ways to attract more participants from industry and agricultural businesses. It is also considering new incentives to complement the fund, including partnerships with other tiers of government and the private sector and reconsidering how to best spend “existing financing resources”. Those resources include an additional $2bn committed to the fund before the election (when the government rebranded it as part of what it calls a climate solutions fund) and money allocated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Possible emissions reduction options listed include: Changing the scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was supposed to limit emissions from big industry but in practice has allowed pollution to increase, so companies that emit less than their limit are awarded carbon credits they could sell to the government or business. Companies now have limits based on emissions intensity (how much they emit for every dollar earned) rather than outright pollution. Offering companies cash to help pay for technology-focused emissions reduction projects that would otherwise struggle to be financially viable. Boosting energy efficiency by giving smaller operators better access to expert advice and providing incentives to reduce energy use in commercial buildings and low-income housing. There is a view among some stakeholders that the Morrison government is trying to pull together a policy reboot before a meeting of energy ministers at the Council of Australian Governments energy council in November. The meeting has been delayed for months because of wrangling among the participants. Guardian Australia revealed in August that the New South Wales government had asked Canberra to provide an alternative to the dumped national energy guarantee. It would see the Morrison government underwrite both new generation to replace the Liddell power station, probably firmed renewables, and new investments in transmission. Energy stakeholders are speculating that some states may also pursue money from the fund to drive abatement . In response to questions about the panel, Taylor said the environment department and expert panel were working together to ensure the $2bn climate solutions fund would deliver the most emissions abatement possible. He said the commonwealth conservatively estimated the fund would deliver at least 103m tonnes of cuts by 2030. “This is a minimum target, not a cap,” he said. Interest groups were asked to give quick feedback last week before the panel submits advice to Taylor next month. The other panel members are Susie Smith, chief executive of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, Prof Andrew Macintosh, head of the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, and David Parker, the Clean Energy Regulator chairman. The fund has faced consistent criticism since it replaced the Gillard-era carbon pricing scheme. A Guardian Australia investigation found while the type of vegetation projects it supports were worthwhile it was often difficult to know what taxpayers were getting for their money. There have been problems with how emissions cuts from some projects have been calculated and some methodologies have paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have supported fossil fuel projects. The government has also been criticised for planning to reduce the difficulty of meeting its 2030 target by using what are known as “carryover credits”, which it has claimed for Australia surpassing the targets it set under the Kyoto protocol (an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2012, and a 5% reduction between 2000 and 2020). The environment department has conceded it is not aware of any other country planning to use carryover credits to meet a target under the Paris agreement."

What follows is a video of North Korea’s military going green, installing a wind turbine that will produce climate-friendly energy, and so protect the planet for future generations of brainwashed North Korean robot slaves.

Wonderful world without dissent.
Let’s be honest. Isn’t this exactly the kind of green-energy enthusiasm the UN, IPCC scientists, and devout climate activists have wet dreams about? This is what they’d love to see. You see what’s possible without dissent?!
This is precisely the kind of enthusiasm the whole world would see – were it not for those damn dissenters and flat-earth deniers ruining everything!
Moreover, what’s really great is that dissent in North Korea never sees the light of day. They have supreme leaders who know what’s best for the people, and they really know how to deal with pesky dissenters. Wouldn’t that be wonderful in climate science?

Share this...FacebookTwitterI watched the following  Greenpeace video clip of Camila Speziale, the youngest of the 30 Greenpeace activists. I really wonder if Greenpeace is getting the message at all.

I found it peculiar that at the end of the video Greenpeace added the text (my emphasis): “Camila is one of the 30 activists taken captive when Russian authorities stormed the Arctic Sunrise on September 19.”

When Greenpeace illegally trespasses onto a facility and rams the boats of authorities, they insist it’s “peaceful protest”. But when Russian authorities arrest activists for breaking the law, Greenpeace describes the Russian authorities as “taking captives”…like hostage takers holding people illegally. A rather hostile and confrontational choice of words by Greenpeace lawyers, I’d say.
Greenpeace seems to be confused about who the accused criminals are and who the law-enforcement authorities are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe preliminary results of Germany’s national election are rolling in. What’s sure is that Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU/CSU party is the winner, with projections showing them currently capturing a massive 42.5% of the votes.

Preliminary, early results show the Greens (Grüne) collapsing to 8% (2009: 11%) thus eliminating the possibility of a socialist/green coalition government made up of the SPD/Greens. Source: www.tagesschau.de
The Green Party is among the big losers, with early projections showing them picking up only 8% of the vote. In 2009 they received almost 11%.
With climate change losing importance in Germany as an issue and the Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) turning into a chaos that threatens the country’s economic stability, the Greens, who were polling near 16% earlier in the year, have since lost almost half of their voter base.
In a reaction to the preliminary results, Green Party co-leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt said on ARD television that they “failed to convince voters of an ecological transition and sustainability“.
The element of fear, which the Greens have always effectively used in the past to motivate its voter base, was absent during the campaign as the issues of nuclear power and climate change didn’t play a role.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Resonator, the research podcast of the German Helmholtz Research Group conducted a long interview (1 hr 40 min!) with climate scientist Hans von Storch director of the GKSS Research Center. In the interview von Storch was asked about his views on a wide variety of climate science related issues.
Hat-tip: klimazwiebel.
Overall the interview saw a Hans von Storch who spoke frankly and openly. Some of the remarks he made raised my eye brows. In general von Storch, best described as a non-alarmist warmist, views the climate debate as being dominated by the more extreme positions from both sides, with voices in the middle getting drowned out. He levels a fair amount of criticism at the climate science community, but does so without naming any persons in particular.
Due to the sheer length of the interview, I will only look at the points that I found interesting and relevant as skeptic.
Scientists too quick to accept dramatic scenarios
At the 15-minute mark von Storch describes a science that is so politicized with both sides are trying to make it black and white, and a debate that has been overly shrill. Some scientists, he says, have tended to accept dramatic scenarios and consequences even when there’s little evidence behind them. He also talks of a group of scientists who fancy themselves as the ultimate authority and who have the last word. All the exaggerations and projections of doom, gloom and disaster have led to an overall discrediting of the field.
“Science and Nature are pretty bad journals”
At the 29-minute mark von Storch says he sees himself as someone who needs a lot of time before he is convinced of anything. I was surprised to hear him call both Science and Nature “pretty bad journals” when it comes to the quality of their articles. Hans von Storch cites an article published by Science claiming that the climate was going to tip in the year 2047, calling the report “a real doozy“. He says that science journals must remain sufficiently critical and not let themselves get caught up with the zeitgeist. Von Storch admits that he has not always been popular among the community.
Overall von Storch doesn’t blame the media much for the hysteria, implying that the hysteria stems more from scientists communicating poorly. The media are only interpreting what the scientists are spewing. Projections of snowless winters, for example, were hardly helpful in lending credibility to climate science.
Scientists dramatizing for attention and prestige

At the 37-minute mark von Storch believes some scientists succumbed to drama in order to get attention and prestige, and says that the such are only damaging the credibility of climate science.
Models too CO2-centric
At the 40-minute mark von Storch discusses possible reasons why the warming has stalled and thinks other explanations need to be examined, such as solar activity and aerosols. He finds climate models too CO2-centric in general. Here he appeals for more patience to let the science unfold.
At the 45 minute mark he fires harsh criticism at scientists who promote a society governed by an elite technocracy, calling the idea “stupidity”. He calls the proposals made by a group of scientists in favor of appointing future councils to represent the interests of future generations “peculiar”.
At the 59-minute mark, on whether storms are becoming more frequent and severe, von Storch says he doesn’t think this is the case and that the disasters are more about the over-development of coastal areas.
Hockey stick was “something dumb” – an attempt to steer politics
On the hockey stick chart, at the 63 minute mark, von Storch has some blunt words on how it was possible for it to become the icon it became. He recalls having examined the chart himself and finding it deficient.
I believe it was something dumb by scientists who wanted to steer politics.”
He thinks the climate science community were too quick to call it the last word. Hans von Storch sees critique of the hockey stick and confirmed and that’s why it no longer appears in the IPCC reports. Scientists, von Storch reminds us, should not be so quick to claim absolute truth.
Also, von Storch believes that the oceans could be warming up, but that there is very little data out there to confirm it.

Like a number of readers, I’m also quite puzzled by what is going on here. Maybe someone could fill us in on the background. It’s not the kind behavior we want to have. We’d prefer to see the long knives returned to the drawer.
Again I’m not taking any sides. But I will say I don’t like watching big guys beat up on little ones. Science is supposed to stay factual with emotions left aside as best as possible. If a scientist has something to say, I say let him get it out there on the table so everyone can see it and decide for himself.
Nicola posted a reader comment that I’m upgrading to a post. It can’t be that all a man has left to defend his reputation with (which he’s worked so hard for) is to post reader comments at a little blog like mine. Nicola’s comment is being upgraded to a post. His science is just as entitled to go through the process of rigorous review as anyone else’s, and to be so without petty attacks from the hinterhalt.
Maybe his science is completely wrong, but let it go through the process. What’s the BFD?
Nicola’s comment:
================================
Because Pierre has linked above a new post on WUWT of Willis that criticizes one paper of the collection, I think that also the readers here might be interested in my comment.
Willis appears to criticize a paper without reading it. He picks up something extrapolated from the context like the famous guy jumping around the Bible who concludes that It says “There is no God.” while the full sentence says: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”

The same graph discussed above by Willis was discussed with Anthony’s great approval here and here. 
The graph is essentially taken from Shaviv (2008): Shaviv, N. J.: Using the oceans as a calorimeter to quantify the solar radiative forcing, J. Geophys. Res., 113, A11101, doi:1029/2007JA012989, 2008. It has been properly referenced by Solheim and where a lot of details are present. Solheim does not need to repeat the details given the fact that those are in the referenced work.
The uncertainty noted by some above is also discussed in Solheim’s paper and it is due to the fact that the decadal climatic cycle may be due to a soli-lunar oscillation at about 9.1 years and to the 10-12 year solar cycle.  This is clearly shown in numerous figures of the paper such as Figure 7, which is taken from one of my papers, which are these:
Scafetta, N.: Solar and Planetary Oscillation control on climate change hind-cast, forecast and an comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs, Energ. Environ., 42, 455–496, 2013a; and
Scafetta, N.: Discussion on climate oscillations: CMIP5 general circulation models versus a semi-empirical harmonic model based on astronomical cycles, Earth-Sci. Rev., 126, 321–357, 2013b.
Willis, unfortunately, has not mastered the work of reading a scientific paper.
Is this all your science, Willis?”
================================
One last note. One factor that motivated me to get active in climate science debate was having watched small, poorly-funded skeptical scientists and dissenters get dragged through the mud by the huge multi-billion dollar climate change industry. Even if the dissenters had been shown wrong, I still would have jumped in. Without an open and fair debate, society cannot possibly progress.

"Rhinos are one of the most iconic symbols of the African savanna: grey behemoths with armour plating and fearsome horns. And yet it is the horns that are leading to their demise. Poaching is so prolific that zoos cannot even protect them. Some people believe rhino horns can cure several ailments; others see horns as status symbols. Given horns are made of keratin, this is really about as effective as chewing your finger nails. Nonetheless, a massive increase in poaching over the past decade has led to rapid declines in some rhino species, and solutions are urgently needed. One proposal is to take 80 rhinos from private game farms in South Africa and transport them to captive facilities in Australia, at a cost of over US$4m. Though it cannot be denied that this is a “novel” idea, I, and colleagues from around the world, have serious concerns about the project, and we have now published a paper looking into the problematic plan. The first issue is whether the cost of moving the rhinos is unjustified. The $4m cost is almost double the anti-poaching budget for South African National Parks ($2.2m), the managers of the estate where most white rhinos currently reside in the country.  The money would be better spent on anti-poaching activities in South Africa to increase local capacity. Or, from an Australian perspective, given the country’s abysmal record of mammal extinctions, it could go towards protecting indigenous species there.  In addition, there is the time cost of using the expertise of business leaders, marketeers and scientists. All could be working on conservation issues of much greater importance. Bringing animals from the wild into captivity introduces strong selective pressure for domestication. Essentially, those animals that are too wild don’t breed and so don’t pass on their genes, while the sedate (unwild) animals do. This is exacerbated for species like rhinos where predation has shaped their evolution: they have grown big, dangerous horns to protect themselves. So captivity will likely be detrimental to the survival of any captive bred offspring should they be returned to the wild.  It is not known yet which rhino species will be the focus of the Australian project, but it will probably be the southern white rhino subspecies – which is the rhino species least likely to go extinct. The global population estimate for southern white rhinos (over 20,000) is stable, despite high poaching levels. This number stands in stark contrast to the number of northern white (three), black (4,880 and increasing), great Indian (2,575), Sumatran (275) and Javan (up to 66) rhinos. These latter three species are clearly of much greater conservation concern than southern white rhinos.  There are also well over 800 southern white rhinos currently held in zoos around the world. With appropriate management, the population size of the southern white is unlikely to lose genetic diversity, so adding 80 more individuals to zoos is utterly unnecessary. By contrast, across the world there are 39 other large mammalian herbivore species that are threatened with extinction that are far more in need of conservation funding than the five rhino species. Rhinos inhabit places occupied by other less high profile threatened species – like African wild dogs and pangolins – which do not benefit from the same level of conservation funding. Conserving wildlife in their natural habitat has many benefits for the creatures and plants they coexist with. Rhinos are keystone species, creating grazing lawns that provide habitats for other species and ultimately affect fire regimes (fire frequency and burn patterns). They are also habitats themselves for a range of species-specific parasites. Abandoning efforts to conserve rhinos in their environment means these ecosystem services will no longer be provided. Finally, taking biodiversity assets (rhinos) from Africa and transporting them to foreign countries extends the history of exploitation of Africa’s resources. Although well-meaning, the safe-keeping of rhinos by Western countries is as disempowering and patronising as the historical appropriation of cultural artefacts by colonial powers.  Conservation projects are ultimately more successful when led locally. With its strong social foundation, community-based conservation has had a significant impact on rhino protection and population recovery in Africa. In fact, local capacity and institutions are at the centre of one of the world’s most successful conservation success stories – the southern white rhino was brought back from the brink, growing from a few hundred in South Africa at the turn of the last century to over 20,000 throughout southern Africa today. In our opinion, this project is neo-colonial conservation that diverts money and public attention away from the fundamental issues necessary to conserve rhinos. There is no evidence of what will happen to the rhinos transported to Australia once the poaching crisis is averted, but there seems nothing as robust as China’s “panda diplomacy” where pandas provided to foreign zoos remain the property of China, alongside a substantial annual payment, as do any offspring produced, for the duration of the arrangement.  With increased support, community-based rhino conservation initiatives can continue to lead the way. It is money that is missing, not the will to conserve them nor the expertise necessary to do so. Using the funding proposed for the Australian Rhino Project to support locally-led conservation or to educate people to reduce consumer demand for rhino horn in Asia seem far more acceptable options."
"Phosphorus is an essential element which is contained in many cellular compounds, such as DNA and the energy carrier ATP. All life needs phosphorus and agricultural yields are improved when phosphorus is added to growing plants and the diet of livestock. Consequently, it is used globally as a fertiliser – and plays an important role in meeting the world’s food requirements. In order for us to add it, however, we first need to extract it from a concentrated form – and the supply comes almost exclusively from phosphate mines in Morocco (with far smaller quantities coming from China, the US, Jordan and South Africa). Within Morocco, most of the mines are in Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony which was annexed by Morocco in 1975.  The fact that more than 70% of the global supply comes from this single location is problematic, especially as scientists are warning that we are approaching “peak phosphorous”, the point at which demand begins to outstrip supply and intensive agriculture cannot continue to provide current yields. In the worst case scenario, mineable reserves could be exhausted within as little as 35 years. So what is going on – and how worried should be? In nature, phosphorus only exists bound to oxygen, which is called phosphate. It is in this form that it is mined. Chemists can remove the oxygens bound to it to get elemental white phosphorus, which glows in the dark, but it is so unstable that it spontaneously ignites on exposure to air. Phosphate easily diffuses through soil or water and can be taken up by cells. When phosphate meets free calcium or iron, they combine to give highly insoluble salts.  In the first half of the 19th century, Justus von Liebig popularised the law of the minimum for agriculture, which states that growth is limited by the least available resource. It was soon discovered that this was often some form of phosphorus. As a consequence, bones – comprised mostly of calcium and phosphate – from old battlefields were dug up to use in farming. Guano, large accumulations of bird droppings, also contains high concentrations of phosphorus and was used to fertilise crops. But supplies of this were soon depleted. As demand increased, supplies had to be mined instead. But this applied inorganic phosphate fertiliser is highly mobile and leaches into watercourses. In addition, phosphate rock weathers and is also ultimately washed into the ocean where it either deposits as calcium phosphate or is taken up by marine organisms who also eventually deposit on the ocean floor when they die. Consequently, terrestrial phosphorous doesn’t really disappear, but it can move beyond our reach. To complicate matters further, even the phosphorous we can use is largely wasted. Of the phosphorus mined as fertiliser, only a fifth reaches the food we eat. Some leaches away and some is bound to calcium and iron in the soil. Some plant roots have the ability to extract the latter, but not in large enough quantities to retrieve all of it.  In addition to these inorganic forms, phosphate is also converted into cellular compounds, creating organically-bound phosphorus, such as phospholipids or phytate. After the death of an organism, these organic phosphorus compounds need to be returned into the useable phosphate form. How much organically-bound phosphorus is present in soils depends on the number and activity of the organisms that can do this. Agricultural soils are usually rich in inorganic phosphorous while in undisturbed ecosystems, such as forests and long-term pastures, organically-bound phosphorus dominates. But agricultural land is often depleted of phosphorus during harvest and land management practises such as ploughing, hence the addition of phosphate-containing fertilisers.  Spreading manure and avoiding tillage are ways of increasing microbial abundance in the soil – and so keeping more phosphorus in an organically-bound form.  The risks of peak phosphorous can be countered with some simple solutions. Eating less meat is a start as huge amounts are used to rear livestock for meat. The chances are that agricultural yields are limited by phosphorus availability and will be further stretched as the global population grows.  Humans are themselves wasteful of phosphorous, as most of what we take in goes straight out again. Fortunately, technologies have been developed to mine phosphorus from sewage, but at present are too expensive to be practical.  Peak phosphorus does not mean that phosphorus will disappear, rather that the reserves with mineable high concentrations are depleting. Instead, we are increasing the background concentrations of phosphorus and adding it to the ocean floor. More sustainable phosphorus use requires a greater appreciation and understanding of the many organisms that make up soils – and the part they play in phosphorus distribution – or we may no longer be able to feed the world at an affordable price."
"Chile’s decision to withdraw as host of the COP 25 UN climate conference has prompted tears and frustration from a group of school-strike activists sailing across the Atlantic to attend the talks.  But the young campaigners say they are determined to continue their journey to hold other civil society meetings in South America, and may only consider charting a new course if the United Nations accepts Spain’s offer to act as an emergency host of the summit. The shock announcement by the Chilean president, Sebastián Piñera, was the latest in a series of setbacks for the 36 young European campaigners on board the Regina Maris sailboat, which left Amsterdam on 2 October. The vessel had to make an unexpected stop in France because of problems with the water purification system. The weather has been rough and several passengers were seasick, including 18-year-old Adelaïde Charlier, a co-organiser with Anuna De Wever of the Youth for Climate movement in Belgium. News of the cancellation of the Santiago summit reportedly came as a heavy blow to the activists, some of whom have also endured online trolling and death threats, during the past year. “Quite a number of people started to cry, including Anuna and Adelaide,” De Wever’s mother, Katrien Van der Heyden, said. “They’d been planning this trip for months and the COP would be the ultimate climax of their trip. Obviously this changes the entire perspective of what they do, and is extremely disappointing.” But the group discussed the options and decided to push ahead. “We are continuing our journey to Belém, Brasil today, while our thoughts are with #Chile!” they tweeted. 📢UPDATE: We are continuing our journey to Belém, Brasil today, while our thoughts are with #Chile! 🌊🌊From there we can still make it to a #COP25 held in Costa Rica or Bonn, most likely options at the moment. #ClimateAction is unstoppable! 🌏 pic.twitter.com/DP7u9TYYYh “From there we can still make it to a #COP25 held in Costa Rica or Bonn, most likely options at the moment. #ClimateAction is unstoppable!”  They are not the only activists who have sailed the Atlantic to attend the talks and then been left in limbo while the UN attempts to reorganise the event. The Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg is currently in Los Angeles and was due to sail to Chile shortly. On Friday she appealed for a lift back to Europe by sea, tweeting: “It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:) Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November … If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.” She continued: “I’m so sorry I’ll not be able to visit South and Central America this time, I was so looking forward to this. But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. We’re in a climate and ecological emergency.” The British film-maker James Levelle is halfway through a 100-day, 7,000-mile fossil-free journey to Santiago. Supporters say he may not even be aware that the climate summit has been cancelled. Other climate groups are also reeling from the immense financial hit of non-refundable airline tickets and the complications of getting visas to a new venue. “We had big plans to bring indigenous representatives and partners to the summit,” said Nicole Oliveira, Latin America team leader of 350.org, which planned to bring about 60 people to a climate defenders gathering ahead of the summit, in addition to 16 staff and a dozen other regional partners. The group says the cost of airfares and accommodation could double if the climate conference moves to Spain – which would eat up 10-15% of their budget for the event. “What may not mean anything to the large corporations of the fossil fuel industry, to us as non-profit civil society organizations – and even more to the indigenous organizations – can often represent our survival as active agents of change,” Oliveira said. “We expect now that the climate talks move forward with a new focus on public participation and human rights. For far too long, this process has prioritized the voices of big business and corporate polluters. The UN must kick the fossil fuel industry out of the climate talks and make more space for the voices of the people.”"
"The “green revolution” of the 1960s delivered vast increases in food production, averting famines and political instability across the world. There are now urgent appeals for a second green revolution to make food more sustainable, involving climate-adapted crops (some genetically-modified), healthier soil and reduced chemical inputs. Sadly, incentives on offer for agri-tech firms mean our hopes of achieving such a revolution are under grave threat. As was the case 50 years ago, those who grow our food are tasked with growing healthy plants in the face of drought, lack of nutrients, pests, and diseases. But this is where the similarity ends. In 2016, climate change is already hitting home, wreaking havoc with patterns of weather and disease. Furthermore, ten billion people will need feeding by 2050, requiring us to produce as much food between now and then as has been produced in the whole of human history.  This isn’t just a technical problem for agricultural scientists. Alongside the challenge of supplying adequate calories in ever harsher environments, we must also tackle some deep-rooted obstacles to a fair and safe food supply. The economic landscape of agricultural research is radically different to that which enabled the first green revolution. Today, it is overwhelmingly driven by an international private sector, whereas in the past government-funded institutes would develop and distribute better crops and farming techniques.  This shift away from state-funded research poses significant risks when government regulation threatens profits, as evidenced by the recent debate over the re-licencing of the herbicide glyphosate. The argument here should be about the trade-off between the weed-killing benefits of a chemical versus possible negative effects on human health and the environment. However, the profitability of glyphosate-containing herbicides and glyphosate-tolerant crop plants is dependent upon its legality. As a result, conflicts of interest between profits and safety are the true drivers of such controversies, leading to industrial-scale lobbying by agri-tech which undermines the potential for EU regulators to make a balanced decision. Of equal concern is the rampant patenting of the biological resources which underlie our food systems. As we obtain more and more information from crop genomes, the scientific process of sharing one’s research should facilitate huge improvements in crop production around the world. Instead, each additional level of biological information has provided a further opportunity for these crops to become ever more exclusive, based on the ability to pay for access rather than a requirement. The profitability of patents is also distorting the priorities of agri-tech and research institutes. For instance, engineering so-called “resistance” genes into a crop suffering from a microbial disease is a readily patentable process. In addition, once a microbe evolves to overcome the resistance gene, the farmer must then purchase a different variety which has been genetically engineered with the next line of defence. Both of these factors have the potential to push research away from a more multi-layered approach to crop protection and more towards those “innovations” which can be licenced for profit. Finally, the idea in most privatised sectors is that competition between different companies promotes innovation and maintains fair prices for consumers. This simply isn’t the case in agri-tech. At present, just three companies own a staggering 51% of the world’s agri-chemicals and 55% of the world’s commercial seed varieties. This situation is only worsening, as these companies seek mergers to consolidate their market share and increase investment potential.  Such concentration of power over the price and distribution of products is rarely tolerated in other industries, and it is particularly worrying to see such a monopoly over our means to grow food. If access to the knowledge gained during the second green revolution is to be shaped by market forces, we should at least ensure that this is a market with competition. It should be possible to avert a global food crisis, but we must start by reframing the debate. Most public discussion of food security is dominated by an anti-science lobby that is highly sceptical about the safety of GM-technology, when all GM crops really represent is a small part of a complex solution.  The deeper issue lies in the ownership of the technology we need to grow food, and the way that science and intellectual property have been misappropriated. We require nothing less than a total restructuring of the global agri-tech sector – only then can we ensure billions more people can sustainably feed themselves."
"The sex industry, specifically sex work and prostitution, has long been perceived and regulated as a “dirty and disorderly” feature of residential communities. The stereotypical, and unfair, view of sex workers is that they are vectors of disease and social contagions; it’s a moral hangover from the Victorians. Regardless of their legal status, wider society still tends to stigmatise those who provide commercial sexual services, with street-based sex workers often most the subject of public, political and police scrutiny. This is reflected in the regulation and marginalisation of sex work by local and national government policies to dark and secluded areas of cities. This marginalisation and stigmatisation is because many people’s knowledge and understanding of sex work is generally limited and informed by moral panics and stereotypes – particularly surrounding issues such as STI rates and trafficking. While it is important to recognise that such problems may occur in sex work, it is also important to stress that these are not experienced by the majority of those engaged in consensual sex work and should certainly not be portrayed as being the most important factor in all sex worker narratives.  Nevertheless, local councils and police forces periodically engage in “clean-up” campaigns that seek to purge local areas of sex work. The police raids in Soho during December 2013, when around 200 police targeted dozens of premises, have been one of the most high-profile examples of this strategy.  Such raids are generally justified by the media and local authorities on the basis that locals, especially women and children, need to be protected from the harmful effects of “sleaze”. Interestingly, however, there has been little detailed or systematic research on the impacts of sex work on residential communities. Generally speaking, local authority “clean-up” strategies tend to be based not on science, but on a small number of complaints from a vocal minority who assert particular moral agendas.  The evidence that sex work is a problematic issue is rather limited, but it is clear that sex workers themselves are not considered community members and are rarely consulted about their own concerns and needs. Sex workers are just ordinary people – someone’s mother, aunt, brother, friend – trying to make a living.  Research by Phil Hubbard and colleagues, Penny Crofts, Sarah Kingston, and Emily Cooper’s own work suggests that sex work contributes to residential communities in much more complex ways than is commonly portrayed in the media. Sarah Kingston’s research on the impact of sex work on residential communities in Leeds highlights that the presence of sex workers can actually generate positive outcomes. For example, they (and associated clients, etc) provide passive surveillance against criminal activities and will report crimes. In addition, sex workers and their clients also contribute to local economies via the renting of premises, booking hotel rooms and spending money in local shops, bars and restaurants. Cooper’s research on massage parlours and surrounding residential communities in Blackpool, reinforces these findings. 53 in-depth interviews were conducted (often more than once) with local residents, as well as a number of sex workers, police officers and council officers.  Observations were also made over an 18-month period.  Those parlours surrounded by other non-sex work businesses and residences were often referred to by nearby non-sex work business workers as a means of breaking the ice and building rapport with customers, because of questions asked about the parlours being there. Reputedly, for some residents, the parlours also brightened up the mundane routine of peoples’ daily social and work lives. This was also reinforced in Kingston’s findings. More crucially, some residents highlighted that the parlours – and their 24-hour vibrantly neon-lit presence – engendered a feeling of security in an area that is commonly frequented by “either nobody or large groups of stag parties, which can be a bit intimidating” (quote from resident). Such views dismantle the common narrative, which suggests that the sex industry is something that attracts criminality rather than a feeling of security. The Blackpool Gazette often uses “dirt and disgust” rhetoric to characterise the impact of massage parlours and the subsequent “clean-up” campaigns by regulatory bodies. Despite this, plus the ongoing effects of the recent recession, the massage parlours have shown resilience and remain an integral part of the social and economic fabric of Blackpool.  The stigma and stereotyping that tends to surround sex workers (and their clients) has the effect of alienating them and diminishing their sense of safety when working.  Very few residents in the study explicitly stated that they would like to see the sex industry removed. Those that did so were coming from either a stereotypical view of sex work as being inherently harmful or criminal, or from a desire to protect sex workers, who they considered friends and neighbours, from “dodgy clients”. Many residents discussed spending time with sex workers, as they would with any other neighbour. Despite the fact that several sex workers in my study area lived locally, the long-established presence of massage parlours in Blackpool, and the friendly relationships between sex workers and wider community members, sex workers were still excluded from certain community spaces. One sex worker, for example, noted that although she had a good relationship with residents adjacent to her place of work, she and another worker were asked to leave a Police and Community Together meeting by other residents because the meeting was “partly about them”. Such exclusionary actions merely serve to reinforce the stigma imposed on sex workers and deny them their basic democratic rights. Community-based policy and consultation processes need to be more inclusive and appreciative of the fact that sex workers are as much a part of the local community as the next person. Their presence in and near residential communities needs to be viewed through a wider lens based on evidence, rather than a narrow moral one under the control of a vocal minority. Emerging research suggests that the role and impact of sex work on local areas is more multi-faceted and less extraordinary than is commonly portrayed in the media or television dramas. The urban mythology and regulatory fetish surrounding sex work needs to be dispelled.  A more productive policy approach to regulating commercial sex premises would be to treat them like any other business. Ultimately, sex work should be decriminalised as this regulatory approach offers what other approaches don’t – it guarantees the greater safety, health and well-being of sex workers."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Moscow Times here writes that a Russian court has denied the Greenpeace activists bail, and the prospect of spending a long time in a Russian prison is increasingly becoming a grim reality. But unlike in the past, Greenpeace is now also being sharply criticized worldwide.
The English-language Voice of Russia aims harsh criticism at Greenpeace, writing that “experts doubt the adequacy and altruism of that international organization“.
The first thing that jumps out at you in the Voice of Russia article is the photo of Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The front is completely bent in. Have they been engaging in a little ramming lately? Some excerpts from the Voice of Russia (my emphasis):
The Western press launched a loud campaign in support of the Greenpeace. But many experts not to mention ordinary people call the actions of the activists ecological extremism. Here is the view of the situation of Mikhail Voytenko, the editor-in-chief of the Maritime Bulletin:
Everybody was afraid of getting involved with the Greenpeace, starting with corporations and ending with whole countries. And now it encountered somebody who did not get scared. And it is now getting its due. […] In reality, the Greenpeace is a dubious organization, which frequently uses illegal methods in quite different countries. […] On the whole it is practically an extremist organization.”
Voice of Russia quotes Ortis Andres Carlos, an Argentinian expert in economics and energy, a PhD in economics, is of a similar opinion:
It was a real attack on the Russian platform, the activists acted very roughly and provocatively. To call things their names, we are talking about «ecological terrorism». Greenpeace activists are a lot more interested in creating a social response.”

Meanwhile The Mirror here reports that arrested British journalist Keiron Bryan has gotten a letter out to the media in which he expresses real fear of what lies ahead. The Mirror writes: “…he fears a long jail sentence” and that he is feeling “horrible uncertainty and anxiety“. He believes that those arrested were “pieces in a game we didn’t want to  participate in“. Obviously Keiron and the activists initially thought they’d be handled with kids’ gloves, maybe spend a night in jail before strutting out the next day in the limelight of the big sympathetic media. Instead they are now staring at a Russian judge through the bars of a cage.
The biggest problem for the two journalists is the mountain of incriminating evidence Russian authorities likely have seized. All the computers and their contents in the form of e-mails, comments, documents etc. will tell if the journalists were truly objectively reporting, or if they were acting as powerful media representatives aiding and abetting the cause. One gets the sense that Greenpeace hired the journalists for the very purpose of high powered promotion.
“Chilly attitude towards suffering humanity”
Today the Mail Online has a story that is also highly critical of the environmental organization. It writes that the international organization “has a  decidedly chilly attitude towards suffering humanity. It has led a campaign to harass and frustrate ‘the Golden Rice Project’, a not-for-profit scheme backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation“. The Mail writes regarding Greenpeace’s overzealous opposition to the testing of gene modified foods (GMOs): “… it destroys such tests physically, thus showing its fundamental contempt for the scientific method”. In short: Luddites.
Now the reality and the gravity of the situation is dawning on the activists. They are in deep trouble. You can almost see what’s coming ahead: a process involving damning evidence, a harsh sentence, followed by tears and sadness, then by anger and rebellion – and maybe later a hunger strike. That will all pass, however. And after a year or two of deep reflection and thought in their cells, many will probably realize that they indeed had been on an out-of control path and that they had it coming. After a couple of years of good behavior, they’ll be back out on their feet- very likely a whole lot wiser and far less naïve about the world-saving cause they had been indoctrinated with by Greenpeace and its directors.
Also read here: “…either willing participants or unwitting pawns.”

"There is a chasm between a world that quickly breaks the link between modern economic growth and carbon emissions, and a world that fails to do so. The side of the chasm that we are now on is a dangerous place. It would be reckless beyond the normal human irrationality for us to stay where we are. Australian prosperity and security, as well as our natural and human heritage, will be challenged in fundamental and perhaps unanswerable ways if humanity does not succeed in holding temperature increases below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. With only half the warming we can expect from 1.5C, we have already had to deal with dreadful impacts of more severe, earlier and more frequent bushfires; reduced flows into the Murray–Darling river system; degradation of the Great Barrier Reef; a shift to desalination to supply water for Perth; reduced moisture in our southern farming soils; and high tides lapping at the steps of the beach huts at Brighton in Victoria. We need to build the bridge on which Australians can walk over that chasm, from policy incoherence to hope and opportunity. Hope that we might avoid the worst outcomes of climate change. Opportunity for Australia to be the world’s main trading source of metals, other energy-intensive goods and carbon chemical manufactures in tomorrow’s zero-net-emissions world; and a major contributor to the world’s efforts to absorb excessive carbon into land and plants. We need that bridge. And we need Australians to walk across it. It has always been true that Australians walking across the bridge alone will not deal with the challenge. A large part of humanity needs to make the shift. But many others are already halfway across their bridges and we remain on the side of troubles, encouraging others to stay with us. We know that we could make the move, fully and decisively, and yet still be destroyed by others remaining on the side of troubles. China, most important of all to this story, was moving across and has stalled while it deals with its trade war across the Pacific. The United States, second-most important in global emissions and still the leader of international political trends, was striding out along the bridge until a new president set out in 2017 to turn his country back. He has not yet succeeded, but may do so if given long enough at the task. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And beyond international politics, the scientific uncertainties are such that we could meet current expectations of what is required to hold temperature increases to 1.5C and still have to deal with immense harmful effects. Australia has the strongest interest among developed countries in the success of a global effort on climate change. Even if we abstract ourselves from the effects of climate change itself, we have the most to gain economically from being part of a global transition to a zero-emissions economy. But we are stuck on the side of the chasm with the people who are against effective action. Does it matter that we are on the wrong side of the chasm – a force against, rather than for, effective action? Won’t the important decisions be made in other countries? It matters morally, for reasons explained by Pope Francis and Professor John Broome. It matters economically: we deny ourselves the vast opportunities for expanding Australian employment and incomes, which are located disproportionately in rural and provincial Australia. These gains would be much larger if we joined the whole world in taking strong action on reducing emissions, but they are substantial even with the world in its current state. Australian steps also affect the prospect of others building and moving across their own bridges – never as a single determinant of the decisions of another, but as one among many significant influences. Whether Australia actively supports international action on climate change or continues as a drag on the transition will be influential at the margins of decisions in many countries – influential at the margins in ways that sometimes make the difference. It seems crazy now, and will seem crazier to Australians in the future, if we use the influence we have against rather than in favour of the prosperity and security and natural and human heritage of Australians who come after us. I am often asked if I am optimistic or pessimistic about Australia and the world doing what must be done to avoid great disruption from climate change. People who look on and despair at past and present failures of action ask how I manage to carry on trying to improve the outcomes, or at least the chances of a less damaging outcome. I reply that there is still a chance of avoiding disastrous outcomes, and the incidental advantages of that outcome for Australians are so large that once my fellow citizens see them as they are, they will want us all to cross the bridge. Of course, that does not deny the awful reality of where we have gone over the past decade, and where we are today. But Australians with good leadership have made big changes in the past when severe challenges required them. Neither does it deny the difficulties that we have brought upon ourselves and will leave to future Australians by leaving the start so late and closing off the less tangled paths to the bridge across the chasm. The awful reality is that we may fail to change far and fast enough, and that our grandchildren will inherit a parched and disordered country in which a past time of prosperity, democracy and good order is a myth of origin. Yes, that is a possibility. And yes, sometimes I do think that the time of hope has passed. But there is still a path to a manageable outcome. And I see no good purpose in acceding to despair while the path to a manageable outcome remains open to us.

"The idea of a single building where you live, work and play may seem very much of the moment, driven by advances in communications technology. But mixed-use developments have been around for as long as mankind. Research has revealed that complex cave systems hosted multiple uses hundreds of thousands of years ago. The Romans built large multi-use complexes across their empire. And during medieval times, people used to manufacture, sell and live in the same building.  It wasn’t until the industrial revolution that industry and trade were separated from homes. Advances in mechanical and agricultural technologies brought on board processes that were highly toxic and dirty, while instances of plague and infestation grew, as larger volumes of food were stored to feed a growing urban population. Large-scale industrial automation also required special access and ample spaces to accommodate large and noisy machinery and production systems. To address these issues, cities around the world began to segregate uses, by either locating different functions in separate buildings, or through the regulatory zoning of land.  Much has changed since industrial times. The gradual move from a “manufacturing” to a “services” era, the growth of specialised fields of expertise and advances in communication have all meant that organisations could operate at a smaller scale, giving more people the opportunity to work from home.  What’s more, sustainability has become an increasingly important consideration over the past few decades. As a growing body of research shows that flexible spaces can be more economically viable and land efficient, mixed use schemes are gaining popularity once more. In some countries,legislation and financial incentives embrace the view that all different aspects of life can successfully be performed at a local level, in a shared place.  But making the switch back to mixed use isn’t quite so simple. Growing population densities in cities, intricate property ownership models and the need to share limited land resources all present a challenge to changing the way people live and work.  Urban designers must relearn how to allocate different activities and various levels of privacy within one space, while resolving all the increasingly complex technicalities of contemporary city life. Perhaps the biggest challenge for architects and designers is having to learn to work in parallel with other fields of expertise. Fortunately, technology has come to the rescue, with new communication tools and software solutions that allow everyone involved to work simultaneously on one shared design model. While still in the transition phase, architects are acknowledging and embracing the changes required.  But there are other reasons why the changes in building patterns have been slow. There is still a public perception that living in a purely residential area is desirable.  For one thing, there’s a widespread misconception that residential suburbia, with trees and front gardens, but segregated from the main city and its services, equates to the garden city, historically regarded as a healthier living option. In fact, the garden city was initially designed so that residents could have easy access to local jobs and essential services through a highly connected “urban economy” system. This misunderstanding prevents many from appreciating the benefits of healthier and more flexible ways to inhabit our planet.  People don’t like the idea of sharing their residential spaces with industrial and commercial uses. Issues such as noise, smells and loss of privacy prevent some buyers from investing in mixed use schemes. But this tendency is gradually changing. Examples across the globe are showing that living, working, socialising and entertaining locally has multiple benefits such as shorter commuting times and a more active and engaged social life. This is true in both large cities and lower density areas.  What’s more, mixed use developments can help residents to establish frequent contact and long term relationships with others. Virtual reality and global communication systems are connecting people around the world. But they also detach people from those they are closest to. A built environment that keeps people together and offers more opportunities to meet could mitigate this problem.  Lives are becoming more fused, and the boundaries between family life, social life and work, are gradually disintegrating. In response, the built environment must adapt, offering greater flexibility and efficiency, while helping citizens to reach for a richer, healthier, happier future."
"As delegates to the COP25 climate summit scramble to adjust to a last-minute change of venue from Santiago to Madrid, one of the highest-profile attendees has stuck out a metaphorical thumb on social media to ask for a lift across the Atlantic. Teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was speaking in California during a stop on her low-emissions journey from Sweden to Chile, tweeted that she was now in need of a ride to Spain. Thunberg, who refuses to fly because of the carbon emissions involved, had been travelling by boat, train and electric car when the new venue was announced. “It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way:)...If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful,” she tweeted from Los Angeles. As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I’ll need some help.It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:)Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.-> https://t.co/vFQQcLTh2U Thunberg arrived in New York for the UN climate summit in August after a 14-day journey across the Atlantic in a sailing boat. Since then she has been travelling via train and an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger. She made headlines for her incendiary speech at the summit, where she berated the world’s leaders for their inaction on the climate emergency. “This is all wrong,” she said. “I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. “Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones.” The UN announced on Friday that Spain would host next month’s COP25, after Chile abandoned plans to hold it due to deadly anti-government protests. Some 25,000 delegates were expected to travel to Santiago for the event. Harjeet Singh, of environmental group ActionAid International, said moving the summit from Chile to Spain with only four weeks’ notice “presents real barriers to participation” for delegates from the southern hemisphere. “Hotels in Madrid are already full. Last-minute flights are expensive. Visas can be difficult to obtain at short notice. This sudden decision is likely to shift the balance of power towards the wealthier countries of the global north,” he added in a statement. It is the second time that UN authorities have had to scramble to find a new meeting place. Brazil originally welcomed the gathering then backed out after rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. Reactions to Thunberg’s social media plea for transport were predictably mixed, varying from multiple offers of support to suggestions she should return to school to learn about air travel. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s ecological transition minister, said on Twitter on Saturday: “Dear Greta, it would be great to have you here in Madrid. You’ve made a long journey and help all of us to raise concern, open minds and enhance action. We would love to help you to cross the Atlantic back.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online Spektrum.de science magazine conducted an in-depth interview with two leading international climate scientists, Professor Mojib Latif and Professor Hans von Storch.
For the record, both now concede that global temperatures have indeed defied the vast array of (expensive) model projections and have not gone up in 15 years. Now more than ever before they are forced to concede that the models have been giving CO2 too much weight as a climate driver.
But Latif, who 10 years ago predicted Europe would hardly see snow and frost in the wintertime, now claims that he “isn’t at all surprised in any way by the warming hiatus” (and that all the models have been wrong). To his credit, Latif in the past predicted that ocean cycles needed to be better taken into account and that the warming would pause due to ocean cycles.
Hans von Storch, on the other hand, says he is surprised by the stalled warming: “It hasn’t gotten as warm as we expected. […] We really have to think about whether or not our models can really project the future development.”
Too much complexity and uncertainty
Spektrum then asked if the scientists perhaps overestimated CO2. The warmist Latif admits the following:
There are uncertainties regarding CO2 climate sensitivity. This is stated in the upcoming IPCC report, which summarizes the latest of science and looks at a very broad range. Here it is not appropriate to boil the whole problem down to a single magnitude: the global mean temperature. Rather it is necessary to understand exactly what is happening regionally, how the temperature develops at a location. But we are not yet that far, and perhaps we will never get that far because it is far too complex. This is why I’d prefer not to stay stuck on climate sensitivity.”
Moreover, Die kalte Sonne website here points us to a presentation by Latif. On page 31 he concedes the powerful role played by ocean cycles and concludes:
The most recent decades contain a strong contribution from the AMO (MOC) even on a global scale. This raises questions about the average climate sensitivity of the IPCC models.”

What we have here is a devout warmist, Mojib Latif, conceding that average climate sensitivity of the IPCC is truly under serious question and that nothing is settled after all. Therefore any claims to certainty made in the AR5 will have no credibility whatsoever.
When it comes to the impact of the sun, von Storch warns:
We should not declare this discussion over too soon. When we look at the 20th century, the climate fluctuations cannot be exclusively attributed to CO2 alone or to internal factors. Also the sun naturally played a role. The question is whether or not we correctly quantified it.”
Warming stop may continue until 2025!
Also Spektrum asks how much longer should we expect the warming stop to continue. Latif:
I wouldn’t be surprised if the temperatures remain at a high level until 2020 or 2025.”
That would mean almost 30 years without any warming. That also means the temperature will in 2025 will be 0.6°C below what the models projected. Meanwhile Hans von Storch says he is starting to get nervous:
I would get nervous if the temperature continues to pause more than 5 years more. The we would really need to question our climate models. But I also do not expect a cooling.”
My feeling is that we’ll be checking in 2018. But then again, in five years time both will probably be retired.

"Devil rays, close cousins of the enormous manta rays, are stars of nature documentaries. They tend to collect together in large numbers, and some species leap from the water. Because of this they are popular with divers and, like mantas, important for tourism. But as is so often the case with some of our favourite species, these charismatic creatures are under threat from humans, specifically, because of the gill plate trade.  Devil rays are pulled out of the sea in huge numbers, all over the world, and butchered on beaches for their gill plates, the feather-like organs that they use to filter plankton and small fish – their preferred prey – from the oceans. The gill plates are then sold in markets in parts of Asia as a purported health tonic, despite the fact that there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support this claim.  Unfortunately, these rays are both vulnerable to targeted fishing and often victims of bycatch. To make matters worse, the nine described species of devil ray are known to be some of the slowest reproducing of any elasmobranch, the group which includes sharks and rays. Females take many years to reach maturity, and only produce a single live pup every few years. Huge declines of these rays have been documented all over the world – at a rate of to 99% in some places. So what is being done? In September and October 2016, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) met in Johannesburg, South Africa, for its 17th conference. This is the same organisation which is responsible for regulating trade in some of the world’s most infamous wildlife products, including elephant ivory and rhino horn. The meeting happens every three years, and delegates from the 183 signatory countries discussed listing all nine devil ray species under the convention, to regulate the trade in the species and their parts.  I was lucky enough to be present at the meeting, and to see the devil ray proposal achieve the required two-thirds majority vote. These new regulations are being implemented in April 2017 – so it is becoming illegal to trade in devil rays, or any of their parts, such as gill plates, across international borders without permits approving that the trade is not detrimental to the wild population.  One of the main concerns about enforcing the devil ray regulations is identifying between species, which are visually very similar. Compound that with the fact that those monitoring the fisheries – and customs officials – are often presented with gill plates, and not the whole specimen. Despite these issues, the devil ray listing will also greatly benefit the existing protections for manta rays, as manta gill plates can no longer be hidden among devil ray gill plates. A large part of my work focuses on developing traceability tools that can identify a devil ray, or any of its parts, and which region it has come from. The intention is that this will assist with enforcement and monitoring of the new CITES regulations. I am also doing the same for the manta rays, which were listed on CITES in 2013. Essentially, we take tissue samples from individuals of known species and sequence short fragments of the DNA that they contain. This allows us to build up a picture of the genetic signatures of each species and population, to which we can compare samples from an unknown individual or part. What we are looking for is a minimum number of regions within the genome that are unique enough within species to give us confidence in assignment and this assists us in identifying which species it came from.  The project is fortunate to have had a lot of support from international researchers and organisations, and therefore has access to one of the world’s most comprehensive sets of manta and devil ray tissue samples, which will allow the final tool to be as robust as possible. The hope is, that with regulations such as CITES effectively enforced, marine life will still be as vibrant and exciting for many generations to come."

Explanation soon follows in my next post. First let’s rejoice!

"When the dinosaurs were wiped off the face of the planet, how did they leave? Was it a slow, plodding decline or a short sharp bang? Back in the 1960s and 1970s, debate about this question was mainly taking place on the ground, at fossil sites in places like Montana. Paleontologist Robert Sloan and his colleagues documented evidence for the long-term decline of dinosaurs over a 10m to 20m-year period. Dinosaurs had been losing out, ever so slowly, to the rising mammals, mainly as a result of cooling climates. Indeed, climates at this time were cooling. And because dinosaurs relied on the external environment to maintain their body temperatures, this would have hurt them.  But two revelations dramatically switched the consensus against gradual decline. First, the geological field evidence suggested no gradual decline in dinosaur fossils in the rocks. Plus the overlap of declining dinosaurs and rising mammals noted by Sloan turned out to be based on faulty fieldwork and fossil dating. Fossils can be moved from one type of rock to another by being “reworked” or eroded, moved along and then deposited for a second time in younger rocks, providing misleading information about their true age. The other revelation was the 1980 discovery by Luis Alvarez, which showed that the Earth had been struck by a huge meteorite 66m years ago. It was a collision that threw up vast tonnages of black dust into the atmosphere, which blacked out the sun, leading to freezing and darkness for some months. This was accepted reluctantly at first by geologists, but then enthusiastically as the evidence accumulated.  Impact and sudden death of the dinosaurs made complete sense. The last dinosaurs, such as Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex, were imagined as dumbfounded by the asteroid streaking through the sky, and killed wholesale by a consequent fireball and then freezing darkness. But did the dinosaurs really disappear with a bang? New evidence now suggests instead a very, very, long decline, perhaps as long as 40m years. Part of this comes from our application of a modelling technique to the data. The key here is to have an evolutionary tree, what is known as a “phylogeny”, which is dated accurately against geological time. Although the fossil record of dinosaurs is incomplete and patchy, we do have high quality phylogenies, tested over 30 years of research, that provide solid information on dinosaurian relationships.  Once you have a phylogeny, and date it against a geological time scale, you can read off a great deal of new information. It helps to joins the dots, linking isolated finds, and bridging gaps. It also provides a framework from which rich data on rates of evolution can be calculated. We wanted to explore a hint of decline that had been noted in the first such comparative phylogenetic analysis.Our new work focused on exploring the diversity dynamics of dinosaurs through their entire evolution. We confirmed first that they did most of their evolving in the first half of their reign on Earth, during the late Triassic and early to middle Jurassic periods, some 230m to 150m years ago.  Most importantly, we found clear evidence for a long-term decline from 40m years before the end of the Cretaceous period. We looked at all dinosaurs, and then each of the main subgroups. The only exceptions were the duck-billed dinosaurs (hadrosaurs) and the horned ceratopsians, both of which showed renewed bursts of evolving into new distinct species later on. So after so much recent disagreement, can our new theory be believed? We believe so. It is based on the most detailed data ever assembled, a complete evolutionary tree of more than 600 species of dinosaurs, with better control on the time scale than ever before.  The result was obtained through modelling of the data using an approach which allowed us to repeat the calculations millions of time, using different assumptions about uncertainties each time, to see whether the analysis converged on a single result. In this case, we modelled uncertainties in the phylogeny, in geological dating, and in sampling, and tried every variant of the data, and the result was robust. We can now say categorically: for their final 40m years on Earth, the dinosaurs were in decline - their rate of species extinction was on average consistently higher than their rate of forming new and distinct species (speciation). But what we cannot yet explain is why this was so. We found correlation of our speciation dynamics data with sea level, but a more detailed exploration is needed of the impact of cooling climates and their interactions with other species such as mammals. Whatever the driver, dinosaurs were declining. They went out with a long, protracted whimper … followed by that almighty meteoric bang."
"A large oil find has been declared 60 miles west of Shetland, off the north coast of Scotland. It’s being described as the UK’s “largest undeveloped discovery”. Taken at face value, this is exciting news for an industry still reeling after the oil price collapse of the past few years (environmentalists though are less enthusiastic). The discovery was made by Hurricane Energy, a specialist exploration firm, which announced that its Halifax well had found large amounts of oil. It said it had also successfully undertaken a production test in which oil flowed at an impressive rate. This find may even be connected with a previous discovery nearby (the Lancaster field) and hence be part of one large accumulation of nearly a billion untapped barrels. Hurricane Energy specialises in trying to extract oil from so-called fractured “basement” reservoirs. While most oil, including most North Sea oil, is found within sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, these basements occur when oil gathers in the natural cracks (or fractures) between impermeable igneous rock. In this specific case, Hurricane was actively searching along the Rona Ridge – a prominent seabed feature which hosts several oil fields. This is undoubtedly an encouraging result for the UK oil industry as it seeks to extend the life of a mature basin characterised by ever diminishing resources. However, it is important to underline that there are major geological hurdles still to overcome and the oil can’t yet be considered potential, probable or proven reserves, all of which have strict statistical and commercial definitions. Although fractured reservoirs have been successful elsewhere in the world, most notably in Vietnam and Yemen, this would be a first in the UK. The rocks around Shetland are very dense, and it’s particularly hard to work out how much oil is found in the narrow, open fractures in between them.  Success is likely then to be dependent on the fractures, which not only need to be significant but also suitably oriented for a directional drill bit to intersect them. Fractured basements are notorious for fast depletion on production as the fractures are drained quickly, and such fields consequently commonly have a shorter shelf life. It is also worth remembering that no basement has been shown to work elsewhere in the North Sea to date. Concerns over economic viability mean the most notable discoveries at Cairngorm and at Bagpuss have yet to be developed. Hurricane will need to conduct an extended well test to demonstrate sufficient flow for the field to be feasible in the long term. Also, more drilling will probably be required to ascertain whether the Halifax oil exists in one large reservoir or in several smaller accumulations. The latter is much harder to develop. The billion barrels quoted in the media is certainly an eye-watering discovery – especially now, after oil firms have been scouring the North Sea for decades. However it is unclear whether these are actual usable resources. Given what we know about this field and the typical recovery rates of oil from fractured reservoirs, actual reserves may be around 200m barrels – reasonably large but not especially so (the largest oil fields in the Gulf have tens of billions of barrels).  We also don’t yet know what sort of oil has been found. Oil in nearby Clair Field is particularly viscous and heavy, which meant it was left in the ground for almost 20 years until better technology and higher prices made extracting it worthwhile. If the Lancaster/Halifax oil has similar characteristics the operator will face additional challenges.  Even presupposing that the geology, oil type and drilling can lead to a successful development, it seems likely that evacuation would have to take place by hooking up the discovery with existing pipeline infrastructure or a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility.  However, with the infrastructure that is now in place and with the experience major operators have gained in developing their oilfields west of Shetland with few incidents, the development of another large field nearby should not prove to be a major hurdle. This discovery raises various social and political questions, of course. After Brexit, is this the UK’s oil or Scotland’s, or even Shetland’s? Do people want the jobs, income and secure energy supply that comes from a thriving offshore industry, or would they instead highlight the global carbon budget and choose to leave that oil under the sea? Who knows? What we can say, as petroleum geoscientists, is that we are excited but cautious. After all, it took more than 28 years from Clair’s initial discovery for its reserves to be confirmed."
"Whatever happened to energy crops? A decade ago, the UK authorities confidently expected farmers to devote swaths of land to growing the likes of short-rotation willow and poplar and perennial grasses. These were to help feed one of the UK’s promising new renewable power sources – biomass energy, which burns plant materials to produce heat and power.  In only a few years, biomass has developed into a major UK power source. It supplies nearly 3GW of the whole electricity supply, getting on for 3% of the total. Locally farmed energy crops were supposed to help reduce the biomass stations’ dependence on imported plant materials. One projection in 2009 envisaged their planted area expanding by a factor of 275 to reach 2.2 million hectares in the UK by 2030, representing a radical transformation of the agricultural landscape.  Yet, since then, the planted area has been declining. This is despite government incentives for farmers and the potential for energy crops to tick many policy boxes – as well as biomass they help with agricultural diversification, make productive use of marginal and surplus farmland and help improve the ecosystem.   The assumption in government circles seems to have been that, given sufficient incentives, large numbers of farmers would switch. According to research that I recently co-authored, this seems to have underestimated the complexity of the decision.  We explored the attitudes of 190 farmers in the Lockerbie area of southern Scotland to planting short-rotation willow, the energy crop best suited to the region’s climate and soils. The reason we chose Lockerbie was that E.ON opened a 44MW combined heat and power plant there in 2009 – then the largest biomass plant in the UK. It needs 480,000 tonnes of wood each year, 20% of which E.ON aimed to source from locally grown willow. That equates to 4,000 hectares of land and represented a potential new source of income for the upland livestock and dairy farmers of the region.  Yet we found that most farmers in the area were not interested in planting the crop – even if it meant increasing their profit margins. One third told us they couldn’t imagine anything that would persuade them to grow it. The farmers saw themselves primarily as food producers and saw energy crops as an alien practice. They were strongly and even passionately attached to their way of life. As one told us: No amount of money would ever encourage me to grow willow because I am a farmer. I can’t think of anything more unattractive. Study after study in the UK and elsewhere has reached similar conclusions: most farmers see energy crops as simply not for them. A recent survey of English farmers, for example, found just 7% willing to grow short-rotation willow. Meanwhile, at the SembCorp wood-burning plant in north-east England, only 5% of the area set aside for energy crops has been planted.  Underlying this antipathy is a deep-seated cultural divide between farming and forestry in the UK. “We are livestock farmers not tree farmers,” one respondent told us. “Our job is producing food, not fuel,” said another.  The government’s overly optimistic projections calculated only whether the land was technically suitable for growing these crops. It also gave too little consideration to the geography of where in practice farmers might actually be willing to plant them. While not all are opposed in principle, most recommend other types of farmland than their own. So farmers in arable regions point towards upland grazing areas as the appropriate place for energy crops, while livestock farmers believe they belong on arable land. In the Lockerbie area, all of this compounded with certain other financial and practical factors. These included the costs involved in what they would be giving up; lack of familiarity with the crops; an undeveloped supply chain and the fact that it imposed a four-year harvesting cycle, which reduced the farmers’ business flexibility compared with the current annual cycle.  Energy crops have been victims of what is sometimes called the “food, energy and environment trilemma”, in which food security, energy security and mitigating climate change all demand different land uses. Promoting biomass energy might make perfect sense from a national perspective, but the government won’t get much help from UK farmers while it ignores the fact they see energy crops as being at odds with their traditions and priorities.   Farmers themselves are keenly aware of this disconnect – between “the suits” and “the boiler suits”. As one of our respondents put it: Some suit-wearing office boy must have thought that the hillbilly farmers of Dumfries and Galloway would just subside, sell half their herds and plant willow.  Whether that is fair comment or not, this is evidently a strategy that needs to be seriously reconsidered."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwitter today led me to a comical report by “climate communications expert” David Holmes titled: Four Hiroshima bombs a second: how we imagine climate change. We’ve all heard about the farmer who expected to harvest a thousand bushels, but ended up only with only a hundred. Gee, whatever happened to the other 900?

Has anyone seen 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of missing heat? Goofball climate professors can’t find the mega-heat. Photo source: theconversation.com/uk.
Yes, expectations are often far from reality.
In his post Holmes tells his readers that James Hansen calculated that “the planet is building up heat at the equivalent of four Hiroshima bombs worth of energy every second” and that John Cook (the guy who lost thousands of scientists in a simple survey) and oceanographer John Church say “90% of that heat is going into the oceans.” …somewhere.
Such a naïve calculation is Holmes idea of poignantly communicating the seriousness of man-made global warming to the public. With such enormous heat being added to the lower atmosphere, you’d think it would heat up very quickly. Recall that according to the models and the physics, the heat is indeed supposed to appear in the lower atmosphere, and not hidden miles deep down in the oceans.

Well it hasn’t, and it’s a real big problem for climate scientists. Expectations again far from reality. In fact the temperature of the lower atmosphere hasn’t gone up at all in 15 years, nor has the upper 700 meters of the ocean. Even the ice caps are growing once again, thus showing that heat, to the contrary, is disappearing! Holmes and climate scientists insist that the heat is there, and that 90% is hidden somewhere DEEP in the oceans in a place from which we happen to have very little measured data.
Whopping 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat – missing!
Just how much heat is lost? Using Hansen’s 4 Hiroshima bombs per second calculation over 15 years, it comes out to 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat. It’s gone – missing! Nobody is able to find it.
The truth is that most of it very likely does not even exist. This is an error magnitude of monumental proportions committed by the climate modelers. The 1.9 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat is their error, and it is glaring. This is way beyond left field. It’s not even in the ball park. Soon we are going to need an awfully big ocean to hide that kind of error. Little wonder that an exasperated Kevin Trenberth once called it a “travesty“.
Astonishingly, Holmes admits that “for the most part, climate change as change cannot be visualised. People living in cities are the last to notice changes in climate, because it is happening a long way from our direct experience in the natural world.”
Indeed. If it wasn’t for all the media hype, nobody would even notice climate change.

"When mass market 4x4s first appeared on the scene in the 1970s, I was a little boy. I was in awe of these huge, rugged things that started appearing everywhere. Toyota Landcruisers, Range Rovers, Mercedes G models, Chevy Blazers … they had an air of exoticism and adventure that I found irresistible. I could literally smell horses and hear country music every time a Blazer or a Bronco appeared on the roads of my hometown, as if they had driven straight there from the Wild West. That magic was not lost on the adults, either. All around us, friends and family began contemplating the purchase of one of these newly-domesticated adventure vehicles. Would it be a Nissan Patrol or an Isuzu Trooper? A Suzuki LJ or a Samurai? It was the fashionable thing to do to buy a vehicle you could easily take across the Sahara and back, or do the Transamericana in, from Alaska to Argentina. Many rarely left the nearby cul-de-sac, but I know some that went to the ends of the Earth. It was as if the world had suddenly become a more accessible place – and what’s more, this new breed of vehicles could even take you to Timbuktu in a measure of comfort. There were perfectly domesticated seats inside, you could get power steering, even automatic transmission, just like in a normal car. Only these things could play tricks you wouldn’t dream of performing with one of those more conventional vehicles.  My father and I spent unforgettable hours test driving late 70s and early 80s SUVs in the presence of enthusiastic salesmen who would stop at nothing to convince us that every high school teacher needed a vehicle that could climb a 45-degree incline in low gear, lock differentials, and wade through surging rivers. Some of these test drives felt positively dangerous, and yet, car and passengers always emerged unscathed back at the dealership. This was also the time of the Cold War, and we Europeans eyed the Soviet Union and the Eastern Block as a place perhaps best compared to the Land of Mordor in Lord of the Rings. It seemed a mysterious place, closed to all inquiry and even touristic interest, all the while coldly plotting to eradicate us all.  And yet, they gave us fantastic Radio Yerevan jokes – and some truly iconic cars (as well as some rather sketchy ones). In fact, my mother’s side of the family started the Czech company Tatra, known among vintage car enthusiasts as the manufacturers of wonderfully dolphin-shaped vehicles with air-cooled, rear-mounted V8 engines and central, airplane-style fins. These jokes and the family car connection enabled me at an early age to fully appreciate one contender in the 1970-80s 4x4 racket many Western Europeans eyed with contempt and suspicion: the Lada Niva. The Russian car marque Lada, produced by AvtoVAZ, was the butt of jokes in the West. What do you call a Lada with a sunroof? Yes, a skip (that’s a dumpster to north American readers). The saloon car, the Riva, was the main target of the jibes. But Lada made an off-roader too. The rugged little Niva first took to the road in 1977. And 40 years on it’s still going strong.  My first encounter with this vehicle was at a motor show in Germany, where it was trying hard to look cool next to a Toyota Landcruiser J50 … and winning hands down, in my opinion. Where the Toyota came across as brutish, tinny and truck-like, the Lada exuded an almost feminine grace and an urbane elegance that could have befitted a city in Italy. Keep in mind, this is the late 1970s – a time when people thought the Mercedes W114 looked “sleek” (these days, we would liken it more to a piece of furniture). The Lada Niva (“нива” is the Russian for “crop field”) was an immensely advanced and forward-thinking concept. And now it is apparent how influential it has actually been. Its dimensions are very reasonable, compact, garage-friendly; you can drive around a European city in one without worrying you might leave a trail of destruction. Its body has a timeless, almost Italian, Giorgetto Giugiaroesque aesthetic, which is perhaps no wonder since the Italians featured heavily in Eastern Block car design at the time, and incidentally also designed the last generation Tatra V8 in the 70s.  But it wasn’t only the way the Niva looked that made it special; it actually had a unibody, which set it apart from the ladder-frame based monsters around it, resulting in more refined handling, lower weight, and better passive safety than its rivals. Years went by until Jeep picked up on this concept with its successful Cherokee.  The chassis and drivetrain were also absolute jewels of engineering by comparison to the leaf-sprung (a basic form of suspension), rigid-axle rivals from Japan and the US. The Niva actually had three differentials, an independent suspension at the front, plus coil springs all around when nobody else did this with the exception of perhaps Range Rover. Even the Monteverdi Safari, at the time considered absolute royalty among 4x4s, had a leaf-sprung rear axle.  It could also, seemingly, go anywhere. Lightweight and tough, it could drive where other, bulkier 4x4s ground to a halt. Used by the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, it reportedly became the first car to spend more than a decade on the frozen continent. But the best thing is that the Lada Niva is still available today – outliving even Land Rover’s iconic Defender – almost unchanged, in its original, brilliant, clean package. You can buy it, you can run it, you can get it fixed. The car is a brand new vintage model that makes economic sense. If you buy one now, you can even choose a snowplough as an optional extra. You could go off-road to Siberia and back. I’ve been saving up my pocket money to buy one since I was nine, and hey, now it’s 40 I might just go for it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn attempt by a group of climate science skeptics to perhaps bypass climate-science gate-keeping and marginalization used against their scientific hypotheses has taken a turn for the worse, with accusations of “nepotism” within the peer-review process at the PRP journal.
Jo Nova has a new post on the situation, implying that peer-review is a mere formality that’s subject to corruption and that in the end “science is not done by peer or pal review, but by evidence and reason.”
Given the corruption and gate-keeping we’ve seen in climate science over the past 2 decades, We can be glad that we have real data and observations. But even some of those are being massively tampered with. Such is the sad state climate science has devolved to.
Roger Tattersall, one at the centre of the controversy, has reacted to the accusations of peer-review “nepotism” at the PRP journal as follows:
Pierre, thanks for adding the links. Martin Rasmussen’s excuse for shutting down the journal have shifted from “PRP was never meant to be a platform for climate sceptics.” to “the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis, which we regard as malpractice”
This grubby accusation remains a vague and unsubstantiated smear. The Handling Editor, Nils-Axel Morner is mystified, and has made an official complaint to the EGU, which publishes many journals through Copernicus. We await developments. Meanwhile, lukewarmer website Wattsupwiththat has rushed to judgement, finding the editors of the PRP special edition, myself included, guilty. Watts has emailed me to say I am ‘now a Pariah’. Mother nature will be our judge, when in due course she shows whether our dynamical model, which successfully hindcasts 1000 years of solar variation, remains on course or not in the future. Experimentum summas judex – Albert Einstein.”
I can certainly understand the frustration on the part of some scientists with regards to the known pal-review corruption and gate-keeping at some renowned journals and at the IPCC, and the overall difficulties encountered to get alternative views out. And God knows the hostile environment skeptics in Germany have had to deal with. Yet I agree with the expectation that the ethics of peer-review process must be upheld and lived by on all sides. There’s no other way.
But on the other hand, let’s not forget that peer-review is not the universal Stamp of Final Truth and that the real test is time and scrutiny. As I said, damn good thing we have data and observations.

"Greenhouse gas emissions from diesel cars, utes and vans have risen sharply since 2011, effectively cancelling out the cut in pollution from new renewable energy replacing some coal plants. A surge in ownership of larger diesel vehicles is a central reason emissions from transport leapt by more than 10% over the decade, according to the monthly emissions audit published by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute.  They rose as the federal government considered, promoted and ultimately shelved plans to introduce vehicle emissions standards to address the issue. Report author Hugh Saddler, an energy expert and honorary associate professor with the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, found annual carbon dioxide emissions from burning diesel increased by 21.7m tonnes between 2011 and 2018. Diesel vehicles – mostly utes – have doubled their share of the light commercial vehicle market, and from a lower base tripled their share of household passenger car sales. Emissions from electricity fell by 22.1m tonnes a year over the same period. Saddler said the increase in diesel use was one of the reasons there had been a year-on-year rise in national emissions since 2015. He said governments and industry had improved fuel efficiency of heavy road freight vehicles but done little to lift the efficiency of light vehicles such as the work ute or family car, with the issue “placed in the purgatory of a ministerial forum for the last five years”. “Focusing purely on reducing electricity emissions while failing to recognise the importance of transport emissions is taking two steps forward, one step back,” he said. Saddler said there had been a dip in retail diesel sales over the past six months but it was too early to tell what caused it. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions was set up by the Turnbull government in 2015. In 2017, interest groups were sent a model proposing a standard of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre for Australian light vehicles, phased in from 2020 to 2025. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development estimated the resulting fuel savings would deliver a net benefit to the economy by 2040 of $13.9bn. The owner of an average petrol car was expected to save $519 a year. Josh Frydenberg, then the environment and energy minister, now the Treasurer, said reforms to Australia’s fuel efficiency, fuel quality and noxious emissions standards had the potential to deliver real benefits, and pointed out that 80% of the global vehicle passenger fleet was subject to fuel efficiency standards. But the proposal was shelved after internal opposition and criticism from the automotive lobby. Labor adopted a similar policy before this year’s federal election, promising 50% of new car sales would be electric by 2030. Scott Morrison responded by accusing the opposition of wanting to “end the weekend” by forcing people out of four-wheel drives. A spokeswoman for the Michael McCormack, the minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, said the government’s goal was to encourage cleaner and more efficient vehicles without burdening Australian families. She pointed to a February announcement that it would develop a national electric vehicle strategy “to plan and manage the transition to new vehicle technologies and infrastructure”. “The Liberal and Nationals government’s policy is clear: we will not introduce a mandatory fuel efficiency standard that can drive up the price of cars for Australians,” she said. Saddler said based on the evidence there was “absolutely no reason” not to introduce vehicle emissions standards. “It’s a failure of political will,” he said. Most countries in the OECD have adopted policies to reduce emissions and improve vehicle efficiency. Saddler said in the 1990s diesel vehicles were viewed as better for the environment than petrol cars but technology evolved and many markets, particularly in Europe, had moved to cleaner alternatives. “The average diesel vehicle owner travels further than a petrol vehicle owner and many diesel engines have gotten larger, easily undoing the benefit of diesel as a lower CO2 polluting fuel than petrol,” he said. The Australian government has revised down over time the emissions cuts it expects to make from cleaning up cars. In 2015, it produced a graph indicating it expected to achieve a reduction of about 100m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 through vehicle emissions standards. The climate package released earlier this year projected only 10m tonnes of abatement through a yet-to-be-released electric vehicle strategy."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNature here today has a commentary acknowledging that the warming pause is real and that it has grown into a full blown trend – it is no longer just noise! “Sixteen years into the mysterious ‘global-warming hiatus’, scientists are piecing together an explanation.”
Hat/tip: Barry Woods. Nature writes:
The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. […]
For several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field.”
Don’t let Nature fool you here. It’s actually a major crisis of confidence. Nature even acknowledges natural factors are in play after all.
An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), […]
…and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998.″

On climate models:
…none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time.”
And Susan Solomon is now moving the goal posts once again, claiming that the “main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years”!
So why the unexpected hiatus? Nature floats out a number of possible reasons: aerosols, ocean cycles, solar activity – no one knows!
But Kevin Trenberth refuses to give up hope, and keeps clinging to the climate catastrophe: “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.”
In the meantime, only one thing is sure: Scientists haven’t been “on the right track” – not in 15 years!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a segment of the press conference video of COP 19 from CFACT.

Verna from the UK Youth Climate Coalitions is stunned how anyone could doubt the global warming religion, asking the panel, “How you can sleep at night?” Clearly the young lady has never read the science and refuses to be aware that there are lots of skeptics among the 97% who believe man is causing (to some extent) global warming, but reject there’s a problem. There’s no consensus among the consensus. Her only rebuttal? A childish: “Like, everything you said is BS…how can you sleep at night?”
“Just fine,” the panel reassured her – because the data show CO2 has been overblown and there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years.
I thought the question was handled very well by the panel. The question the young lady really needed to ask was how can anyone sleep at night knowing energy is being priced beyond what poor people can pay…24,000 high energy related deaths in UK alone last winter. 600,000 people in Germany alone are having their power turned off every year because it has become a expensive luxury.
You can watch the whole video here.
I thought Marc Morano should have stuck to more scientific results, and avoided the political aspects. But then again, I’m not familiar with the kind of environment they have to contend with at the Warsaw Conference. I guess it’s more politics than science.
Walter Cunningham did a good job on explaining how science works, and that the AGW theory is in deep trouble. Cunningham speaks of an “absence of supporting data…their climate models have never successfully predicted anything“.
In Germany, not sure about the rest of Europe, there really hasn’t been that much reporting on COP 19; it’s a stale, worn out issue. The enthusiasm is gone and the activists know it. That’s why they’ve become so shrill. It’s the last ditch effort to get a little attention.

"County councillors in North Yorkshire have voted seven to four in favour of allowing fracking near the village of Kirby Misperton.  The decision came after a two-day hearing which covered everything from the impact of shale gas development on the UK’s climate change commitments to the benefits for energy security and job creation, while those against the development maintained the risks and uncertainties were too great. However, this is a relatively modest proposal to hydraulically fracture an existing well at a site that has been producing gas for many years, and which is already connected to a nearby power station by a pipeline. The development programme involves no new drilling and will be short lived.  At the end of the day this was a local planning decision and not a national plebiscite on shale gas development. Councillors rightly felt that they had been put under unreasonable pressure and national scrutiny. So, while UK firm Third Energy has got its planning permission, it is clear that it has failed to obtain a “social licence” from the local community. Those living in Rydale are understandably worried about the impact of widespread development on the landscape and remain overwhelmingly against shale gas.  Shale gas in the UK is still in its very earliest stages and the Kirby Misperton site is not representative of the exploration and appraisal programme that will determine whether or not it can be developed commercially. Nonetheless, the industry will feel buoyed by the fact that shale is up and running again after a five-year hiatus. Other companies are waiting in the wings. Chemicals giant INEOS, for example, has already embarked on a programme of seismic surveys and has begun a PR campaign in areas where it already has a license. Last year the UK government awarded 93 onshore licences for 159 new blocks. Under changes introduced by the 2015 Infrastructure Act, licence holders must undertake 12 months of environmental monitoring. However, soon enough they will come forward with development plans that require planning permissions. Anti-fracking campaigners are right when they say the Kirby Misperton decision is just the beginning. What we have seen, first in Lancashire and now in North Yorkshire, is bound to be repeated elsewhere and with growing frequency. Nottinghamshire may be the next venue as developer IGas considers its options.  After its exuberant and unqualified support for “going all out for shale”, the government has now adopted a more measured approach that supports a safe and responsible programme of exploration. In England, at least, it is unlikely to declare a moratorium any time soon. This leaves local communities with no alternative but to protest and make their feelings known, as they did so eloquently at Kirby Misperton, while local planners and politicians will continue to find themselves caught firmly in the middle of the UK’s heated shale gas debate.  To some extent the campaigners’ focus on local politics is unavoidable: regulations require that it is county councils who grant planning permission. This puts the planning officers in an unenviable position.  Councils must treat any shale gas application as if it were a request to carry out a normal industrial activity, and the likely impact, and suggested mitigation measures, must be assessed on the basis of planning law and existing legislation. And, as elected officials, they have to do all this while taking into account the concerns of the local electorate. To put further pressure on the councillors, the government has sought to ensure decisions are reached within the statutory 16-week time frame. The government maintains shale gas development is a “fantastic opportunity” to improve the UK’s energy security and balance-of-payments, attract investment and create jobs and that it can contribute to the low carbon energy transition. But battle lines have been firmly drawn. On one side lies the Westminster government and the nascent shale gas industry, on the other, those living in areas where licences have been granted and an increasingly loud and effective no campaign, backed by falling public support for fracking. Councils will continue to find themselves caught in the crossfire. If the cumulative consequence of local planning decisions is that the shale gas industry fails to obtain a “social licence to operate”, then the national government that champions localism will surely have to bow to the outcome of local democracy."
"The possibility of Britain leaving the European Union raises all kinds of uncertainties. So when I sat down with a with a group of fellow academics to think about what it would mean for agriculture, we expected some surprises. We did not, however, realise just how complex and uncertain a picture we would produce.  UK farmers rely on subsidies from the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and have significant export markets in Europe which also influence domestic prices. For the consumer, however, the CAP pushes up food prices, due to tariffs applied to imports from outside the EU. The National Farmers Union favours remaining within the EU, but a substantial number of farmers want to leave over concerns about what they perceive to be excessive regulation. The biggest question mark relates to what would happen under the so-called Article 50 process, which lays down the procedure to be followed if a country wants to leave the EU. Negotiations would last at least two years, leaving farmers in an uncertain position which could also impact consumers.  The British government does not appear to have done any contingency planning for what would happen to agriculture in the event of a Brexit vote. However, EU subsidies to farmers would disappear and the UK government might not replace them in full. In the 2014 financial year the CAP resulted in €4.3 billion from the EU (about £3.5 billion) being passed to UK farmers. This is a serious issue for farmers. Data that our “farmer-scientist network” team assembled shows that, for many of them – especially sheep farmers in upland areas – these payments are the difference between running at a loss and making a modest profit.  Of course, the subsidies wouldn’t be withdrawn overnight. This would be catastrophic for British farmers. However, we do believe they would be gradually reduced each year. The Treasury has always regarded subsidies as market distorting because they are not related to competitiveness and efficiency, and there is continual pressure to reduce public expenditure – after a Brexit, farming subsidies might be a relatively easy way to cut spending. Subsidies tied up in contractual arrangements with national government agencies, so-called “pillar 2” subsidies, are less vulnerable. Deals such as the Countryside Stewardship agreements initiated in 2016, which provide incentives for landowners to restore wildlife habitats, manage flood risks or reduce water pollution, should remain in place for several years.  These subsidies have substantial support from domestic environmental and conservation lobbies and they are also viewed more favourably by the Treasury, which sees them as providing a public good. If Britain left the EU, these payments would probably be funded domestically. Some farmers hope that withdrawal from the EU would reduce the burden of regulations and form-filling for everything from subsidy claims through to livestock movements or water pollution. Yet much of this admin comes from London rather than Brussels. National governments tend to award themselves more powers while transposing EU directives into local law, for instance, a process known as “gold plating”. Plant protection has been an area of particular concern for farmers in recent years. The EU’s recent decision to ban three neonicotinoids, which are used to spray and protect crops, is a good example: despite concern that these chemicals are harmful to bees, the ban was made without what is regarded as sufficient field trial evidence. British farmers face difficulties growing their oil seed rape as a result. The UK had its own system of plant protection regulation before it joined the EU, and its Chemicals Regulation Directorate still approves products containing active ingredients cleared at European level. The CRD could become a purely domestic agency, however it would still have to be guided by the EU. After all, firms would be reluctant to develop distinctive products without certain active ingredients purely for the UK market. Products that have been restricted by the EU could be used in the UK, in principle, but this would meet strong opposition from the environmental lobby. As the EU currently imposes high tariffs on many agricultural and food products coming from outside, the post-Brexit tariff regime is of particular concern. At present the EU negotiates in the World Trade Organisation on behalf of the UK and other member states. Whatever happens after a potential Brexit, UK farmers wouldn’t be able to return to the unfettered use of high levels of domestic support, export subsidies and import tariffs that currently insulate the EU’s agricultural production from changes in world prices. World Trade Organisation regulations wouldn’t allow it at the present levels. Depending on any subsequent agreement with the EU, Brexit would place limits on the availability and use of labour from the EU. Not all of this labour is unskilled and seasonal, although it might be possible to restore a version of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme, which allowed Romanians and Bulgarians to work in the UK on temporary visas. Bear in mind also that many other member states derive a greater proportion of their GDP from agriculture or have a strong cultural attachment to farming and food. This gives British farmers a measure of additional political protection from subsidy cuts for instance, as farmers and their representatives in other countries help fight their battles for them. Outside of the EU, British farmers would be on their own, without help from their European counterparts who would continue to receive CAP subsidies.  All told, it is difficult to see exit as beneficial to British farmers or to the UK food and drink industry more generally. It would create a period of considerable uncertainty at a time when farmers already have to cope with low and volatile prices, while it is unlikely that the regulatory burden would actually be reduced. And regulations are needed to protect the environment and human and animal health."
"Furry, fast, occasionally chubby. Small, whiskered, bushy tailed. An expert climber. A nut eater. And grey. For those in the UK, everything was going great until that last trait. You were probably thinking “cute” and “cuddly”, and feeling positive about this mystery mammal. Until you discover it is the grey and not the red squirrel. Grey squirrels are a contradiction. They have all the characteristics of animals that people tend to love, and yet they are actively persecuted by humankind. BBC presenter Chris Packham calls them Britain’s “most unpopular non-native invader” – and one of their unflattering nicknames is the “tree rat”.  The Wildlife Trust has recently announced plans to recruit an army of 5,000 volunteers to monitor their endangered native relative, the red squirrel – and kill the greys. So why such a bad press for grey squirrels? Firstly, they ain’t from around here: greys were deliberately introduced from North America in the late 19th century as an exotic addition to country estates. They soon spread across the UK, however, and today the invaders are the dominant squirrel across almost all of England and Wales and much of Scotland and Ireland. But hostility towards invasive animals can’t explain the grey squirrel’s unpopularity – as other non-native species don’t get the same negative attention. The UK’s naturalised mammals include the brown hare, the edible dormouse, and sika deer. Even the much-loved rabbit is a Roman import. Instead, grey squirrels are disliked, by foresters due to the damage that they inflict upon trees, and more generally because of the harm they cause to their native relatives, red squirrels. Studies have shown that greys can outcompete reds – the two species do not directly fight for resources, it is just that the greys are better at gathering the nuts and berries that both live off.  Grey squirrels are also unknowingly the carrier of a disease, squirrel pox, to which they are immune, but sadly the red is not. For red squirrels, the pox means painful scabs, ulcers and almost certain death (although some are finally developing resistance). The pox itself may actually be the chief “evil immigrant” in this eco-relationship, with the grey squirrel simply moving into vacant habitat following an epidemic among local red squirrels. Whatever the true ecological relationship between red and grey squirrel, the human species has for many years been waging war on the unfortunate invader. Human nature is such that, the moment we label a species as a “pest”, the welfare of individual animals is often ignored.  The grey squirrel is not so different from the red. How would we feel if we were to trap, poison and shoot the red squirrel? Greys did not come over here of their own accord and did not ask to be introduced. Neither do they have any control over the pox that they carry. They do what they do; which is to be grey squirrels. In response, what we do, is kill them by the tens of thousands, year after year. The killing is “humane” – but how free of pain and suffering is it for the squirrels? We poison them. We trap them. We shoot them. We bludgeon them to death. How many dead greys is a live red worth? The success of this sustained massacre is debatable. Nobody seriously believes that the grey squirrel could be exterminated in the UK. A report by Stephen Harris and colleagues at the University of Bristol concluded that culling greys to save reds is neither viable nor economic. Harris has instead suggested that we should move the reds to protected islands and let nature take its course on the mainland. We could save ourselves a lot of time, money and effort by not persecuting grey squirrels. I don’t want Britain to lose its native red squirrel. But neither do I take any joy from the thought of the tens of thousands of culled grey squirrels and the infinite number that we will have to kill if current plans are to continue in perpetuity.  We need to show a bit more respect to this highly successful species and there are alternative options to culling. We could start by managing forests to favour conifers (which reds prefer) over deciduous trees (the grey’s favourite). The resurgence of the native pine marten could also swing the balance in favour of reds over greys. A conservation success story in itself, these ferret-like predators were recently spotted in England for the first time in more than a century. In areas of Ireland where pine martens are thriving, grey squirrels have almost disappeared, allowing reds to reestablish themselves. The occurrence of pox-resistance within some red squirrel populations is also a reason for hope for red over grey. Last but not least is the development of an oral contraceptive for grey squirrels together with plans to bait them using Nutella. Some would describe the grey squirrel as criminal. Others would describe the way they are treated by humans as criminal. Ultimately, we don’t necessarily need to kill to conserve."
"A majority of the UK public and almost half of Conservative voters support a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle the climate crisis, a poll suggests. YouGov found that 56% of people back the total decarbonisation of the UK economy by 2030 and just under half support public spending to make large swathes of public transport free to use.  The findings appear to highlight a growing awareness of the scale of the climate crisis and the increasingly radical policy solutions the public is willing to support. Last week a separate survey found that the climate emergency would influence how most people vote, with almost two-thirds agreeing it was the biggest issue facing humankind. The new poll, commissioned by Green New Deal UK, a non-party-aligned campaign group, found that 47% of Conservative voters back a zero-emissions target by 2030, compared with just 16% who support the government’s current aim of reaching that point by 2050. Labour wants the UK to hit zero carbon by 2030 as part of its Green Industrial Revolution agenda, the Green party also has a target date of 2030, and the Liberal Democrats have set a target of 2045. Aliya Yule, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, which campaigned for Labour to adopt the 2030 target, said the polling showed next month’s vote was becoming the UK’s first “climate election”. “The figures demonstrate the huge public appetite for rapid and radical government action on climate change,” he said. Yule said only Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution plans – which aim to tie radical action on the environment to huge job creation and housing upgrade schemes – would address the scale of the crisis. “Not even Conservative voters support the Tories’ net zero 2050 target. They have no credibility on climate change, not even with their own supporters,” he added. “A target date of 2030 has been Green party policy for years,” said a Green party spokesperson. “The fact that the majority of people now support it shows how much concern about the climate emergency is accelerating, and how little support there is for the government’s policy of setting targets for mid-century and using that as an excuse to take very little action to achieve them.” This week student and pensioner groups called on the leaders of all the main parties to take part in a televised leaders’ debate on the climate. All agreed except for Boris Johnson, who did not respond. Noga Levy-Rapoport, a participant in the youth climate strikes, said: “This general election is our last chance to face up to the climate crisis. The public clearly support the most ambitious targets to decarbonise. “Parties should respond in kind by offering a Green New Deal which rapidly reduces emissions while improving living standards and expanding services like free bus travel.” "
"The UK imports around 6% of its electricity through undersea cables linking it to the European mainland. These links help Britain deal with the ebbs and flows of renewable energy generation, and give the country a “safety net” in case things go wrong. Europe’s electricity network shows just how interconnected nation states are these days, and energy offers many insights into wider issues raised by the EU referendum. The first is that national sovereignty – if that means the ability of a nation state to promote its best interests – is not necessarily best achieved at a purely national level. The UK has had lots of influence on the EU’s energy policy over the years, on everything from liberalising EU energy markets to the more recent push to ditch fossil fuels for renewables. On these and other issues, the UK has led and other member states have followed. British sovereignty in respect of energy and climate change policy has been expanded, not diminished, by its EU membership. Sovereignty doesn’t necessarily imply democracy, of course. Yet people sometimes call the EU “undemocratic” without having the first idea of how it operates. Don’t forget that all European legislation is debated and approved, unanimously or by majority vote, by elected representatives from each member country. The European parliament, elected by proportional representation, is rather more democratically representative than the UK parliament, in which a party with only 37% of the popular vote has an absolute majority of seats. This means directives on renewables or energy efficiency have been agreed by British politicians in discussion with their counterparts from all other member states. They’re not “imposed” by “Brussels”, as such legislation is so often described. At the same time, checks and balances ensure that the EC does not over-reach itself, and national governments get to decide how most European legislation is actually implemented in their countries. Therefore it’s up to the UK how it chooses to keep the lights on while reducing its carbon emissions – not the EU. With member states moving in broadly the same direction on renewables and energy efficiency, the markets for new technologies are larger. The EU harnesses these economies of scale so that products are cheaper, which benefits both Europe’s consumers and exporters. This is the point of the single internal market. This effect is especially important in the energy sector. Energy, and especially electricity, flows through networks that need to be regulated and balanced by complex technical and institutional arrangements. If a power plant suddenly goes down, for example, or a still, overcast day prevents wind and solar generation, then electricity can still be wired in from a neighbouring nation. Most people won’t even notice any disruption.  Under the EU’s Energy Union proposals, the UK is having its interconnection to other European countries substantially strengthened, with new cables to France, Denmark, Belgium, Norway and Iceland either agreed or mooted. Such new interconnectors would be possible if the UK was outside the EU and its Energy Union, of course, but they would be a much lower priority for the EU and would almost certainly be substantially more expensive. The conclusions from the available evidence are clear. Inside the EU, the UK will have considerable influence over how the continent cuts its carbon emissions and adopts radical new renewable technology. Britain’s energy system will be well-integrated into that of the mainland, delivering benefits from economies of scale and common standards, while ensuring a secure and stable supply of electricity. Outside the EU the UK will either exist in an energy isolation that is both more expensive and less secure than being part of the internal energy market, or it will be a second-tier member of that market, bound to accept the rules made by EU members but having no influence over how they are agreed. The paradox is that inside the EU the UK will be more sovereign, in the sense of having more control over its energy future, and part of a wider democracy, with an energy system that is more secure and delivers energy at lower cost, than if the UK sought to control energy developments by itself. Such paradoxes in today’s globally interconnected world are not uncommon."
"If you hear a bird singing in the spring, you might assume it’s calling to a potential mate in the hope of producing offspring. But in parts of the UK, birdsong could be helping to mask the fact that the populations of certain species are in sharp decline. Our research into willow warblers has found that, in a growing number of locations, many males are failing to attract a mate – with significant consequences for the species. Using data from surveys of willow warbler populations across the UK, we found that the male-to-female ratio has changed from about 50:50 in 1994 to about 60:40 in 2012. But we also found this male bias was greater in small populations of birds, which are particularly common in the agriculture-dominated regions of south-east Britain. This suggests that the fragmented patches of remaining habitat in these areas can attract male but not female warblers. This skews the national populations and shrinks these small populations further because not enough females means fewer offspring. The fact that male birds sing makes them much easier to count than females, so when scientists want to measure wild bird populations they usually count the singing males and use that to estimate the total. However, this doesn’t give us a clear picture of the ratio between males and females in a specific location, especially as unpaired males often sing for longer than paired males during the breeding season. Capturing birds in mist nets (very fine nylon nets that are virtually invisible) can give more accurate estimates of numbers of males and females. Across the UK, citizen scientists catch, ring and recapture birds as part of the British Trust for Ornithology Constant Effort Sites Scheme. Capturing and recapturing ringed males and females allows us to calculate sex ratios and survival rates. To do this, we have to take into account the fact that we’re more likely to capture males during the breeding season because of the way they move around and spend less time at the nest than females. Together with our colleagues Rob Robinson and Jacquie Clark, we studied this British Trust for Ornithology data about captured and recaptured willow warblers to produce a more accurate picture of sex ratios. We found that male-bias is more common in areas with small populations, which are now widespread across much of southern and eastern England. This could be because females have lower annual survival rates than males. But the difference between these survival rates wasn’t consistently greater in the male-dominated populations. And survival rates of males and females have not changed over the period in which male bias has become more common.  If females are less common in small populations, despite being no more likely to die, this suggests that they must be less likely to join these small populations. Most breeding birds return to the same breeding sites each year, and males often breed close to the area in which they were hatched. But females are more likely to disperse and select a breeding location elsewhere. Our findings suggest that females are more likely to choose busier breeding locations where the abundance of willow warblers is higher and the habitat is likely to be of a better quality. If females are more attracted to sites where there are more willow warblers in the first place, then to tackle the declining national population we should focus on creating and maintaining habitats that can support large numbers of birds. While small patches of habitat might be enough for a male to set up a territory, females looking for a mate find these conditions less attractive. And they may simply be less likely to encounter sparsely distributed lone males."

"Edward Platt travels around Britain in search of the kind of apocalyptic deluge that increasingly swamps the country’s urban and rural landscapes. He is most interested in what people’s accounts of flooding, and his own first-hand observations of wading through sodden fields and streets, can tell him about the experience of such calamity. He writes that he’s “less preoccupied with the point the water reached or the rate at which it went down than with the emotional and psychological marks it left behind”. How we visualise climate catastrophe tends toward the epic, the exotic. We seek to dramatise it through faraway scenes of the Romantic sublime gone awry: the polar ice collapsing from a glacier, the monstrous tsunami hitting a shore on the other side of the world. Platt instead locates its effects in the everyday: the flooding experienced by England’s picture postcard towns and occasionally decrepit coastal settlements. He shows how these places are turned upside down by torrents of raging water, as rivers, streams and culverts strain and break under the pressure of extreme rainfall, or sea walls and floodgates give way, and how the flood is merely the starting point for months and often years of misery as houses are dried out, refurbished – and, frequently, soon deluged again. The Great Flood makes the global local in the same way that the climate emergency does.  Platt’s trip takes place during the extreme floods of the winter of 2013-14, the wettest on record in the south of England, and provides him with plenty of opportunities for waterlogged reportage: in one village in the Somerset Levels he accepts a lift in a canoe along the flooded main road to get to his car. His journey takes him to houses that have been modified to stand a couple of feet above ground level, and coastal shacks sitting in the shadow of sea walls. He arrives at some destinations in the midst of their inundation, finding them spookily empty except for the odd hardy, or foolhardy, soul. In Easton Bavents, a hamlet on the edge of Southwold, Suffolk, Platt meets Peter Boggis, “the King Canute of East Anglia”. His clifftop land had been so severely eroded by the sea – the 340 acres bought by his family in 1924 had been worn down to 160 acres by 2002 – that he constructed his own coastal defences from rubble, building a road to the cliff’s edge along which a convoy of lorries travelled. While some locals were irritated by the heavy traffic, others admired him as “a hero of an inimitably English kind”, Platt writes: “self-reliant, inventive, dismissive of bureaucratic procedure, and, above all, eager for his day in court”. The crossover between the geography of The Great Flood and the so-called “left behind” fringe places of Britain is striking. Although for the most part Platt visits these locations in the years before the EU referendum, Brexit seems foreshadowed in the feelings of people who have experienced the misery of flooding: of being ignored by the authorities, of having to get by on their own. Frequently, the Environmental Agency is mentioned as a focus of people’s anger – a faceless, omnipotent bureaucracy on which every failure can be pinned. To his credit, Platt is neither fully dismissive nor wholly credulous of this position, and instead considers the tenor of his interviewees’ complaints late in the book as he stands outside the agency’s office near Millbank in London. This section is an exemplary piece of Brexit-era autocritique in which the author tries to gauge how much his own London-centric privilege might have shaped his attitudes. “I had become so accustomed to the view from the centre that I had forgotten the purpose of my trips, which was to try to capture life in the marginal places that were prone to flood. (One of his chosen towns is Jaywick in Essex, one of the poorest places in England. It is surrounded by a sea wall that, when flooded, has filled up like a saucer. It lies within Brexiter Douglas Carswell’s constituency.) Like any good psychogeographer, Platt is drawn to the mythical dimensions of the places he visits. He becomes particularly interested in stories of sunken cities, especially those supposedly inundated as a result of someone maliciously or accidentally opening a floodgate. He finds that these myths persist in the explanations people provide for severe flooding: a nonexistent floodgate opened by an uncaring bureaucracy – rarely an individual – upstream, or a reservoir venting excess water. Musing on the metaphorical dimensions of “opening the floodgates”, Platt considers how the phrase resonates with people in the era of mass migration. (How many times did we hear variations of this metaphor during the Brexit campaign?) He shrewdly incorporates the crude moments of hostility and prejudice he overhears that speak of a deeper malaise. Even in the smallest, ostensibly deserted village he encounters someone who’ll insist that it’s “crowded”. An official he meets at a pumping station tells him he’s there to stop “pikies” stealing diesel. In the aftermath of a flood in Boston, Lincolnshire, a woman tells him of a joke doing the rounds: that the town “had finally drowned under its weight of immigrants”. Platt’s writing combines sharp reportage with a poet’s eye for a striking image that vividly captures the otherworldly, waterlogged landscapes he travels through. He finds houses transformed by their inundation into “mouldering palazzos beside a still canal”. What if “flooding was not an aberration, but the restoration of the natural order of things”, he wonders. “The stories we have always told ourselves” aren’t relevant any more, he concludes, bracingly. “When it comes to climate change, we are all to blame.” • The Great Flood is published by Picador (£16.99).

"Everton Football Club announced a milestone step towards moving from its historic Goodison Park home to a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock in Liverpool. When I saw this news my initial reaction was one of surprise. As a researcher in sustainable business models, surely spending £300m on a waterfront stadium is a significant risk in terms of sea level rise? On paper, this is a fantastic opportunity for both the club and the city. For Everton it’s an opportunity to move to a large modern stadium befitting of a club which, under major shareholder Farhad Moshiri, has ambitions to become a leading footballing power. For the city of Liverpool, the development is a vital part of its regeneration programme, adding to its already UNESCO World Heritage-rated waterfront. The exact implications of climate change for sea level rise are complex. There are simply too many variables. We don’t yet know whether the Paris Agreement is achievable, which means we don’t know how much the planet will warm by, let alone the precise consequences for sea level. But we have some good ideas. Recent research has shown that by the year 2100 sea levels could rise by two metres. That is only 83 years into the proposed stadium’s 200-year lease. And the Surging Seas website, which maps out scientific predictions of sea level rise, shows that 2℃ climate change would inundate the Liverpool docklands in the next 200 years or so. The worst case scenario is even more worrying. Researchers at Liverpool John Moores University looked at what would happen if the sea were to rise seven metres, the same level as it was the last time the Earth was 1.5℃ hotter, and found much of the city would disappear under water. Of course, this won’t happen any time soon and few businesses are required to think in such long terms. New buildings are generally not designed to last for centuries, partly because it’s rare for a firm to last that long. This is one of the reasons why climate change is such a complex challenge for society – it simply does not comply with the time-frames of political or corporate shareholder decision-making.  But football clubs are different. Everton was founded in 1878 and has been at its current home of Goodison Park for 125 years. It will still be around to see 2℃ warming and beyond. Although increasingly operated like businesses, football clubs remain institutions that are deeply important to many communities. For millions of people they are “the most important of the less important things”. Football clubs owe it to these people to think in the longer term.  Such thinking is starting to seep into the game. The popular book Soccernomics, for example, argues that a long-term footballing philosophy that underpins a club’s direction on the pitch, can prevent short-termism associated with changing managers every couple of years (something that politics too could benefit from). A truly responsible football club should embrace the challenge of overcoming climate change. They could start by recognising their own role, for instance the significant transport emissions of people travelling to matches. I have conducted research in the past in which I benchmarked the environmental initiatives conducted by football clubs outside of the Premier League. While I found many clubs had carbon reduction initiatives typical of those found by leading “brands” in other industries, the majority had some way to go. Considering most football clubs are effectively small and medium-sized enterprises, with few resources, this is perhaps to be expected. But it’s a missed opportunity. These clubs have the ability to engage with their communities on levels beyond that of perhaps even government or religion. They are already striving to do so on issues such as racism and homophobia. They should begin to highlight the climate change challenge too. Doing so could go a long way to justifying the increasing cost of following football, and could make a real difference in terms of our ability to mitigate the impacts of global warming. Everton hasn’t won a trophy since 1995. The club’s fans, desperate for success, could be forgiven if they don’t let the far off implications of climate change deter them from supporting a state of the art new stadium. But whether they will look on this development so favourably in the coming decades remains to be seen. One can only hope the developers of this new stadium have undertaken a full climate change risk assessment – or have stocked up on sandbags."
"Carbon dioxide concentrations are heading towards values not seen in the past 200m years. The sun has also been gradually getting stronger over time. Put together, these facts mean the climate may be heading towards warmth not seen in the past half a billion years. A lot has happened on Earth since 500,000,000BC – continents, oceans and mountain ranges have come and gone, and complex life has evolved and moved from the oceans onto the land and into the air. Most of these changes occur on very long timescales of millions of years or more. However, over the past 150 years global temperatures have increased by about 1℃, ice caps and glaciers have retreated, polar sea-ice has melted, and sea levels have risen.  Some will point out that Earth’s climate has undergone similar changes before. So what’s the big deal? Scientists can seek to understand past climates by looking at the evidence locked away in rocks, sediments and fossils. What this tells us is that yes, the climate has changed in the past, but the current speed of change is highly unusual. For instance, carbon dioxide hasn’t been added to the atmosphere as rapidly as today for at least the past 66m years.  In fact, if we continue on our current path and exploit all convention fossil fuels, then as well as the rate of CO₂ emissions, the absolute climate warming is also likely to be unprecedented in at least the past 420m years. That’s according to a new study we have published in Nature Communications. In terms of geological time, 1℃ of global warming isn’t particularly unusual. For much of its history the planet was significantly warmer than today, and in fact more often than not Earth was in what is termed a “greenhouse” climate state. During the last greenhouse state 50m years ago, global average temperatures were 10-15℃ warmer than today, the polar regions were ice-free, palm trees grew on the coast of Antarctica, and alligators and turtles wallowed in swamp-forests in what is now the frozen Canadian Arctic.  In contrast, despite our current warming, we are still technically in an “icehouse” climate state, which simply means there is ice on both poles. The Earth has naturally cycled between these two climate states every 300m years or so. Just prior to the industrial revolution, for every million molecules in the atmosphere, about 280 of them were CO₂ molecules (280 parts-per-million, or ppm). Today, due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels, concentrations are about 400 ppm. In the absence of any efforts to curtail our emissions, burning of conventional fossil fuels will cause CO₂ concentrations to be around 2,000ppm by the year 2250.   This is of course a lot of CO₂, but the geological record tells us that the Earth has experienced similar concentrations several times in the past. For instance, our new compilation of data shows that during the Triassic, around 200m years ago, when dinosaurs first evolved, Earth had a greenhouse climate state with atmospheric CO₂ around 2,000-3,000ppm.   So high concentrations of carbon dioxide don’t necessarily make the world totally uninhabitable. The dinosaurs thrived, after all.  That doesn’t mean this is no big deal, however. For a start, there is no doubt that humanity will face major socio-economic challenges dealing with the dramatic and rapid climate change that will result from the rapid rise to 2,000 or more ppm.  But our new study also shows that the same carbon concentrations will cause more warming in future than in previous periods of high carbon dioxide. This is because the Earth’s temperature does not just depend on the level of CO₂ (or other greenhouse gases) in the atmosphere. All our energy ultimately comes from the sun, and due to the way the sun generates energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, its brightness has increased over time. Four and a half billion years ago when the Earth was young the sun was around 30% less bright. So what really matters is the combined effect of the sun’s changing strength and the varying greenhouse effect. Looking through geological history we generally found that as the sun became stronger through time, atmospheric CO₂ gradually decreased, so both changes cancelled each other out on average.  But what about in the future? We found no past time period when the drivers of climate, or climate forcing, was as high as it will be in the future if we burn all the readily available fossil fuel. Nothing like it has been recorded in the rock record for at least 420m years.  A central pillar of geological science is the uniformitarian principle: that “the present is the key to the past”. If we carry on burning fossil fuels as we are at present, by 2250 this old adage is sadly no longer likely to be true. It is doubtful that this high-CO₂ future will have a counterpart, even in the vastness of the geological record."
"While street protests and riots in Barcelona continue to grab the headlines, deep in the woods of northern Catalonia another crisis is unfolding: a scarcity of wild mushrooms that is being blamed on climate change. Mushroom hunting is a serious and lucrative business in Catalonia when the autumn rains come and the precious fungi appear overnight on the damp woodland floor. But so far this season, mushrooms have been thin on the ground in Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain.  A 20-year study carried out by Sergio de Miguel Magaña and Juan Martínez de Aragón of the University of Lleida shows a decrease in the number of mushrooms throughout Catalonia. What mushrooms need to thrive is moisture and warm but not high temperatures, whereas the tendency in recent years has been towards dry autumns and, in 2017, a drought. Even one of the most common and popular species, the rovelló (Lactarius deliciosus) is scarce this year, pushing prices up to around €30 a kilo. While fungi are a victim of the climate crisis, their absence may also exacerbate it as they are involved in carbon capture through their symbiotic relationship with trees. According to the Catalan Technological Forestry Centre, in some parts of the Pyrenees the quantity of mushrooms has declined 100-fold compared with last year, and in the foothills there has been a sevenfold decrease. Wild mushrooms are a key ingredient of autumnal cuisine in northern Spain, and restaurants and markets depend almost entirely on individual mushroom hunters for their supplies. The lore of where to find the precious fungi is a well-guarded secret kept in families or small clubs of boletaires, as mushroom hunters are known in Catalonia. One retailer complained that this year “there are more boletaires than bolets [mushrooms]”. The climate crisis is also affecting the mushroom season in Galicia, in north-west Spain, often known as “green Spain” because of its traditionally high rainfall. A dry summer this year meant the mushroom season began a month later than normal, and the crop is down by 50% in some areas. “Climate change is having a really big effect,” said Fernando Ramos, of the mycological association in A Coruña. “The seasons aren’t as clearly defined as they used to be. We are seeing species in September that normally appear in late autumn, while some that usually appear in summer appear later and are few and very small because of the lack of rain.” In Mallorca, the temperature now is ideal for mushrooms but they are scarce because of a particularly dry summer. In desperation, some Mallorcans have taken to watering areas where mushrooms habitually appear."
"Most of us take it for granted that the taps in our homes will deliver safe and clean water for drinking, cooking, showering and cleaning. This means there is usually little interest from the public in how the water gets there. However, it took less than a day for a story from Onoway, a small town in Alberta, Canada, with just over 1,000 residents, to make it from social media to global newsfeeds. “Bright pink water comes out of taps in Canada!” – suddenly we are all interested in water treatment methods. To enjoy the benefits of clear and safe water, a hidden but valuable infrastructure of water treatment exists in our cities and villages. These are operated and maintained by engineers and scientists, and among them are water chemists. These chemists have been investigating the use of neat chemical reactions to remove undesired chemicals and potential pathogens from naturally sourced water and to prepare the water for its safe journey through distribution systems.   The local drinking water treatment plant of Onoway treats its water using potassium permanganate. This is an almost black looking solid which forms a bright purple solution in water and also removes dissolved iron and another metal called manganese. Iron and manganese are not harmful to human health but if these metals are present at high concentrations it can lead to deposits in the water distribution system and discolouration of the water. However, the auburn tints of iron seem boring compared to the spectacular pink that has raised global interest and lively social media discussions. Customers are very sensitive to the colour, taste and odour of drinking water – these are the human senses used to assess water quality – so this incident has understandably caused alarm. The pink colour stems from some potassium permanganate that escaped through a failed valve and into the drinking water distribution system, eventually ending up with the customers.  Potassium permanganate has been used in drinking water treatment for more than 100 years. In addition to iron and manganese removal, it is used to remove taste and odour as well as to control undesired algal or mussel growth in treatment works. It also has disinfecting properties. Permanganate forms solid, black manganese dioxide when it reacts with the water contaminants – and this can then be filtered out of the water.  Potassium permanganate has the chemical structure KMnO4 and is a compound that is electron deficient – it doesn’t have enough electrons. This lack of electrons makes it a strong oxidant that readily reacts with a wide range of unwanted compounds in water. It belongs to an established group of water treatment chemicals that can be summarised under the term “conventional chemical oxidants”, which also include oxygen, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and, in the wider sense, UV light.  Water is typically treated with a dose of 1-3mg of potassium permanganate per litre of water, which is quite a small amount. But only unreacted potassium permanganate has a visible pink colour in water and is visible even at very low concentrations – as low as 0.05 mg per litre of water – so it doesn’t take much to add colour.  Since only small quantities of permanganate can change the colour of water, customer complaints relating to residual permanganate are known to occur . This means treatment works usually take care to remove any unreacted, coloured permanganate before the water reaches consumers.  The pink water does not pose a threat to human health but skin irritation related to potassium permanganate is known at a certain concentration. Onoway’s mayor claimed that customers were not at risk, however these concentrations seemed to vary – some had water merely tinted pink whereas some water was bright purple. Regardless of what shade of pink they receive, customers are advised to rely on alternative drinking water sources until the permanganate is flushed out of the distribution system.       For water treatment, there is no one-size fits all approach. Drinking water treatment processes vary due to different local water resources and what the traditional and established technologies are. Iron and manganese can be removed by alternative methods, such as aeration, which uses the oxygen present in the air, or by running the water over catalytic granules consisting of manganese dioxide. But every method has its specific advantages and disadvantages.  Many parameters need to be evaluated before making an informed decision on which method to use to treat a water supply – but there’s no doubt that potassium permanganate is one of the more colourful methods."

By Ed Caryl
I am constantly struck by the extremes that the alarmists will reach attempting to convince the rest of us that we should abandon our comfortable life-styles and live in fuel poverty, burning our corn in our cars, eschewing all use of fuels that have accumulated in the ground over the eons, reaching into the winds to catch a few watts from the occasional breezes at the cost of beating to death random vistas, bats and birds, and paving our deserts and rooftops with silicon to capture a few hours of sun on the off chance it shines.
These efforts are awfully inefficient, and incredibly costly for the achieved results. Especially when the achieved result is exactly nothing. Of course, the money spent, and made by your friends, is always someone else’s, so that doesn’t count.
All this is done in supposed fear that adding a few parts per million to the carbon dioxide already in the air will somehow, in some yet to be explained way, turn our planet into another Venus. Never mind the fact that at several points in our planets history, including in the beginning, carbon dioxide was many times more prevalent than it is today, and no disaster happened, as we know because we are here. We know that carbon dioxide was a major part of the early atmosphere because of the mountains of carbonate rocks all around us, and the deep layers of carbonate rocks beneath us in vast areas of the world. Life uses CO2. Life uses it up.
Why the continuous negativity? Rejoice! Abundance surrounds us! More CO2 in the atmosphere fertilizes our crops, as those crops labor to use it up. On a warm, windless afternoon in a cornfield, photosynthesis slows because all the available CO2 gets consumed. If there is more of it in the beginning, this doesn’t happen. In a closed greenhouse, CO2 must be added to the air or growth slows as it is used up. If extra CO2 is added, growth is faster than in an open field, a lot faster. Defining CO2 as a pollutant is the worst kind of lie.
Does CO2 make it warmer? The first 200 parts per million does, but so does water vapor, and this is a water world, not a CO2 world. We really don’t have much CO2 in the atmosphere. By geological-historical standards, the atmosphere right now is in fact close to record lows. During ice ages, the amount of CO2 drops to the point that grasses outcompete trees in the tropics, and rain forests dwindle to remnant islands in vast savannas. This happens when the concentration drops below 250 parts per million as the cooling oceans take it up. Life likes more CO2. Life returns in abundance as the oceans warm and release the CO2 they took up when it was cold. If there is more CO2, plants can close the vents that let it in (stomata) and can conserve moisture, letting less water out. Life isn’t poisoned by CO2 until the concentration reaches the point where oxygen can’t be traded for it. This doesn’t happen until the CO2 concentration is 25 times what it is now. No, CO2 is not a pollutant.
Will more CO2 make it warmer? When it is from fuel used to heat our houses and cook our food, yes, but inside our houses. Outside? No one knows how much. Really! No one truly knows. Yet billions, verily, trillions of dollars and euros, will be wasted on the fear that extra CO2 will make it hotter outside in some catastrophic way. As I sit here writing this, with a fire in the fireplace, looking at the snow in the back yard, watching a squirrel feasting on sunflower seeds, I don’t think the squirrel knows either, and doesn’t care. In the Pleistocene and Holocene, man worried about staying warm. He should continue that practice in the Anthropocene.
Stay warm. Have a great Christmas and a Happy New Year. And stop worrying about an insignificant trace gas in our atmosphere!

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhy The Hiatus?
By Ed Caryl
One of the climatologist’s explanations for the 17-year hiatus in global warming is the effect of aerosols. This explanation seems weak for the simple reason that we don’t see aerosols in this time period.
We do see the impact of aerosols from volcanic activity in previous periods, however. Here is the satellite view of monthly global temperature since 1979, along with the El Niño index and atmospheric transmission from the Mauna Loa atmospheric observatory.

Figure 1 is RSS Global TLT, El Niño 3.4 index, and atmospheric transmission.
Atmospheric transmission is the ratio of direct solar radiation from the near UV to infrared wavelengths (0.3 microns to 2.8 microns) that makes it through the atmosphere. www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/mloapt.html.
Two volcanic eruptions CAUSED significant stratospheric haze from sulpher dioxide (SO2) injected into the stratosphere,
El Chichon in 1982 and Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. Both caused significant solar energy obstruction for four years or more. Here are pictures of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 on the left, and of the resulting stratospheric haze in August 1991 on the right, taken from the Space Shuttle.

Figure 2 is (on the left) Mt Pinatubo in eruption, and (on the right) the earth’s limb showing the stratospheric haze, the purple line across the middle, above the cumulonimbus clouds. Source here.
The 34-year satellite observation era can be split into two halves, the 17 years before the El Niño of 1998, and the 17 years since, including the El Niño. During the first 17 years there were 2 significant volcanic eruptions and three El Niños. Two of those El Niños occurred after eruptions, but during the periods where SO2 haze was present. The SO2 hazes prevented any temperature increase, and in fact produced cooling for nearly four years in each case. Despite that, during the 17 years, temperatures increased by 0.12°C, 0.072°C/decade.
Look closely at the temperature pattern associated with El Niños. Each El Niño produces a global temperature spike a few months later, followed by a cooling rebound that is as about as negative as the El Niño is positive, and lasts as long. But there is one exception. There was a small El Niño in 1995 for which there was no negative rebound as it was followed by the super-El Niño of  1998. These produced a step in temperature of about a quarter of a degree.
Most of the warming in the years from 1979 to 1997 are in that two-year period from the El Niño of 1995 to 1997. We are now in a slow cooling from that step, thus the hiatus in temperature. There is very little temperature trend since the end of the Pinatubo eruption haze in 1995 as the result of aerosols. With the exception of two very short volcanic events, atmospheric transmission as measured at Mauna Loa was almost flat at around 93% for that whole period.

Figure 3 is a magnified view of atmospheric transmission pre- and post-1997 with trend lines.
The two minor volcanic events were Shishaldin volcano in the Aleutian island arc of Alaska, producing an ash cloud to at least 45,000 feet in the stratosphere on April 19, 1999, and on March 22, 2009, Mount Redoubt volcano, 106 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, began a series of eruptions with the ash plume reaching 60,000 feet in the stratosphere during two of the six significant eruptions. Neither of these eruptions produced very much SO2, and the ash fell out of the stratosphere in less than a month, the resolution of the above plot.
If the very significant solar obscuration due to El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo pre-1995 resulted in warming, there is no way that the dearth of activity in the post-1995 period could have produced the observed lack of warming. But, the 0.25°C step in warming in the period from 1995 to after 1998 can be explained by the lack of volcanic activity in the later period. The average atmospheric transmission in the first period is about 1.5% less than in the second period. Allowing for average albedo, that is about 2.5 Watts/m2 difference in average solar radiation at the earth’s surface. This, plus the two El Niños in 1995 and 1998, explains the step in warming. This also means that the climate sensitivity, Lambda is very low.
Delta T = lambda * delta F, T is temperature in degrees C, F is the forcing in Watts/m2.
Lambda = delta T/delta F = 0.25°C/2.5 Watts/m2 = 0.1°C/Watt/m2.
This figure has some caveats, the temperature measurement is from the global satellite (RSS) temperature data, and the atmospheric transmission data is from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, which was on the edge of the SO2 plumes from Pinatubo, so it should be viewed as an approximation.
But it agrees with what Willis Eschenbach found yesterday for tropical regions, here. The Pinatubo eruption was the larger of the two eruptions and had the largest impact, but it was limited to tropical latitudes where lambda is low or negative.

Figure 4 is an optical depth plot of the Pinatubo SO2 plume three weeks after the eruption. Source here.
The lack of warming for the last 17 years cannot be due to an increase in aerosols, as there was no significant increase.
The hiatus in warming, with little volcanic activity to provide cooling, with the peak reached in the AMO, solar activity declining, increasing sea ice, sea temperatures hitting the limit, and the very low climate sensitivity measured above, all indicate that we have reached the peak global temperature in this cycle. It will get no warmer. It may never get warmer. The thermostat is open.

"In Down the Mighty River with Steve Backshall, the adventurer and naturalist took a journey through New Guinea, the world’s second largest island. As he travelled along the Baliem River, through some of the densest jungle on the planet, Backshall visited the Dani people, which the BBC described as an “ancient tribe”. I spent two years living with groups not far from the Dani, and was disappointed to hear this sort of language still being used. This distorted perspective perpetuates the myth of the “living fossil” or the “backwards tribe”.  After all, what exactly is an “ancient tribe”? Surely, by definition, an ancient tribe is either really, really old, or really, really dead. The Dani are neither. Nor are they “backward”. The 25,000 or so Dani people scattered across the Baliem Valley are very much alive and well, prospering in a challenging region despite being faced with land dispossession from mining, military control from Indonesia, and the occasional film crew from “the West”.  Indeed, the Dani have featured in several TV and film documentaries over the years. The first of these, Dead Birds, made in the early 1960s by anthropologist-filmmaker Robert Gardner, followed two males as they went about their everyday business. Back then, the Dani were a model of “tribal culture” representing what was fast becoming an elusive example of “stone-age man”. They used stone tools, practised gift exchange and fought over territory.  Such practices were typical across the island of New Guinea, particularly in the vast central highlands. Over 50,000 years of habitation, this almost impenetrable rainforest proved the ideal environment for developing permanent agriculture, complete with drainage canals. The Dani themselves were only first “discovered” in 1938 when, completely by chance, a pilot flying overhead spotted their cultivated fields. But they had long been part of a complex social network of exchange and interaction that reached across the island. Even the government patrols and prospectors that once infested New Guinea were restricted to more accessible coastal regions, so the island’s rural inhabitants continued farming, trading and intermarrying across huge distances.      By the time of “discovery”, the indigenous population had, politically, already been divided in two. In 1828, European colonisers separated New Guinea in half, right down the 141st meridian. By 1963 the western half was formally annexed to Indonesia, while the east became formally detached from Australia in 1975 to form the independent state of Papua New Guinea.  The Dani people are therefore governed ultimately from the Indonesian capital Jakarta, some 3,500km away, while an international border separates them from their kin in Papua New Guinea. These culturally and historically-linked groups have been fighting ever since to release West Papua from Indonesia. The region’s cultural complexity has made it an ideal location for anthropologists, and my own work has taken me to the Kutubu and Ok Tedi regions in Papua New Guinea. In Ok Tedi, which lies just the other side of the 141st meridian, my friends and hosts were very similar to the Dani people that Backshall met. Like the Dani, they value the sal kambun (penis gourd) and bul bul (grass skirts) as symbols of identity, and they value the stone axe for its practical ability to outlive and outperform the modern alternatives sent to replace it – steel axes and knives.  The ritual amputation of digits is common across the island. As anthropologist Karl Heider recalls in his ethnographic examination of the Dani, close female relatives of males killed in warfare (not those who die from “natural” causes) “have their fingers chopped off”. This is not unique to the Dani; in fact digit/hand amputation was not unusual among men and women across the highland region before missionary intervention.   In one of his most memorable scenes, Backshall was invited to sleep alongside the smoke-dried remains of a legendary village elder. Such mummification is actually quite rare across the highlands, even among the Dani, who according to Heider cremate the dead in a detailed and lengthy series of funerary rites. The practice is typically associated with the Anga language group in Papua New Guinea and likely spread eastwards to the Dani. In recent years, the Dani have been affected by mining, tourism and ongoing attempts to “Indonesianise” their highland culture. But perhaps the biggest threat of all comes from the military presence representing Indonesian interests in a resource-rich land with what they see as a “backwards” culture. Like the colonialists who described the vast area of internal New Guinea as “uninhabited”, government bodies and multinationals still view rural landscapes as Terra nullius, “no-one’s land”. The illusion of “no-one’s land” and “the ancient tribe” is not helpful to the amazing people who live there. My friends in Ok Tedi and Kutubu are artists, school teachers, academics, gardeners, widows, businessmen and businesswomen. And yet, everything they do remains tightly entwined by a rich, resilient and dynamic culture."

=============================
There are lots of accusations flying about concerning the PRP journal controversy. What’s disturbing is that the whole thing seems to be on the verge of devolving into mob rule. So far there have been only accusations and mudslinging. There has been no formal investigation or due process to get to the bottom of the matter.
The law of civilization tells us that the accused are to entitled to a fair hearing before the stones get cast. There’s something out there called due process, the presumption of innocence, and allowing the accused to present a defence in an objective forum. Last I checked, most everyone was damned glad to have it.
I’M NOT PICKING SIDES HERE. My sole interest is to see to it that the accused are at least given a fair chance to present their case.
Unfortunately climate science does not operate like the other fields of science. It’s a mess and stinking-rotten to the core. Can it be that some potentially valuable, groundbreaking science gets dismissed outright because MAYBE its authors did not properly go through what has long become the climate science circus tent called peer-review?
Nicola Scafetta has asked me to publish his case here and I ask those holding the noose to first hear it out before tightening it one last time.
==============================
Before putting the noose on, could we at least get a trial?
Nicola Scarfetta
Here I would like to briefly add some comments to my previous post and also respond to two blogs articles authored by Anthony Watts on WUWT following the suppression of Pattern Recognition in Physics by the publisher, Dr. Martin Rasmussen:
1) The ‘planetary tidal influence on climate’ fiasco: strong armed science tactics are overkill, due process would work better
2) The Copernicus-PRP fiasco: predictable and preventable
I found both posts by Anthony highly misleading and subtly malicious. I would like to address the two major points here:
1) In the first post Anthony insinuated the journal was stopped because of the topic of our special issue (the planetary theory of solar and climate variation). Anthony titled his post: “The ‘planetary tidal influence on climate’ fiasco”. However, the “planetary theory” did not play any role in the decision of Rasmussen.
In fact, in a letter sent to Mörner, the accused editor of the journal, Rasmussen wrote: “While processing the press release for the special issue ‘Pattern in solar variability, their planetary origin and terrestrial impacts’, we read through the general conclusions paper published on 16 Dec 2013. We were alarmed by the authors’ second implication stating: ‘This sheds serious doubts on the issue of a continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC project’.” In the official version published on the PRP web-site, Rasmussen wrote: “Recently a special issue was compiled titled ‘Pattern in solar variability, their planetary origin and terrestrial impacts’.” Besides papers dealing with the observed patterns in the heliosphere, the special issue editors ultimately submitted their conclusions in which they doubted “the continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC project” (Pattern Recogn. Phys., 1, 205–206, 2013).
Thus, it is evident that Rasmussen was not disturbed at all by the astronomical aspect of our study, as Anthony Watts insinuated in his first post, which was the primary topic of our works. By his own words, Rasmussen was “alarmed” only and exclusively by a single secondary statement in our Conclusion paper (a 2-page article) where the global surface temperature projections of the IPCC for the 21st century were questioned based on our analysis. That single statement was evidently interpreted by Rasmussen as a kind of “heresy” that required the instantaneous “burning” of the entire journal without even first inquiring with the accused editors.
Very likely Rasmussen overreacted because he ignores similar questioning of the IPCC temperature projections that have recently appeared in numerous scientific papers. Indeed from his statement there is no evidence that he has read any of the papers of the special issue where one finds the arguments which the statement in the Conclusion is based on, and which is supported by numerous references to other works already published in the scientific literature.
In fact, the IPCC models have predicted a 2oC/century warming from 2000 to 2014. But this warming never materialized. The scientific community is currently wondering about the causes of the large discrepancy between the climate models and the data. A possibility that we put forth in the special issue is that solar-astronomical effects and natural cyclical variability are currently underestimated by the IPCC models and, because for the next decades the sun is projected to experience low activity, this will likely slow down the warming. When one reads the papers of the special issue, he sees that they shed serious doubts on the issue of a continued or accelerated warming that is claimed by the IPCC project, and would also easily realize that the concept is perfectly consistent with the current scientific knowledge. Rasmussen’s “alarm” is incomprehensible.
Also an article on BBC, Has the Sun gone to sleep?, published on January 17, 2014 supports our conclusion that projected low solar activity would imply colder weather for the imminent future. But Rasmussen evidently did not know anything about this recent research and misinterpreted the meaning of our research by taking a sentence out of context.
Going back to Anthony Watts’ first blog, it seems to me Anthony, who is a notorious skeptic of the planetary theory discussed in our special session, took advantage of this unfortunate situation in order to discredit the planetary theory, as Rasmussen clearly stated he had been “alarmed” not by the planetary theory, but by some secondary climatic implication of doubting IPCC temperature projections. Ironically, Anthony fully agrees that the IPCC projections are significantly overestimated but he is apparently very allergic to the fact that the physical explanation might be found in astronomical causes.

In his second post, Anthony switched the focus of his attack against the authors and editors of the special issue. Here the claimed offence was deduced from an accusation present in Rasmussen’s statement declaring that: “In addition, the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis, which we regard as malpractice in scientific publishing and not in accordance with our publication ethics we expect to be followed by the editors.”
Rasmussen’s accusation is paradoxical for several reasons, and therefore invalid as I will demonstrate below. Firstly it was not present in the email sent to the editor, Dr. Mörner. In this email a weaker statement had been written: “we also received information about potential misconduct during the review process.”
Note the difference between the two statements. The statement written in the email to Mörner simply indicates a complaint over a “potential misconduct” that the publisher received from somebody. Here it would be interesting to know who complained – an IPCC AGW advocate with conflict of interest against our theories? The sentence then reported in the official statement, on the contrary, is a definitive verdict of “guilty.”
Rasmussen found an editor “guilty” of a malpractice without first properly investigating the issue. In fact a proper inquiry requires asking the accused to respond to the accusations: a fact that did not occur because the editors were not informed of anything. This is a case of censorship that is even worse than what was suffered by Galileo and, ironically, Copernicus himself, whose works at least were subject to a trial before being put into the index of the forbidden books.
Rasmussen’s “guilty” verdict was based on the claim that “the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis”. The literal meaning of the accusation implies the editors selected as referees were “blood-relatives” of the authors. I suspect that Rasmussen would have hard time in demonstrating his claim in a court room. But let us interpret his accusation figuratively as meaning that the editor selected as referees people who fraudulently favored the authors.
Was the review process scientifically fraudulent? This is the very point that needs to be demonstrated. 
The obligation of an editor, as I understand it, is to select honest referees who can provide a professional scientific review of a paper to prevent that papers containing evident scientific flaws are published. An editor should avoid referees who are not expert in the topic and/or who could fraudulently favor or harm an author.
It is evident that simply selecting (as a referee) an expert in a scientific field who might happen to share a similar scientific interest or opinion of an author is not “nepotistic malpractice”. Would a paper advocating IPCC AGW being reviewed by a scientist who shares the same scientific view be considered “nepotistic malpractice” by Rasmussen? Moreover, for a special issue on a very narrow scientific topic, when an editor invites a restricted group of experts it may not be unusual to ask authors of other papers of the same issue to serve as referees of a paper of another author. This actually could improve the scientific quality of the special issue because authors would not want to publish their papers in special issues containing evidently flawed papers.
The problem that I have with Rasmussen’s “pal-review” accusation is that he did not demonstrate that the reviews of the papers of the special issue, as well as of the entire journal were fraudulent, (nor did he demonstrate that editors, referees and authors were blood-relative to each other). To prove the fraudulent claim he should have pointed out the existence of evident scientific errors present in all papers published by the journal so far. It is the presence of evident errors that would have demonstrated that those papers had received a poor and unprofessional review and that the editors were fraudulently trying to promote a personal ideology instead of advancing a specific field of science. But Rasmussen did not provide any evidence that the papers published in the journal contain evident erroneous claims. Rasmussen’s only “scientific” argument against our work was his erroneous claim that the IPCC temperature projections for the 21st century are valid beyond doubt and, therefore, those who questions that claim should be ignored and treated as anti-scientists. To “distance” himself from these scientists he closed the journal.
Rasmussen’s argument is not only offensive, but also absurd and hollow. Thus his accusations are groundless and based on a prejudice. He evidently rushed to judgment in fear that our research could in some way displease the IPCC establishment. For the same reasons also the accusations of Anthony Watts at his blog are equally groundless and in large part based on prejudice. Many times on his blog he was asked to point to factual errors in the papers, but he could not find any and focused only on the “appearance” of the facts interpreted in a malevolent way.
I can only testify that my papers received very professional reviews from the reviewers and especially from the editor, Dr. Morner, who dedicated a lot of his time to this project by personally reviewing and editing my papers as best as he could and, I suppose, each paper of the collections. I am fully satisfied on how my papers have been handled.
Basically it appears that Rasmussen skipped trial and hastily rounded up a lynch mob, and some in the blogosphere appeared to have been quite happy to join in.
It is evident that our work will stand or fall based on its scientific validity.
I invite the readers to study our works and judge by themselves: http://www.pattern-recogn-phys.net/special_issue2.html.”
 
Comment from Nils-Axel Morner (e-mail to Tallbloke):
(1) We were alarmed by the authors’ second implication stating: ‘This sheds serious doubts on the issue of a continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC project’
So what? This is the direct inference of the 12 research papers (especially Papers 1,4,5,7,9,11,12).
(2) ‘the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis’
Nepotism is to favor friends and relatives without respects to qualifications. We did the opposite; the reviewer chosen were all specialists on the topics in question. It is true that they primarily were chosen among the authors of the special issue with some additional from outside. This does not mean “pal-reviewing”, but serious colleague reviewing. Most members of the author-team only new each other superficially or as authors. It is common practice when printing proceedings or collective volumes to seek the reviewers within the group, not in order to make the reviewing process less serious, but because those persons are the true experts within the field. And almost always they do a tremendously good job to improve the papers in constructive ways. So also in our case: our reviewing was simply excellent, which I am sure all persons involved would happily testify. This includes strong points and forces for relevant changes and updating. And what we achieved was a wonderful collection of papers that together make a very strong impact of elevating an old hypothesis into a firm theory saying that the solar variability is, indeed, driven by the planetary beat.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany has ambitious plans of erecting huge offshore wind parks in the North and Baltic Seas with the hope of generating lots of natural, climate-friendly energy. The Riffgat offshore wind park, comprising 30 monster turbines located some 15 kilometers from the North Sea island of Borkum, is such a wind park.

The Riffgat offshore wind park has no transmission lines to take the power onshore. More than 22,000 liters of diesel fuel are needed each month to keep the idled turbines from rusting away. Photo source:www.riffgat.de.
The dream is that Riffgat will power tens of thousands of homes and businesses with clean energy, and so become a model for the rest of the world. And now that construction of the wind park is finished, the dream also includes leading politicians inaugurating the wind park amid massive media attention, and thus looking like responsible heroes who are rescuing the planet.
That was the dream.
But now comes the reality. Number one German daily Bild here reports that the wind park is indeed complete, but it isn’t going to be supplying any green energy anytime soon. Bild writes:

The wind turbines aren’t operating, They are not allowed to run. This is because the wind park is still not hooked up to the power grid. 15 kilometers of the 50 kilometers of underwater power cable needed to connect the park to the mainland are still missing!
And because the wind park is not allowed to remain idle, diesel generators must keep the wind park in motion: The sensitive motors that are to convert the wind into energy must run continuously. Otherwise there’s a threat of corrosion from the salty air.
The consumption is enormous: According to BILD information Riffgat needs over 22,000 liters of diesel. A month!”
It isn’t possible to lay the last 15 km of sea cable because that section of the seabed is still littered with old bombs from WWII. Special ships are required to find and defuse the old munitions. Unfortunately these ships are booked out and it’s going to take months before any become available. Bild adds that the park isn’t going to get hooked up until February 2014 at the earliest.
Until then, and likely much later, 22,000 liters of diesel fuel will be burned each and every month to keep the turbines from rusting away.

Perhaps you’ll recall how about a year ago a draft version of the recently appearing IPCC AR5 found its way to the public’s attention. That draft report contained an important chart that clearly illustrated the failure of all climate prognoses over the last 15 years. The actually observed temperatures of the last years were clearly below the models’ projected range, see Figure 1:

Figure 1: Chart from the Second Order Draft of the IPCC climate report (Figure 1.4. Yellow arrows show digitization of cited Figure 10.26 of AR4). 
So it’s no wonder that this chart never saw the light of day in the final version of the IPCC final report. At his blog Climate Audit Steve McIntyre took a close look and researched why the substitute chart used in the final version (Figure 2) looks so different.

His summary conclusion: Without any plausible explanation, the colored forecast ranges were shifted and the chart was set up to be confusing. Moreover, what’s worse, the new version was never subjected to professional review or quality control, and was slipped in at the last minute as a replacement chart. This is a very dubious illusory trick for which the involved parties will have to answer to in the coming years when the historical-scientific examination of the climate-alarmism era takes place.

Hail storm in Dordrecht, Holland, May 17, 1552. Image: Taschen Verlag, amazon.de.
The online Spiegel today has a report on a new book titled The Book of Miracles which presents and examines a collection of 16th century depictions of celestial phenomena and portentous signs. They were recently discovered as part of a collection of 169 illustrations created in Augsburg, Germany around 1552. End-of-world visions, it turns out, are a human mental disorder that has been around for as long as civilization itself.
The images were created as Europe was in the grips of the Little ice Age, a time of bad weather, bitter cold, storms and crop failures, starvation and human misery. The 16th century depictions reveal images of a civilization obsessed with the end-of-the-world. Priests and elitists of the time conducted terrifying witch hunts to find those allegedly responsible for the black magic that cooked up the extreme weather.
Sound familiar?
The book containing the collection of images was authored by Joshua P. Waterman of the University of Indiana and Till-Holger Borchert of the University of Oregon. The collection of images depict demons, fire, drought, and torrential rains – of blood, stones and hail falling from the sky, which brought or warned of unimaginable misery for sinners on earth.
When one compares these hallucinatory depictions to today’s bleak climate scenarios coming from climate scientists, and their shrill demands that we radically change our behavior, the parallels could hardly be more striking.
Spiegel writes:

The Augsburg Book of Miracles (German title: Wunderzeichenbuch) illustrates how mankind from antiquity to the Renaissance imagined the end of things. As a rule: frightening. Only very few positive heavenly appearances are seen in between.”
Nowness site here quotes co-author Borchert on what the dire images signified.
The Protestant viewer would have reflected on the greater significance of these wonders: Why are there dragons in the sky? Why does it rain blood? Why are there three suns overhead? We know from contemporary sources that the answer was general: Things are wrong in the world. Repent and prepare for the end times, which are possibly now.”
Aren’t the similarities to the climate science establishment absolutely stunning? Once again today mankind is being led by obsessive, paranoid charlatans warning of unprecedented colossal weather disasters. Really, there is no other way to accurately describe today’s climate science schizophrenia.
Spiegel writes that the book’s 167 pages “illustrates the angst” of the times, many having to do with weather extremes. For example one illustration (see above) shows a massive hailstorm hitting Dordrecht Holland on May 17, 1552. Note the perceived “weirdness”.
Spiegel writes:
Lightning strikes, comets and the unknown were regarded as the Wrath of God, or as omens for bad things to come. … Starvation, disease, locusts and falling stars. Many of these signs were distributed as pamphlets. And many of these phenomena indeed happened, says Waterman. But the ten-headed monster with horns and a crown of course never existed.”
Extreme weather events being taken as signs for the coming end, unless sinful ways are repented, is as old as civilization. Today’s climate panic is merely just the latest relapse into a very old mental disorder that has afflicted mankind for thousands of years. The only antidote is reason and knowledge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes it takes awhile for bad science to be exposed.
Often it starts with one person finding an inconsistency, digging a little deeper, and then announcing that something is rotten. That person in turn gets attacked and smeared as an outcast. But a few other, open-minded persons take a closer look and they too realize that something is indeed wrong. Before you know it, other scientists and experts in the field are joining in and chipping away, and soon the whole thing collapses.
German meteorologist Dominik Jung (right) wonders why climate “hysteric scientists” have come out of their cave.
This is what is happening now in climate science in Germany – lots of skeptic people are now chipping away and that process has become a run-away train.
Just a few years ago, the science was as good as settled in Germany. Yet, a few skeptical, mainly retired scientists looked into the dissent coming from America and found that the AGW hypothesis was indeed full of holes. They formed into the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and before too long more than 60 German scientists signed an open letter rejecting man-made global warming. Eventually some small-scale media outlets, journalists and blogs joined in. They in turn were followed by skeptical major articles appearing in flagship news magazines such as Spiegel and Bild, see here, here, here, and here, for example.
In 2012 one of the fathers of the modern German environmental movement, Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, teamed up with geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and released a best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. That book shook up the German climate establishment. The alarmists scrambled and put on a full-court press, but failed to contain the book’s spread. Now that book is appearing worldwide in English next month.
Recently, Germany’s leading meteorologists have begun taking note and have used their immense skills to analyze the climate data. They too have concluded that the science is far from convincing, see here, here, here, and here. Earlier, many simply had accepted the IPCC findings as truth, but for whatever reason they began taking a closer look just to be sure. And when they did, they too quickly realized that much was rotten with AGW science. Today that fact is so obvious that German meteorologists are now openly ridiculing the once highly respected institutes as opportunist prophets of doom scamming for public funding. The German skeptic train is now running away.
The latest prominent meteorologist to express harsh criticism is Dominik Jung, who I follow at Twitter. Here he linked to a short commentary at his wetternet site where he takes a slap at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for their recent fit of alarmism in projecting an 8-fold increase in heat waves in Germany by the year 2040 – based on failed models.
Here’s his commentary at wetternet.de:

Weather: The Climate Hysterics Are Back!
Wiesbaden (wetter.net), 16 August 2013 – Hard to believe: heat and drought in the middle of the summer – now who’d have ever expected that? Hardly a summer was dryer or nicer in the last 10 years, and already the climate experts are coming out on stage.
Drought?
After a really warm July and a very hot start in August, it had to be expected: the climate experts are again coming out of their caves and warning us of extreme heat summers that are supposedly now imminent.
At least that’s what we read last Thursday and Friday in the media. There are going to be more and more heat-waves until 2040, so claim the prognoses. Yet, we are still waiting for the German winters with no snow and ice which were prophesized in the year 2000 . Perhaps the lady and gentleman climate scientists should simply once ask the workers of the road maintenance and winter snow clearing crews?
Weird: Over the last two rather cool and unsettled summers, we heard or saw almost nothing from the climate prophets. Also during the last colder than normal winters there was silence. Perhaps it is once again time for applying for new research funding …who knows, who knows…

"Almost 8,000 new private jets are expected to be bought by multinational companies and the super-rich over the next decade, each of which will burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as regular commercial flights, according to a report by aviation firm Honeywell Aerospace. About 690 new business jets are expected to take to the skies in 2019, a 9% increase on 2018, as businesses and the wealthy refresh their fleets with new models released by three of the world’s biggest private jet manufacturers. Despite their huge carbon footprint, demand for new private jets is expected to continue to grow next year, according to the report. Over the next decade, the number of new private jets taking to the skies is expected to total 7,600 – costing buyers a combined $248bn (£193bn). One-fifth of the new jets is expected to be ordered by “super-emitter” celebrities and other members of the richest 1% of the population, who use the planes to fly between their homes in the world’s most desirable locations. The jets are also bought by big companies to ferry executives across the world. There are currently more than 4,600 private jets operating. “It is the introduction of many new aircraft models at the same time, with new clean streamline designs, that is driving demand for new private jets,” Gaetan Handfield, senior manager of marketing analysis at Honeywell Aerospace and author of the report said. “People like to have the newest and best jets.” Handfield said a new range of jets produced by Bombardier, Gulfstream and Cessna are proving popular with buyers, as they have extended range that can allow executives to fly as far as New York to Beijing non-stop. Larger cabins also allow more luxurious conditions. “They have really big cabins, with four-to-five zones so you can have a bedroom, a place for crew to rest, a place to work, a dining area and a place for entertainment,” he said. Canada’s Bombardier recently introduced the Global 7500, the world’s largest and longest range business jet. “Within its luxurious interior are four true living spaces, a full size kitchen and a dedicated crew suite,” the company’s website says. “Elevate your flight experience and discover the uninhibited freedom and tailored luxury of the Global 7500 aircraft–a new class of business jet.” Bombardier claims the Global 7500 has the largest cabin of any private jet. “The only business jet large enough to accommodate four true living spaces with an available Master Suite and full size bed, dedicated crew suite and kitchen.” Brian Foley, an aviation analyst, concurs with Handfield, saying demand for new jets is being driven by people’s desire to “buy the latest and greatest” models. “People want to be the first to take a new product, it’s like iPhone mania but for jets,” Foley says. “We think deliveries will continue to increase in 2020/21, but then start to come down in 2022 as there is a lag time in private jet market response to the economic slowdown. Foley says the global super-rich account for between 15 and 25% of the world’s private jet market, while the majority are bought by multinational companies and about a quarter are bought by companies that organise “sort of timeshares” of planes, such as NetJets, a global firm offering customers both fractional aircraft ownership and private jet leases. Foley said demand for private jets continued to be strong across the world, but had notably cooled in Sweden due to the climate crisis awareness campaign launched by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. “In Sweden in particular the airline travel market has decreased by 5% or so, because of Greta,” he said. “From there it has moved to Europe, but by the time you get to North America and Asia it [the climate crisis] is on people’s radar but people are not as vocal and are not taking action.” Almost two-thirds of the jets are expected to be delivered to customers in the US and China, while Europe will account for about 20%. Other research by a Swedish university has found that celebrities who have called for the need to address the climate crisis are among a group of “super-emitters” who own private jets or regularly travel on them. Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder and world’s second-richest man, took 59 flights in 2017 travelling more than 200,000 miles, according to the study by academics at Lund University. The report estimated that Gates’ private jet travel, which he has described as his “guilty pleasure”, emitted about 1,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide. That compares to a global average of less than five tonnes per person. Like the Honeywell report, the study suggested that private jet travel emits up to 40 times as much carbon dioxide per passenger as scheduled commercial flights. However, other experts suggest this figure is nearer 10 times. Other celebrities identified as super-emitters include Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah Winfrey. The researchers collated media reports and trawled Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to build up a picture of their jet travel. Stefan Gossling, author of the study, which was published in the Annals of Tourism Research, said he decided to carry it out to try and identify which individuals produced the most carbon. “We are always talking about countries trying to reduce emissions, but there are huge differences between people in countries.” Gossling said that after looking at the results of the study he realised that: “I guess most celebrities don’t care [about the climate crisis] or if they care, they don’t care enough to change it.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Honeywell joins oil companies in predicting a never-ending demand for business as usual. The business being 7,600 new business jet deliveries over the next decade, rapidly expanding the most carbon-intensive form of transport on Earth. As private jets boom, the planet busts. To put it bluntly, it’s us or them.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo illustrate the absurdity that global warming science has become, global warming is claimed to cause climate change, which in turn now causes winters to be too cold! This is what some leading German state officials would like to have people believe.

1000-year old oak tree in Germany ailing because of “climate change”. Photo released into the public domain by Thomas Berendes.
Today FOCUS here reports that Lower Saxony Forestry Minister Christian Meyer (Green Party) released the 2013 Forestry Status Report, which concludes:
Lower Saxony’s forests are suffering from too much nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and climate change. This is the conclusion of the state Forestry Status Report introduced Friday.”
Here it turns out the three causes named above just happen to be by-products of the three things environmentalists love to hate: 1) agriculture – responsible for the nitrogen, 2) industry – responsible for the sulfur dioxide and 3) humans responsible for the climate change. In summary, when you get down to it, all three are because of man. Precisely who activists want to frame. Meyer says:
Especially old beech and oak trees are ailing”.
Imagine that, old trees aren’t healthy!

Report confirms cooling
Climate change, i.e. global warming, being cited as one of the reasons would lead a normal person to believe that German forests are likely suffering from too much warmth – due to the global warming. But the report says the climate-related ailments that forests are suffering are because of the “drier summers and more frosty winters.”
Forests are ailing because the winters have been too cold, the report claims. How is this due to global warming? This tells me global cooling is the problem, and not warming.
10 of the last 11 summers have been normal or too wet
And have summers really been drier? According meteorologist Dominik Jung, 10 of  the last 11 summers have been normal or wetter than normal in terms of precipitation. There’s only one conclusion we can reach about Meyer’s report: It is seriously flawed and more a political instrument that has little or no merit.
What’s another sign that the forest report is lots of activist hooey? The above pictured oak tree, for example, has been around 1000 years. Obviously it endured a broad range of conditions that occurred during the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age and the current Modern Optimum. It’s seen and survived it all.
And because it is 1000 years old, nobody should be surprised that the tree is sick.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman meteorologist Dominik Jung has a commentary today at his wetternet.de site where he looks at the Atlantic Gulf Stream. The commentary is titled: “Is the Gulf Stream Now Losing Its Steam?”
Over the last few days Central Europe has been enjoying almost summerlike temperatures as a weather system is drawing warm air from Mediterranean to the south. But this  of course is a temprrfary weather situation and things will soon be cooling off.
There have been a number of signs pointing to another cold winter, and meteorologist Jung today points to yet another: a disrupted Gulf Stream.
The Gulf Stream is a powerful, warm Atlantic ocean current that originates at the tip of Florida and pumps warm water along the eastern coastlines of the North America and across the Atlantic over to Europe, thus keeping the north of the old continent relatively warmer in the wintertime.
Jung shows two charts of the Gulf Stream, which I’ve placed side-by-side. The left one from 14 October 2012 and the right one a year later from 14 October 2013.

Jung describes the charts as follows:
One year ago off the coast of North America there was a strong continuous current which one could describe as quite healthy. From Florida and along the entire coast of North America the current speed was more or less uniformly high.
But compared to 2012 this year’s Gulf Stream shows a considerably disrupted flow. Already at the coast of North America the speed breaks down considerably compared to last year (see red arrow). At some places the speed is down to one half.”
So could this have an impact on Europe’s coming winter? Jung thinks this is a real possibility. He continues:
For now it is not clear what exactly the origin of the flow speed anomaly is. Of course the Gulf Stream remains intact and is not interrupted – an interruption would undoubtedly be fatal for our climate [in Europe]. In any case the flow has reduced considerably and thus the transport of heat to Europe has been considerably throttled, and that right before the coming start of winter. Never over the last 5 years has the Gulf Stream along North America been so weak as it is at this time of the year.
That could be another sign for an unusually colder than normal winter.”
It would be interesting to see what other meteorologists have to say on this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA number of websites have thoroughly and deservedly thrashed Germany-based Copernicus Publications for terminating one of its scientific journals: Pattern Recognition in Physics. Read here, here and here.
The reason for terminating the entire publication was an IPCC skeptical paper titled: General conclusions regarding the planetary–solar–terrestrial interaction, authored by an impressive roster of leading maverick scientists.
A Copernicus Publications statement claims that “scientific dispute is controversial and should allow contradictory opinions which can then be discussed within the scientific community“. But unfortunately anything that disagrees with the IPCC isn’t going to be tolerated – data and observations be damned. Clearly the dogmatism of IPCC global warming science rules at Copernicus Publications. The director of Copernicus Publications, Thies Martin Rasmussen, appears to be simply too young, naïve and closed-minded to know better and is thus intolerant to alternative explanations.
Growing German intolerance
The move by Copernicus Publications should not come as a surprise, though. The move simply once again confirms a growing intolerance to climate science dissent that we’ve been seeing in Germany over the past years. Today dissent is being met with increasing scorn and viciousness. Those who express dissent are routinely singled out and marginalized as heretics. And the more the data refute anthropogenic global warming, the more intense the dogmatists become.
From “Jewish science” to “denier science”
Unfortunately, Göttingen, where the publisher is based, has a long history of caving in to this brand of intolerance and remaining silent when things get out of hand. Jacob Bronowski in Knowledge or Certainty reminds us of a dark period in Gottingen’s history:
It’s a major tragedy that in my lifetime and yours, that here in Göttingen scientists were refining to the most exquisite position of the principle of tolerance and turning their backs on the fact that all around them tolerance was crashing to the ground beyond repair.”
The same is true today in Germany’s climate science community. The move by Copernicus Publications once again represents how science and debate can be suppressed by arrogance and elitism. Albert Einstein was also attacked by German scientists, who called his theories “Jewish science”. The only difference today is that we’ve gone from “Jewish science” to “denier science”. Today’s skeptical scientists in Germany, and elsewhere, are held with an eerily similar contempt as Einstein was held in the Nazi days. Some have already left the country.

Even lukewarmers get disinvited
One particular glaring example occurred two years ago, when lukewarmer Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of the then newly released IPCC critical book “Die kalte Sonne“, was abruptly disinvited by administrators from giving a speech at the University of Osnabrück after immense pressure was applied on the university and threats were made by powerful, radical green forces.
Germany’s Environment Ministry goes after skeptics
Last year Germany’s Ministry of Environment, a major federal government body, published and distributed a 123-page pamphlet that singled out, publicly named, isolated and discredited leading German climate dissenters, warning the public not to listen to them. Jewish journalist Henryk Broder wrote that the move by the Ministry of Environment smacked of tactics used by the Reichskulturkammer, read here.
Move by Copernicus defends anti-science and dogma
With its rash, poorly contemplated move, Copernicus Publications has turned its back on the principles of open scientific debate and demonstrated an obstinate insistence that certainty exists in the complex science of climate change. The publisher is not defending science at all, rather he is defending anti-science and the preservation of dogma. With it’s move Copernicus Publications is stymying debate and dissent.
The authors of the controversial paper General conclusions regarding the planetary–solar–terrestrial interaction, are among the most esteemed in the field, and thus cannot be dismissed as crackpots. Collectively they have published hundreds of scientific papers, an immense contribution to the field and expansion of knowledge. Their only “wrongdoing”? They refuse to tag along with the fashionable dogma of anthropogenic global warming. They insist of remaining scientitific, i.e. being critical and skeptical of claims that cannot be supported by observations.
Copernicus Publications has made a terrible, cowardly and narrow-minded mistake that will become a huge embarrassment to Germany’s scientific community and spirit of open discussion. Reversing this grotesque decision and apologizing to the scientists is in order.

"Victoria police have expressed “extreme disappointment” at the behaviour of two officers involved in policing climate change protests in Melbourne last week, after one was photographed with a sticker on his body camera and another was discovered to have posted “inappropriate memes” on his social media. The same officer who posted the memes, which included Pepe the frog, was criticised this week after he was photographed making a hand gesture that Victoria police deny was the “white power” symbol. Police have repeatedly stated the officer was directing an “are you OK” sign at two protesters who appeared distressed outside the International Mining and Resources Conference in Melbourne. On Saturday, Victoria police said in a statement the officer had been reprimanded in relation to images posted on his personal Facebook page that are closely associated with online alt-right communities. The statement came after the images were discovered online. “Victoria police is aware of the ongoing commentary about a police officer who made a hand gesture at the protest earlier this week and previous posts on his social media page. “In relation to the hand gesture, we have reviewed body worn camera footage of the incident and it’s inconclusive. The footage does not capture both sides of the interaction and is at times obscured by structures and people. “We have spoken extensively to the officer in question and he has advised the hand gesture was simply the ‘are you OK’ sign directed at two protestors who looked distressed. “In regards to his social media page, we are aware of a small number of posts which include inappropriate memes. “Under no circumstances are these posts reflective of the values of Victoria police. The officer has been spoken to about these posts and, although they were made more than 12 months ago, he is aware of our extreme disappointment.” Victoria police said it was assessing the material to decide if further action was required. “While officers are entitled to have personal social media accounts, we do not want or expect them to be including content which may offend members of the community.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The second officer is also being investigated after he was photographed at the same protests during the week wearing a sticker on his body camera that said “EAD hippy”. The letters EAD commonly stand for “eat a dick”. Victoria police confirmed over the weekend the photograph of the officer was legitimate. “We have identified the police officer who was photographed at this week’s protest with a comment on his body worn camera and can confirm the image is real,” a spokesperson said. “We are still working to ascertain how and why this comment was on his camera. “The community can be reassured this is not the type of behaviour we expect from our officers and we are extremely disappointed by the situation.” “Victoria police will be investigating the matter further with involvement from professional standards command and disciplinary action will be considered as part of this.” Victoria police said the behaviour detracted from an “otherwise professionally conducted operation and tarnishes the reputation of all of our officers”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe public by now has heard every climate scare story at least five times over the last three decades. They’ve stop listening years ago.
Yet, the last remaining, diehard alarmists are reaching ever deeper into their bag of tricks in an attempt to reawaken the good old days of climate alarmism. We certainly can tell we are now in the run up to the release of the IPCC AR5 Report.

September, 2013 front cover of National Geographic shows sea level rise of 65 meters. At current rate it’ll take 30,000 years! 
The most recent is the latest National Geographic cover everyone is now ridiculing (see above). It is turning out to be another alarmists’ own-goal, much to the delight of the skeptics.
The semi-submerged Statue of Liberty used to convey a catastrophic sea level rise is actually just an old trick used by Spiegel…27 years ago, August 11, 1986!

27 years ago, Spiegel showed a semi-submerged Cologne Cathedral. Source: www.spiegel.de/spiegel/html
If that doesn’t tell us that the warmists are intellectually bankrupt and have lost the debate. Even the annual children’s ritual of Halloween scares grown-ups more.
So what will be on National Geographic’s cover next month? Bacon sizzling in a frying pan accompanied by warning, “Be scared, be very scared!“? Now wouldn’t that be creative and original?

Both Spiegel and National Geographic depict on their covers a sea level rise on the order of 60 meters or so. Totally preposterous with regards to today’s scientific knowledge. Spiegel has long since cranked back its global warming alarmism, and even occasionally publishes articles critical of climate alarmism claiming even 1 meter of sea level rise by 2100.
Bjorn Lomborg: “exhaustion and lack of interest”
At FaceBook Björn Lomborg comments:

This is the kind of scare pictures that are unnecessary for the public conversation on global warming. The new National Geographic cover shows the Statue of Liberty covered in 65m (214ft) of water — 80 times more than even the highest expected sea level rise in the upcoming IPCC report. Yes, global warming is a problem, but screaming way over the top hasn’t helped the last 20 years. Arguably it has lead to panic, poor policies that have cost trillions of dollars with little benefit, and now almost exhaustion and lack of interest. 65m calculated here: http://bit.ly/158KG7x, National Geographic here: http://bit.ly/17sRKKQ.”

Reader comments at FB:
George Breckenridge:
National Geographic has been part of the propaganda machine for some years. Whores for hire.”
Matt Greenwade:
What’s going to happen is these predictions will turn out to be false, or at the very least inaccurate, and people won’t pay attention anymore.”
Well Matt, people stopped paying attention long ago. NatGeo is just the latest example telling us why this is so.

"The Paris Agreement commits nations to limiting global warming to less than 2˚C by the end of the century. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that, to meet such a massive challenge, societies will need to do more than simply reduce and limit carbon emissions. It seems likely that large scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere may be called for: so-called “negative emissions”. One possibility is to use waste material from mining to trap CO₂ into new minerals, locking it out of the atmosphere. The idea is to exploit and accelerate the same geological processes that have regulated Earth’s climate and surface environment over the 4.5 billion years of its existence. Across the world, deep and open-pit mining operations have left behind huge piles of worthless rubble – the “overburden” of rock or soil that once lay above the useful coal or metal ore. Often, this rubble is stored in dumps alongside tiny fragments of mining waste – the “tailings” or “fines” left over after processing the ore. The fine-grained waste is particularly reactive, chemically, since more surface is exposed. A lot of energy is spent on extracting and crushing all this waste. However, breaking rocks into smaller pieces exposes more fresh surfaces, which can react with CO₂. In this sense, energy used in mining could itself be harvested and used to reduce atmospheric carbon.  This is one of the four themes of a new £8.6m research programme launched by the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council, which will investigate new ways to reverse emissions and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The process we want to speed up is the “carbonate-silicate cycle”, also known as the slow carbon cycle. Natural silicate rocks like granite and basalt, common at Earth’s surface, play a key part in regulating carbon in the atmosphere and oceans by removing CO₂ from the atmosphere and turning it into carbonate rocks like chalk and limestone. Atmospheric CO₂ and water can react with the silicate rocks to dissolve elements they contain like calcium and magnesium into the water, which also soaks up the CO₂ as bicarbonate. This weak solution is the natural river water that flows to the oceans, which hold more than 60 times more carbon than the atmosphere. It is here, in the oceans, that the calcium and bicarbonate can recombine, over millions of years, and crystallise as calcite or chalk, often instigated by marine organisms as they build their shells. Today, rivers deliver hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon each year into the oceans, but this is still around 30 times less than the rate of carbon emission into the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning. Given immense geological time scales, these processes would return atmospheric CO₂ to its normal steady state. But we don’t have time: the blip in CO₂ emissions from industrialisation easily unbalances nature’s best efforts. The natural process takes millions of years – but can we do it in decades? Scientists looking at accelerated mine waste dissolution will attempt to answer a number of pressing questions. The group at Cambridge which I lead will be investigating whether we can speed up the process of silicate minerals from pre-existing mine waste being dissolved into water. We may even be able to harness friendly microbes to enhance the reaction rates.  Another part of the same project, conducted by colleagues in Oxford, Southampton and Cardiff, will study how the calcium and magnesium released from the silicate mine waste can react back into minerals like calcite, to lock CO₂ back into solid minerals into the geological future.   Whether this can be done effectively without requiring further fossil fuel energy, and at a scale that is viable and effective, remains to be seen. But accelerating the reaction rates in mining wastes should help us move at least some way towards reaching our climate targets."
"The oceans are becoming ever more acidic as humans pump increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These acidic oceans will change smell molecules and render them unrecognisable for animals in the sea. Chemical communication using smell is essential for marine organisms. Its importance is comparable to the combined status of vision and hearing in humans. My latest research reveals that smell molecules in the ocean are significantly affected by ongoing ocean acidification.  Smell molecules are chemicals that are produced by organisms either on purpose – by females to attract males, for instance – or by chance during natural processes such as protein degradation. In both cases, they can be used by animals to smell their way around.  Imagine you are a little crab living on a shore covered with large rocks and deep pools, and battered by tides and waves. The only way to find your lunchtime snack would be to smell it from a distance. But the same also applies to the octopus hunting you. So you, the crab, also rely on smelling the octopus first to avoid being eaten. What if all this were no longer possible? Man-made, increasing carbon dioxide emissions have caused the pH in our world’s oceans to decrease, an effect called ocean acidification. By the year 2100, the sea surface pH is predicted to drop by up to 0.4 units. This may not seem much, but it has been shown to significantly affect the fitness, physiology, reproduction and behaviour of everything in the sea from huge sharks and whales to the tiniest of plankton. Many molecules transporting smell from its source to an organism are potentially sensitive to pH. This holds particularly true for peptides and proteins, which are used, for example, by crabs, barnacles and mussels as indicators for food, predators, settlement spaces or during brood care and larval hatching. The main question is whether a drop in pH will render them ineffective.  For a molecule to be “smelled” by an animal’s receptor – usually its “nose”, although crabs actually smell using their antennae and even the tips of their legs – two characteristics are key: how the different bits of the molecule are arranged, or “conformed”, together, and whether it is positively or negatively charged. Both turn out to be affected by changes in pH. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to determine what happens to smell molecules in different pH conditions. But to assess what smell molecules of the future will be like (when the ocean will become more acidic) we need to use computer models. The image below looks at three smell molecules used by crab larvae to communicate. While in their eggs, tucked underneath the female’s belly, the larvae release these smells to tell their mums when they need more ventilation, oxygen or assistance to hatch. The three smell molecules are shown as they are in today’s oceans (on the left) and under expected conditions until 2100 (on the right). Molecules representing the smell today are relatively compact and have very distinct areas of positive and negative charge (with green indicating neutral areas). In contrast, the future molecules are less compact and have an overall positive charge. These changes were found to happen exactly within the ocean pH range expected from today until the year 2100.  With both charge and conformation affected by pH changes, ocean acidification clearly affects the process of smelling. This can be tested by observing animal behaviour in different pH conditions before and after a smell substance is added to the water. In our study we used female green crabs, also known as shore crabs (Carcinus maenas), Britain’s most common crab. In normal pH conditions, after the smell substance was added, the female crabs responded by increasingly ventilating their eggs.  But when we lowered the pH to the more acidic levels predicted for the year 2100, the crabs no longer responded to the smell. This suggests that in future oceans, smell molecules may lose their function. The combination of computational, chemical and biological techniques has helped to uncover a new mechanism by revealing the molecular effects and actual consequences of changing pH in the world’s oceans on “scent”. But what do these observed changes mean? The smell molecules tested in the study are examples for one class of chemicals and are known to play a role in the settlement of barnacle and oyster larvae, shell location of hermit crabs and brood care and larval release of shrimps and crabs.  If all marine smell molecules were affected in a similar way, chemical communication in the ocean would be completely disrupted. It would be comparable to a world without light and sound for us humans.  Luckily, not all smell molecules are the same and some may work differently. How each one works will determine whether the crab or the octopus will end up with their lunchtime snack. At the moment we don’t know enough about smell molecules and their functions in the ocean to foresee the overall effects. The wider ecosystem consequences of this newly found mechanism, however, are yet to be investigated."
"Cities – we are repeatedly told – are the future. Governments and global corporations seek to increase productivity by accelerating urban growth, while more and more citizens migrate to cities, in search of a better life. Indeed, the Chinese government recently unveiled plans to construct a city three times the size of New York, calling it a “strategy crucial for a millennium to come”.  Yet as it stands, visions of our urban future are bleak.  By 2050, it is predicted that up to six billion inhabitants will live in urban areas – more than two thirds of the world’s population. There could be as many as 30 cities with populations exceeding 10m, and massive urban areas may merge to form megacities, resulting in urban populations exceeding 50m.  According to Mike Davis, author of Planet of Slums, approaching two billion of the world’s inhabitants will live in slums, scratching out an existence without access to the basic services necessary for life. Another four billion will live severely compromised lives within urban sprawl, left to fight for resources as city governments fail to cope with the rapid influx of people.  Social services and health facilities will break down. Human catastrophes such as starvation and the spread of disease will result from unsanitary conditions and high population density. The megacities of the future will have weak and unsustainable local economies, that will negatively affect citizens’ lives in myriad ways. Wealth will not provide immunity from these issues. Pollution will rise exponentially, with toxic smog regularly enveloping entire cities. This will inevitably lead to a rise in respiratory diseases, which are already emerging as one of the three major health risks to the modern population. Bad air quality will be made worse by the urban heat island effect, as parks and rural hinterlands are built over to house the influx of people.  Nature will struggle to gain a foothold in the future city, with rural land predicted to shrink by 30% to accommodate urban expansion. The lack of countryside and green space will ultimately contribute to the sixth recorded mass extinction of animal and plant species.  But there is a way to avert this apocalyptic vision. Efforts to control the rapid and chaotic expansion of cities must go hand in hand with tackling the global environmental crisis, brought about by climate change. Governments, however, have proved unwilling or unable to reconcile the interests of global corporations with those of everyday people and the environment; this can be seen through their support of projects such as mining the Alberta Sands and oil operations in the Niger Delta. As such, any alternative to this bleak urban future will require a radical shift in governance and economic philosophy. Scholars argue that society’s economic aim should be the sustainable production and fair distribution of wealth – rather than the maximisation of profit. Devolving wealth and power will help to build robust local economies and strong communities, which can mitigate the pressures of global urbanisation.  These changes should also be manifest in the physical structure and form of urban communities, with compact, densely populated, sustainable and self-governing community developments, as opposed to laissez-faire urban sprawl. In alternative future cities, urban blocks will support all the immediate needs of their inhabitants; from healthcare to housing, education, food production, clean water and sanitation.  To better understand what such a place might actually be like, David Dobereiner, Chris Brown and I created Organicity: an illustrated prototype for localised, autonomous, sustainable, urban community infrastructure. The Organicity is densely occupied, with residential, urban agriculture, retail, industry, commerce, education and health facilities stacked above each other, accommodating approximately 5,000 people per unit.  Automated industries and waste processing are located beneath the living zone, where there is no need for natural light. Each unit has a primary industry which trades with other neighbouring communities to generate income to support the infrastructure. Resources should be managed at a local level, with a higher level of responsibility than is currently shown by global corporations.  Protecting the environment and supporting a diverse range of wildlife would be a natural function of these new communities. Biodiversity could be promoted by green corridors, situated near education, health and office spaces so that children and workers can benefit from the proximity of a rich natural environment.  Investing in local people through the provision of skills and education will add to the commercial viability of the community, as well as building cohesion, purpose and mutual respect. As the sociologist Jane Jacobs argued back in the 1970s, for cities to remain viable they should become the producers of resources, rather than insatiable consumers.  In the Organicity, each development will have the necessary expertise for the community to flourish, including doctors, architects, solicitors, dentists, as well as skilled and unskilled labour. This new urban model transforms city blocks into productive environments. For example, the development of urban farming would boost food production and prevent starvation, which would be an inevitable consequence of unimpeded urban growth.  The developments will vary in scale, with the bigger ones housing hospitals and other community facilities that require specialist facilities. The prototype reinvents the concept of “terraced housing”: land is stepped backwards up a slope, forming true terraces, where rows of houses are arrayed to embrace the public plaza and allotment gardens.  Within these communities, it is essential that people work close to where they live, to reduce the impacts of transport: not only will this tackle pollution, it will also afford people more quality time with their families and local community.  Sharing communal resources – including machinery and cars – is an important principle of urban sustainability. Communal ownership of assets, including real estate and green space, is essential for this model to work. Renewable technologies could also be community-owned, which would help to break people’s dependency on fossil fuel.  By shifting from globalisation to localisation, and creating smaller, self-sufficient communities within sustainable developments, cities could regain their equilibrium. From where we stand today, the Organicity may sound like a Utopian dream. But if we’re to avoid an urban apocalypse, we’re going to need strong alternative visions, to change the way we imagine and plan for the cities of the future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been so quiet in the mainstream media this year when it comes to polar sea ice. So I figure there must be something going on there that they just don’t want us to see.
The Arctic is refusing to melt like it did last year, and there’s hardly a chance it’s even going to get even close to a record low there. The other story is Antarctica, where I noticed a new record was set…quietly and already months ago.

Antarctica sea ice above normal, uninterrupted almost 2 years. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/seaice.anomaly.antarctic.png.
That record is not sea ice area, but rather the duration that sea ice at the South Pole has remained above the long-term average – now close to 2 years! Never has it even come close to being above average for that long since records have been kept.
From the above chart we observe that it’s rare for South Polar sea ice to be above normal even for just 1 year. Now we are almost at two years. This is unprecedented.
The last time sea ice around Antarctica was below normal was in late 2011.
The warmist scientists who warned us of the albedo tipping point up in the Arctic have to be really trembling about what’s happening at the South Pole – if the albedo theory is correct.
Is this vast yea ice extent a sign of global warming? I think only a real moron would answer yes. Sure there are lots of factors, but ice just doesn’t grow and grow when it gets warmer. Obviously it’s cooling down there, and we need to be very concerned about it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got a news e-mail from Craig Rucker of CFACT. It turns out that the environmental movement is turning into a mob of angry, frustrated white males who go around terrifying people. Look familiar?

Scary, angry mob bearing torches threatens to shut you down. Image source: CFACT.
If that isn’t spreading a message of terror. Ah shucks, you mean the masked men are just holding candles that symbolize hope and peace?
Craig Rucker writes:
Throwback to uglier times:
Torch bearing radicals descend on pipeline executive’s private home. It’s the kind of scene we’d like to think we’d put behind us.
Yet here it is again. How would you like to look outside and see masked radicals with torches on your front lawn?
That’s what greeted Mark Maki and his family. Maki was targeted for this shameful act of intimidation because he is a member of the board of Enbridge Energy Management which works with oil pipelines.
The masked perpetrators refused to identify themselves, or their group, claiming only that they represent “the people.”
This comes at a time when both parties are coming around to the realization that pipelines are the safest, most economical and environmentally sound way to move petroleum, particularly after several bad train accidents.

The radicals are in danger of losing the pipeline issue and they know it.  Their response is to act out and threaten sabotage.
Not too long ago Marc Morano, who edits CFACT’s award-winning Climate Depot news and information service, asked an anti-pipeline protestor if they were ready to engage in “eco-terrorism.”  The protestor replied that they would do “whatever it takes” to prevent the project.  It appears now that such threats are more than mere hyperbole.  Law enforcement needs to be on alert.
The most high profile pipeline project in the country right now is the Keystone XL.  It has been the subject of years of wasteful and foolish obstruction.  It is time for President Obama to end all delays, listen to his own State Department, pick up his vaunted pen, sign his name and authorize Keystone XL once and for all.
Paul Driessen has the facts on Keystone XL at CFACT.org.  They are important.
Mister President, the time has come.  Authorize Keystone XL today.  Will you side with ignorance, radicalism and intimidation, or the economic, energy and environmental needs of the nation?
No American, no matter who they are or where they stand, should ever fear threats from masked radicals with torches outside their home again.
Such intimidation cannot be tolerated.
For nature and people too.

Steve McIntyre here looks at the so-called Oxburgh Panel’s “exoneration”. In his conclusion McIntyre writes (my emphasis):
However, it is evident that the Oxburgh panel did not interview Mann or carry out any of the steps necessary to conduct an investigation of Mann’s work and that they did not provide the wide-ranging ‘exoneration’ asserted in Mann’s pleadings.  Furthermore, public statements by members of the Oxburgh panel on Mann’s work were highly critical and, far from indicating the widespread exoneration claimed by Mann, suggested the opposite. Indeed, Mann himself at the time perceived these opinions as damaging to himself, as he dismissed Hand’s as a ‘rogue opinion’ and unsuccessfully sought an apology from Hand.”

"A zoo in northern England has had its license suspended after reports that 486 animals had died there in just four years. Casualties at South Lakes Safari Zoo included snow leopards, two monkeys with septicaemia and an overweight giraffe. The zoo’s owner has been given 28 days to appeal. People who have spoken to me about this automatically assume that nearly 500 animal deaths in four years is an unacceptably high number. But as a biologist my first question is: what species have been dying? Unfortunately, I do not have access to this information – and that’s part of the problem. One dead animal every three days sounds like a lot, but it depends on the species. For example, if the zoo was mainly a collection of small rodents then this death rate could be acceptable as these animals rarely live for longer than a year or two. However, if most of the animals that died were large mammals or birds then I would be more concerned.  In any case, it is important to establish these facts as it would give us a benchmark to assess each zoo against. We can compare zoos to Britain’s health service, the NHS, which publishes the survival rates of patients in its different hospitals and information is available down to the level of individual surgeons. It would be unfair and nonsensical to compare the survival rates of cancer hospitals with those dealing with orthopaedics, just as it would be to compare a specialist rodent zoo to one filled entirely with primates. As a zoo biologist, I do not have access to performance league tables for animal collections and so I can’t say if the death rates at South Lakes are exceptional or not. There are databases on animal longevity but these tend to emphasise the extremes rather than the median lifespan. And then there is the question of zoo animals versus their wild counterparts. We know that elephants have shorter lifespans in captivity than their wild counterparts, whereas species such as chimpanzees regularly live 10 or 15 years longer in captivity. Again, this situation is paralleled by human health studies where people in developed countries have longer lifespans than those in less developed countries. For example, life expectancy in Japan is 84 years, whereas in Swaziland it is only 49 years. In Japan, where infant mortality is rare and most deaths are associated with old age, even the worst hospital would have an impressive mortality rate by Swaziland standards. Death rates in humans and animals can be investigated by constructing life tables, which basically calculate the probability of an individual making it to their next birthday. This is the type of data I would need on species held in UK zoos to be able to make an informed statement about the death rates at South Lakes.  All zoos do collect such data and the good ones will use it to review their work in much the same way as a hospital would. The info will often be entered into an online database system called ZIMS, which has the records of millions of animals both living and dead. However, unlike hospital records of human health, zoo data is not readily available to scientists.  As science moves towards greater transparency and open access data repositories become more common, it is time zoos also published in this format. Independent analysis and publishing of life tables would allow for problem zoos like South Lakes to be detected much earlier. Overall this would benefit zoos as they would be able to compare their performance and investigate any anomalies.  In human medicine this type of data has not just been useful for identifying problems, but it can also identify examples of good practice. For example: which cancer hospitals have the best survival rates? What could other hospitals learn from them? The rating of zoos would allow people to make more informed decisions when choosing to visit, and it would provide zoo managers with an independent analysis of their performance. Of course I am not suggesting animal longevity is the only way to judge a particular institution. But this could be the starting point for developing an evidence-based system, and it would help identify the worst before too many animals have died."
"Former London mayor Boris Johnson has been accused of holding back negative findings from a 2013 report on the city’s air pollution.  The report stated that 433 of London’s 1,777 primary schools were in areas where nitrogen dioxide concentrations breached EU limits. Nitrogen dioxide, or NO2, is an air pollutant that when inhaled can aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma, emphysema and bronchitis. It has been estimated that in 2010 there were 5,900 deaths in London associated with long term exposure to NO2.  There’s a social element too. Of those 433 polluted schools, 82% were officially considered “deprived” (where more than 40% of pupils eligible for free school meals). Given that the then-mayor was, for some time, promoting Cleaner Air 4 Schools it is difficult to understand why the report wasn’t released three years ago. After all, the finding that children, especially poorer children, suffer the most from air pollution isn’t particularly surprising. In November 2015 a study by King’s College London and the think-tank Policy Exchange found that a third of the capital’s primary, secondary and independent schools were situated in areas with NO2 concentrations above legal limits. This equates to about one in four school children in London being exposed to poor air quality.  This isn’t just a London thing: the Sunday Times mapped school location against government data of NO2 emissions per square kilometre and found that about 3,000 British schools were sited in areas with potentially dangerous levels of air pollution.  Two schools in South Yorkshire next to the M1, England’s main north-south motorway, are to be relocated as their pupils were exposed to too much air pollution. However in Croydon, south London, a new school is to be built next to a busy arterial road where NO2 concentrations have been shown to exceeded EU limits. It is proposed that the school will be “internally ventilated” to reduce the pupil’s exposure. The London report highlights the importance of environmental justice: deprived poorer communities suffer from poor air quality more than wealthy communities and by implication its associated disease burden. This has been known for some time and data from 2001 indicates that of the 2.5m people in areas of Britain where the NO2 limit value was breached, more than half were among the poorest 20% of the population. A more recent analysis found that air quality improvement has been greatest in the least deprived areas. There is now a wealth of research papers that have characterised children’s exposure to air pollutants in schools, although many concentrate on indoor air quality. In one of the most comprehensive studies, focused on Barcelona, it was found that schools had high levels of pollutants because the majority of them were very close to high traffic streets. However schools contribute to just over 30% of a child’s total exposure to air pollution. Why is exposure to air pollution of particular concern for children? Young people are more susceptible to air pollution as their lungs are still growing and developing, and because they tend to spend more time being active outdoors. For example children living in areas with high levels of nitrogen dioxide have up to 10% less lung capacity than normal.  Both the Royal College of Physicians and parliament’s Environment Audit Committee have noted that little attention has been paid to planning when it comes to air pollution at schools due to their proximity to roads. The committee even recommended that national planning policy: Should make it impossible to build new schools, care homes or health clinics near existing air pollution hotspots, and any redevelopment of such existing buildings should only be approved if they reduce pollution exposure for their users. Building regulations should provide for existing schools sited near pollution hotspots to be fitted with air filtration systems. Transport to and from school is one option that should be considered. However, parents are often reluctant to allow their child to walk along busy roads and so often drive, making the situation worse. Children these days are walking to school less often. In the 1970s an estimated 64% of all trips to school were made by walking (74% for primary age pupils and 53% for secondary age). By 2014 younger children were being driven as often as they walked in (both 46%) while older children were walking just 38% of the time.  Exploring safer or “well-being” walking routes could be one solution to encourage more walking to school and reduce exposure to air pollution. Every council has a legal duty to increase opportunities for children to travel to and from school by sustainable modes such as cycling and walking. Most schools have a “travel plan” which identifies healthy and sustainable transport options to help to reduce the numbers of cars on the road at peak times and improve the local environment. More could be done to make parents aware of these."

By Michael Krüger, Science Skeptical Blog
(Translated, condensed, edited by P Gosselin)
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in November 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Organization for Meteorology (WMO). The main task of the UN Climate Framework  Convention (UNFCCC) was to assess the risks of global warming and to draw up mitigation strategies. One important role was to determine the global climate development over the last 1000 years in order to see if the warming of the last century was “unique” and to see if today’s supposed manmade warming was a threat.
An examination of the five IPCC reports published thus far reveals a remarkable scientific reversal. What follows is the evolution of the 1000-year temperature curve: from double hump (1990) – to hockey stick 2001) – and back again to double hump (2013).
1st Assessment Report, 1990
In the First Assessment Report of 1990, page 202 depicts the following chart:

Figure 1: Page 202 of the IPCC FAR.
In Figure 1 we see that the period of the 11th to 13th century, the Medieval Warm Period, was considerably warmer than today. The above graphic appears to be based on the publication from LAMB from 1965, H. H. LAMB, 1965, THE EARLY MEDIEVAL WARM EPOCH AND ITS SEQUEL Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. The climate data were taken from Central England and extend up to 1970.
2nd Assessment Report, 1995
But already in the Second Assessment Report of 1995 the curve looks much different. On page 174:


Figure 2: Page 174 of the Second Assessment Report
And instead of showing the last 1000 years, as the section title states, the chart starts only in the 15th century, i.e. exactly at the end of the Medieval Warm Period. And there’s another oddity that stands out: The drawn mean curve does not match the depicted temperature curve.
3rd Assessment Report, 2001
In the Third Assessment Report of 2001 the following curve was presented by the IPCC (as to Mann, M.E, R.S. Bradley and M.K. Hughes (1998) Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries.- NATURE, VOL 392, 23 April). In the literature often cited under (Michael E. Mann and Raymond S. Bradley (1999). Northern Hemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, Uncertainties, and Limitations) (original chart in Figure 3).

Figure 3: Hockey Stick chart from the IPCC Third Assessment Report
In a single stroke the Medieval Warm Period gets deleted altogether. The chart shows a relatively stable climate all the way up to 1900 with an overall slight cooling tendency. This then gets followed by a dramatic temperature increase. It became known worldwide as the “Hockey Stick chart”. It was cited endlessly, often times without the gray zone of uncertainty – for example in Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth movie.
However, the chart became highly criticized because of the methodology employed by lead author Michael Mann. The methodology produced a hockey stick no matter what data were input. Even today Mann refuses to fully disclose the method he employed. Moreover, it was determined that the tree-ring data methodology suppressed the climate jumps of the past. Furthermore the reconstructed data was simply truncated at 1980 and replaced by the instrumental data. This was done because the data derived from the tree-rings did not deliver the desired temperature rise at the end of the data series.
4th Assessment Report, 2007
In the Fourth Assessment Report of 2007 on page 467, the IPCC presented a new climate spaghetti curve.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





Figure 4: 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment report, page 467.
It contained the hockey stick curve of Michael Mann (MBH1999), which however was only one of many. New temperature reconstructions depict once again more or less a pronounced Medieval Warm Period.
5th Assessment Report, 2013
The Fifth Assessment Report has been just released. In it the IPCC now shows the following Figure 5.7 climate curve, a new spaghetti chart:

Figure 5: IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Figure 5.7.
Here we now clearly see that Michael Mann’s hockey stick curve of 1999 has disappeared altogether. The new temperature reconstructions once again show a very pronounced Medieval Warm Period, thus rehabilitating the MWP of the First Assessment Report from 23 years ago. Today’s warming, it turns out, is nowhere near as dramatic as it was claimed for a long time.
The IPCC has gone from a double hump curve – to hockey stick – and again back to double hump curve. This is a remarkable scientific reversal over the course of 23 years.
Hide the decline
Michael Mann’s hockey stick curve of 1999 is not the only climate curve that has disappeared from the 5th Assessment Report. Also Keith Briffa’s curve from 2000 and 2001 have disappeared. The following may be the reason they have disappeared.
Most reconstructions do not extend all the way to the present even though they provide enough data to do so in most cases. The reason for this is because the curve designers do not want to deal with the gaping differences between the values derived from the proxy reconstructions and the values recorded by modern instruments. So they simply truncate the proxy reconstructed values where a divergence between the two datasets begins. The discarded proxy reconstruction data are then simply replaced by the instrumental data obtained from the weather stations.
Example
Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart from 1998 uses reconstructed proxy data only until 1980. Mann writes in his 1998 publication: “the training interval is terminated at 1980 because many of the proxy series terminate at or shortly after 1980)”. This truncate-and-substitute trick is even mentioned in one of the Climategate e-mails from Phil Jones (Director of the Climate Research Unit): “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”
Keith Briffa (CRU) also used the truncate-and-substitute trick. The Briffa reconstructions from 1998 (as well as 2000, 2001) extended only up to 1960 even though the reconstructed data ranged from 1402 – 1995. This is explained as follows in an internal e-mail: “The data are attached to this e-mail. They go from 1402 to 1995, although we usually stop the series in 1960 because of the recent non-temperature signal that is superimposed on the tree-ring data that we use.”
Here’s how it’s done

Figure 6: How “Mike’s Nature Trick” works.
Figure 6 shows Keith Briffa’s reconstruction. The data from the reconstruction extends all the way to 1995 (red curve included). But the red part of the curve (1961-1994) gets deleted because it does not show any real warming and gets replaced by instrumental data from weather stations (green, 1871-1997) . This trick was used to conceal the drop in temperature at the end of the reconstruction and to cover up the considerable discrepancy with the instrumental data of the weather stations, i.e. “to hide the decline”.
The same was done with Michael Mann’s reconstruction, which got chopped off at 1980.
Without the work of the “climate skeptics”, one of the greatest scientific reversals of the last century very likely would have never taken place.

In the publication, Germany’s Federal Environment Agency (UBA) singled out, named and pilloried three skeptic journalists, along with American and German climate scientists. A one-sided, witch-hunting publication designed to destroy the reputation of prominent dissenters is not the same as the cold-blooded murder of college students of course, but serves as an illustration of a similar attitude of intolerance and frustration with respect to an unwanted debate. It should warn us of where this is headed.
One of the attacked German journalists, Günter Ederer, has responded at the Achse des Guten. What follows is his commentary in English, translated with permission from Ederer.

How I got on the “black list” of the German Federal Environment Agency
By Günter Ederer
Either I am stupid, or I am corrupt. In the least, however, I am naïve and unteachable and for that reason I am dangerous. No matter what, the German Environment Agency does not allow any room for doubt in its publication “Und sie erwärmt sich doch” (And indeed it continues to warm) when it comes to the unstoppable increase in global temperature. Here, along with my highly esteemed colleagues Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, we are the journalists who have been specifically named in the publication as those who deny climate change and spread nonsensical things. Since then, I’ve been torn between a sense of pride for having been taken so seriously, and complete amazement by how recklessly a state authority is prepared to go in defaming freedom of expression.
I have been pilloried because bureaucrats of the “Bundesklimakammer” have identified me as a “climate denier“, that is a partial nut job – a relative of the “Holocaust denier“, i.e. criminal and dangerous. That justifies the “official destruction of reputation by the state“, as written by the Weltwoche of Zurich to describe the behavior of the German Federal Environment Agency. Yet, there is only one thing: I do not deny climate change.

Icy periods and warm periods have been occurring for hundreds of thousands of years, dramatic climate changes that have shaped our Earth. For the last 30 years we have been told of “manmade climate change” and the ongoing dispute of whether and to what extent this is responsible for our current weather. Nigel Calder, former publisher of the New Scientist and science editor of the BBC, wrote in 1997 in the book The Manic Sun that scientists reached the conclusion that our climate was dominated by the sun. During my two-day visit he summarized his findings in one sentence: All parties in Europe, whether left or right, will go along the warming theory because the permission to tax the air we breath will be granted for the first time, and would even be praised because they it will be for rescuing the planet.
Since then I’ve been forced to acknowledge that Calder was right. The rise in CO2, and the danger of the global collapse associated with it, is the brilliant excuse for higher taxes and the expansion of state power. One product of this fear-mongering is the EEG energy feed-in act. Here the state guarantees that an unlimited amount of power is bought from producers at an exorbitant price. This is a pure centrally planned economy – one that would be unimaginable without the threat of a world collapse. How else can one explain the German SPD socialist party allowing its clientele, the “little folks”, to pay billions to the wealthy and owners of vast areas of roofs through their electric bills? How  else do we explain that the other parties like the FDP liberal democrats and the conservative CDU, who even today continue to extol the virtues of Ludwig Erhard’s market economy, are calling on consumers to pay for an offshore liability fee – in addition to the feed-in act costs? This fee is nothing less than forcing consumers to pay for the investment risks of large corporations. Should a federal government agency be allowed to warn the public of a journalist because that journalist supports a market economy? Yes, I do become skeptical when I read the comments of Klimaretter claiming democracy must be “developed further” because it is not capable of protecting our planet. The director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber wants to scale back voting rights and award a greater say to scientists who know what is right for the people. Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the IPCC, argues in a similar manner. The suspicion that this is no longer about the climate, but more about the de-democratizing of states is surely justified. Most likely I find myself on the “bad-guys-list” because I have written about these tendencies – so far I have written nothing about the physics of our atmosphere.
In its publication the German Environment Agency insists that the science of global warming by CO2 is conclusively settled. Here the officials rely on the results of the IPCC. My Canadian colleague Donna Laframboise, together with 80 volunteers, made the effort to check all 18,531 scientific papers cited by the IPCC. That effort found that 5587 of these works originated from environmental activists who neither studied climate science nor were experts. She was able to show that the “leading” scientists were often not even students and that the results of studies had been falsified or rewritten. But the climate fear-mongers do not read any of this, neither in the government offices or in editorial rooms.
Even the Deutsche Journalisten Verband (German Association of Journalists) and the Wissenschafts Pressekonferenz e.V (Science Press Conference) and organized journalists requested Federal Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier to stop the UBA publication and to apologize to the pilloried journalists. However, Altmaier sees no reason to act. To me this is the most troubling aspect of the entire affair. Not because a Minister refuses to apologize to us, but because we have a Minister who is so thick-skinned that he believes that it is normal for a government agency to have sole claim to the representation of science and to strip the freedom of expression from journalists who in his eyes are inappropriate. For our country this is more dangerous than a global warming that is currently not even taking place.

"Thirty-thousand people across the UK have been randomly chosen to take part in a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency convened by MPs. Invitations to the assembly, which will be held over four weekends in Birmingham from January to mid-March, are due to arrive from Wednesday next week.  Only 110 of the 30,000 people will take part in Climate Assembly UK, at which they will be asked to discuss how the UK should respond to the climate emergency and what policies they would like to see implemented to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, now enshrined in law. Those selected to take part will be demographically representative of the country. The initiative comes from six select committees of MPs, which have managed to get the invitations out before parliament is dissolved for the election, so the next government will receive a full report on the outcome. Citizens’ assemblies have been used in other countries to respond to complex and emotive national issues, such as abortion in Ireland, and have been advocated by some as a response to Brexit. Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “Adopting the net-zero target was a major milestone for the UK, reflecting the strong cross-party support for action on climate change. We now need to set out a clear roadmap, and finding solutions which are equitable and have public support will be crucial. Parliament needs to work with the people and with government to address the issue of climate change.” The £520,000 cost of Climate Assembly UK is being met partly by the House of Commons, providing £120,000, with the rest split between two philanthropic foundations, the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and the European Climate Foundation. Some campaigners also want to ensure politicians do not try to use assemblies as a way to put off taking urgent action on emissions while waiting for consensus to be built on some of the trickier questions. Dave Timms, the head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth, said: “Much of what needs to be done already commands widespread public support and it is politicians that just need to bloody well get on with it now.” The Liberal Democrats and the Green party have supported the idea of citizens’ assemblies to assist government decision-making. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem climate change spokeswoman, said: “It is vital that citizens from across the UK are directly involved with ending the climate emergency – but this must be more than a talking shop. “It is deeply disappointing that the Tory government have failed to take the lead. If they were serious about tackling the climate emergency, they wouldn’t leave it to backbench MPs.” Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said: “Tackling the climate emergency is not an issue just for politicians. It needs to include everyone or we will not succeed in building a sustainable, just and fair society. Citizens’ assemblies are the ideal vehicle to do this and I warmly welcome this initial step.” Separately, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, has announced a review of the economics of reaching the net-zero target, including ways to use government policy to generate green growth and prevent the UK from exporting the emissions from manufacturing goods to other countries. “The UK is leading the way on tackling climate change as the first major economy to legislate for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,” he said. “We must all play a part in protecting the planet for future generations. This review is a vital next step in delivering that commitment, ensuring that we can end our contribution to global warming, while supporting growth and balancing costs, to avoid placing unfair burdens on families or businesses.”"
"The first female boss of a major British bank has pledged to make the climate crisis a priority as she took over the top job at Royal Bank of Scotland. Alison Rose said she would build a more “open and, accessible and inclusive” bank following years of scandal at the state-owned lender. Rose said she would reveal her new strategy for the bank in the new year, but sought to draw a line under the past following the departure of Ross McEwan, who led the bank since 2013. “At the heart of how I will run the bank is my conviction that if our customers do well, if our economy does well and if our communities do well, then we all succeed together,” Rose wrote. “Shared success also means playing our part to help tackle the problems that can hold the country back, like the threat from climate change, a lack of financial confidence and barriers to enterprise and growth. These pillars will form part of our strategy.” Addressing staff later on Friday morning, she said that under her leadership RBS would be taking “bold actions to play a driving role in helping the UK transition to a low-carbon economy”. But Rose is not expected to overhaul RBS’ fossil fuel financing policy which was unveiled last year. It states that RBS will not fund Arctic oil or oil sands projects and will cut lending to firms profiting largely from coal.  Rose is the first female chief executive to lead one of the UK’s big four lenders, after climbing the corporate ladder during a 27-year career at RBS. Her predeccessor, Ross McEwan, had led the bank since 2013. She takes over at a turning point for the lender, which is still working to gain back trust following a string of scandals and its £45bn state bailout following the lender’s near collapse in 2008. It is 62%-owned by the taxpayer. Over the past 10 years, the lender has been hit with claims that it mis-sold toxic mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the global credit crunch, and that it pushed small businesses towards failure in order to sell their assets for profit. Rose takes over an institution with fewer legal problems, after the bank reached a $4.9bn (£3.8bn) settlement with US authorities and the City watchdog confirmed it would not punish the bank for mistreating business customers following the financial crash. Rose did not say whether her new strategy would involve job cuts, but Unite – the trade union that represents RBS workers – said staff needed to be reassured after years of upheaval under its former boss. Unite’s national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: “Everybody feels a mixture of nerves and excitement when they start a new job, but for Alison Rose there is an incredible opportunity to turn things around at RBS. “Unite members are concerned about the security of their jobs, pay and reward, flexible working practices, increased stress and pressure upon their mental health, unreasonable targets and the gender pay gap. Now is the time for urgent change within the bank.” MacGregor said employees were understandably nervous, having watched thousands of colleagues lose their jobs since the financial crisis. “They have seen the name of their employer, often appearing daily in the media, linked to numerous scandals or regulatory fines for poor practices. The workforce of RBS has had to pay for the mistakes made by the bank’s management.” RBS employs around 67,000 people. Rose said in her letter that she wanted RBS to be “more open, more accessible and more inclusive,” and wanted to develop better communication with staff. She added that there would be more opportunities to provide feedback to the bank’s leadership. She wrote: “With a defining period for the banking sector ahead of us, we will deliver a dynamic, confident response to the challenges we face and build a purposeful bank that is trusted by its customers, plays its part in society and delivers for its investors.”"
"Australia could set a path to 100% renewable electricity, a highly reliable grid and significantly cheaper wholesale prices than today by introducing a handful of policies consistent with the Morrison government’s election platform, the economist Ross Garnaut says. Writing in his new book, Superpower, which builds on his advice to Labor governments in 2008 and 2011 to set out a vision for a low-carbon future, Garnaut says introducing three policies that align with the government’s commitments could “increase the chances of a strong outcome”.  He says embracing low-carbon opportunities could lead to a clean electricity system more than three times the existing capacity that powers a transformed economy, including electric transport and new and expanded industries in minerals smelting. “I have no doubt that intermittent renewables could meet 100% of Australia’s electricity requirements by the 2030s, with high degrees of security and reliability, and at wholesale prices much lower than experienced in Australia over the past half dozen years,” Garnaut writes. “More importantly, I now have no doubt that, with well-designed policy support, firm power in globally transformative quantities could be supplied to one or more industrial locations whenever it is required in each state, at globally competitive prices.” Garnaut’s recommendations include: Rewarding private investors who pay for new long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines, boosting the reliability and security. Fully adopting a consumer watchdog recommendation that it use the green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to underwrite smaller electricity generators to provide “firm” power supply contracts at low price. The government has embraced this in part, but the project shortlist focuses on “peaking” power rather than overall supply, and the process of choosing and underwriting the developments has been opaque. Breaking Snowy Hydro in two, so the existing generator and retailer is separate to a new body responsible for reliability. The new corporation – which Garnaut calls the Snowy Hydro Guarantee, or Sneg – would be required to ensure constant capacity to balance supply and demand across the grid. It would use the cheapest firm generation, whether from the planned “Snowy 2.0” expansion or other pumped hydro developments, batteries or demand management. Prices would have to remain below a maximum level set by the Coag energy council. Now a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne and the chair of the advisory board to the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub, Garnaut set out the three steps in lectures before the election, conscious they were consistent with the policies of both major parties. He said an emissions trading scheme, as he previously recommended and what the mislabelled “carbon tax” would have become had it not been repealed, remained an economically and environmentally superior option but he recognised it was not feasible now or in the foreseeable future. “There’s no need to do any more than those things in the electricity sector this electoral term,” he said. “Once everyone sees that we’re on a path to more secure, reliable, lower cost power that is giving a new future to Australian industry it will introduce some momentum.” Superpower builds on the knowledge, yet to take hold in some political and media discussions, that Australia implicitly signed up to a goal of net zero global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 when it joined the 2015 Paris agreement. More than 60 countries have set targets of net zero emissions by 2050. Australia has a 2030 target of a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels but, like China and the US, has not set a longer-term target. Australia’s emissions have increased each year since 2015. Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, has appointed a panel headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia, to make quick suggestions on ways to improve the emissions reduction fund, the government’s main climate policy. Garnaut found that, even more than when his first review was published in 2008, Australia had more to lose from escalating emissions than other wealthy nations and more to gain from acting. If Australia rose to the climate challenge it would emerge as a “global superpower in energy, low carbon industry and absorption of carbon in the landscape”. He said the cost of cutting emissions had fallen “far below” what modelling suggested 11 years ago. “No other developed country has a comparable opportunity for large-scale, firm, zero-emissions power, supplied at low cost,” he said. In 2008, he found the world moving to tackle rising emissions would hurt the competitiveness of Australian industries in the short term. But the dramatic decline in the cost of renewable energy had brought forward by a decade the time when cheap wind and solar power could provide the country with an advantage in energy-intensive manufacturing. Along with the expected development of green hydrogen, it could help make Australia a natural home for expanded industries in aluminium, steel, silicon and ammonia. He said this would benefit regional centres in every state, including the Pilbara in Western Australia, the Upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia, Portland and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Newcastle in NSW, Townsville, Gladstone and Mackay in Queensland and parts of Tasmania. Garnaut found Australia has also barely begun to explore the extent to which it could build an industry out of capturing carbon in soils, woodlands and forests. Superpower suggests up to 1bn tonnes a year could be captured, nearly twice Australia’s annual emissions. “It is of national economic consequence that we undertake the research to define the scale of and the means of unlocking the opportunity,” he said. He said tapping that value would require creating a market. Initially, that could involve offsetting fugitive emissions, particularly from new liquefied natural gas production, which are the main reason national pollution has increased. In the longer term, credits would need to be sold on the European market (where the carbon price is currently equivalent to about A$40) and other international markets as they emerged."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a first and quite possibly a watershed event when it comes to media sentiment towards green energies. It appears it’s no longer taboo in Germany to mock green energy.
In the past German public television and mainstream media always kept the wagons circled around the anthropogenic global warming theory and the Energiewende (transition from fossil fuels and nuclear power over to renewable energies). Now it is becoming the butt of jokes and surprisingly sharp satire on late-night German comedy shows.
)
Last Friday ZDF German television (Germany’s version of the BBC) launched a blistering parody at the now collapsing Energiewende. The German government obstinately refuses to acknowledge that it is a monumental failure and will never work. Late-night comedian Oliver Welke openly calls the Energiewende a religion: “All you have to do is believe.”
When ZDF television mocks the project, then you know it’s in very serious trouble.
The parody stems from Angela Merkel’s grand coalition government’s refusal to accept the findings of an expert commission who gives the Energiewende project a grade of “F-minus”. Welke openly asks if Angela Merkel’s Grosse Koalition (grand coalition) government – abbreviated GroKo – formed with Sigmar Gabriel’s center-left SPD Social Deomcrat party “has gone nuts” after refusing to listen to the advice of the experts.
At the 0:57 mark, Welke reiterates the findings of the commission: “The green power subsidy is causing the power price to go up and leads to less climate protection.” Adding at the 1:17  mark: “Why are they doing that? It’s totally illogical.”
Albrecht Humboldt joins Welke in the parody, confirming at the 1:28 mark that the Energiewende makes no sense but that this is all beside the point. It is something “you just have to believe in! The Energiewende works only if we all really believe in it!” he proclaims sarcastically.
At the 1:47 mark Welke demonstrates to the audience just how nuts the Energiewende has become:
Last year every German forked out €240 for green power fees…babies, seniors, every German. A total of 21.8 billion euros for power that on the market has a value of only €2 billion. That’s sick!”

This quality of criticism Welke aims at the Energiewende in Germany is unprecedented in sharpness and cynicism for mainstream media. The wheels the green-energy wagon are truly coming off in Europe. The green-energy dream is in irreversible collapse.
The remainder of the harsh parody mocks the Energiewende as a religion that requires full faith from its followers. Though the brunt of the jokes is aimed at the GroKo (grand coalition government) the real target is the Energiewende and the policy of early retirement at age 63.
At the 4:25 mark Tina Hausten sarcastically tells the audience:
Stop questioning the policies. Thinking about them just gives you a headache! Just pay and be happy!”
To which everyone responds by singing: “Oh happy days!”
At 4.29 Welke says: “This new GroKo sect is starting to scare me!”
At the very end at the 6:10 mark Welke makes it official:
Yes, so the GroKo is now officially deemed a religion.”
I’ve prepared a rough transcript of the entire parody in English and have sent it over to Hajo Smit at Climategate.nl here, who will add English subtitles to above video.

"The latest eruption of Mount Sinabung in Sumatra killed seven people and injured two others. After lying dormant for 400 years, Sinabung has erupted several times since 2010 and is now Indonesia’s most active volcano. Locals have maintained a close watch as the official alert status has fluctuated, and thousands had already been evacuated long before the eruption. But many villagers remained in the area – and outsiders may well wonder why, given the volcano’s recent history, people would not only live near the “red zone” (the restricted area within 3km of the summit) but also regularly venture into it. Surely local people know the risks of a “pyroclastic” cloud of superheated gas? This is a question we’ve looked at in our research. The recent large eruption had an added personal component – we were leading a team that had been investigating why people continued to live near the red zone. Our researchers had been distributing questionnaires and conducting interviews in the village of Gamber and other villages bordering the red zone right up to the previous Tuesday, May 17. On several occasions, smaller eruptions sent huge plumes of superheated gas into the sky as well as down the slopes of the mountain towards inhabited villages. We were cautious – we monitored the situation closely and were ready to evacuate quickly if we needed to. We witnessed these eruptions with a mixture of excitement, awe and fear. This contrasted with the calm and – sometimes – complete indifference of locals.  The main eruption on May 22 sent a pyroclastic flow 4.5kms down the mountain, eventually reaching Gamber. Our experience in the field and knowledge of the devastating effects of other eruptions and natural hazards in Indonesia – such as the eruption of Mount Merapi in 2010 – meant that the latest tragic deaths were, sadly, not a surprise to us. Villagers regularly go into the red zone to farm their land, for instance. But the villages themselves can face the additional risk of “lahars”: potentially torrential flowing mixtures of water and rock fragments caused by heavy rainfall on the mountain. In the second week of our fieldwork, two children and one adult had been killed and a further child and adult were missing as a result of lahars not far from Gamber. While we are not yet ready to report on people’s thoughts and actions in the week prior to the latest eruptions, there are some preliminary answers. Previous research tells us the key factors explaining why people live in these dangerous situations are attachment to place and the protection of their livelihoods as well as a capacity to adapt to natural hazards and the reduced perception of risk that involves.  A recent review by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies highlighted the need for external agencies and organisations to set aside their own conceptions of risk and engage seriously with the “alternative rationalities” of local people. Considerations about whether to stay, relocate independently or be relocated by the government to other locations should reflect the priorities of villagers and their community identities.  In the case of Gamber and other villages like it, many are reluctant to leave land owned by generations of ancestors as long as they can also continue to make a living from it. And, while people may not seem to fear being injured or killed by an eruption, we heard that some are less likely to visit their land within the red zone when there are no volunteer observers from a local group watching the mountain. Our research at Mount Sinabung also tells us that people who have been permanently relocated from the red zone to new villages far from the mountain appear to have a better quality of life and less risk of health problems from dense ash clouds, for instance. In contrast, many people who have been temporarily evacuated to shelters (known as “Posko”) are in a desperate situation. They live in poor conditions with few offers of work and concerns about the quality of government-provided food. Some have now lived like this since 2010. Villages outside the red zone have been designated safe by authorities but regular ash falls affect their health and reduce their ability to maintain farmland. For some, the ongoing eruptions will probably mean that their status as “refugees” will change soon. In this context, what impact can our research hope to have? Cultural change might occur by, for example, educating young people about the risks and encouraging them to change the activities of their parents. And we hope to provide evidence of how living so close to a volcano affects the psychology, health and well-being of villagers. This will turn, allow related interventions to be developed.  Our findings may also demonstrate the importance of community-led initiatives, such as volunteer groups formed of local villagers, in facilitating communications with authorities about imminent threats and the need to evacuate. Living near the volcano is dangerous and complicated but support and solutions are possible."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDieter Dürand and Sven Titz write at Germany’s flagship business weekly Wirtschaftswoche (English: Business Week) that it’s high time for a new climate policy in the wake of the massive IPCC failures.

Germany’s “Wirtschaftswoche” publishes unusually harsh article on IPCC science.
Fear-driven science is a failure
The authors write of scientists using “horror scenarios” to scare leaders into rash policymaking. Wirtschaftswoche cites three examples: hunger, war, and species extinction. They add:
The facts refute many end-of-world prophesies or at least greatly diminish them. …the time is ripe for a new climate policy.”
Wirtschaftswoche describes a science that has been dominated by doomsday-sayers and shoddy computer simulations and gives a list of examples of totally botched predictions.
The German business weekly is the latest in a string of German flagship media outlets to openly express skepticism and dissastisfaction with IPCC science and to harshly criticize IPCC results. Wirtschaftswoche writes:
Humbly and quietly the IPCC is forced to admit that the central mechanism for global warming is not functioning like the scientists said it would, at least for the time being. […] Even though CO2 concentrations are increasing like the scientists have said it would, global warming has paused for 15 years. No IPCC climate model had predicted that.”
Moreover, Wirtschaftswoche adds that “scientists are urgently scrambling for an explanation“:
One thing is clear, something cannot be right with the previous simulations. The climate is obviously reacting far less sensitively to the rise in greenhouse gases than feared.
Mann’s hockey stick among top 5 climate bloopers

Wirtschaftswoche also highlights the top 5 grossly blundered claims made by IPCC scientists: 1) increasing cyclone frequency, 2) the hockey stick chart, 3) rapidly melting sea ice, 4) melting Himalayan glaciers, 5) Africa threatened by starvation. All of these have turned out to be false, writes Wirtschftswoche.
On Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart: The magazine writes:
There’s a suspicion that scientists led by US climatologist Michael Mann ‘smoothed’ the climate curve in order to underscore drama.”
Wirtschaftswoche also expresses surprise that Antarctic sea ice is near record highs and that cyclones are not growing in frequency, and that the IPCC only mentions extreme weather frequency on the very fringes of its report. In summary the business weekly concludes that much is rotten with the current state of IPCC science, and thus it is indeed “time for a new climate policy“.
Richard Tol: all cost, no benefit
To be fair, Wirtschaftswoche insists that the risks of manmade climate change cannot be underestimated and that steps should be taken to curb emissions. But the authors also caution against throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Climate policy has to make sense, and this has not been the case, Wirtschaftswoche writes. The magazine cites economist Richard Tol:
Dutch environmental economist Richard Tol has compared the costs and benefits. By the year 2100 the EU will have pumped nearly 15 trillion euros into climate protection. That amount of money however brakes the temperature rise only 0.05°C.”
Moreover, Wirtschaftswoche writes stricter CO2 emission standards for automobiles would add 3600 euros to the price tag of each automobile, making mobility for the poor a daunting task.
Wirtschaftswoche has nothing against those who wish to protect the climate, but argues that “the means must be effective. In the end if both climate and the economy are driven into the ground, no one will be helped.”
Wirtschaftswoche’s top 6 doomsday sayers
Wirtschaftswoche also lists its top 6 doomsday-sayers of climate change: 6) Michael Mann: past climate like a hockey stick, 5) Angela Merkel: 4°C rise likely, 4) Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber: Sahara may extend to Berlin, 3) Nicholas Stern: worst climate in 30 million years, 2) Rajendra Pachauri: heatwave warnings, and no. 1 (no surprise here) Al Gore for his catastrophic sea level rise warnings.
It’s beginning to dawn on Germans that climate science has been much less about science, and much more about hoax. Expect more critical articles soon. The climate change issue is sinking faster than the Titanic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNews of the NOAA’s miserable, failed 2013 hurricane prediction performance has spread to Europe.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site took a look at the results. They compare the official NOAA prognoses from
May 23, 2013:
NOAA predicts active 2013 Atlantic hurricane season – Era of high activity for Atlantic hurricanes continues 
For the six-month hurricane season, which begins June 1, NOAA’s Atlantic Hurricane Season Outlook says there is a 70 percent likelihood of 13 to 20 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 7 to 11 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3 to 6 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; winds of 111 mph or higher).”

NOAA: Slow Atlantic hurricane season coming to a close: No major hurricanes formed in the Atlantic basin – first time since 1994 
The 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Saturday, Nov. 30, had the fewest number of hurricanes since 1982, thanks in large part to persistent, unfavorable atmospheric conditions over the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and tropical Atlantic Ocean. This year is expected to rank as the sixth-least-active Atlantic hurricane season since 1950, in terms of the collective strength and duration of named storms and hurricanes. […] Thirteen named storms formed in the Atlantic basin this year. Two, Ingrid and Humberto, became hurricanes, but neither became major hurricanes. Although the number of named storms was above the average of 12, the numbers of hurricanes and major hurricanes were well below their averages of six and three, respectively. Major hurricanes are categories 3 and above.”
Scientists Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s conclusion:
This year’s failed prognoses show just how difficult forecasts still can be. In regards to these prognoses, forecasts for an entire century into the future are even more questionable. While annual forecasts at least can be checked and compared to the actual development, this is certainly not possible for prognoses up to the year 2100. The followers of the climate catastrophe theory gleefully exploit this. Activists scientists such as Stefan Rahmstorf or Mojib Latif would be well-advised to be more careful with their argumentation and to be more clear about the huge uncertainties.”
Please note that Lüning and Vahrenholt are not being overly critical of the NOAA, but simply just want to point out that climate scientists shouldn’t be so cocky about their predictions – especially those dealing with the future, let alone 100 years out.

"The next great plague has descended, and this time it’s moths. Diamondback moths have been crossing the English Channel over the past fortnight in far greater numbers than usual.  Those of you reaching for moth-balls and carpet sprays, stop. There are only two species of British moth (from a cast of thousands) that damage clothes, and the diamondback is not one of them. You, the reader, really don’t need to worry – unless you grow cruciferous vegetables like cabbages or broccoli. Plutella xylostella – more commonly known as the diamondback – is one of the world’s most widespread and prevalent agricultural pests; so widespread, indeed, that scientists disagree as to where exactly its native range lies.  Their success belongs in part to their preference as caterpillars for eating plants in the Brassicaceae family. This amazing group of crops (notably the species Brassica oleracea) has been selectively bred over hundreds of years to make use of almost every part of the plant, and now contains many popular vegetables such as cabbages, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and turnips, as well as oil-seed rape. The moths lay eggs on brassica leaves; a week later, caterpillars hatch and start eating. An infested plant can quickly be reduced to little more than leaf stems. Despite being one of the smallest moth species to occur in the UK, with a wingspan of under 15mm, diamondbacks are capable of dispersing vast distances, using the wind to make up for their small size. Research has shown that without assistance, diamondbacks are only capable of flying 35 metres – yet when carried along by the wind, they may travel hundreds of miles in a single day. It is this ability to disperse that leads it to British shores. Every summer, adults cross the Channel and attempt to breed in the UK. A number of butterfly and moth species employ this strategy. In some cases, such as the Painted Lady butterfly, the offspring will return south ahead of the winter. For others, including diamondbacks, the offspring will attempt to remain, but British winters are typically too cold for them to survive.  For the moths, these fatalities are an unfortunate side effect of a highly dispersive life history; by having offspring constantly travelling beyond the edge of their range and attempting to breed, the moths ensure that no available space is wasted. Should some of the dispersing moths find a new area that is suitable for breeding success, they will benefit enormously from a lack of competition with their peers and, potentially, the absence of specialised predators and parasites. Thus, evolution favours and preserves these intrepid explorers. And it is once the moths begin to breed that the problems begin for farmers and gardeners, because these are not your average pest. Diamondback has been referred to in some coverage as a “super-moth”. It’s a title it certainly deserves.  The species has proven itself to be extraordinarily adept at evolving resistance to pesticides. Wild populations have developed significant resistance to almost every significant synthetic insecticide in use, including one of the main classes, pyrethroids.  Perhaps more impressively, diamondback was the first insect recorded to have developed resistance in the field to the bacterial pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis; only one other species is known to have managed this since (the “cabbage looper”, a pest moth named after its favourite food). Interestingly, this has led scientists to target it with the same genetic tools as are employed against the mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever and Zika virus. Field trials are planned in the US for this summer. In the short-term, perhaps. The influx of moths will soon begin to produce larvae, and these may cause substantial damage to crops where they are able to escape death by insecticide. The damage will be most severe to farmers of leaf crops, such as cabbages or kale, as the holes left behind in leaves by caterpillars make the crop unsellable. Looking at the longer term, this year’s invasion will die out over the winter. Next year there will be another, but this is nothing new: these moths come to the UK every year in substantial numbers. I spent the summer of 2014 collecting moths on farms in Oxfordshire for a study on the effects of light pollution on moths. Out of the 203 species of moth I recorded, diamondback was the 26th most common, forming around 1% of my total catch. Britain’s cabbage-growers have been dealing with diamondback for years and have managed to persist thus far. They may have a hard summer ahead of them but it is not without hope. Although globally diamondbacks have developed resistance to almost all pesticides, most populations are only resistant to a subset of these, and scientists at Rothamsted Research are already studying the current influx to identify their weaknesses. Armed with the results of that research, farmers may be capable of restricting the damage."
"Panama has been in the news for other reasons recently, but paleoclimatologists have long known of its significance. In fact, the formation of this thin strip of land between North and South America may be one of the key events in Earth’s history. Today, the Panama Canal is one of the world’s most important shipping lanes, allowing large ships to go straight between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans while avoiding longer and often more dangerous routes around the tip of South America.  But this isn’t the first time there has been an equatorial connection between our two largest oceans. More than 20m years ago, Panama and much of Central America was under water or, more accurately, much of this land mass was yet to form, and water flowed freely between these two climatically important ocean basins. Once you zoom out to geological timescales of millions of years, it becomes apparent that plate tectonics – continents drifting around the Earth’s surface – have a huge impact on the climate. The position of continents naturally affects the shape and size of the oceans, and crucially, the currents that flow within them that transport energy (in the form of heat) to different parts of the globe. In this case, the shallowing and eventual closure of the Panama “gateway” and creation of the Isthmus of Panama, where both continents become connected by land, strengthened what we call the “Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation”, a current that transports warm equatorial waters north and is responsible for Europe’s mild winters. This played a crucial role in shaping our modern climate system.  None of this happened overnight. What’s now Panama lies on the boundaries of the South and North American, Caribbean and Cocos plates, and collisions between these huge masses around 23-25m years ago led to rises in the seafloor and the formation of underwater volcanoes. Over time, these eventually emerged above the water line.  By 7m to 11m years ago, the volcanoes had grown, and the sea had become shallow enough that deep water exchange between the Pacific and Atlantic is thought to have ceased, leading to a reorganisation of oceanic currents. Finally, around 3m years ago, a land bridge emerged, connecting both North and South America. Or so the story goes …  Establishing the timeline is crucial in piecing together the Panama gateway’s climatic role, yet new evidence suggests the closure was earlier than previously thought. Fossils of both terrestrial and marine species suggest closure may now even date back to around 20m years ago, when there were periods of land chains above sea level, although likely not fully connected. This is 17m years earlier than first suggested. Although land species were moving between the continents as far back as around 20m years ago, it wasn’t significant until 6m years ago, implying that there must have still been inhibitors to mass migration of species between these land masses before then.  The recent removal of sediment for the new expansion of the Panama Canal unearthed 20m year old fossilised trees, adding further weight to an earlier closure hypothesis. The same study also suggests that the isthmus may have even formed an uninterrupted chain of land between the Late Eocene (20m-30m years ago) to the Late Miocene (11m-5m years ago), further compounding the long and complex history of this climate-altering event. The shoaling and eventual closure of the Panama gateway was a key reason for glaciation in the northern hemisphere. As winds in the atmosphere often respond to what is occurring in the ocean below, changes in ocean circulation that developed with the shallowing and closure of the Panama seaway led to warm, moist winds blowing northwards. This fresh water held in the atmosphere was deposited at high latitudes where glaciers and ice sheets could form. Analysis of geological data has shown that despite an open Panama gateway (no isthmus) the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation was unaffected during the Pliocene (around 2-5m years ago). This casts doubt on the key importance of complete isolation between the Atlantic and Pacific. Indeed, conventional geologic theory on the role of the Panama seaway is being challenged. Some argue that greater heat transport towards the poles (in the form of a stronger gulf stream) may have actually hindered ice growth and delayed glaciation in the northern hemisphere. One climate modelling study suggested though that the increased moisture transport outweighs the increase in temperature, supporting the hypothesis that the closure intensified northern hemisphere glaciations through changes in oceanic circulation. The closure of Panama, and the end of deep water currents flowing between oceans, is not solely responsible for kicking off the ice ages. Other primary factors include decreasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, changes in the Earth’s axis, and long-term “wobbles” which meant the poles received less sun.  However, we can say the transformation of Panama from seaway to isthmus played a crucial role in shaping our present day climate. It’s a great example of how geography and climate are linked: one small strip of newly-created land changed the planet forever."

By Ed Caryl
Everyone Is Correct – Just At Different Times.
Since the time of the patron saint of Climatologists, Svante August Arrhenius, climate researchers have been attempting to pin down climate sensitivity, the amount of warming that various constituents will cause when present in the atmosphere. This is not limited to carbon dioxide, as other gases and substances also warm and cool the atmosphere to varying degrees.  The chart below is from the IPCC AR4 Summary for Policymakers.

Figure 1:is found here as figure as SPM2
The IPCC believes carbon dioxide as about 55% of the positive forcing, and methane as about 16%. But water vapor is missing as a contributor in this chart, except as clouds, a reflector. Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas. Water vapor is highly variable in the atmosphere. Over oceans relative humidity is usually close to 100%, over deserts it can be close to zero. Absolute water vapor content is also variable with temperature. In the tropics water vapor is very high. In the Arctic and Antarctic, in winter when it is very cold, water vapor is very low.

Figure 2 is Global Relative humidity in the Troposphere. Source here. A similar chart is available here  along with global maps for water vapor and methane. Click on Greenhouse gases in the sidebar, then select the gas of interest. Methane sources are mostly tropical.
The IPCC believes that water vapor increases with temperature, acting as a positive feedback, further increasing temperature. But this is not happening. Global weather balloon data shows that water vapor has been decreasing over time, not increasing.
Why should tropospheric humidity decrease with temperature increasing? The answer is that humidity in the upper atmosphere is largely driven by thunderstorms (convection), and thunderstorms have been increasing.

Figure 3 is the thunderstorm frequency at Hong Kong since 1947. Source here.

Most thunderstorm activity is in the tropics, and Hong Kong is subtropical at 22°N latitude, so should be representative of global activity. The data shows a low during the cool 1960’s, and a high in the warm 1990’s, with an increase of 1.7 days/decade, roughly tracking global and local temperature. Local temperature at the Royal Observatory in Hong Kong has not been corrected for local heat island, or “homogenized” by GISS. I could find no global data for thunderstorm frequency.

Figure 4 are the steps in thunderstorm maturation. Source Wikipedia.
 
Figure 5 is the aftermath of a thunderstorm/hailstorm, near La Luz, New Mexico, USA, August 2009. Source is the author.
Thunderstorms operate by convection. As the surface heats up, air rises. If that air contains moisture, as the air rises and cools, the moisture condenses, giving up more heat. This can result in towering clouds that produce hail and rain. This leads to rapid surface cooling and heat transport to the stratosphere. The rising air is depleted of water vapor resulting in drying at all levels in the troposphere up to the stratosphere. If there are more thunderstorms, there is more drying and surface cooling. The heat transported to the stratosphere is then transported poleward by Hadley Cell circulation and radiated to space. This is one reason for the poles (at least the north pole) warming more than the tropics.
Thunderstorms are nature’s thermostats. This is easily observed. On a hot summer’s day, in the heat of the afternoon, rising thermals turn into cumulus clouds and then into rising thunderheads, followed by rain and sometimes hail. Surface temperatures under the clouds of 105°F (40.5°C) can drop to 60°F (15.5°C) in minutes. The winds felt on the ground are just the bottom portion of a loop of air that extends up through the clouds outside or trailing edge and down in the rain. At the end of the storm, when the clouds dissipate, what is left is dry air. The moisture is now on the ground as water or hailstones and the heat has been lifted to the tropopause. In temperate latitudes it may take several days for heat and humidity to build up and begin the cycle again. In the tropics, the cycle may begin the next day.
The most important area for climate regulation on earth is the tropics, and the tropics are where there is the most water vapor and where most thunderstorms occur. Thunderstorms do two things: they move heat from the surface to the top of the tropopause, and the associated clouds reflect solar heating to space. They also set the earth’s sea surface temperature thermostat to 30°C. See Willis Eschenbach’s article on the subject here. As the earth warms, more sea surface will reach the thermostat set point, and more heat will be shunted away by clouds and thunderstorms, either as short-wave reflected from the cloud tops, or long wave radiated from the top of the atmosphere. This naturally reduces climate sensitivity to more greenhouse warming. Climate sensitivity has changed over time. This is the reason that the early 20th century warming was as dramatic as it was with a small CO2 rise, and the late 20th Century warming was the same amplitude with a much greater CO2 rise. Here is a plot of 60-year window equilibrium climate sensitivity from 1880 to 2010 using GISStemp data and a combination of Law Dome and Keeling CO2 data.

Figure 6 is a plot of equilibrium climate sensitivity assuming a 60 year window (1880 to 1940, 1881 to 1941, and so on). The window length bridges the natural climate cycles.
As the plot shows, climate sensitivity in the early 20th Century was about 4°C for CO2 doubling, but by the turn of the Century, this had reduced to about 1.5°C. It is likely approaching zero if we take out all the GISS “adjustments” and use the true temperatures. This explains the “pause” of the last 17 years. The temperature cannot rise higher because we can’t warm beyond Mother Nature’s thermostat set point, set by the maximum sea-surface temperature.

"Wimbledon, 2026. Bright blue skies and a wonderful late afternoon sun lights up the lush green grass of centre court. Out strides the British number one and four-time winner, Andy Henman, to the cheers of the excitable, partisan crowd.  Somewhere nearby, at the headquarters of WeatherMod Inc, a group of technicians are busily checking data, confident that their efforts have worked. They have been in contact with two pilots who have just completed their spray sorties and are returning to land at Heathrow’s new third runway. Thanks to the delivery of 4kg of, in its pure form, a yellowish powder known as Silver Iodide (AgI) into clouds upwind of London, it is now raining over the Salisbury Plain, 100 miles away, and the rain predicted for later in SW19 is now 92% less likely. This scenario probably sounds a little far-fetched, and not least the bit about the repeatedly successful home-grown tennis player. However, weather modification occurs more often than most people are aware. For example, as I wrote that first paragraph I genuinely didn’t realise that a Weather Modification Incorporated actually already exists in Fargo, North Dakota. They, and other companies like them have sprung up over the past few years promising to manage water for crops, clear fog and even protect wedding days from ill-timed hail.  But two questions need further investigation to consider the likelihood of the above scenario at Wimbledon: can we do it (that is, does it work) and should we do it? Neither, it turns out, are particularly easy to answer. In order to make rain several processes need to occur. First, small particles known as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are required onto which water can condense. Then these droplets need to grow to a size where they precipitate out of the cloud, finally falling where and when required.  In our hypothetical scenario we would therefore need to be able to either control or at least predict accurately the concentration of CCN, the rate at which droplets form, and the evaporation rates within the clouds. We’d also also need to have some handle on the rate and direction in which rain would fall. In reality, cloud seeding with AgI – the current default option – only really tackles the first of these processes, forming the condensation nuclei. Even if clouds are seeded, it is still a matter of debate as to whether they actually create much additional rain. While companies claim success, some scientists are more wary. Although other seeding agents (and methodologies) exist, it is worth noting that, in the case of AgI, the nature of the clouds into which the particles are injected will govern the outcome. Seeding works best in clouds which have a pre-existing mixture of water droplets and ice, as this type of nucleation requires ice-crystals to form. Following the production of CCN we’d then need to be able to predict, through computer modelling, how small droplets will form into rain and eventually fall.  One of the major drawbacks of cloud seeding is a lack of proof that it works: given weather forecasting remains imperfect, how would you know what would have happened without intervention? The second part of the question is arguably even harder to approach. What are the ethics of removing water from one part of the world, even on a small scale, and moving it somewhere else? Is this “messing with nature” or “playing God”? Water is, after all, the most precious commodity on Earth. Let’s assume for now that it is possible to alter local weather patterns and to prevent or cause rain. This could be used for both good and evil, and the potential for abuse is worth considering. While manipulating the weather as a weapon is now explicitly outlawed by the UN’s ENMOD treaty, there have been efforts to alter the outcome of conflict using cloud seeding. Deliberate and accidental effects from commercial activity also seem possible. That dreamy, rain-free wedding ordered up by an anxious billionaire could easily ruin a school sports day in a nearby town. The question of attribution is possibly the most challenging. Without any alternative outcomes to analyse, how can you really know what are the impacts from your actions. Some even say, quite incorrectly, that cloud seeding experiments caused floods, such as those that killed 35 people in the English village of Lynmouth in 1952. Expert opinion leans strongly against that idea being correct. Nonetheless, conspiracy theories persist. If, in our hypothetical Wimbledon scenario, bits of Wiltshire flooded, who would foot the bill? It’s certainly possible in theory to prevent rain in one place by using cloud seeding to induce it in another, upwind. But there are huge challenges and the jury is still out about whether such efforts really work. There are some very good causes, such as inducing rainfall in Sub-Saharan Africa during drought, where I would sanction intervention. For something as frivolous as a sporting event I feel differently. Just last weekend I played cricket for four hours in unrelenting drizzle (thanks Skip). While not a massively enjoyable experience it was at least familiar, and is part of the essence of both cricket and tennis. There’s some comfort in that."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter a record five consecutive colder-than-normal winters, this year’s 2013/14 German meteorological winter (DJF) is coming in as a mild one, reports Germany’s DWD Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service) here.
This will be the first winter in 6 years that has been above the long-term mean, calculated for the reference period 1981-2010.
According to German weather statistics as of February 15, 2014 the DWD writes:
The summary thus far of this meteorological winter shows that the mean temperature across German was about 2.6°C. The average for the reference period of the years 1961 to 1990 is only 0.2°C, which means the current level is 2.4°C warmer. The current winter will likely be in the Top 10 warmest winters since 1881, as we reported here yesterday.”
The DWD provides a link to a page with the following chart:

The DWD writes that the 2013/14 winter likely will not make it into the Top 3 (1975, 1990 and 2007), unless an unusual warm spell takes hold for the remainder of the month.
The latest forecasts show that the mild weather will continue, thanks to the latest in a long series of low pressure systems moving in from the Atlantic which have that have pumped plenty of mild maritime air over Europe during much of the winter.
Overall, German winters over the last 20 years have been trending significantly cooler, contradicting climate models.
The chart above also shows that after the unusually warm winters, cold ones followed immediately or just a couple of years later. So don’t export this year’s surplus road salt over to the US just yet!

"Caring for zoo animals requires the ability to deal with an awful lot of poo … or dung, excrement, animal waste, or faeces (the latter being used if you want to be more technical). Shovelling the proverbial is often how we start and end our day in the zoo. But aside from ensuring that we provide animals with clean environments, this process of collecting animal poo is also a vital part of their healthcare.   A quick Web of Science search for “faeces + zoo + animal” demonstrates just how reliant we are on poo in the zoo research and veterinary community – nearly 1,000 research articles contain a reference to faecal material from animals in zoos over the past 60 years. That means that the scientific community publishes an article on zoo animal poo at least once a month.  So, as a scientist, why am I so interested? Well, first, it’s often one of the easiest samples to get hold of from a zoo animal. You don’t need to touch the animal in order to obtain the sample, so it’s non-invasive (important from both a safety and ethical perspective).  Second, all animals produce it. It comes in all shapes and sizes and some do it in vast quantities, such as the 100kg+ of dung produced daily by an elephant. But most creatures produce manageable volumes that permit analytical techniques to be employed in a reliable manner.  Finally, poo offers a wide spectrum of opportunities for assessing animal health. So what can a poo sample reveal? Let’s start with some of the more obvious aspects of poo-ology: just the presence of fresh faecal material in an animal’s enclosure assures us that the animal’s gastrointestinal tract is moving. Constipation has serious health consequences for any animal, including potential toxicities, so we need to ensure that an animal is passing faeces as often as it should be.  But this isn’t always as simple as it sounds. Some snakes only pass faeces once every three months, while the world’s smallest bat, the bumblebee bat has poo that is apparently as small as a pin head, making it very hard to see. So we need to establish our “species norms” before we start using poo as an indicator in any type of health check. Another common use of faeces in zoos is for disease monitoring. Samples can be analysed for internal parasites, such as worms and pathogens (for example bacteria or fungi) that may indicate gastrointestinal problems or even zoonotic diseases – those that can be spread from animals to humans.  Many zoos will implement a routine faecal screening programme for their animals and this allows zoo vets to respond quickly if symptoms of disease or parasites are found, often before clinical symptoms of ill health are shown by the animal. It is also a valuable tool for monitoring the effect of any treatments, such as de-wormers.  Some of the research projects that I’ve been involved in recently have investigated aspects of the use of de-wormers in cheetahs and support a diagnosis-based approach. This means that, instead of routinely de-worming the animals, we should first check to see if they have any parasites present. But it’s not just about what’s inside the poo – you can tell a lot about an animal’s gut health just by looking at its faeces.  I used a faecal consistency (shape and texture) scoring system – similar to the Bristol Stool Scale for humans – to investigate how diet influences gastrointestinal disease in captive cheetahs.   My colleagues and I were able to identify some key dietary risk factors for gastrointestinal disease in cheetahs, just by asking the cats’ keepers about their animals’ poo. For example, animals that were fed rib bones at least once a week were much less likely to have experienced diarrhoea. A similar study was conducted with captive tapir and enabled the generation of feeding recommendations aimed at reducing obesity in this species. Colour and smell are also important. For example, the faeces of raptors (which is actually a combination of urine and faeces) will turn green when the bird has an empty gastrointestinal tract. This is important when attempting to regulate meal frequency since overfeeding can lead to infections and obesity. Green faeces in raptors can also indicate lead poisoning when combined with other symptoms.   Understanding how zoo animals digest and utilise the diets we provide is an important step in improving zoo animal nutrition. We can measure the digestibility of key nutrients by analysing faecal samples, and we can also study aspects of the animals’ gastrointestinal function by using indigestible markers and recording the time it takes from ingestion to excretion of these markers.  We also use these types of markers to help us determine a poo’s owner when animals are pair or group housed. I’ve spent hours pulling zoo carnivore faeces apart looking for bits of glitter (yes, the same stuff you might find in your child’s art box), lentils, or corn kernels just to figure out whose poo is who’s.  In another study with colleagues in Belgium, faecal samples from captive cheetahs were analysed for products of hindgut fermentation (the efforts of all those microorganisms that live inside animal guts, including our own) to determine the beneficial role that animal fibre, such as cartilage, bone or fur, plays in this species.  The microbes that live inside the cheetah have also begun to be characterised, all thanks to that brown smelly stuff! As with the growing interest in the human microbiome, differences due to genetics, diet and the environment are also being characterised from a zoo animal faecal perspective.   Likewise, poo is important for monitoring zoo animals’ welfare as we can measure hormones called glucocorticoids and their metabolites which provide an indicator of excitement and/or stress. By performing long-term studies of the concentrations and patterns of these hormones in animal poo, and combining them with behavioural data, we can learn a great deal about how a zoo animal is experiencing its captive environment.   By monitoring the excretion of sex steroids, we can also start to understand whether females are displaying normal reproductive cycles, such as in captive rhinos, or even finding out if they are pregnant, such as in captive felids.  Rather less savoury is coprophagia. This is the term given to the behaviour of eating faeces, either the animal’s own, or that of others. Some species have digestive adaptations that require coprophagia to be part of their normal feeding behaviour. A well-known example is the domestic rabbit. In a zoo setting, coprophagia is also an important element of the nutritional physiology of a range of herbivores including capybaras, some lemurs, mara, and beavers. However, in some species, coprophagia is considered an abnormal behaviour which may have nutritional origins or be indicative of compromised welfare.  Regardless of how it is used, though, those caring for animals should never underestimate the importance of a poo."
"What did you do before you joined the Guardian? I did a PhD and post-doc research in geology at Edinburgh University, including an expedition to Antarctica, which was amazing: beautiful, pristine with bursts of life along the coast. But I think my attention span was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the Guardian, which was – and is! – my favourite paper.  How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the Guardian, concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal.  How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time?The Guardian has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues? The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBs What frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument. Has your work influenced/informed the way you live your life? Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons. What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home. How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then. What have been the highlights of your reporting at the Guardian so far? What has made you most proud? I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the Guardian, and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the Guardian holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the Guardian!” What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the Guardian the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment. What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Maldives and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least. What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN biodiversity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice. What makes the Guardian unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the Guardian has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."
"The ability to keep things cold is a pillar of modern society – demand is booming worldwide to deliver air conditioning, data centre cooling and transport refrigeration, particularly in emerging economies. Although our cooling technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they are also energy intensive.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that, by the end of this century, air conditioning alone will consume almost half the electricity that we generate worldwide today. Keeping things cold is highly polluting – cooling emits 7% of greenhouse gases (GHG), which is more than double aviation and shipping combined (3%) – and GHG emissions are projected to double by 2030. Large amounts of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate materials are also released, for example from the diesel engines powering transport refrigeration. And while we pollute, we are equally wasteful – the re-gasification of liquid natural gas (LNG) from its frozen state at import terminals wastes huge amounts of energy.  But what if we could recycle this wastage, simultaneously providing cold and power? Could this dramatically reduce the environmental impact and spiralling costs? The global trade in LNG has increased significantly in recent years and is vital to the energy security of a growing number of countries. LNG is natural gas that has been refrigerated to -162°C to make it compact enough to transport by tanker, but this cold energy is normally discarded during the re-gasification process. Research suggests that recycling this waste cold could generate more than US$50 a tonne (£41) in economic and social benefits. With a projected global LNG trade of 500m tonnes, this new “waste recycling” market could be worth many billions per year by 2025. Economic modelling and case studies developed in Britain, Spain, Singapore and India suggest that in “developed economies”, LNG waste cold could form the foundations of an entirely new economy – the “cold economy”. Energy would be stored and moved as cold rather than converted into electricity and then converted again to provide cooling. The cold economy is less about individual clean cold technologies – although these are vital – and more about the efficient integration of cooling with waste and renewable resources, and with the wider energy system. The cold economy approach is powerful because it recognises that there is no demand for cold in itself – but massive demand for services that depend on it. For the first time we are asking ourselves what energy services we require and how we can provide them in the least damaging ways, rather than merely how much electricity we need to generate. If the service required is cooling, current approaches such as burning diesel, which produces power and heat, or electric-powered air conditioners that expel heat into their immediate environment, are sub-optimal. Only 23 of the 111 LNG import terminals worldwide currently attempt any form of cold recovery and this is usually limited to the industrial plants close to the terminals themselves and at times when LNG is being re-gasified. The amount recycled could be raised by converting it into novel types of energy that store and transport it for use on demand, such as liquid air or liquid nitrogen. Recycling waste cold in this way would produce cheap, low-carbon, zero-emission cryogenic “fuel”. The use of LNG waste cold makes the air liquefaction process highly energy efficient and cost effective, harnessing otherwise waste packaging. The liquid nitrogen can then be stored and transported to provide cold and power on demand in buildings and vehicles or electricity to the grid. Liquid nitrogen expands 700 times when re-gasified, which can be used to drive an engine. It also exhausts loads of “cold” as it reheats from -196 to ambient which can be used to provide cooling or refrigeration.  Britain is currently developing two main energy technologies that could exploit large amounts of LNG waste cold: liquid air energy storage (LAES), which provides large-scale electricity storage for balancing the electricity grid, and cryogenic expansion engines (CEE) that are driven by liquid air or nitrogen delivering both cold and power. Due to the current grid regulations in the Britain and elsewhere – UK for example only included storage as a specific category in the capacity market for the first time in 2016 – the business case for new investment in large-scale energy storage, such as LAES, is only now starting to develop. The first application of a CEE system is a zero-emission transport refrigeration unit to displace the highly polluting secondary diesel engines used on trucks and trailers today. It is now in commercial trials with supermarket Sainsbury’s. Other applications in development with UK grant funding (APC, Innovate and Newton Fund) include a back-up electricity and cooling generator for data and food distribution centres and a “heat hybrid” engine for trucks and buses that could reduce diesel consumption by over 25%. It is estimated that projected global trade of 500m tonnes a year of LNG in 2025 could produce enough liquid air to cool almost 4m fleet-average refrigerated trucks – equal to the entire size of the global transport refrigeration fleet today. While waste cold of LNG re-gasification is a huge resource, there are also significant barriers to overcome: air liquefiers are capital intensive, plant operators are naturally risk averse – and any such project would require an entirely new business model. Barriers aside, modelling shows that recycling LNG waste cold as distributed cold and power would be profitable once demonstrated and produce significant and measurable environmental benefits. Given the urgency to meet global cooling demand growth, there is a clear need for government, industry and research institutes to convene global working groups to accelerate delivery of the cold economy with an in-depth feasibility study. This will maximise the business case through a detailed analysis of the economic, environmental, and energy resilience aspects of this approach, comparing its costs and benefits with alternative strategies for green cooling."
"The ambition in the Labour party’s new plans for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is, of course, welcome (Labour spells out 30-point plan in new green pledge, 24 October). But climate change is a global phenomenon, and the UK only emits 1% of annual world GHG emissions in contrast to China at 22%, the US 13%, the rest of the EU28 7%, and India 7%. In order to ensure that the average global atmospheric temperature is stabilised at around 1.5C-2C, thereby avoiding dramatic climate change in this century, the large emitter countries will need to significantly reduce their emissions going forward.  The work of the UK government’s independent expert group (the Committee on Climate Change) has indicated that achieving the net-zero emissions target here by 2050 will require quite dramatic interventions and changes in lifestyles. The ultimate costs of many low-carbon options – for buildings, transport, food production, consumer products and electricity generation – will disproportionately fall on the relatively poor in society. Thus climate activists or political parties that wish Britain to take a moral lead, and bring forward the date for achieving net-zero emissions from the present target of 2050, need to make clear the case and costs of doing that to ordinary citizens.Geoffrey HammondEmeritus professor, Department of mechanical engineering, University of Bath • Labour’s vision of enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches is hard to imagine.

"Eating healthy food is almost always also best for the environment, according to the most sophisticated analysis to date. The researchers said poor diets threaten society by seriously harming people and the planet, but the latest research can inform better choices. The analysis assessed the health and environmental impacts of 15 foods common in western diets and found fruit, vegetables, beans and wholegrains were best for both avoiding disease and protecting the climate and water resources. Conversely, eating more red and processed meat causes the most ill health and pollution. There were a small number of foods that bucked the trend. Fish is generally a healthy choice but has a bigger environmental footprint on average than plant-based diets. High-sugar foods, such as biscuits and fizzy drinks, have a low impact on the planet but are bad for health. The effect of bad diets on health in rich nations is well known, as is the need to slash western meat consumption in order to tackle the climate breakdown and other environmental crises. But this is the first study to consider both together in detail. Michael Clark at the University of Oxford, who led the research, said: “Continuing to eat the way we do threatens societies, through chronic ill health and degradation of Earth’s climate, ecosystems and water resources. “Choosing better, more sustainable diets is one of the main ways people can improve their health and help protect the environment.” Some farming groups argue only intensively produced meat is seriously damaging to the environment. But Clark said replacing any meat with plant-based food makes the biggest difference. “How and where a food is produced affects its environmental impact, but to a much smaller extent than food choice,” he said. Marco Springmann, also at Oxford and part of the study team, said: “We now know pretty well that predominantly plant-based diets are much healthier and more sustainable than meat-heavy diets. But sometimes there is still confusion among people about what foods to choose.” The scientists hope more detailed information will help consumers, policymakers and food companies make better choices. The researchers are currently working on new types of food labels to see if information on health and environmental impacts changes people’s selection of food. The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, assessed plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, potatoes, refined grains and wholegrain cereals, and sugar-sweetened beverages, and animal-based foods such as raw and processed red meat, chicken, dairy products, eggs and fish. Using data from other studies on the diets and health outcomes of tens of millions of people, mostly in developed western nations, they calculated the health impact of eating one extra portion of each food on heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. The environmental harm for each food, from greenhouse gases to water use to pollution, was calculated relative to a portion of vegetables. Producing unprocessed red meat had the highest impact for all environmental indicators and was many times worse than pulses. The researchers said foods with medium environmental impacts or not significantly associated with ill health, such as refined grain cereals, dairy, eggs and chicken, could help improve health and reduce environmental harm if they replaced foods such as red meat. Prof Tim Benton at the Chatham House thinktank, who was not part of the team, said: “The [new research] is the most sophisticated analysis to date that brings health and environment together. “If we can produce reasonable guidelines of what a healthy and sustainable diet is, and were those guidelines to be adopted, the world and its people would be in a much better place.” According to Benton, strictly controlling people’s diets over many years for scientific research is impractical and it is therefore difficult to study the direct effects on health of eating specific foods, as the continuing debate over red meat shows. But he said the weight of evidence from epidemiological studies was now significant. “The global ill-health costs from diabetes alone are the same order of magnitude as the total value of farming to the global economy,” he said. “Our existing agricultural economy is destroying our ability to deal with climate change and also destroying our public health.”"
"On Sunday, the baroque-and-bling Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh (suites a mere £6,500 a night) is expected to host the launch of the biggest privatisation in history. Aramco, the holder of Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves, is likely to come to the market with a price tag as high as $2 trillion. The kingdom is only selling a small portion of the company, but if it achieves anywhere near that price, Aramco will be valued at more than BP, Shell, Google, Walmart and Netflix combined.  It’s a monster. It is easily the world’s worst polluter, topping the Guardian’s list of the 20 biggest companies responsible for a third of all the planet’s carbon emissions since 1965. Aramco is head and shoulders above the rest, and is behind nearly 5% of all global emissions over the last half century. You don’t have to sign up to Extinction Rebellion to know that if we burn all the oil in Saudi Arabia’s vast reserves, we’re never going to tackle the climate emergency. Yet Aramco just recently agreed to spend $18bn to massively expand production at two of its oilfields. Putting aside – if you can – the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, the croneyism of an autocratic state and the proxy wars – even on a cold-headed financial calculation, investing in Aramco could well be a dud. The era of oil is coming to an end. The Saudi Arabians are cute, flogging it off now, because although it may be the world’s most profitable company at present, it could be worthless within 50 years. At some point there is going to be a global switchover to electric cars. Offshore windfarms, we’re told, can provide more electricity than the world needs. Aramco’s vast reserves will be left in the ground, and we’ll all be quoting Ozymandias: “Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.” Yet the way our asset management industry runs, virtually every company employee with a pension scheme will, over the coming months and years, see it stuffed with Aramco shares – whether they like it or not. It’s partly the fault of indexing. Much of our company pension money now goes straight into global index funds, which can’t help but buy into Aramco to fulfil their mandate of matching moves in stock market indices. But even when pension activists try to stop their money going into fossil fuels, they are usually stumped. Greta Thunberg sails the Atlantic, speaks to the UN and inspires a whole generation. Climate activists take direct action in cities across the world. But they are no match for the stonewalling, evasiveness and sheer truculence of the fund managers who could have the most immediate effect on the world’s biggest polluting companies. Classical economics says that as shareholder-owners we can tell the boards of these companies what to do – from cutting pollution and carbon emissions to setting caps on runaway executive pay. And we can choose to buy or sell out whenever we like. Like hell we can. Currently there are almost no company pension schemes in Britain that allow the employee to stop their money going into fossil fuel extraction. It’s also virtually impossible to get fund managers to use their votes to take even the mildest steps towards fighting climate change or voting down excessive corporate pay. One group, which represents hundreds of UK company trustees with ownership of around £750bn worth of shares, contacted me this week with its deep, deep frustration at being able to effect any change, despite nominally owning vast amounts of shares. The group, the Association of Member Nominated Trustees, a few years ago set out its Red Lines when it came to voting. None of them is especially radical. They ask that fund managers vote against pay levels that are more than 100 times the UK’s average wage, and if they don’t, to report back to shareholders why not. Given the UK’s average wage is around £29,000, that limits chief executive pay to just shy of £3m. On climate change, it doesn’t ask for divestment. It just asks that if a company has failed to introduce an emissions reduction target, and is failing to take action to stop the planet warming by 2C, then the fund manager must vote against the re-election of the chair of the environmental sustainability committee of the offending company. Yet even these mild measures are usually blocked. When the AMNT surveyed fund managers, it found half did not even have a climate change voting policy. Aramco will hardly be quaking in its boots. Instead, the attention of Wall Street and London’s bankers will be on the $450m fees bonanza the Saudi government will shell out to get Aramco launched on global markets. Many people will regard it as hypocritical to divest from fossil fuels when so many of us drive cars and fly off on holidays. Maybe they also think corporate pay packets are just the going rate for the job. But for those who think otherwise, there’s a need to have bolder, simpler and more accessible ways to opt out of investing in the likes of Aramco if they wish. It is their money, after all. One final word of caution. Back in 2000, tobacco companies looked like history as cigarette bans took hold in western countries. Yet in the following decade, British American Tobacco was the very best performer on the London Stock Exchange, with its shares soaring and dividends gushing. It was morally and ethically right to divest from tobacco, but not (at first) financially. The same may well be said about Aramco. "

But things seem to be swinging the other way now. This year has not been a good year for the Arctic meltdown catastrophists.
Not only has the Arctic seen one of its coldest summers since data has been kept and sea ice up there has jumped an astonishing 60%, now we are getting news about Greenland from markvoganweather.com/ who writes that a temperature of -40°C was recorded there already in mid September! He writes:
A deep area of low pressure spinning over the northeast Atlantic has brought the 2nd spell of snow to parts of Iceland and 100 mph wind gusts over the tops of the Scottish Highlands. In the wake of the deepening low, skies cleared, winds fell light and bitter cold settled over Greenland with a rapid rise in surface pressure. These conditions, all thanks to the exiting low to the south, allowed the temperature to plummet to -40C over the Greenland interior last night, the lowest value so far this autumn.

"“If you were smarter I’d be in school” – so said a recent sign by a striking child anxious about climate change. It is a potent rebuke, not least because so many of the solutions are not rocket science. The implications of worsening climate change are also clear: while the world will not end, it will as we know it and with mounting evidence not for the better. Yet this sobering, irreversible prospect continues to divide rather than unite us in response. Between landing the Paris Agreement in 2015 and it beginning to operate next year we have seen the five hottest years on record. Climate change is our defining challenge. In nearly four years as Ambassador for the Environment for Australia, there was of course political point-scoring that makes this issue seem to forever go round in circles. But there were also trends that make me optimistic we will come closer together to infuse our children’s eyes with hope, not anger. I observed care for the environment does not belong to any one political party. Conservation is conservative bedrock, protection a core progressive instinct. Successive Australian governments of either description have nurtured Australia’s world class environment, which was a privilege to represent. Consensus on the science of climate change grows ever stronger: that the world is heating and we are largely responsible, and therefore can do something about it. Reinforcing this, communities around the world are feeling the negative impacts of change such as rising seas, stronger droughts, floods and cyclones. They want solutions, which will be a political driver. There is global recognition, bar one, that no one country can solve the challenge. It must be through common cause, by nations choosing – not being forced by the UN – to come together. Each has committed to doing more under the escalating cycles of ambition of the historic Paris Agreement. We all have made a start, with much already being done – including by key developing countries like China and India – which is itself a platform for more. It is not a choice between reducing emissions and economic growth and jobs. The standout is the UK which has reduced its emissions by over 40% since 1990 while growing the economy over 70%. Many other countries are also proving this point. Corporates are increasingly factoring climate risks and opportunities into their business thinking. For some it’s pressing, like insurance companies where insured losses were US$225bn in 2017-2018. For others it is strategic given the trillions of dollars of new technologies and business associated with transition to lower emissions, more climate resilient economies. Technologies are accelerating solutions. Solar costs have fallen 80%. Wind turbines have fallen by half in recent years. Half of new cars bought in Norway are now electric. We are currently developing a national hydrogen strategy where we have the potential to build an export industry on the scale of our current LNG production, the largest in the world. Finance is shifting. From being negligible a few years ago Green Bonds have now surpassed US$750bn. Annual investments into climate friendly technologies and solutions are also now topping US$500bn. It’s not virtue signalling or even because of shareholder pressure – although this too is growing – but because the numbers stack-up. It is sound business. There is appreciation across the world that poorer countries need help to take climate action, to make sure they are developing climate-smart agriculture, health, overall economic policies, to strengthen vulnerable communities. Many developing countries are in parts of the world that will be more affected by climate change and as they do not have the resources to address the threats they are doubly vulnerable to shocks. We are leading in the Pacific, as we have for years with finance, technology and capacity building. People from all walks of life are becoming engaged, which is to be expected as climate touches everything. The current worldwide strikes and street protests are the tip of a less visible, quieter mass of concern. This year’s Lowy survey saw Australians rank climate change at the top of a list of 10 possible threats to Australia’s vital interests in the next 10 years. A sense of urgency is growing. Last year’s 1.5 degree report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underlined the threats to us, our land and marine eco-systems and biodiversity unless we act. Internationally, focus is sharpening on action and ambition evident in the recent UN Summit on Climate Change. None of this means success is assured. That requires a step-change in action and ambition to ensure we reach net-zero carbon as soon as possible, across many sectors such as energy, transport, agriculture, and urban and industrial infrastructure. Crucially, without political leadership on all sides we will not succeed. Technologies and organic change alone will not forge this future. That is why close to 80 countries – including those of the EU, China and Japan – are currently putting in place long-term strategies for change; as we must. I am confident we will, precisely because the convergence for climate action evident in the trends outlined above is shrinking the space for political division toward more drive for accelerating progress in Australia: for all. Patrick Suckling was Australia’s Ambassador for the Environment and recently joined Pollination, a specialist climate investment and advisory firm"
"Environmentalism is often belittled as an indulgence for the affluent. This is not simply an existential criticism, but also a potent ploy to head off any environmental argument before it can gain traction.  The tactic has merit. Contemporary environmentalism’s roots make easy targets, whether it is the bunny-hugging activism of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth born in late-1960s West Coast America or the more genteel concerns about ladies decked out in egret feathers which gave rise to the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) or the National Trust’s rapture for “beauty and historic interest”. Even today, a new Oxford study found the people most interested in environment news tended to be left-wing, older and highly educated. If the charge of affluence was not awkward enough, the ammunition to defend the environment is often provided by these same boffins. Being an expert is now an automatic disadvantage in any debate, even before leading Brexit campaigner Michael Gove’s recent assertion that “people in this country have had enough of experts”. All too often, the environment’s advocates can be portrayed as outsiders, an elite, out of touch. This antagonism is also a curse for the disadvantaged and excluded around the world, who have pressing environmental concerns, but maybe not the same as those of the experts.  In the early 2000s the Joseph Rowntree Trust worked with residents in poor areas of the UK. Their environment mattered dearly to them, but it was litter or dog poo, municipal tidiness and their immediate surroundings that were important. When asked about the likes of WWF or the National Trust, people responded: “Locally you have no contact with them”. The burden of day-to-day problems was harsh enough, with residents explaining how: “I don’t think in the long term … I live for the day and see what tomorrow brings”. The Anthropocene can seem a long way away when you are struggling to feed a family.  In the developing world a similar outlook prevails. In equatorial Cameroon locals were once asked about attitudes to protected areas, forested peaks internationally famed for their endemic biodiversity: “We didn’t even know the parks existed”, people said, or: “We couldn’t hunt where we used to hunt”. Again, the burden of everyday survival trumps the long term conservation.  The same tensions cloud the use of big-game hunting as a device for conservation in southern Africa. If local people living next to large, dangerous, disease-carrying wildlife can have some financial reward maybe they will put up with the other costs and threats. This reward could be permits to legally hunt elephants, for instance. In the UK these huge animals are understandably popular, as they live in loving, protective families and are seemingly aware of their own mortality. Yet British people don’t have to put up with elephants destroying their own family’s reserves of food. In each case the classic themes of environmentalism, such as climate change, air quality or biodiversity can miss a profound appreciation of the environment among local communities. One of my favourite examples is from my part of the world, documented by the photographer Chris Steele-Perkins in his book Northern Exposure. This is the white working class of north-east England, out in the countryside, enjoying the landscape and wildlife, but not bird watching or visiting historic monuments. This is the countryside of ferreting, rough shooting and whippet racing in an eerie rural periphery of industrial decay.  This is not respectable environmentalism – not a world where academic expertise carries any credit – and yet it is a deeply ingrained and heartfelt culture, rooted in place and land. It is an appreciation of the natural world run through with violence and sentimentality, but one without much sympathy for outsiders who want to impose their version of the countryside. For example a new opencast coal mine is planned for Druridge Bay in Northumberland, a wild coastline of big skies, North Sea fog and rare wildlife. The plan has met expertly argued opposition from the RSPB, National Trust and Wildlife Trust along with many local residents. De-carbonisation, climate change, protected species: opponents are able to call on a full house of expertise-led reasoning.  However other locals are vehemently in favour of the mine and dismissive of the opposition. As one resident writes on a Facebook group supporting the development: “the tree huggers give nothing and cost hardworking men their bonus and overtime at work, some of those depend on that extra money to look after their families”. The criticism is not only of the opponents but essentially a conflict of class and culture.  These schisms are desperately sad and are exploited ruthlessly by powerful lobbies who have as little concern for the Cameroonian villagers, or County Durham ferreters, as they do for the environment. And experts are all too easy to portray as boffins in ivory towers, wasting taxpayers’ money on daft research – people whose out of touch ideas hit orindary people – hardworking families.  Experts should be less surprised by this tactic – crocodile tears over their research are used to negate debate. But equally, experts might be more fun than sceptics realise, maybe invite a boffin out ferreting? Then those local environmentalists, who feel left behind  may find they too have some powerful allies on their side."
"A severe drought threatens millions of people in East Africa. Crop harvests are well below normal and the price of food has doubled across much of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and nearby countries.  The last major drought in the region, in 2011, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. They are becoming more frequent and more intense – and each has a disastrous impact on the economies of nations and livelihoods of people.    So what is causing these droughts? And why are they becoming more common?  At least part of the explanation lies with a climate phenomenon known as the “Indian Ocean Dipole”. The dipole, often called the Indian Niño due to its similarity with El Niño, is not as well known as its Pacific equivalent. Indeed, it was only properly identified by a team of Japanese researchers in the late 1990s.  The dipole refers to the sea’s surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean off Indonesia, cycling between cold and warm compared to the western part of the ocean. Some years the temperature difference is far greater than others.  We are currently coming out of a particularly strong dipole. At its peak, in summer 2016, the sea off the Indonesian coast was 1℃ or so warmer than waters a few thousand kilometres to the west. Warmer seas evaporate more water and, on this sort of vast scale, a relatively small temperature difference can have a big effect. In this case it meant there was a lot more moisture in the atmosphere above the eastern Indian Ocean. As moist air is cooler than dry air, this in turn affected the prevailing winds. Wind is simply the atmosphere trying to equalise differences in temperature, density and pressure. Therefore, to “even out” the unusually cool air, a warm, dry wind began to blow eastwards from Africa across the ocean.  This is disastrous for farmers in the Horn of Africa who rely on moisture from the Indian Ocean to generate the “short rains” that run from October to December and the “long rains” from March to June. With winds blowing out to sea, the air was even drier than usual. The 2016 short rains were a month late and in some places failed entirely. Aid agencies  warned the failure of these rains could trigger mass famine across northern Kenya, South Sudan, Somalia and eastern Ethiopia.  Things will not improve any time soon. As with El Niño, global warming means the Indian Ocean Dipole has become more extreme in recent years. In East Africa, these severe droughts will become the norm. There are no easy answers. However, while we cannot control the Indian Ocean, we can change the way humans interact with the East African environment, making communities more resilient to climate change.  Past land use offers us some important clues. For example, a number of sites across East Africa demonstrate the impact of switching to more drought-sensitive New World crops such as maize. Maize was introduced in 1608 and since then it has largely replaced more traditional and drought-resistant crops such as cassava or sorghum. Maize provides excellent calorific returns in good years, but it often fails and has challenges around infestation and storage during drought years.  Further lessons from history show us that pastoral communities have become less mobile. Livestock farmers are settling down and becoming increasingly reliant on irrigation and crop growing, which makes them more sensitive to drought. Competing demands to conserve land for wildlife add to the problems.  There are a few things East Africans can do to ease the impact of climate change, especially droughts. Livestock farmers could share large communal “grazing banks” to act as an insurance scheme and spread the risk of pasture failure. Pastoral movements could be better managed to ensure areas do not become overgrazed and conflicts with conservation areas are minimised. Mountain forests could be valued more and managed better to capture useful water without the need for costly and vulnerable irrigation systems. And finally farmers could switch to varieties of crops that are better at coping with climate variability.  The “Indian Niño” isn’t going anywhere, along with the regular and severe droughts it causes. People in East Africa must prepare."
"Coalmining in Australia by the nation’s six biggest coal producers ultimately results in more greenhouse gas emissions each year than the entire domestic economy. In the latest report to estimate the role fossil fuel businesses play in driving the climate crisis, researchers from the University of New South Wales calculated the total emissions from the coal and gas produced by Australia’s top carbon companies, from extraction to the resources being burned for energy, mostly overseas. They found the top six coal producers – BHP Billiton, Glencore, Yancoal, Peabody, Anglo American and Whitehaven – were in 2018 linked to 551m tonnes of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Total emissions from all activity within Australia were 534m tonnes. When the list was expanded to include Australia’s 10 biggest carbon producers, adding Chevron, Woodside, ExxonMobil and Santos, the combined emissions from their products was found to be 670m tonnes a year, equivalent to that from about 75% of global air traffic. The UNSW report follows the Guardian’s global series The Polluters, which revealed 20 fossil fuel companies including BHP could be directly linked to more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era. In Australia, it found a wave of planned developments by major fossil fuel companies across the north would significantly increase the amount of coal and gas the country planned to sell into Asia and could push the Paris climate agreement goals further beyond reach. The report’s lead author, Jeremy Moss from the UNSW Practical Justice Initiative and a professor of political philosophy, said there was a clear case that big emitting companies, which the report calls “carbon majors”, should be held responsible for the consequences of their products. Global greenhouse accounting emphasises national emissions, rather than those connected to companies. There are no plans for that to change. But there is an increasing focus within companies in reporting and considering how to deal with “scope 3” emissions, including those that are released by a company’s customers when using their products. BHP’s chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, acknowledged this in July when, in a speech calling for drastic action to combat the climate crisis, he pledged US$400m to develop technologies to cut emissions from not only its own operations, but also the companies that buy its resources. BHP, Rio Tinto and South 32 are among those that report scope 3 emissions. Moss said fossil fuel companies had a moral responsibility to rapidly phase out their operations in line with the evidence of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found global emissions need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. He said companies should retire assets, not sell them. He said their products should be seen through a similar prism to goods that had been banned or had limitations placed on their use on moral grounds, giving the example of Scott Morrison’s announcement that Australia would ban the export of plastic waste, in part because it was ending up in the ocean. Moss said other industries where there were moral constraints included the live sheep trade, asbestos and uranium. “The only reason we care about these things is the impact they have. That’s a moral argument,” he said. “There is a reason we sell uranium to France and not Pakistan. It’s because if we know something was to go wrong in Pakistan, a safety issue or a dirty bomb, we’re partly culpable. “In the same way, to say you’re selling coal to a country just to stop someone worse from doing it, that’s just not true. We use supply-side constraints all the time. We should with fossil fuels.” Coal companies were asked for their response to the emissions analysis. Peabody said the company recognised climate change was occurring and that human use of fossil fuels contributed to greenhouse gas emissions. “We also recognise coal is essential to affordable, reliable energy and will continue to play a significant role in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future,” a Peabody spokesperson said, adding that technology would be vital in advancing climate change solutions. Others, including BHP and Glencore, declined to respond. In his speech in July, Mackenzie said the company would limit its direct emissions to 2017 levels by 2022 and set a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but the company faces pressure from shareholders over its membership of lobby groups that promote coal use. Chevron, listed in the report as the oil and gas company linked to the most pollution, said managing emissions was an integral part of its planning and it had announced goals to reduce emissions intensity (the amount emitted for each dollar earned) from upstream oil and natural gas projects (by 5-10% and 2-5% between 2016 and 2023 respectively). The UNSW report cites research that global fossil fuel emissions more than doubled between 1988, when the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established, and 2016. Emissions were greater from burning fossil fuels in those 28 years than the previous 237. Moss said big emitters should pay compensation for the harm caused by emissions released since 1990, if not earlier. He said many of the major producers listed in the report had long histories of pollution and continued to hold vast reserves to be extracted in the future. The researchers give the example of Glencore, which last year reported it had 6,765m tonnes of measured coal resources and 1,565m tonnes of proved marketable reserves. Moss said extracting it all could lead to 15.6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, about 29 times Australia’s annual emissions."
"President Trump has now fulfilled his disastrous promise to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement represents decades of work by both Democratic and Republican administrations to achieve a common goal: bringing every country of the world together to tackle the climate crisis, the existential threat of our time. President Trump surprised no one with his decision to withdraw from the agreement. It is yet another reckless choice in line with his steps to rollback our bedrock environmental laws, which have cleaned up our water and our air for decades. But that doesn’t minimize the gravity of his latest move. Trump is not only ceding American leadership at a critical juncture in the fight against climate change, he’s also giving away American jobs in the clean energy economy of the future – walking away from the greatest economic opportunity of our time.  The science is clear: the costs of climate change are even greater than we thought. In fact, a report released last year by Trump’s own government found that by the end of the century climate change will cost the American economy hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives every year. We are already seeing the cost of inaction here at home – bigger wildfires in California, record flooding in the Midwest and stronger hurricanes from Houston to New Orleans. And the global costs are even greater: climate change is making already unstable governments even less so, fueling international conflicts, and creating climate refugees around the world. It’s also spreading diseases into new parts of the world, costing more lives. With each passing year, the climate crisis wreaks greater havoc. But instead of acting to protect American lives and creating good paying jobs, we have let Big Oil set our climate policy in Washington. These companies spent three decades deceiving the public about the climate crisis, spreading lies and misinformation through their lobbyists. With Donald Trump in the White House, they now have a climate denier in chief. President Trump continues to peddle lies about the climate crisis, while he lets big polluters go back to poisoning our air and water. He falsely claims that complying with the Paris Agreement would cost Americans “billions of dollars and put millions of jobs at risk for no meaningful reduction of emissions.” This couldn’t be further from the truth. The World Bank estimates that the Paris Agreement created a $23tn investment opportunity over the next decade in just the top 20 developing countries. As these countries move toward 100% clean energy, and other countries of the world join them, markets for America’s clean energy innovation will only expand. My Green Manufacturing Plan will jumpstart clean energy development right here in the United States by investing $2tn to grow clean energy at home and abroad, while creating millions of new, good paying, union jobs. And my Green Marshall Plan would directly assist countries abroad to buy American-made clean energy products, further expanding markets for green manufacturing. The next president must rejoin the Paris Agreement, but that alone is not enough. Instead, she must show the world that the United States is ready to once again lead on the international stage. The first step is to submit a new US commitment under Paris raising our previous target to achieve rapid emission reductions. I have a plan for that. Next, we must encourage other nations like China and India to step up in this fight alongside us. And climate change must be an organizing principle in American diplomacy. That means whether it’s negotiating new trade agreements or addressing security threats, my administration will consider the impacts of climate change as we make foreign policy decisions. The world is facing one of the biggest threats we have ever encountered. But Americans do not walk away from a fight. We lead. In November 2020, it won’t just be Donald Trump on the ballot but also the chance to renew America’s climate leadership for a safer, cleaner, more secure and more prosperous future. Elizabeth Warren is a United States Senator from Massachusetts and a US presidential candidate"
"From Wednesday, 30,000 people will begin to receive invitations to take part in a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency convened by MPs. A demographically representative sample of the population will then be selected from those who respond, with 110 people taking part in the Climate Assembly UK over four weekends in Birmingham next year. Participants will be asked to discuss how the UK should respond to the climate emergency and what policies they would like to see implemented to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, now enshrined in law. We want to hear from people who have received an invitation to take part about their views on participating. We are interested in hearing from people who have received an invitation to take part in Climate Assembly UK. Are you pleased? Is counteracting climate emergency something that’s important to you?

"Jane Fonda accepted a prestigious award from Bafta Los Angeles while being led away in handcuffs after being arrested during climate emergency protests.  The actor and activist was honoured with the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film at the annual Bafta Britannia ceremony. However, she could not be at the Beverly Hilton in person to accept the prize and, as is customary, sent a video message instead.  Footage of Fonda being arrested in Washington DC last week was shown to the audience on big screens. The Oscar-winning actor shouted, “Bafta, thank you” as she was led away. “I’m very honoured,” she added. Folks, @Janefonda accepted the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award WHILE BEING ARRESTED. #Britannias pic.twitter.com/LDbZKTZWrs Fonda, known as much for her activism as her film career, had earlier said she was inspired to return to civil disobedience by teenage climate emergency protester Greta Thunberg. Fonda was one of 17 climate protesters arrested at the US capital on charges of unlawful demonstration by what she called “extremely nice and professional” police. She said she had moved to Washington DC so she could be more involved in the fight against climate breakdown. She added that she hoped to inspire other older activists and revealed she planned to get herself arrested every Friday during the protests.  Previous winners of the Stanley Kubrick award for excellence in film, which is given to “legendary individuals whose work is stamped with the indelible mark of authorship and ingenuity”, include Cate Blanchett, George Clooney and Meryl Streep."
"An eruption of Mount Etna recently caught out some BBC journalists who were filming there. The footage was extraordinary and highlighted the hazards volcanoes pose to humans and society.  Since 1600, 278,880 people have been killed by volcanic activity, with many of these deaths attributed to secondary hazards associated with the main eruption. Starvation killed 92,000 following the 1815 Tambora eruption in Indonesia, for example, and a volcanic tsunami killed 36,000 following the 1883 Krakatoa eruption.  Since the 1980s, deaths related to volcanic eruptions have been rather limited, but this is not entirely a result of increased preparedness or investment in hazard management – it is significantly a matter of chance.  Research shows that volcanic activity has shown no let up since the turn of the 21st century – it just hasn’t been around population centres. Indeed, there remain a number of volcanoes poised to blow which pose a major threat to life and livelihood. Known for its 79AD eruption, which destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Vesuvius is still a significant hazard given that it overshadows the city of Naples and its surrounds, which are home to over 3m people. It is also known for a particularly intense form of eruption. Plinian (after Pliny the Younger who was the first to describe the 79AD event) eruptions are characterised by the ejection of a vast column of gas and ash which extends into the stratosphere, far higher than commercial airliners fly.  Were such an eruption to occur at Vesuvius today, it is likely that much of the population would already have been evacuated as a precursory swarm of earthquakes would likely herald its imminent approach. But those who remained would initially be showered with huge pumice rocks too large to be kept aloft by the column of gas.  Then, as the volcano began to run out of energy, the column itself would collapse, causing smaller particles of rock (from fine ash to small boulders) to fall from the sky and back to Earth at high velocity. Asphyxiating clouds of gas and pulverised rock – pyroclastic density currents – would then flood down the slopes of the volcano, annihilating anything in their path. Such gas-ash features have been known to travel tens of kilometres and at terrifying speeds, potentially turning modern Naples into a new Pompeii.  This central African volcano has erupted several times over the last few decades and while its eruptions aren’t particularly explosive, it produces a particularly runny – and dangerous – form of lava. Once effused, this lava can rapidly move down the flanks of the volcano and inundate areas with little or no warning.  In 2002, the lava lake at the volcano’s summit was breached, resulting in streams of lava hurtling towards the nearby city of Goma at 60km/h, engulfing parts of it to a depth of two metres.  Fortunately, warnings had been issued as the volcano’s unrest has made it the focus of intense research – and over 300,000 people were evacuated in time. Should such an event occur again, we have to hope that the authorities are equally prepared, but this is a politically unstable area and it remains seriously vulnerable. “Popo”, as the locals call it, is just 70km south-west of the one of the largest cities in the world: Mexico City, home to 20m people. Popo is regularly active and its most recent bout of activity in 2016 sent a plume of ash to an altitude of five kilometres.  In recent times, and indeed throughout much of its history, eruptive events at Popo have consisted of similarly isolated ash plumes. But these plumes coat the mountain in a thick blanket of ash which, when mixed with water, can form a dense muddy mixture which has the potential to flow for many kilometres and at relatively high speeds.  Such phenomena, known as “lahars”, can be extremely deadly, as exemplified by the Nevado del Ruiz disaster of 1985 when around 26,000 people were killed in the town of Armero, Colombia, by a lahar with a volcanic source that was 60km away.  The Nevado del Ruiz tragedy was the direct result of volcanic activity melting ice at the volcano’s summit, but a large volume of rainfall or snowmelt could feasibly generate a similar lahar on Popo. This could flow down-slope towards nearby settlements with little or no warning.  Otherwise named Krakatau, Krakatoa’s name is infamous; 36,000 people were killed by the tsunami triggered by its 1886 eruption, which released more energy than 13,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs. The eruption destroyed the volcanic island completely, but within 50 years, a new island had appeared in its place.  The new island is named Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatoa) and since the 1920s, it has been growing in episodic phases, reaching about 300 metres in height today. New and significant activity commenced in 2007 and since this time, further episodes of activity were noted at the volcano, most recently in March 2017.  No one knows for sure whether or not the spectacular growth of Anak Krakatau means it may one day repeat the catastrophe its “father” unleashed, but its location between Indonesia’s two most populated islands, Java and Sumatra, means it poses a grave threat to life. Few have heard of this volcano in a remote part of Asia – and its last eruption was in 1903. However, its history tells a rather scarier story. In around 969AD, the volcano produced one of the largest eruptions of the last 10,000 years, releasing three times more material than Krakatoa did in 1886.  One of the chief hazards is posed by the massive crater lake at its peak (with a volume of about nine cubic kilometres). If breached, this lake could generate lahars that would pose a significant threat to the 100,000 people that live in the vicinity.  In the early 2000s, scientists began monitoring the hitherto under-monitored volcano, and determined that its activity was increasing, that its magma chamber dormancy was coming to an end, and that it could pose a hazard in the following decades.  Further complicating things is the fact that Changbaishan straddles the border of China and North Korea. Given such a geo-politically sensitive location, the effects of any volcanic activity here would likely be very hard to manage."
"West Country asthmatics breathed a deep sigh of relief last week, as Bristol city council unveiled long-awaited plans for a clean air zone in the city. The proposals would see a total daytime ban (from 7am to 3pm) on diesel vehicles entering a small central zone – a first in the UK, though increasingly common across the continent – plus a new charge for entering a wider area.  If approved tomorrow, the scheme will come into force in 2021. It cannot come too soon for Bristol’s most vulnerable residents: illegally poor air quality currently contributes to 333 annual premature deaths from respiratory illnesses in the city. Preliminary results from a similar scheme in London, the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ), are even better than expected, with toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions down by nearly a third, demonstrating that this approach can really work. In one respect, Bristol’s plan goes one better, as its proposed scrappage scheme – financial compensation for ditching old diesel vehicles – includes an option, unlike London’s, to redeem value against an electric bicycle or on public transport. But one curious feature of the plans exposes Bristol’s clean air zone as a microcosm of national policy paralysis, and demonstrates a collective failure of imagination on transport and the environment. The city intends to charge commercial diesel vehicles including buses for entering the wider clean air zone – while exempting private cars. They argue that charging private motorists would disproportionately affect low-income households that depend on their cars to get around, and in the absence of alternatives this is undoubtedly true. But this is exactly the wrong way of thinking about the problem. A fifth of children in Bristol are in low-income families, and are far less likely to have access to a car than their better-off peers. Leaving the streets filled with dirty cars means throwing these children under the SUV. What is required is urgent action to ensure that nobody in Bristol is dependent on their cars for mobility. This is the heart of the issue. The years of foot-dragging and buck-passing between central government and city authorities on air quality are just one aspect of a fundamental societal intransigence. At every level of government, politicians have been too blinkered and cowardly to challenge the primacy of the private car as the dominant mode of transport in Britain. As a result, transport is now the largest sectoral source of carbon emissions in the UK. Private cars make up the bulk of these emissions, and they are still rising – even in the teeth of the escalating climate crisis. Expectations that switching to electric vehicles will be equal to the task are wildly at odds with the evidence. Estimates suggest that meeting our climate commitments under the Paris agreement will require an overall reduction in vehicle miles travelled in the UK of between 20-70% (depending on how fast we switch to EVs). But there are no measures to reduce traffic volumes in the government’s decarbonisation plans. Instead, they intend to spend more than £30bn of public money on road building to facilitate a 50% increase in traffic between now and 2050. While rural areas and small towns are likely to remain dependent on cars for the foreseeable future, major cities such as Bristol need to treat this existential imperative as a golden opportunity to improve quality of life for residents by making private cars completely obsolete. Bristol is well placed to lead this transition. It is one of only half a dozen places in the UK where more than half of all trips are already made by walking, cycling or by public transport, and where bus journeys are actually increasing rather than declining. Moreover, the city’s mayor, Marvin Rees, was one of the most senior Labour political leaders to sign up to the Green New Deal motion at the party conference, aiming for UK net-zero emissions by 2030. But taking this pledge seriously demands a leap of imagination far beyond anything in the city’s new clean air zone proposals. This is much more achievable than it may initially seem. Cars were always a perversely poor solution to the basic geometry problem of moving lots of people short distances around densely populated areas. Exciting new frontiers are opening up in urban personal transportation all the time now, from shared rides and vehicles, to electric buses and rickshaws, to micromobility solutions such as dockless bike hire schemes and e-scooters. Many of these emerging solutions are not just better for society and the environment, but offer a superior user experience over private cars, daily traffic jams and the demoralising musical chairs over a parking spot. More prosaically but just as importantly, more and more cities across Europe are realising that free public transport makes sense for them, and that citywide cycling infrastructure creates network effects that radically alter the attractiveness of cycling versus driving. It can’t happen on its own. British society was systematically motorised through a series of investment and regulatory decisions in the 1950s and 60s, when the government forced the closure of thousands of miles of railway lines while constructing a thousand miles of new motorways. Deliberate choices by governments gave us the broken and toxic transport system we currently have, and they can give us the transport system we need to prosper in the 21st century too. But first we need the courage to imagine better, and then to demand it. • Leo Murray is director of innovation at the climate change charity Possible (formerly 10:10 Climate Action) "
"On any other Friday the government’s major report on the energy market rip-off would have been headline news. It was the result of a two-year investigation by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) into why household bills keep rising – a process that started with a probe by energy regulator Ofgem way back in 2008.  But Brexit meant that the report, published on June 24, passed by largely unnoticed. This is a shame, as bills keep rising, and the CMA’s proposals won’t solve the problems in the energy markets. Here are four key ways the government’s investigation has let down consumers: The UK energy market is dominated by a “big six”: Centrica, SSE, EdF, EoN, Scottish Power and Npower. They are involved in both the wholesale (generation) and retail (supply) markets, controlling around 90% of the sector.  The CMA isn’t too worried about this sort of “vertical integration”, pointing to the recent emergence of new challengers such as Nottingham-based Iresa, the low returns on offer in the wholesale market, and the low possibility of price discrimination in the same wholesale market (where electricity generators charge different suppliers different prices). There are a number of problems with this. The low profits from generation don’t reflect effective competition and a lack of market power – it just shows these big companies are able to keep their generation profits low because of higher profits on the retail side of the business. Previously (prior to 2002) they were able to balance out their revenues in the opposite manner, with low revenues from the retail trade counterbalanced with higher cash flow from the wholesale business.  In any case, despite the new entries, the big six still control the vast majority of the energy market. It’s questionable if these new entrants will stick around – as many new companies disappeared in the past. And even if these firms cannot use price discrimination this is not a guarantee against abuse of market power in a sector where wholesale prices are passed onto customers. The CMA found that more than half of customers never switch their suppliers and around 70% are on the most expensive tariffs, despite often substantial gains from switching. Its estimates suggest that energy customers have been overcharged to the tune of £1.4 billion per year, something the CMA largely blames on a lack of switching by consumers. This lets companies off the hook, however, and shifts the responsibility for competition onto customers in an industry struggling with market domination by a few firms. One of the remedies proposed by the CMA is a price cap for vulnerable customers. However experts from in and outside the CMA investigation challenged the narrow definition of “vulnerable” which only included those on prepayment meters (just 16% of domestic users). Measures introduced after Ofgem’s Retail Market Review in 2010 have been identified as the second culprit for the problems in the energy markets. Aiming for “simpler, clearer and fairer” conduct in pricing energy, these interventions lowered the number of tariffs each supplier could offer to four. Ofgem also required price comparison websites to provide full rather than partial information about available offers.  The CMA says these measures made energy markets less competitive. But this ignores the widespread dissatisfaction with the previous situation in which each supplier offered a large number of tariffs which many customers found complex and confusing.  The CMA’s analysis privileges “competition” over social and consumer welfare: competition at any cost, be it through artificial complexity created by extra tariffs or information withholding by comparison websites. The six large energy suppliers have effectively been under investigation since 2008, starting with the Ofgem probe. The long periods involved in such investigations mean consumers continue to be exploited in the interim. This is particularly noteworthy as privatisation is conventionally expected to reduce the inertia and heavily bureaucratic procedures, often associated with public provision. But aside from a false dawn that lasted a few years immediately after privatisation, the energy sector failed to deliver on its own promises of lower prices. In 2014 British households spent 75% more for electricity and 125% more for gas in real terms than they did in 2004. This is despite the fact that gas consumption declined by around 30% in the same period while electricity consumption went down by around 15%. It is high time, therefore, the public sector takes control of the UK’s energy through nationalising the industry progressively over time. This would not only eliminate abuse of market power by big players, but also secure the UK’s future energy supplies and reduce its carbon emissions."
"This is the second drought that my partner Robert and I have faced in the last decade at Carinya, our property in Muttama, New South Wales. After the millennium drought broke in 2011, we felt a bit bruised, but thought that we would have a few good years to rebuild. As we grew our business again and raised our children, there was always this dread at the back of our minds, that we’d face another drought soon. This drought set in around 2017, and it hit hard. It has been heart-wrenching to see our animals go from grazing on fresh grass to rationed drought feeding routines, native plants dying slowly, and wildlife struggling to cope with the lack of water and food. Our family is also feeling the mental, emotional and financial strain; we’ve had to make tough decisions about our animals and business.Robert and I know that the impacts of this drought are worsened by climate change, and with every day that passes without rain or credible climate action, it gets harder to stay positive.We are trying hard to have enough resilience left to undertake a recovery, so for now, we’re waiting and watching. We’re coping the best we can, and hoping that every day brings us closer to rain. Vivien Thomson is a farmer based in Muttama in the Riverina, southern NSW The Liverpool Plains area is famous for having some of the most fertile soils in Australia. Unfortunately, it all changed after the November flood of 2000. The rain stopped and the last four years in particular have been off the scale in below-average rainfall. I have never experienced anything like it. We use farming techniques that help to store moisture in the soil. However, when it doesn’t rain for years on end there is nothing to store. The hardship of the drought is often focused on the livestock industry and I understand that – we have been hand-feeding our horses for two-and-a-half years. However, there is less focus on cropping farmers – we haven’t grown a wheat crop in three years and west of me they have only had one crop in seven years. We borrow money to pay our staff in the hope that one day it will rain. The drought is insidious, it creeps up on you. After years of telling yourself “it will rain soon” and it doesn’t, doubt starts to niggle, your mental health is slowly being white-anted, that positive mindset is like the soil as it dries, it loses structure. The ups and downs lose rhythm. The dust storms remind you that you are not alone, that is someone else’s farm that blows past on its way to New Zealand; you try not to see your own farm being blown away. You start to question why you farm – you do it because you love it, the exhilaration of seeing a seed you planted grow into a healthy plant that you harvest and supply food and fibre to the masses. I hope that chance comes again soon. John Hamparsum is a cropping farmer, Liverpool Plains, north-west NSW On evening walks down the dry creek bed on my farm in Broken Hill, alongside my parents and kelpie dogs, I feel a deep sense of belonging. I am part of this landscape, with its apricot pink skyline and corellas taking up roost in the old river red gum trees, and it is part of me. This love for the land underpins everything I do to protect its future. We are already seeing the impact of climate change on our land in the form of scorching heatwaves and relentless drought. The increased frequency and intensity of such events has led us to sell most of our sheep. We are also trying to help local endangered species struggling to cope by conserving their habitat, among other things. Future predictions are pretty bleak. In 2050, by the time I’m the average age of an Australian farmer, the increase in extreme heat and reduced rainfall could end our livestock business. So I focus on addressing the causes of the drought and working on the solutions to climate change. My future on the land hangs on tenterhooks, but I draw hope from being part of groups like Farmers for Climate Action, a coalition of food and fibre producers advocating for policies that cut our emissions. I’m optimistic that together, we can save the places we love and call home. Anika Molesworth is a farmer on her family’s sheep station in Broken Hill in NSW and the founder of Climate Wise Agriculture. She was 2015 Young Farmer of the Year, 2017 NSW finalist for Young Australian of the Year, and NSW Young Achiever Award for Environment and Sustainability In my 40th year in the wine industry I have never witnessed the slow-moving drought that has rolled out through the bush over the past two years. I have reverted to old-style farming, fortunately taught to me years ago. We have totally run out of water for the 270 acres of grapes situated in Ballandean, south Queensland. It hasn’t rained for some time here. Recently just over an inch fell, and this has simply polished the outside without fixing the internal damage. It’s been nearly two years now since the creeks have run dry, and that forced us into changing our farming practices. In winter vine plots were reduced to a one bud spur instead of the traditional two bud spur, fertiliser was broadcasted by the tractor right across the vineyard to be dissolved into the soil once rain returns, and all grass removed under the vines along with between the rows. We are now spraying nutrients on via a foliar spray cart and if the drought continues, we will remove the entire crop to give the vines a chance of survival. At this stage we will be purchasing grapes from southern states to accommodate our export market.

"Roll up! Roll up! The world’s biggest climate polluter, Saudi Aramco is poised to announce the world’s biggest stock flotation in an ultimate marriage of carbon and capital. Any institution with tens of millions of dollars and few qualms about the environment is invited. Entry is not as exclusive as it sounds. Individuals with a lot less cash and a lot more concern may also inadvertently find themselves as guests through pension funds that automatically track the stock markets. Scientists warn that fossil fuels and money will soon need to divorce because carbon emissions must be slashed by half over the next decade if the world is to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level of 1.5C. Despite this, Aramco expects to receive the greatest infusion of cash in history.  In the modern era, no company has a bigger carbon footprint than Saudi Aramco. The Guardian’s recent Polluters investigation found the oil and gas producer has contributed 59bn tonnes of CO2 since 1965, a third more than any of its rivals. Output is forecast to expand even further between now and 2030 to a level that would mean this single firm will account for almost 5% of the remaining 1.5C carbon budget. Until now, the company has been state-owned, influenced by the Saudi royal family, and has disrupted, delayed and diluted international efforts to cut carbon emissions. The flotation will not change this dramatically.  The bigger questions are who is going to buy the shares, how will the money be used and will a public listing make the company more transparent and less of an obstacle to climate action. So far, the indications are less than reassuring. The most likely buyers are sovereign wealth funds and state-backed institutions in Russia, China and Abu Dhabi. Others may follow, but most big private institutions appear to be waiting on the economic and reputational price. A notable exception is Singapore’s investment fund Temasek, which said it would not invest in Aramco’s IPO, partly due to climate concerns. We believe that the escalating climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes and that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We know that our readers and supporters around the world care passionately about this too, as so many of you have told us. We want the Guardian to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe. So at the Guardian we commit to the following: Read our full environmental pledge  Oversight and transparency are other concerns. The Saudi royal family is neither open nor democratic. Barely a year after being implicated in the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi in October, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman is getting positive global attention for his Aramco selloff plans. He said the sale would raise money for the state’s sovereign wealth fund to invest in a diverse range of businesses across the globe, which would make Saudi Arabia less dependent on oil. Climate campaigners believe it is reckless to pour such money into a petrochemical giant when fossil fuel firms should be scaling back. Last month 10 environmental groups signed a joint letter to bank chief executives, including the bosses of HSBC and Goldman Sachs, urging them not to participate.  “This IPO will be a boost to a planet-wrecking company linked to a regime with a dubious human rights record,” said Adam McGibbon, senior campaigner at Global Witness. Yossi Cadan, global finance campaign manager for 350.org, said: “Investors who expressed concerns about climate change and human rights violations must be sincere to their word and not be investing in Saudi Aramco’s climate wreckage sale.”  In a letter to the Guardian last month, Aramco’s chief technology officer, Ahmad O Al-Khowaiter, said the company supported a cut in the overall carbon footprint of the oil and gas industry and end-use markets. He said his company had already made progress. “We have achieved the lowest carbon intensity of any major oil producer.” Saudi oil is of high quality and close to the surface, which means it requires less energy to extract and process than fuel from Canadian tar sands, Venezuela’s Orinoco fields or Brazil’s deep sea reserves. Even so, the Climate Tracker watchdog estimates half of potential Saudi spending on new projects would not fit within even a 1.7C climate scenario. In an earlier bond prospectus, Saudi Aramco said the firm was pursuing various initiatives to manage its carbon footprint. Tellingly, it also declared support for Saudi efforts to achieve the Paris agreement objectives. If the same is true for the equity raise, then investors and financial market regulators would be entitled to ask how it reconciles this with a plan that would break the global carbon bank. Richard Heede, at the Climate Accountability Institute in the US, said a proportion of the capital raised should be invested in expanding Saudi Arabia’s solar electricity generation, energy efficiency and carbon sequestration programmes, at a scale that goes beyond freeing up domestic use so there is more oil for exports. “It would be prudent for investors to do climate-related due diligence, and for the kingdom to assure investors that steps to protect the global climate will be taken,” he said. But stock markets and asset management companies continue to champion fossil fuel firms, via listings in benchmark indices and by investment algorithms that automatically track the biggest firms. The FTSE recently benchmarked the Tadawul as a secondary emerging market, which already puts it on the radar of global investors. If Aramco later lists in a major international stock exchange, its size would ensure it becomes a major player in any index. It would then appear in every major pension fund portfolio “benchmarked” to the FTSE All Share Index, which could mean millions of pension policyholders end up unknowingly with a stake. “There would then be a transfer of risk from the Saudis to the rest of the world, ie London, then to every pension fund member or saver in a passive fund. Only those funds with ‘no carbon’ benchmarks are likely to avoid it,” said Mark Campanale, of Carbon Tracker. If the financial markets are serious about climate change, they need to be reorganised to separate climate and carbon, not push them closer together. "
"For centuries, we have observed that artificial sources of light hold a strange fascination for moths. Despite decades of research, we still don’t know the cause of this attraction. Some theories put it down to the way moths navigate; others think it’s a mechanism to help them to escape from perceived danger. But the truth is, little evidence exists to support either of these ideas. Whatever the cause is, research has shown that this deadly attraction may have even more sinister consequences than we first thought. In an open access paper in Global Change Biology, my colleagues and I describe the first evidence which shows that the effects of artificial light on moths may have serious implications for the wider ecosystem.  There has been plenty written about the danger posed by declining bee and butterfly populations, on the basis that some plants rely on these insects to carry pollen and fertilise flowers, in order to reproduce. But many people aren’t aware that moths also perform this task: our study of field sites across Oxfordshire found that one in four moths were carrying pollen, from at least 28 different plant species.  And like their cousins the butterflies, moths are in trouble: according to Butterfly Conservation’s Richard Fox: “the total abundance of moths in Britain has decreased by over a quarter since the 1960s”. Research indicates that artificial light, such as street lamps, has contributed to this decline by affecting moths’ development, reproduction and ability to escape predators. Now, our data suggests that street lights are also directly thwarting night-time pollination, by attracting moths upwards, away from the fields and hedgerows. We found that the abundance of moths at ground level was halved in lit areas, while flight activity at the height of the street light was nearly doubled. The diversity of species was also reduced at ground level, with 25% fewer moth species in lit areas, compared to places without street lighting.  This change is likely to disrupt nighttime pollination by moths, and indeed we found some evidence that moths may carry less pollen, from fewer plant species, in lighted streets. This could mean that the impacts of street lights go beyond posing a health risk to moths. Plants that rely on moths for pollination would also suffer if their reproduction is impeded – and this might, in turn, affect organisms that eat those plants or drink their nectar.  In a best-case scenario, some of these so-called cascading effects might be mitigated where flowers can rely on other insects such as bees for pollination. But there are further factors driving declines in pollinator populations, such as climate change, pesticides and habitat loss. Now, our research suggests that artificial light can be added to the list. So how can we protect these beautiful, under-appreciated insects and the important role they play in our environment?  Another recent paper published by researchers in Switzerland suggests that moths may be evolving to be less strongly attracted to lights. Under controlled experimental conditions in a flight cage, they found that Spindle Ermine moths from urban populations were less likely to be captured in light-baited moth traps than their rural counterparts.  These findings suggest that moths which can resist the temptation of lights put themselves at a significant advantage over their peers. Over time this has led city-dwelling moth populations to become less attracted to lights, through natural selection. But this is all relative: urban moths are still far from immune to the deadly allure of urban street lights. We can’t simply switch street lighting off: although the evidence for its actual benefits is questionable, it certainly contributes to many people’s feeling of safety and security when outside after dark and proposals to turn lights off are often unpopular.  But if we don’t wish to wait for the slow crawl of evolution, it may be that recent advances in street lighting technology can help to mitigate the impacts of artificial light. For example, developments born out of a desire for energy efficiency could also minimise the impact of street lighting on moths. Measures such as switching on street lights for part of the night, dimming them or introducing motion-activated lighting would reduce moths’ exposure to street lights. Similarly, the flexibility of LED lights might allow for the creation of street lights that are less attractive to moths, which respond most strongly to short-wavelength blue light. Nevertheless, artificial light at night continues to increase as we seek to drive darkness from the streets. Our research is another warning that this may have far-reaching consequences for the organisms around us."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to 53-page report here released by environmental activist group urgewald.org/, which looks at financing of the coal industry by major banks, global coal consumption has risen “to a staggering 7.9 billion tons annually”; that’s a 69% increase since the year 2000. A real “climate catastrophe” hyperventilates the Urgewald report!
And so applying global warming theory, which claims that CO2 is the dominant climate driver and that coal is the big source, you’d think that global mean temperatures would be skyrocketing upwards by now. But here’s a chart that tells us the reality of the time period referred to by Urgewald:
GLOBAL TEMPERATURE COMPARED TO GLOBAL COAL EMISSIONS

Global temperature (green) compared to global coal consumption (black). While coal consumption has soared 70% since 2000, global temperatures have eased since 2002.
What does that tell us about coal’s impact on the climate?
In fact by almost every measure, global living conditions for humanity have improved worldwide, this is in large part thanks to the affordable energy delivered by that 70% increase in coal. Coal has lifted millions of people worldwide out of grinding poverty and horrible lives without electric power.
The Urgewald paper is just the latest lapse into a fit of doom and gloom. There’s no denying the temperature reality of the last 15 years: no rise!
You’re more than welcome to read the 53-page report, but it’ll probably cause you to suffer a spell of Doomer Depression.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Voice of Russia today has a report titled Scottish in fear of bad weather more than terrorism. At first I thought it was about just another twisted survey to give the impression that people fear global warming climate change and the extremes it’s supposedly brings.
But when you actually read the report, you quickly discover what Scots are really far more worried about: brutal winters!
The Voice of Russia writes (my emphasis):
Nearly half of Scottish people are afraid of being clobbered by an ‘extreme weather’ emergency this winter season… . Concern has been mounting over power and water cuts, and Scots are in fear of being stuck in vehicles or trains in blizzard-like conditions.”
Here we see that the report is talking about ice-age-like winter conditions! The kind that climate scientists, like David Viner, said we’d rarely ever see again in the future.
Today 49% of Scots fear the coming winter this year. Last year the figure was 38%. Alarm over cold winters is rising rapidly.
So why are Scots getting ever more scared of brutal winters in times of purported warming?
The answer is because it hasn’t been warming at all in Europe over the last years. If anything winters have been getting harsher, more dangerous and are completely the opposite of what Europeans were told to prepare for a few years ago.

The Voice of Russia writes that Scots have fresh memories of brutal, life-threatening winter conditions (again my emphasis):

‘Severe weather can strike quickly and at any time of year. In March, we saw the impact of severe snowstorms on communities in Arran, Kintyre and Dumfries and Galloway,’ Transport minister Keith Brown said and added, ‘So whether it is making your home energy efficient, protecting your pipes, packing an emergency kit for the car or looking out for vulnerable neighbors, we can all play our part in helping Scotland get ready for winter.'”

Does this sound like people getting ready for global warming?
It also appears that Scottish citizens are losing faith in their energy supply.
It has been estimated that 28 percent experienced some delay in their gas, water, or electricity in the past year. In rural areas the percentage was much higher, at 41 percent.”

"My parents researched malnutrition and under-nutrition in India, especially among children, and found that many diets recommended by Western nutritionists were in fact completely inapplicable to the poor. So they formulated cheap, healthy diets based on indigenous food with which people were familiar. Yet despite their many other efforts, a quarter of people in Indian and nearly one in nine people around the world do not have enough food to live a healthy active life.  The World Bank estimates that we will need to produce about 50% more food by 2050 to feed a population of nine billion people. And the past 50 years have seen agricultural productivity soar – corn yields in the US have doubled, for example. But this has come with sharp increases in the use of fertilisers, pesticides and water which has brought its own problems. There is also no guarantee that this rate of increase in yields can be maintained. Just as new agricultural techniques and equipment spurred on food production in the Middle Ages, and scientific crop breeding, fertilisers and pesticides did so for the Green Revolution of the 20th century, so we must rely on the latest technology to boost food production further. Genetic modification, or GM, used appropriately with proper regulation, may be part of the solution. Yet GM remains a highly contentious topic of debate where, unfortunately, the underlying facts are often obscured. Views on GM differ across the world. Almost half of all crops grown in the US are GM, whereas widespread opposition in Europe means virtually no GM crops are grown there. In Canada, regulation is focused on the characteristics of the crop produced, while in the EU the focus is on how it has been modified. GM crops do not damage the environment by nature of their modification; GM is merely a technology, and it is the resulting product that we should be concerned about and regulate, just as we would any new product. There are outstanding plant scientists who work on GM in the UK, but the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have declared their opposition to GM plants. Why is there such strong opposition in a country with great trust in scientists? About 15 years ago when GM was just emerging, its main proponents and many of the initial products were from large multinational corporations – even though it was publicly funded scientists who produced much of the initial research. Understandably, many felt GM was a means for these corporations to impose a monopoly on crops and maximise their profits. This perception was not helped by some of the practices of these big companies, such as introducing herbicide resistant crops that led to the heavy use of herbicides – often made by the same companies. The debate became polarised, and any sense that the evidence could be rationally assessed evaporated. There have been claims made about the negative health effects and economic costs of GM crops – claims later shown to be unsubstantiated. Today, half of those in the UK do not feel well informed about GM crops. GM involves the introduction of very specific genes into plants. In many ways this is much more controlled than the random mutations that are selected for in traditional plant breeding. Most of the commonly grown crops that we consider natural actually bear little resemblance to their wild ancestors, having been selectively modified through cross-breeding over the thousands of years that humans have been farming crops – in a sense, this is a form of genetic modification itself. In any case, we accept genetic modification in many other contexts: insulin used to treat diabetes is now made by GM microbes and has almost completely replaced animal insulin, for example. Many of the top selling drugs are proteins such as antibodies made entirely by GM, and now account for a third of all new medicines (and over half of the biggest selling ones). These are used to treat a host of diseases, from breast cancer to arthritis and leukaemia. GM has been used to create insect-resistance in plants that greatly reduces or even eliminates the need for chemical insecticides, reducing the cost to the farmer and the environment. It also has the potential to make crops more nutritious, for example by adding healthier fats or more nutritious proteins. It’s been used to introduce nutrients such as beta carotene from which the body can make vitamin A – the so-called golden rice – which prevents night blindness in children. And GM can potentially create crops that are drought resistant – something that as water becomes scarce will become increasingly important. More than 10% of the world’s arable land is now used to grow GM plants. An extensive study conducted by the US National Academies of Sciences recently reported that there has been no evidence of ill effects linked to the consumption of any approved GM crop since the widespread commercialisation of GM products 18 years ago. It also reported that there was no conclusive evidence of environmental problems resulting from GM crops. GM is a tool, and how we use it is up to us. It certainly does not have to be the monopoly of a few multinational corporations. We can and should have adequate regulations to ensure the safety of any new crop strain (GM or otherwise) to both ourselves and the environment, and it is up to us to decide what traits in any new plant are acceptable. People may be opposed to GM crops for a variety of reasons and ultimately consumers will decide what they want to eat. But the one in nine people in poor countries facing malnutrition or starvation do not enjoy that choice. The availability of cheap, healthy and nutritious food for them is a matter of life and death. Alongside other improvements in farming practices, genetic modification is an important part of a sustainable solution to global food shortages. However, the motto of the Royal Society is nullius in verba; roughly, “take nobody’s word for it”. We need a well-informed debate based on an assessment of the evidence. The Royal Society has published GM Plants: questions and answers which can play its part in this. People should look at the evidence – not just loudly voiced opinions – for themselves and make up their own minds."
"A new coalmine in Cumbria has been given the green light by the government in the same week that the Treasury launched a review into how the UK can end its contribution to global heating. The developer, West Cumbria Mining, said the £165m mine would create 500 jobs.  The Cumbrian MP Tim Farron called the decision “a kick in the teeth in the fight to tackle climate change”. Farron had asked the government to “call in” the decision after it received unanimous planning approval by Cumbria county council in March. But his application has been rejected, with the local Conservative MP Trudy Harrison saying “sense has prevailed”. Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, expressed his dismay, saying the government should “invest fully in zero-carbon energy” instead. He said: “Cumbria has so many renewable resources to provide energy – water, wind and solar – and we should most definitely not be taking the backwards step of opening a new coalmine.” The news came as the government announced its net zero review, which will assess “how we can cut our emissions without seeing them exported elsewhere”. The mine, called Woodhouse Colliery, will be situated on the former Marchon industrial site near Whitehaven. It will extract coking coal from under the sea nearby, with access via the existing Sandwith Anhydrite mine portals, according to West Cumbria Mining. The company said site work should begin in early 2020, with coal production commencing two years later. It hopes to develop a mine that will produce 2m to 3m tonnes of hard metallurgical coal a year for around 50 years. Harrison said: “This is fantastic news. It is vital that this development goes ahead and I am pleased that common sense has prevailed. Woodhouse colliery has been recognised for its importance to the steel industry and to UK export. Coking coal is essential for the steel industry and this has been rightly recognised.” Deep coalmining in the UK, a sector that employed more than 1 million people across several thousand pits a century ago, ceased in December 2015 with the closure of Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire. After Cumbria county council approved the mine in March, Geoff Cook, chair of the council’s development control and regulation committee, said it had not been an easy decision. “All of us would prefer to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and we recognise that during construction there will be disruption to many local residents,” he said. “However, we felt that the need for coking coal, the number of jobs on offer and the chance to remove contamination outweighed concerns about climate change and local amenity.”"

"The Conservatives have been criticised for picking an election candidate who has questioned whether climate change is dangerous and argued its risks have been exaggerated as a “socialist Trojan horse”. Craig Morley, who is standing in the marginal Labour-held seat of Reading East, a key target for the Tories, has a long explanation on his website of why he believes the “dangerous climate change theory relies on shaky evidence”.  Morley, a former Foreign Office official who held a job as head of climate change and energy policy for south China, says the evidence for human-caused climate change is incontrovertible but goes on to claim scientific models have “overexaggerated” the trend of warming and are unable to predict its consequences. On his official website, a post written in the past year says: “The alarmism and lexicon of emergency used in the current debate has lost sense of reality and proportion. There is no developing catastrophe and no smoking gun. “We used to have a science where scientists make a claim or hypothesis, and then tested it against independent data. If they failed, they went back and started again. Today, all that seems to matter is who shouts the loudest. “Stripped of the theatre of hype, cheerleading rent-seekers, alarmist headlines, Extinction Rebellion stunts, climate emergencies and even Greta Thunberg’s lectures, the stark truth is that the modern ‘climate emergency’ movement is about politics and wealth redistribution, not science. “It is a socialist Trojan horse for delivering failed socialist economic policies through using the emotive lexicon of ‘emergency’, disaster, and doom-mongering.” Last month, Morley approvingly tweeted a Washington Post article highlighting the views of 500 “scientists and professionals” from Clintel, a Dutch climate science-denying thinktank endorsed by the UK’s climate science-denying Global Warming Policy Foundation. In his tweet, Morley wrote: “There is consensus that Earth has warmed. There is no consensus on what will happen in future, or what the impacts will be.” Morley’s stance is at odds with his party. Michael Gove, the former environment secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, have both acknowledged there is a climate emergency, even though the government has not formally declared one and missed parliament’s deadline for taking action to tackle the situation. Boris Johnson previously said climate change was a “primitive fear” that was “without foundation”, but changed his position to accept climate science after becoming foreign secretary. The Tories are concerned they are being outflanked on environmental and climate issues by Labour. The party has released a series of Facebook adverts of its candidates standing in front of trees and green spaces, with their names on green backgrounds, which appear to be aimed at younger audiences. Responding to Morley’s views, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said it was “no wonder the Tory party is attracting climate deniers”. She added: “Under the Tories, private investment in renewable energy is plummeting, support for solar and electric vehicles has been slashed and onshore wind has been effectively banned. “At this election, the choice is clear – this is our last chance to take action to protect future generations under Labour or allow the Tories to accelerate our planet’s destruction.” Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat climate change spokeswoman, said: “If ever voters needed a clear sign that the Tories weren’t serious about tackling the climate emergency then here it is. “Whether it’s expanding Heathrow, scrapping renewable energy or threatening our capability to work with our friends in Europe, the Conservatives have delayed climate action at every turn … We need climate action now, not more Tory climate action deniers.” Asked if he stood by the statement on his website, Morley said: “Tackling climate change is vital but independent experts and even Labour’s own unions say their promises don’t stack up. The GMB said ‘wishful thinking doesn’t generate the power we need to heat homes, keep the lights on and the economy functioning’. “The reality is that Jeremy Corbyn’s plans would wreck the economy, putting up bills for hardworking families – and preventing any real progress on climate change. “Under a Conservative government, we have decarbonised our economy faster than any other G20 nation and reduced greenhouse gas emissions faster than any other G7 nation since 2010.” A Conservative spokesman gave a similar response, saying: “We’ll take no lectures from Labour. Under the Conservatives, we have led the world in tackling climate change, cutting emissions faster than any other G20 country, taking renewable electricity generation to a record level and becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero. “While we make ambitious but achievable commitments to tackling climate change, independent experts and Labour’s trade union donors say Labour’s plans are ‘utterly unachievable’ and ‘almost certainly impossible’.”"
"Looking at weather maps showing the changes in temperature already occurring in Europe it is clear how lucky those are who live next to the cooling Atlantic Ocean. Even over the next three years the increased temperature gradient from west to east is quite alarming – with central Europe up to 2C hotter on average than 30 years ago. Even in Britain it is up to 1C warmer in the south-east. Ireland, Cornwall and west Wales, close to the cooling sea, are the only places where the rise is minimal. Even the Outer Hebrides and the far north of Scotland are warming appreciably because sea temperatures there have risen quite fast too.  So that everyone can prepare for the disruption that droughts, floods and extreme weather events will bring, researchers are dividing Europe up into 25km squares and developing a regional climate prognosis for each of them for the next few years. As scientists study past and present climate changes, the computer model can also calculate what the land surface temperature will be in a lattice of thousands of boxes across the earth’s surface. In Britain and Europe generally the forecasts are said to be most accurate because the sea temperatures off our west coast are the most comprehensively measured in the world. "
"New data on urban air quality from the World Health Organisation recently led Onitsha, Nigeria to be given the title of “most polluted city” in the world. International media also singled out the “most polluted city” in their region, and highlighted countries such as India which had several cities in the “top five”. Of course, it’s important to highlight cities where pollution is a big concern. Air pollution is a “silent killer”, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases such as asthma. Often, poorer and more vulnerable groups, such as children and the elderly suffer these effects the most. But this “name and shame” approach risks being inaccurate and misleading. For one thing, the pollutants that cause poor air quality can vary significantly between cities. Saying one city is more polluted than another is a bit like comparing apples and oranges – particularly when it comes to developing countries. To understand why, we need to dig down further into the data.  For its analysis, the WHO looked at levels of two types of particulate matter – PM₁₀ (which has a mean aerodynamic diameter of ten micrometres) and PM₂.₅ (which has a mean aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometres)  – for 796 cities from 2008 to 2013. PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅ include pollutants such as sulphates, nitrates and black carbon (soot), which penetrate deep into the lungs and into the cardiovascular system, posing the greatest risks to human health.  Unsurprisingly, the WHO analysis shows higher levels of urban air pollution in low and middle-income regions such as Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia. In these areas, a lack of funding and inadequate capacity to monitor air quality make it difficult to effectively reduce air pollution.  Based on PM₁₀ data, Onitsha, Nigeria topped the list in Africa, while Bamedna, Tanzania, had the highest PM₂.₅ levels. In the Americas, Santa Gertrudes, Brazil, had the worst PM₁₀ pollution, and Lima, Peru, topped the list for PM₂.₅. In the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia (which are clustered together in the database), Peshawar, Pakistan, is number one for PM₁₀, and Zabol, Iran, for PM₂.₅. And these examples focus only on particulate matter. The rankings would be more diverse if other common pollutants – such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone – were included in the database. There are several other reasons why the air quality of different cities cannot be directly compared. For example, different seasons have unique meteorological conditions and activities, which may cause dips or spikes in pollution. For instance, a city will have greater pollutant concentrations in a dry year than in a wet year, and higher levels of particulate matter at times when agricultural refuse is burned. So using data for one season to extrapolate an annual mean pollution level could skew the results.  What’s more, some cities will not make the “most polluted” list simply because they do not monitor air quality as is the case in some African cities. And even cities that do monitor pollution levels will have different numbers of monitoring stations in different sites. For example, the stations may be concentrated in less-polluted, residential areas in one city, and on busy roads with high pollution in another. A minimum number of monitoring stations is needed to obtain spatially representative data. The methods used to monitor different pollutants and analyse the data may also differ, requiring adjustments to make the data comparable. Finally, quality assurance and control of monitoring data, selection of instruments, calibration and documented performance in one city cannot be compared with a city of unknown data quality. Only by considering these variations can we accurately compare cities within and between countries. Otherwise, any rankings will be misleading. There are also political consequences: if city officials fear being “named and shamed”, they have a strong incentive to hide their data or under-report pollution. The controversy over Beijing’s air quality data highlights these risks. Clean air is a basic human right, and we urgently need to act to reduce air pollution – particularly in developing countries. Rankings and lists which single out the “worst cities” do not advance this cause: they only serve to misrepresent the data and politicise a public health issue. If we are to save lives now and protect future generations, we need to resist the clickbait headlines, and be more thoughtful and precise when talking about urban air quality."

"Imagine, for a second, that the slice of delectable cake melting in your mouth was made with flour ground from insects not grains. Or that your most alluring perfume – a special gift, perhaps – contained reclaimed ingredients once excreted audibly from someone else’s bowels. The visceral, gut reaction you might experience in these scenarios is a consequence of their “yuck factor” or capacity to disgust. Disgust is an emotion that causes us to reject things – and that is why we may expect there to be little demand for the kind of “eau de toilette” detailed above. Disgust evolved as part of our behavioural immune system, but it also plays a role in our sexual and moral judgements. Most of the time, disgust works well. For example it encourages us not to eat spoiled food, which could make us unwell. It is, however, an extremely blunt tool. While it gives us a quick and instinctive answer on how to act, it has evolved to be an overly conservative response, which often gets things wrong. 


 Things that either imitate or have a physical or psychological connection to sources of disgust, yet cannot cause us harm, often make us feel disgusted too.  This was first demonstrated in a series of classic experiments by the psychologist Paul Rozin in the 1980s. Among other things, people in these studies were much less likely to want to eat fudge shaped as dog faeces rather than discs, or the soup from a brand new bedpan rather than a bowl. The same yuck factor is a problem for sustainable consumption. When we are presented with choices it prompts us to choose the packaged and sterilised safe-looking option – the symmetrical and unblemished apple over its ugly sister. This results in us increasing waste rather than minimising it. Our disgust response is either exploited – for example in the advertising of cleaning products – to make us feel like we need to consume more. Or it acts as an irrational barrier to sustainable solutions that are rationally OK, but automatically trigger a primitive and overly sensitive emotion system. This includes things that increase our exposure to products that do have potential to make us unwell, such as handling reusable nappies or composting. But it also makes us averse to things that won’t do us any harm, such as atypically shaped fruits and vegetables, or food made from insect proteins or purified water or medicine that have been reclaimed from sewage. These things either have features that imitate real indicators of disease (asymmetry), or have been in contact with things that could make us ill (sewage). So our disgust system misfires and is difficult to override, despite rational information that these objects are safe to consume. There are individual differences in how sensitive people are to disgust; some people are less affected than others. Plus, our disgust responses are moulded by society, so we see a lot of variation in what different cultures find disgusting, such as eating insects. Disgust is also malleable in the early years of life, so generational change in disgust responses isn’t uncommon. When disgust responses are established, however, they have been shown to be more resistant to change than other emotions such as fear. Once this has happened there are some techniques from behavioural science that can help. One approach is to reduce the disgust people feel through “masking”. For example, rather than oven-baked crickets, companies introducing insect-based foods into the UK supply-chain may rely on products made from ground insect protein with packaging that dissociates their creepy-crawly ingredients. A recent experiment in branding found that people were much more willing to use and pay more for the same product described as “recycled water” than “treated wastewater”. So presenting something in a palatable way can make all the difference. Yet, you still have the psychological problem. The idea one is eating insects or the idea one is gargling treated sewage – and ideas are sufficient to cause people to viscerally reject something. A second approach does not focus on changing how much disgust someone feels, but how they think about it. The most basic way is to educate people – get them to consider that when they feel disgusted by something whether there is a reasoned argument behind this, or a false alarm? In psychology, we call this “reappraisal”. A third approach is to exploit emotions that are generally antithetical to disgust-based rejection, such as compassion. Recent work by Nathan Consedine and colleagues at the University of Auckland shows this might work for nursing behaviours that evoke disgust. We can apply the same mechanisms here by making people feel compassion for the odd-looking fruit and vegetables that are normally wasted (“don’t leave me behind”). Or by triggering compassion for the environment, emphasising it is vulnerable and in-need or our care. So, despite our evolutionary instincts, there are ways we can overcome the yuck factor to live more sustainably. We just need to learn more about them.  Hear more about the yuck factor and how one person’s waste can be another’s treasure on The Conversation’s podcast, The Anthill."
"Germany has ambitious plans for both electric cars and renewable energy. But it can’t deliver both. As things stand, Germany’s well-meaning but contradictory ambitions would actually boost emissions by an amount comparable with the present-day emissions of the entire country of Uruguay or the state of Montana. In October 2016 the Bundesrat, the country’s upper legislative chamber, called for Germany to support a phase-out of gasoline vehicles by 2030. The resolution isn’t official government policy, but even talk of such a ban sends a strong signal towards the country’s huge car industry. So what if Germany really did go 100% electric by 2030? To environmentalists, such a change sounds perfect. After all, road transport is responsible for a big chunk of our emissions and replacing regular petrol vehicles with electric cars is a great way to cut the carbon footprint. But it isn’t that simple. The basic problem is that an electric car running on power generated by dirty coal or gas actually creates more emissions than a car that burns petrol. For such a switch to actually reduce net emissions, the electricity that powers those cars must be renewable. And, unless things change, Germany is unlikely to have enough green energy in time. After all, news of the potential petrol car ban came just after the chancellor, Angela Merkel, had announced she would slow the expansion in new wind farms as too much intermittent renewable power was making the grid unstable. Meanwhile, after Fukushima, Germany has pledged to retire its entire nuclear reactor fleet by 2022.  In an analysis published in Nature, my colleague Harry Hoster and I have looked at how Germany’s electricity and transport policies are intertwined. They each serve the noble goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, when combined, they might actually lead to increased emissions. We investigated what it would take for Germany to keep to its announcements and fully electrify its road transportation – and what that would mean for emissions. Our research shows that you can’t simply erase fossil fuels from both energy and transport in one go, as Germany may be about to find out. It’s certainly true that replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric ones would overnight lead to a huge reduction in Germany’s energy needs. This is because electric cars are far more efficient. When petrol is burned, just 30% or less of the energy released is actually used to move the car forwards – the rest goes into exhaust heat, water pumps and other inefficiencies. Electric cars do lose some energy through recharging their batteries, but overall at least 75% goes into actual movement.  Each year, German vehicles burn around 572 terawatt-hour (TWh)‘s worth of liquid fuels. Based on the above efficiency savings, a fully electrified road transport sector would use around 229 TWh. So Germany would use less energy overall (as petrol is a source of energy) but it would need an astonishing amount of new renewable or nuclear generation. And there is another issue: Germany also plans to phase out its nuclear power plants, ideally by 2022, but 2030 at the latest. This creates a further void of 92TWh to be filled. Adding up the extra renewable electricity needed to power millions of cars, and that required to replace nuclear plants, gives us a total of 321 TWh of new generation required by 2030. That’s equivalent to dozens of massive new power stations. Even if renewable energy expands at the maximum rate allowed by Germany’s latest plan, it will still only cover around 63 TWh of what’s required. Hydro, geothermal and biomass don’t suffer from the same intermittency problems as wind or solar, yet the country is already close to its potential in all three. This therefore means the rest of the gap – an enormous 258 TWh – will have to be filled by coal or natural gas. That is the the current total electricity consumption of Spain, or ten Irelands.  Germany could choose to fill the gap entirely with coal or gas plants. However, relying entirely on coal would lead to further annual emissions of 260 million tonnes of carbon dioxide while gas alone would mean 131m tonnes. By comparison, German road transport currently emits around 156m tonnes of CO2, largely from car exhausts. Therefore, unless the electricity shortfall is filled almost entirely with new natural gas plants, Germany could switch to 100% electric cars and it would still end up with a net increase in emissions.  The above chart shows a more realistic scenario where half of the necessary electricity for electric cars would come from new gas plants and half from new coal plants. We have assumed both coal and gas would become 25% more efficient. In this relatively likely scenario, the emissions of the road transportation sector actually increase by 20%, or 32 million tonnes of CO2 (comparable to Uruguay or Montana’s annual emissions). If Germany really does want a substantial reduction in vehicle emissions, its energy and transport policies must work in sync. Instead of capping new solar plants or wind farms, it should delay the nuclear phase-out and focus on getting better at predicting electricity demand and storing renewable energy."
"What does a staple food such as bread have to do with global warming? For a start, to make loaves on an industrial scale, you’ll need powerful milling and kneading machines and a huge oven, heated to 230℃ or more. This uses a lot of energy. The flour, yeast and salt must also be shipped in and, finally, the finished loaves are delivered to stores – all in trucks powered by petrol. But it isn’t milling or baking or transport that accounts for most of the environmental impact of bread. In a new a study published in the journal Nature Plants, colleagues and I looked at the entire supply chain of a regular loaf – from seed to sandwich, via mill and bakery. We found that more than half its environmental impact arises not from food processing but from the production of the raw material, the wheat grain.  Food causes about a third of total greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the supply chains can be so complex that it is difficult to determine what part of the process is responsible – and without this information neither the industry nor consumers will know what to do about it. This is why it’s useful to take a zoomed-out look at the entire process. Thanks to a collaboration with a bread manufacturer we had accurate “primary” data for every stage of their particular brand of 800g loaf. We found that ammonium nitrate fertiliser alone accounts for 43% of all the greenhouse gas emissions, dwarfing all other processes in the supply chain including baking and milling. These emissions arise from the large amounts of energy and natural gas needed to produce fertiliser, and from the nitrous oxide released when it is degraded in the soil. For crops to grow big and fast, they need nitrogen, usually through fertiliser. It is the key ingredient of intensive agriculture. Without fertiliser, either we produce less food or we use much more land to produce the same amount, at greater economic and environmental cost. That is the fix we are in.  We could reduce the use of fertiliser by recycling agricultural and human waste as manure, in order to retain the nitrogen in the same cycle. We could also harness the best of organic farming by, for example, using “green manures” or rotating crops with legumes that “fix” nitrogen in the soil. Precision agriculture can be used to only apply fertiliser where and when it is needed, using new sensor technologies including drones to monitor the nutritional status of soils and plants. And we can even develop new varieties of crops that are able to use nitrogen more efficiently by, for instance, harnessing fungi in the soil or getting soil microbes to release less nitrous oxide.  But technology isn’t the only solution – we could also change our diets. Meat, in particular, is a very inefficient use of nitrogen, as cows or chickens use up energy and nutrients simply staying alive before being slaughtered.  Cereal crops such as wheat are a much more efficient way of converting nitrogenous fertiliser into nitrogen in food protein. Studies show emphatically that low-meat diets are also good for the environment. But whose responsibility is it to reduce fertiliser use? After all, fingers could be pointed at the fertiliser manufacturer, the farmer, or even the retailers and consumers who demand cheap bread. With goods like electronics or car tyres there is a growing recognition for a notion of extended producer responsibility where manufacturers are held responsible for the continuing impact of their products, often including disposal. This could be extended to fertilisers too. Consumers could pay more for “greener bread” or apply pressure to use less fertiliser. But things can be confusing as people are usually entirely unaware of the environmental impacts embodied in the products they consume. This is particularly the case for food, where the mains concerns are over human health or animal welfare – not emissions. Many will be surprised that wheat cultivation has a greater environmental impact than baking or milling. This highlights one of the key conflicts in the food security challenge. The agriculture industry’s primary purpose is to make money, not to provide sustainable food for the whole world. Profits for farmers and retailers rely on highly productive crops – which require lots of relatively cheap fertiliser. However the environmental impact of this fertiliser is not costed within the system and so there are currently no real incentives to fix things.  Feeding seven billion people fairly and sustainably is therefore not only a question of technology but also one of political economy. We need incentives to use less fertiliser – and we could start with bread."

His conclusion: Germany’s energy-feed-in act is a failure. What follows are some excerpts:
On the costs, Vahrenholt writes:
…wind, solar and bioenergy sources are considerably more expensive than conventional energy sources.  Currently in Germany €24 billion a year are paid because of the feed-in act. Federal Environment Minister Gabriel knows that unbraked expansion will lead to a cost avalanche of 1000 billion euros. […] The average family of three are forced to pay 250 € a year [currently]. “
On the practicality of installing so much solar capacity in a country with barely any sunshine…
Why on earth are we stalling 52,000 MW of solar energy capacity in the next years in a country that sees as much sunshine as Alaska?”
And
Wind and solar energy do not deliver a stable supply. Wind turbines produce only as much energy in a year as they would if they ran at full capacity for 1800 hours. PV systems only 800 hours. A year, however, has 8760 hours.”
What does that mean for industry? Vahrenholt writes:

The electricity costs for industry today are already 26% higher than the EU average. Compared to the USA, the difference is already 150%.  The creeping process of deindustrialization has begun.”
No CO2 reductions. Vahrenholt also writes that no CO2 is going to be saved by German green energy:
With every newly built wind turbine and every new solar roof, not a single gram of CO2 is going to be avoided. That is because of the fact that in Europe the emission of CO2 is determined by emissions trading.”
On CO2 climate sensitivity:
The scientific findings that the climate impact by CO2 is wildly exaggerated are accumulating. There has not been any significant global warming in 16 years even though one third of the historical emissions took place in the period and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has climbed year after year. The climate models, all whose prognoses have turned out to be wrong, are not able to compute the natural fluctuations of the climate. […]
Yes CO2 is a gas that has an impact on climate, but it will not cause the global mean temperature of the earth to rise more than 1 to 1.5°C  by the year 2100.”
Obsolete model. Will other countries follow Germany’s once highly ballyhooed lead?
No nation on earth is going to follow us when they see that Germany’s own industrial basis is being destroyed and citizens are being financially overwhelmed. […]
The renewable energy act in it’s current form is simply supporting the old power plants of the last decades and is not leading to any CO2 reduction and is eroding the industrial base of Germany. It is not an export hit. Rather it is an obsolete model whose consequences can hardly be managed any longer.”

"During the darkest hours of the night, they fly and hunt for prey. They live in caves and ruined buildings and have to drink blood every night to survive. They can bite with their fangs without you even noticing. No wonder these bats are called vampires. Yet when it comes to coping with these bloodthirsty creatures, the good news is that a breakthrough could finally be in sight.  Vampire bats only live in one part of the world – which is a relief, unless you happen to be in Latin America. They exist between northern Mexico and northern Chile, and they are a major problem. They are now the main cause of human deaths from rabies in the region.  Between 2009 and 2013, vampire bats bit 20,000 people in Peru alone, according to the country’s health minister; and in communities across the Amazon, where bites are commonplace, the rate of rabies infection could be almost as high as 1% per year. At least 12 children were killed by rabies earlier this year in a single outbreak.  Meanwhile, farmers lose a few thousand livestock every year – or perhaps many more, since the worst-hit remote communities almost certainly under-report infection rates. We found that about 70% of farms in the Andes have at least one animal bitten regularly.  The virus is also steadily expanding into areas that were historically free of the disease, as we discovered through our recent work in Peru. As many as 12 new governmental districts become infected per year on average, which has doubled the number of outbreaks at national level. We found that the virus invades new areas in waves that advance at between 10km and 20km per year. The advance is stalled only by tall mountains that rise above the altitudes where bats thrive.  We don’t know what has sparked the spread of rabies into new territories, but one possibility is that bats nowadays have access to more livestock and man-made structures for roosting. This could be making it possible to allow the disease to spread by connecting previously isolated populations.  We are pleased to report that the waves of rabies in bats move quite predictably. This makes it possible to forecast in some areas when and where the virus is likely to strike next. With this information, which has not been known until now, the authorities in Peru will have the option of anticipating their arrival, allowing them to vaccinate the animals and people before deaths begin.  This would be a big shift from the norm, where livestock and people typically get vaccinated only after an outbreak has been declared. Assuming the virus behaves in the same way in other countries, the same approach could be adopted across Latin America.  Having said that, vaccinating animals and people does nothing to prevent the spread of the virus. It only saves the recipients of vaccines from dying. If you want to stop the virus, you have to tackle the source of the transmission – the bats themselves.  Since the 1970s, Latin American governments’ answer has been bat culls. Yet there is no convincing evidence that this has made a substantial difference, and it may even have been counterproductive – by mainly targetting adult bats that are already immune and provoking bats to disperse between roosts, it might have hastened the spread of the disease.  Governments across the world have been very successful at using mass-vaccination programmes to curb rabies in dogs and other key carrier species such as foxes and raccoons, but this has never been attempted on a large scale with vampire bats. This is despite the fact that an effective vaccine is now an option. Researchers in Mexico and Brazil have shown that you can prevent bats in captivity from catching rabies by giving them an orally transmitted gel that has been impregnated with the vaccine.   Whether this would work with wild bats is another matter, of course. All the biological and ethical challenges inherent in any wildlife vaccination campaign are likely to apply, not to mention the logistical challenge of remote landscapes in the Andes and Amazon.  But our findings on the way that the disease spreads in waves among bats could change the game here, too: rather than seeking to eliminate rabies from all vampire bats in endemically infected areas, we could try to halt the spread into new areas instead.  It is also important to galvanise interest in bat vaccination among public health officials and conservationists for other reasons. As well as rabies, bat populations are thought to spread other diseases such as Ebola and white-nose syndrome in other parts of the world.  Given that vampire bat rabies has a major impact on human lives and livestock, and we now have both an effective vaccine and a better understanding of how it spreads, we believe this is the right starting point to inspire a new generation of disease control strategies for bats. It is surely something we could all get our teeth into."
"Former Greens senator Scott Ludlam has pleaded not guilty, after he was arrested during Extinction Rebellion climate change protests in Sydney in October. Ludlam had been charged with not complying with police direction regarding a road closure.  On Thursday his lawyer Russell Byrnes told registrar Stephen Lister that the former federal senator, as well as six other protesters, would all be pleading not guilty. The case will have its first hearing date on 21 November. Ludlam was not present in court on Thursday. Police have charged Ludlam with breaching section 148B(2) of the Road Transport Act, which has a maximum penalty of a $2,200 fine. Byrnes told Guardian Australia outside court that this was “a very simple charge”. “We’re pleading not guilty, and we hope justice prevails,” he said. Ludlam was initially given strict bail conditions which banned him from coming within 2.5km of the Sydney Town Hall or attending future Extinction Rebellion events. Other protesters arrested were given bail conditions that banned them from “going near” or talking to other members of Extinction Rebellion, which civil liberties lawyers said could breach the constitution. In October, Ludlam and other protesters had these bail conditions dismissed by judges. Thirty other protesters, including four teenage girls, were arrested at the same time, as they called on the government to take action on the climate crisis. Extinction Rebellion’s “spring rebellion” was a week-long series of protests across Australia – from road blockages to singalongs. New South Wales police prosecutor, senior sergeant Jamie Palmer, said there were “some 40 people co-accused in these matters”, and it would “need to run as one hearing”. She told the court that some of the other protesters had already pleaded guilty and been sentenced. In October, Ludlam told Guardian Australia that if the government wanted to stop climate protesters, they should take action on policy. “The people [arrested] are very well aware that if you are disrupting traffic that will invoke a police response. People are not surprised to hear these are arrestable offences. “The question really is, if the government wants us to stop – whether that is the school kids or people doing banner drops – they have a very simple and clear path to do that. “Nobody is doing this for fun. We are doing it for a purpose, and that is for the government to snap out of it.”"
"More than 1,000 Google workers have signed a public letter calling on their employer to commit to an aggressive “company-wide climate plan” that includes canceling contracts with the fossil fuel industry and halting its donations to climate change deniers. The letter, which is addressed to Google’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, also calls for zero emissions by 2030 and “zero collaboration with entities enabling the incarceration, surveillance, displacement or oppression of refugees or frontline communities”.  “We’re excited to keep building momentum as tech workers join millions of people all over the world acting boldly for a livable future,” said Sharon Campbell-Crow, a senior technical writer for Google, by email. “Marginalized communities have worked for climate justice for decades; Google needs to catch up and stop funding climate denial.” The public campaign by Google workers follows similar efforts by employees of Amazon and Microsoft. Workers across the tech industry participated in the global climate strike on 20 September. Like many corporations, Google boasts about its sustainability and says that it supports global action on climate change. According to its annual environmental report, Google has been “carbon neutral” since 2007, and uses 100% renewable energy for its operations. But Google has also made large donations to more than a dozen organizations that have worked against climate action or sought to roll-back environmental protections, the Guardian revealed in October. Those contributions include funds to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which helped convince the Trump administration to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The letter calls for “zero funding for climate-denying or -delaying think tanks, lobbyists and politicians”. In a blogpost announcing their participation in the global climate strike, the group calling themselves Google Workers for Action on Climate wrote: “In 2018 the company funded 111 members of Congress who voted against climate legislation at least 90% of the time.” Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, responded to the demand for zero emissions by 2030 in an interview with the Financial Times on the day of the global climate strike. “It doesn’t seem unreasonable to me,” he said. “We want to be ambitious in how we think about it. It definitely seems the kind of timeline by which we want to accomplish those things.” “We stand by our call for Google to make a clear public commitment to all four demands,” said Campbell-Crow. The letter also takes aim at the company’s contracts with fossil fuel companies. Google provides cloud computing services for the oil and gas industry, including using its artificial intelligence technology to help fossil fuel companies perform data analysis, according to Gizmodo. “I can’t feel good about my job if the profits I help generate and the codebases I contribute to can be leveraged to accelerate fossil fuel extraction or fund groups that delay or deny urgent climate action,” said Sam Kern, a UX engineer at Google. “It’s unacceptable for Google to build technologies that help oil and gas companies identify new reserves, accelerate extraction and prolong reliance on fossil fuels.” The letter comes just over a year after approximately 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout in protest of the company’s handling of sexual harassment. The company has been at the center of a wave of employee activism in the tech industry, with employees speaking out over issues ranging from the ethics of supplying artificial intelligence to the US defense department to the treatment of subcontracted workers. Google declined to comment but provided a link to Porat’s recent blogpost on sustainability."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn March 17, Germany’s Helmholtz Association held a podium discussion in Berlin. The title: “What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts”.

Climate science and policy panel discussion in Berlin, March 17, 2014. Photo: Helmholtz Association
I wrote about this almost 6 weeks ago, read here. What’s a bit special about this podium discussion is that one skeptic, Dr. Peter Heller of Science Skeptical, was allowed to take part on the panel of 5 experts.
The five experts discussed climate science and the uncertainty surrounding it. The Helmholtz Association has since released a report on the event.
There is no concensus
On the claim there is a consensus, the Helmholtz Association panel discussion clearly dumps cold water on that in its article right off the bat, writing in the introduction:
Experts dispute the extent, consequences and causes of climate change.”
Hans von Storch, a critic of science actively telling policymakers what to do, however then said:
Global warming is a fact and cannot be scientifically explained without the observed increase in greenhouse gases.”
But this is statement that everyone agrees on, including skeptics. Unfortunately von Storch does not say how much of the warming is due to greenhouse gases, which is not a surprise because no one knows the answer to that question. Is it 5%? 20% 50% or 95%?

Andreas Hense, Professor for Climate Dynamics and the University of Bonn, reminds that there is uncertainty involved in the science and adds:
But what we do know with a relatively high accuracy, with high probability, is that certain climate variables such as the upper air temperature over the last 100 or 120 years have changed due to man-made influences, but not only because man-made influences but also volcanic influences or solar influences.”
So natural factors are being acknowledged after all. The Helmholtz article writes that the panel member opinions on the magnitudes the different factors have on climate “diverged”, thus confirming that there is no consensus.
Von Storch fears a role for science in policymaking
The Helmholtz article also writes that many scientists feel they are being crowded into a role in which they do not feel comfortable:
Hense said that he now avoids all discussions with the media. Von Storch said he even fears science taking a role in the political decision processes which they are not entitled to take.”
Schellnhuber’s approach roundly rejected
Werner Krauss at Klimazwiebel also reports on the podium discussion, and writes that the 2°C target of was rejected unanimously by the panelists (4 of 5 of whom were warmists) and that “a Herr Schellnhuber was sorely missed and thoroughly dissed – everyone agreed on the rejection of the scientifically dubious limits such as the 2°C target or measures that are not democratically legitimized.”
So all of us here in Germany can breath a sigh of relief in that even warmists think the Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s master plan for a great transformation of society and its calls for a watering down of democracy is going too far.
Hopefully the Helmholtz Association will post the video of this worthwhile event in the days ahead.

"The clash on the River Thames outside Westminster between Nigel Farage’s flotilla of fishing boats and Bob Geldof’s Remain ship was one of the EU referendum’s defining images. But fishing has long been at the centre of UK hostility towards Europe, with many blaming the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP) for the decline of the British industry.  Calls for the UK to reclaim its seas and fish were emotive and significant elements of the Brexit campaign. But, as Britain now enters the Brexit era, what actually are the legal implications of withdrawal for UK fisheries? First things first: change may be afoot, but it will not be quick. Until the UK formally invokes Article 50, fisheries regulation will remain as it was before the referendum. Economic stability is undoubtedly the short-term priority. Fisheries may be particularly valuable in Aberdeenshire, Shetland or along England’s east coast, but the industry still comprises less than 0.1% of the UK’s GDP. As in the past, continued access for European fleets to British fishing grounds may form part of a final compromise between the UK and the EU. Reforming the law will take considerable time and effort. A quick look at the marine management blue book, an online database of fisheries legislation, reveals more than 100 different laws or policy instruments at the EU and domestic level alone. Brexit does not mean fisheries will become simpler. Being in or out of Europe does not change the need for regulation to ensure fishing is conducted safely and sustainably. Although most fisheries law is derived from the EU, there are important pieces of domestic legislation which may remain in force, regardless of Brexit. The UK’s territorial sea, continental shelf (seabed) and 200 nautical mile “exclusive economic zone” are established under domestic law, for instance. These will not require review, unless Scotland gains independence and so require the redrawing of international boundaries. Scottish waters comprise 62% of the UK total and contain many productive fishing grounds. Brexit may provide an opportunity to update and consolidate some of the UK’s diffuse and dated fishing laws. Parts of the basic legal framework are nearly 50 years old now, such as the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. But these domestic laws are still interwoven with their EU equivalents. By itself, UK law does not provide anywhere near a complete regulatory regime for fishing and so, while some domestic laws may continue, there will need to be a wholesale review. The CFP is the most important part of Britain’s fisheries regulation. And it will continue to apply until the UK formally withdraws from the EU. Even then UK vessels will still have to comply with EU rules on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing if they want to sell their fish to Europe. It has been a controversial policy. And one rightly criticised. Yet, it is something of an irony that reforms introduced in 2014 have begun to yield positive results. More stocks are being fished at the maximum sustainable yield, and economic efficiency has improved in some sectors. (with the exception of the Mediterranean). The North Sea has been an example of this, and British trawlers in particular have benefited. While the CFP regulates fishing, the UK has wide discretion over who it allocates its quota too, generally favouring large, factory-scale ships. The Dutch-controlled Cornelis Vrolijk and Interfish ships, and the British firm Andrew Marr hold a 61% share of the UK quota. Legal challenges in favour of smaller, low-impact vessels have failed. This indicates Brexit may not entail a change in domestic allocation practices. The UK is a party to both the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS) and the Fish Stocks Agreement 1995. These treaties mean the UK will still have to negotiate and share responsibilities with neighbouring states in the waters around the UK, and on the high seas, regardless of Brexit. UNCLOS entitles the UK to sovereign rights to explore and exploit natural resources in its exclusive economic zone. The call to “take back our seas” implies ownership or exclusivity – going it alone. This is unlikely. Under international law, coastal states are stewards, not owners, of their exclusive economic zone, and obliged to cooperate in fisheries management. This may entail allowing foreign fleets access to fish stocks in coastal waters. The EU currently represents the UK on the organisations that manage regional fisheries, either covering a particular area or a migratory species like tuna. The UK will need to secure membership in order to benefit from quota allocations of valuable fish such as mackerel. Yet it seems unlikely that the UK could simply continue on the same terms as its EU membership, and admitting new states is a headache as existing members want to maintain their own quotas. Nonetheless, securing fishing agreements with EU neighbours is essential. The UK has too many maritime neighbours to ignore, and fish don’t notice or respect international boundaries. These are just some of the challenges an already stretched civil service will have to meet if it is to uphold international commitments and ensure UK interests are advanced. In our view, Brexit is unlikely to produce a radical revolution in fishing regulation and allocation. At least in the short to medium term. There is scope for change, but it must ensure fishing is conducted in a truly sustainable manner, and in a way that ensures the integrity and security of marine ecosystems. Britain can’t do this alone – even after Brexit."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest Greenpeace activist has been denied bail by a Russian court in the Arctic port city of Murmansk.
The online Mail here features photos of a young Greenpeace woman-activist behind bars – the face of innocence. Greenpeace portrays itself as the moral and ethical conscience of the planet and insists it is simply an innocent victim of a state that is greedily attempting to exploit a virgin region.
The latest to be denied bail is 27 year-old Briton Alexandra Harris. Harris is among the youngest of the 30 arrested. Now that she has been denied bail, there is little hope of any of the 30 activists getting released. This is truly a tragic development, especially for the younger, naïve activists. They will now get plenty of time to reflect on how they wound up doing long, hard time in a Russian prison.
With time they may come to realize that they had been enticed by a Greenpeace deal: accept hate in exchange for the title of “moral champion of the globe”. An irresistible deal for any soul in the possession of a young, naïve, or just plain dim mind.
Greenpeace is not a peaceful organization. It is one of violence, condescending intolerance, and confrontation, all hiding behind a guise of moral superiority. It recruits the young, teaches them to hate opposing views and to never compromise with them. It rejects dialogue, always claiming the discussion is over and that they are the ultimate keepers of the truth. Greenpeace teaches the young that they can justify acts of violence and law-breaking by simply claiming moral superiority and the struggle for a noble cause.
Perhaps the young activists will come to realize in a few months (or years) that they had been brainwashed into thinking they were environmental saints who in reality had only been used as publicity pawns for a multi-million dollar publicity machine. What moral, peaceful organization does the following to the young?

What’s the difference between the boy above and the following radicalized Islamic boy?

I’d say there is very little difference. Both rants are based on religious faith, both children are irreversibly convinced they are the keepers of the Truth, both have been filled with hatred, both are very angry, and both had been programmed by a powerful organization.
Today Greenpeace higher-ups are all acting indignant that their members would be locked up in prison, under harsh conditions even, and insist their protesters were peaceful and were only demonstrating to rescue the planet’s future. “Does this young girl really look like a pirate to you?” …”Alex is a caring, sensitive person, who cares for the environmental future of  the planet.” … “She was on board the Arctic Sunrise as part of a peaceful protest, in international waters, in the radio room doing her job.”
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo calls the charge of piracy “absurd”. After all, the highest moral conscience and authority on the planet would never engage in such activity. 
Naidoo appears to have never bothered reading the Law of the Sea. Legally Greenpeace executives acted recklessly. Now one of their crews has to pay a massive price for it. Could Greenpeace lawyers and executives be sued for legal incompetence?
Naidoo adds:
Now these 30 people are prisoners of conscience and we are all responsible for their fate.”
Now we are all responsible. In Naidoo’s mind, all of humanity must follow, without questioning, his belief, his Truth. This man is a dangerous egomaniac who has completely lost his marbles.
The families of all young Greenpeace activists would be wise to wake up to this quickly.

Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, one of the fathers of the modern environmental movement, and today persona non grata for having published a skeptical climate science book last year, met IPCC climate scientist Daniela Jacob in a head-to-head debate before an audience of 100 at the Scandic Hotel in Hamburg yesterday evening. The debate was organized by Angela Merkel’s CDU Christian Democratic Party.
Vahrenholt trounced the former NCAR scientist, who was broken down into making a number of admissions.

Unusual debate at the CDU in Hamburg: A renowned climatologist debates scientist critic and RWE supervisory board member Fritz Vahrenholt. The dispute reveals a new stage in the handling of climate prognoses.”
The days of uncritical acceptance of climate prognoses are over. The trust is gone. Open criticism of climate science is gaining traction in Germany as climate prognoses from renowned institutes are being viewed by the public and media with increasing skepticism. Spiegel writes:
After Vahrenholt and Jacob each made a presentation and duked it out in a heated dispute, the duel appeared to decide: “When the climate models do not agree with the reality”, Vahrenholt thundered, “then reality is not what’s false!”
Hostile audiences are becoming a thing of the past for climate skeptics – even among the generally climate alarmist CDU conservative party audiences. The overall reaction by the Hamburg audience signals a growing, pent-up resentment among Germans as the inkling that the climate catastrophe is more charade than fact begins to sink in.
Failed climate models “the wound of climate science”
In its article, Spiegel calls the growing disagreement between model results and measured observations “the wound of climate science“.  Spiegel writes on Vahrenholt’s claim of faulty models:
With that statement Vahrenholt bored into the wound of climate science: For 15 years the global mean temperature has remained stagnant, the computer models had not foreseen the warming pause. The models could not reproduce the surprising temperature trend, reported climatologists surrounding Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz-Zentrum GKSS in a new study. The probability that the simulations in this respect are faulty is higher than 98 percent. The climate catastrophe is refuted, believes Vahrenholt, who made his audacious claims into a bestseller.”

That German establishment-shaking bestseller is now coming in English in September: North America and UK. And there are discussions to have the book out in Polish.
Vahrenholt scoffed at the excuse that the oceans had swallowed up the heat, saying it was not credible. Jacob even desperately had to cite the Bible to explain the missing heat: “We know this already from the Bible: Seven goods years follow seven bad years.”
Prognoses with “concrete numbers was an error”
Jacob reluctantly had to admit the shortcomings with the models, blaming poor communication for the model failures: “We do however have to improve the communication with the public,” Jacob admitted. “One error was giving out concrete figures for the prognoses.” She then conceded that we ought not be surprised that the models projections were wrong and that there’s lots of uncertainty, adding: “In the economy and in a marriage they aren’t any better.”
Untypical for an IPCC scientist, Jacob also admitted that the models exaggerated. “I don’t think highly of that. we all have learned from it.”
Why did no scientist intervene?
With that admission, Bojanowski writes that Vahrenholt didn’t pass up the opportunity to capitalize, loudly demanding:
Why is it then, when panic was rampant, no moderate climate scientist intervened? … You too must sometimes publicly distance yourselves from the agitators at the Potsdam-Institute, Frau Jacob!”
Applause from the audience, Bojanwski writes. Vahrenholt continued:
The catastrophic heightening of some scientists now threatens to destroy Germany as a place to do business.  … 1000 billion euros for the Energiewende, who is going to pay for it?”
Good question. And what does a scientist feeding on the public trough like Jacob care? Her answer, Spiegel writes:
 I makes statements in my field of study as a scientist, and not politically.”
Germany is slowly awakening.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmists would like to have everyone think that “white Christmases” were normal back in the days before global warming and that human behavior has ruined it all.
But Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski looks back at the statistics of snow on Christmas Day and finds that a white Christmas in Germany happened with a higher frequency in the past is a myth. He writes, “Scientists trace back the nostalgia of a wintery Christmas season to postcards from the year 1863, among other things.”
Later in the article we read that the 19th century postcards stem from New England, mainly Vermont, my home state! The postcard shown from sister state New Hampshire, judging from the vegetation, is definitely high elevation White Mountains. And having spoken to my sister in Vermont yesterday, there’s white stuff on the ground right now in Vermont as well. As I write, the temperature at the Champlain Valley Westford station is a nippy -19°C www.westfordweather.net/.
Bojanowski quotes the findings of the German Weather Service (DWD):
“Despite global climate warming, white Christmases have not become less frequent over the last 100 years.”
He writes that Munich is Germany’s large city that has the highest chances of seeing a white Christmas, with chances at only 40%. Clearly a green Christmas is far more common than a white one. Bojanowski writes the belief that Christmases were whiter in the past also stems in part from the older folks who remember the harsh winters of the 1940s – 1970s, a time when scientists were warning of a coming ice age, i.e. a time that corresponded to a negative phase PDO and AMO.
The DWD findings confirm a quick check of the statistics I made awhile back for snow on Christmas Day in northern Germany near where I am now currently living. Since 1890, there have been on average about 2 white Christmases per decade (Bremen). The last 2 white Christmases were in 2010 and 2011.
Globally, statistics seem to be showing that snowfall is trending upwards. Polar sea ice is getting close to record levels. Global temperatures over the last 8 years have been dropping somewhat. These are hard facts warmists are going to have to start getting used to.
Snow or not, hope you all have an enjoyable Christmas!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Schleswig Holstein Zeitung (SHZ) here features an interview with prominent IPCC climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch titled: A climate scientist against the spread of panic.
Hans von Storch also runs the respected Klimazwiebel blog and has at one time or another harshly criticized both sides of the climate debate. See yesterday’s NTZ story here.
Climate science losing its credibility
In the SHZ interview, the introduction writes as follows with regards to extreme weather events:
Climate scientists Hans von Storch, Director of the Helmholtz Center for Coastal Research in Geeshacht, fears that all of climate science will lose its credibility if panic keeps being spread.”
Haiyun no record storm
On whether Haiyun is a wake-up call for policymakers, von Storch reminds us that “extreme events are all part of normal weather” and that Haiyan was no record storm and that there has been no unusual increased frequency in the region over the last years. This storm can hardly be understood as a sign of man-made climate change.”
Models may have underestimated natural factors
On the models inadequate performance over the last 15 years, von Storch believes that the models may have underestimated natural factors like the sun, or that CO2 has been overrated. But he also says he sees no reason to discard the models altogether.
Acid rain scientists lost much of their credibility
Later in the interview von Storch gives his opinion on the acid-rain forest-die-off scare of the 1980s. He thinks that because of the unwarranted hysteria, few people today listen at all to forest scientists, and that he would prefer that “climate science should not become a Greenpeace arm of the government.”

Some scientists think they are keepers of the truth
Next the SHZ asks von Storch how it can be that some of his colleagues have succumbed to panic spreading. Hans von Storch:
We can think of other people in the 20th century who felt compelled to create a better world and who thought they were the keepers of a higher truth. In our case there are some that think they can derive this privilege from the scientific. Improving the world and people here mostly end up on the wayside.
I don’t believe this is the majority of climate scientists. There are a few especially visible climate scientists who are pushing such thoughts.”
Some climate scientists are abusing climate science
Hans von Storch then adds that he feels that “us scientists have to take the subject seriously and not to abuse it as a vehicle for fundamental world and population improvement.”
Fracking as an “effective bridge technology”
At the end of the interview, Hans von Storch offers some support for fracking, citing the USA’s fracking for natural gas, which he says has made a considerable contribution to “decreasing the US CO2 emissions” and calls it an effective bridge technology.
In Germany this measure is being almost unanimously rejected – obviously decreasing CO2 is ‘good’ only under certain conditions”.
In summary, more harsh criticism and even words of warning from Hans von Storch aimed at alarmist scientists and the overzealous policymakers who feel compelled to rush through a fundamental transformation of global society in a fit of panic.

Ironically, Copernicus’s publications received similar treatment in the 1600s under the Inquisition, see here Inquisition-Copernicus!

From Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt:

Subject: Shutting down Patterns Recognition in Physics
Dear Rasmussen,
A scientific article authored by 15 highly esteemed scientists did not please you as a publisher because their conclusions did not fit with the doctrine of the IPCC. And in a craven reaction, the journal was terminated. You regret that you were unable to prevent the publication. It is written in the fundamental law: “Censorship does not occur”. You have understood very little about science, and from scientific freedom of the fundamental law even much less so. The name Martin Rasmussen however now has found a special place in the history of science, directly on par with Trofim Denissovitch Lyssenko. His scientific understanding was also guided by the socio-political induced mainstream. Imagine what happens should the scientists end up being right with their criticism of the IPCC. Do you realize what you have done?”

From Nicola Scafetta
The steps taken by Copernicus’s publisher are quite clear in their statements sent to Mörner and from the official letter on their web-site.

It is clear that Copernicus publisher (Dr. Martin Rasmussen) was “alarmed” by a secondary implication of our research that questions the validity of the global surface temperature projections for the 21st century made by the IPCC.  Rasmussen appears to believe that the IPCC temperature projections cannot be questioned and are beyond doubt. Consequently, without any proof, he claims that the papers published in the journal PRP received poor scientific review and concluded that the journal had to be shut down because in his words: ‘We therefore wish to distance ourselves from the apparent misuse of the originally agreed aims & scope of PRP and decided today to cease the publication.’
His entire argument is disturbing. The very first statement is based on his misunderstanding of the current scientific research findings. In fact, every expert person in climate change knows that the climate models adopted by the IPCC have on average predicted a warming of about 2 C/century from 2000 to 2014, but the observed temperature has not shown this warming. Nature writes:
‘Climate change: The case of the missing heat. Sixteen years into the mysterious ‘global-warming hiatus’, scientists are piecing together an explanation. […] On a chart of global atmospheric temperatures, the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21 °C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04 °C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.’
Therefore it is clear that the conclusion of the special issue on PRP is perfectly in line with the current scientific knowledge. Essentially, it is the IPCC report and likely Rasmussen’s own knowledge on the topic that are outdated. In conclusion, it appears to me that Dr. Martin Rasmussen is quite confused about the current state of the scientific research. Our conclusions are perfectly in line with what numerous papers published in numerous journals already say. I invite everybody to read them. Everybody will acknowledge that the accusations of Dr. Rasmussen are baseless.
Overall, the wording used by Dr. Martin Rasmussen is quite disturbing and depicts a censorship attitude. Dr. Rasmussen labels scientists who simply highlight the limitations of the IPCC models using scientific arguments with the pejorative appellative of “climate skeptics”. This is a quite an offensive statement that displays intellectual intolerance. He then claims that people sharing such an idea cannot publish papers or serve as editors of Copernicus Journals.
He decided to shut down the journals because he claims that the scientific opinions of the editors were in error, but without providing any proof. Jo Nova wrote:
The reasons they gave had nothing to do with the data, the logic, and they cite no errors. There can be no mistake, this is about enforcing a permitted line of thought.”
Even more disturbing, he took his decision without even first consulting with the accused editors (Dr. Morner and Dr. Ouadfeul), who received the news as a surprise. A minimum courtesy and prudence would require first inquiring with the editors and awaiting their response. From his letters, it is evident that his actions resulted from emails of complaints he had received, and that he believed the accusations without even first listening to the opinion of the accused.  I find this approach by Rasmussen not only rude, but also highly unprofessional.
I think Martin Rasmussen should carefully read the climategate email here. He also would be well advised to update his scientific knowledge in climate science, to think hard about what he has done, and to reconsider his decision. Any time scientists are prevented, for no valid no reason, from presenting alternative explanations is disturbing. None of our papers have been rebutted and I invite people to read them.

"Most people would agree that living more sustainably is something to strive for. With £13bn worth of food being wasted each year in the UK and global temperature records being broken every three years, being green is more important than ever. But it’s a lot easier said than done. For the vast majority, trying to live a more sustainable lifestyle is restricted to the weekly recycling of bottles, paper, plastics and food waste. And consuming less also represents a tricky issue for governments when consuming more this year than last year drives economic growth. An enduring issue remains: what actually is “sustainability” and what does “consuming sustainably” mean in the first place? As David Harvey has pointed out, it can mean almost anything people want it to mean.  In its simplest form, though, sustainable consumption asks that people consider the impact their choices (when it comes to buying things or using energy) will have on future generations’ ability to make their choices. Sadly, the likelihood of the majority acting in this way is small. Most of their everyday consumption choices are made habitually or emotionally and not rationally. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman noted, people are prone to think fast, driven by our habits and intuitions – and not slowly or thoughtfully.  So: how can governments, NGOs – even businesses themselves – encourage people to consume in a more sustainable manner? Currently, the dominant logic is to provide people with more information so they can make more informed decisions about what they spend their money on.   While this may succeed for a minority, in this view information is assumed to be a precursor to changing people’s attitudes and – in due course – their behaviour. The problem is that there is little evidence that information provision does this at all. It’s also problematic, as people suffer from information overload. Too much information can cause confusion and, if it’s not relevant to them, people will simply ignore it. However, even people who’ve taken on board the sustainability message find difficulty in practising it. This finding emerged from data collected by one of our former PhD students Cristina Longo (now a researcher at the University of Lille’s business school). To understand the trials and tribulations of trying to live more sustainably, Longo conducted an ethnographic study and embedded herself in the local Transition Network community, a movement that promotes sustainable living.  She spent two years hanging out with people already highly knowledgeable and committed to living a sustainable lifestyle. She attended talks and meetings, and participated in guerrilla gardening, taking care of neglected public spaces, before interviewing members of the community. Our analysis of these interviews highlighted some major problems when it comes to living out sustainable values – even when you’ve got the best intentions. The paradox of sustainable consumption appears to be that the more you are aware of the issues at stake, the harder you find it to actually live out your values.  The more knowledgeable people become with regard to the myriad issues surrounding sustainability, the more this knowledge becomes a source of dilemma. For example, Tessa, a member of the Transition Network with a longstanding interest and understanding of sustainability issues, told us of her “green beans from Kenya dilemma”. For her, green beans from Kenya were definitely a no-no, because of the food miles incurred in flying the beans over. However, she found the clarity she had on this position was undermined when she learned of the social and economic benefits of growing green beans for the local Kenyan farmers. Also, for those already committed to sustainability ideals, not being able to live up to them becomes a source of considerable tension. Veronica, for example, recounted a story about a talk she’d given on reducing carbon footprints. Afterwards, she drove past a family who’d been at the meeting, who were cycling. Being confronted with not practising what she was preaching was very disconcerting for her. Irene, too, wants to eat locally sourced organic food whenever possible, but on her limited budget finds it expensive to do so. This existential tension that both Veronica and Irene experience is in large part self-inflicted. We’ve found that the more knowledgeable people become, the more it can result in paralysis or the inability to act on one’s sustainability ideals or goals. One informant Kate described a knowledge tipping point. As she accumulated more and more knowledge that she attempted to put into practice, she also experienced an awareness that her efforts would ultimately be unsustainable. Judith experienced something similar too but saw her failure – in her case to not buy anything shipped over from China – as part of an overall learning process. Clearly, being a sustainable consumer is problematic and embedding sustainable ideals into everyday life is fraught with difficulties. Until society’s obsession with growth is addressed at a much wider level, sustainable consumption remains a fantasy."
"The world is noisy.  In cities, we find ourselves constantly surrounded by the moan of motors, the screech of sirens, and the prattle of people. So much so, that we often crave the peace and quiet of the countryside.  But silence is hard to find, even in nature. Animals chirp, roar, squeak, squawk, and howl to attract mates, defend territories, locate prey or even just find their way around. Wind whistles, rain hammers and streams gurgle. The sea thunders. Even under the water’s surface, a cacophony of unknown snaps, boings, ripples and other melodies still surround you.  Together, this symphony is the natural soundscape.  Scientists can use acoustic sensors to monitor anything from an entire soundscape all the way down to a single species. Acoustic monitoring has helped us learn more about the behaviour and ecology of animals such as whales, dolphins, birds, amphibians, insects and bats.  Bats, the subject of my own research, are ideal candidates for acoustic monitoring. Famously, they use echolocation to navigate through the skies, but they also produce feeding buzzes to hunt down prey, and social calls to attract mates.  Monitoring the distinct calls bats use for navigation, prey location and socialising allows us to determine where they are and what they are using particular habitats for. Sensors are often placed outside roosts, along suspected commuting routes and in foraging locations. Currently sensors are too large to be attached to the bats themselves. Studies using acoustic sensors have furthered our knowledge of how these animals are responding to pressures such as climate change and habitat loss. The UK’s National Bat Monitoring Program – a citizen science project that has been running since 1997 – relies on volunteers across the country armed with bat detectors to carry out annual acoustic surveys.  This valuable data has revealed some promising population increases of many threatened bat species.  Zooming out from individual species, a new field of research has recently emerged called soundscape ecology. This is the study of the entire collection of sounds that are emitted from a landscape. Scientists group these sounds into those created by humans (known as anthrophony), those emitted by plants and animals (biophony), and natural but non-biological sounds like rain wind and waves (geophony). Humans often don’t consider sound as an important part of an ecosystem, but other animals are not so oblivious. For instance, the tiny larvae of reef fish use the clamour of fish and crustaceans calls from coral reefs to determine which one they should grow up on. And just as the ambient sound can tell the larvae about the health of a reef, we can also use sound as a way to monitor the status of the environment. As microphones get smaller, cheaper and better at storing data, they are becoming an ever more viable tool for a variety of conservation projects. Acoustic sensors are particularly effective in remote environments where access is limited, and have huge potential for monitoring illegal poaching. In Cameroon’s Korup National Park, where monkeys and chimpanzees are targeted for bushmeat, sensors have already been successfully used to identify target areas for anti-poaching patrols, by recording the location of gunshots and animal calls. Similarly, acoustic sensors may be valuable for monitoring illegal blast fishing in the sea, where dynamite is dropped into the water and the explosion stuns or kills everything in range. This form of fishing has a horrific impact on ocean ecosystems, decimating fragile corals. These aren’t real-time reporting systems, for now – the data must be collected and analysed to identify particular sounds. However, with the technology rapidly advancing, automatic detection systems may be possible in the not too distant future, enabling real-time reporting of illegal poaching or fishing. With biodiversity in decline globally, acoustic monitoring is a highly-effective, efficient and low-cost way to gather the data required to prevent further losses. In the future, we may have huge networks of acoustic sensors monitoring the natural world, feeding us live information. We humans are highly visual animals, but we should remember to take the time to close our eyes and open our ears to the orchestra of the natural world around us."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPIK scientist Stefan Rahmstorf at Twitter directs our attention to an interview he gave on German Public Radio.
The interview is about new models that predict the frequency of heat waves globally will double in the next seven years alone, i.e. by 2020, and quadruple again by 2040. I wrote about this yesterday here.
In the interview Rahmstorf says “the probability of experiencing extreme weather events multiplied over the last decades, simply as a consequence of global warming.” Rahmstorf then explains how models have discovered this:
Colleagues looked: Today’s climate models can well reproduce this trend of increasing heat extremes in the past. And as you have confirmed, they used these models to look into the future and have determined that these heat extremes will double by the year 2020 and then once again quadruple in frequency by the year 2050.”
Here Rahmstorf claims that if a model is able to reproduce the past, then it can reproduce the future. Just forget that any model can be made to reproduce the past and then project any future you so desire. Rahmstorf is sounding more and more like a swindler selling phony fortune-telling services with each passing interview. And above I understand from his words a frequency increase of 8 times.
German Public Radio moderator Fecke then asked what exactly makes the projections so robust? Rahmstorf:
Robust is that we use the measured data of the last 130 years and look at how well the newest generation of climate models, that is the complete range that we have from the various research groups from the whole world, can reproduce the past. And it has been determined that they can do this very well, and for this reason we are confident that the results are also robust for the future development.”
Good hindsight automatically means good foresight?

How good were the “old” models? Here’s what the IPCC told us late last year:

Not very good at all. Worse, Hans von Storch and his colleagues just assessed the performance of the climate models. Here’s the result:
…for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012 , only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend.”
That’s Epic failure.
But I guess these were just the “old models”. Rahmstorf is now talking about a “new generation” of super-tuned models, which are now more robust than ever.
But does it really matter how new or how old the models are? The only fact that matters is that temperatures haven’t risen at all in 15 years, and if that trend continues, then Rahmtorf’s much ballyhooed new generation of robust models are going to be just as wrong. Heat waves aren’t going to quadruple should temperatures remain stagnant or fall.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Rahmstorf, and the likes of him, have quit talking about the global mean temperature. Instead they are using a new yardstick for measuring global warming: the undefined vague frequency of weather events. No alarmist wants to talk about the global mean temperature anymore.

More than 100,000 people fled their homes and flights were grounded across most of Indonesia’s densely populated island of Java on Friday after a volcanic eruption sent a huge plume of ash and sand 17 km (10 miles) into the air.
The ash cloud from Thursday night’s eruption of Mount Kelud in the province of East Java moved west over the island, forcing the closure of seven airports and stranding thousands of passengers. The only major airports still operating on Java were two in the capital, Jakarta. […]

Warm Arctic causing cold winters in tropics makes no sense
Extreme cold is forecast to hit much of Asia for the next 7 days at least. This should lead us to ask if less sea ice in the Arctic is causing extreme cold all the way down to the tropics, 7000 km away, months later. Over the recent years some scientists defending the global warming hypothesis have suggested that a warm Arctic is causing the rest of the northern hemisphere to see more severe winters.

"Doris sounds like the sort of name your grandmother might have. It’s not particularly scary. But the name now has a rather different association, after “Storm Doris” tore through the UK. The Met Office, the UK’s national weather forecaster, put much of the country on “amber alert” and reported 94mph gusts along with severe rain and snow. The Met Office first warned about Doris several days earlier, while it was still travelling across the North Atlantic. The idea is that giving storms human names makes them easy to remember and talk about, meaning people are more aware and prepared when they hit – certainly more prepared than if faced by a generic “high wind forecast”. This is the second winter season in which the Met Office has run a pilot scheme to name these events. Each summer, it announces a list of names, alternating between male and female in alphabetical order, and the moment a new storm is spotted it acquires the next name on the list. Doris is the 15th storm to be named – and the fourth this season. The Met Office’s thinking is that names will better communicate dangerous, high-impact weather events to the public, and can thus streamline the warning system. Storm naming was first introduced in 1945 for Pacific typhoons and was quickly picked up by the World Meteorology Organisation and in Europe and America. It is now very common across the world. Just think of “celebrities” such as Katrina, Sandy or Yolanda – the Philippine name for the incredibly destructive Typhoon Haiyan (itself a Chinese name). The larger British storms often pick up unofficial names anyway. For instance, the 2013 “St Judes Day” storm  that travelled across southern England or the 2012 “Toon Monsoon” in Newcastle. But because these events are named after they have happened, different media outlets can confuse the issue by calling them different things – the Newcastle storm, for instance, was also dubbed “Thunder Thursday”.  By having a predetermined list that runs from Angus to Wilbert, the Met Office can name the storm before it hits, allowing a clear and more powerful warning.  While the public and media consider any severe weather event to be a storm, the term has a much more specific meaning in meteorology (winds 10 or above on the Beaufort scale – that’s 55mph, or 89kmh). This meant heavy rainstorms with little wind could slip through unnamed and unhyped, despite the risk of floods. Indeed, heavy flooding just after Christmas 2015 was incorrectly attributed to Storm Frank when it actually came from nameless rainfall – exactly the sort of confusion the names were meant to avoid in the first place. The Met Office has therefore had to relax its definition of what constitutes a “storm”. This season, all high-impact weather events are named.  The most obvious benefit is that a name generates an instant hashtag and search term: However, there are deeper effects, of which many people won’t even be conscious. Psychologists have shown that naming nonhuman agents and giving them human characteristics has a positive effect on recall and can affect behaviour as we seem to react with the same automatic behaviour to nonhumans assigned personality traits as we would to humans with the same personality traits.  It seems people really are more likely to be aware of Doris or Angus than a nameless storm warning – and indeed the Met’s own research backs this up: a recent YouGov survey has shown that storm naming has influenced behaviour with most people “taking action in some way upon hearing about a named storm”. The choice of name can also influence perception. For instance, more masculine names and harder to pronounce names are perceived as riskier. Naming is such a powerful technique that some scientists even want to adopt it for diseases and epidemics. Naming storms is fundamentally about communicating risk. Successful warning systems are based on reliable and effective partnerships between forecasters, the media and emergency planners. Storm naming has an important role to play in the communication of an event, but that is not the same as communicating what action should be taken. While the storm naming scheme has fostered cooperation between the Irish Met Éireann and the UK Met Office, continued and improved collaboration between all agencies involved in natural hazard management is needed to reduce impact further."

Hat-tip: Marc Morano at Climate Depot
That path is one of arrogance, a despise for the will of the people, leadership failure, and eventual civil strife that could shatter a nation.
I disagree with Marc Morano on one point above. This isn’t brilliant, it’s desperate and frightening.

Krauthammer: “appalling…scandalous” 
Charles Krauthammer, a doctor of psychiatry, calls Sally Jewell’s most recent comments about “climate change deniers” in her department:
…shockingly arrogant and anti-scientific. The idea that science is closed and that a science is settled, and that anybody who brings evidence and questions it, is suddenly somehow a flat-earther is appalling. … The idea of science is that you are open to contrary evidence. It’s the definition of a scientific theory. And particularly climate science, which is young and is new – it’s built on all kinds of assumptions and data which contradict each other. The idea that it is a closed issue is incredibly unscientific and arrogant. And that these bureaucrats and political hacks are decreeing this is scandalous.”

I’ve never been a fan of Obama, but he won the elections and I thought he deserved his chance to lead. But with his latest attitude, he is clearly proving himself to be unfit to be the leader of democracy and looking more and more qualified to lead Burma.

"I pointed out last weekend Scott Morrison spends a large proportion of his time doing two things: talking about how bad Labor is in the hope voters will conclude they made the correct choice in returning him to government in May, and trying to be relatable to people who don’t like politics and tune in as little as they have to. As a subset of these two objectives, Morrison speaks constantly about how stable and dependable his government is (as opposed to his political opponents, who are cast as reckless and engaged in headless chookery).  In order to nail the requisite talking point, backbenchers rise loyally, one after the other, every question time, and ask the dear leader and his cabinet colleagues to explain how calm and wise the government is. Morrison has these formulations read out each sitting day by willing automatons, who periodically inject a lilt or a Pinteresque pause into their questions, like they are at a Toastmasters session at the local Rotary club. Those of us forced to watch this pantomime daily do periodically worry this could be a plot to drive us all bonkers; to force the journalists of the Canberra press gallery to flee, screaming, from the building, leaving them to whatever they want to cook up. But in reality the government couldn’t give a stuff about us, whether we persist or whether we flee – it is speaking over our heads, to the voters. By hammering these messages, Morrison wants one thought to penetrate the great national switch-off: he wants voters to trust him. He wants voters to believe he is a man of his word, that he means what he says, and follows through on commitments. It seems an audacious strategy for a leader in an age when people are inclined to think all politicians stink, but that’s what Morrison wants. Trust. With that thought in mind, it was interesting this week to watch one small exchange in Senate estimates exposing a measurable gap between the prime minister’s rhetoric and actions. Readers will remember Morrison took some heat at the Pacific Islands Forum earlier in the year when he presented as insufficiently empathetic about the threat the climate emergency posed to the region. There were some harsh words. But at the end of the day, despite all the thundering and virtue signalling on the greatness of coal, Australia signed on to a communique that was actually pretty forward leaning on climate change. As I noted at the time, despite all the arm twisting in Tuvalu, Morrison did, in the end, sign up to a statement that committed Australia to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C, and to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020 – no small things. This 2050 strategy, the statement said, “may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050”. Navigating that harmonious landing point with Pacific leaders was, presumably, an important gesture for an Australian prime minister fond of calling his counterparts in the region “family”. But Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, during this week’s Senate estimates hearings, decided to do a little bit of due diligence about what Australia had actually signed up to at the Pacific Islands Forum, and whether we actually meant it. With foreign affairs department officials arrayed before her, Wong asked first whether or not Australia had sought any reservations or exceptions to the PIF communique (which just means did we opt out of any part of the statement). Kathy Klugman, the official responsible for Pacific strategy, said no exceptions had been sought. When it came to the PIF communique, Australia was all in. Having established that we were all in, Wong professed some curiosity that the Morrison government had signed a communique declaring that a “climate change crisis” was facing Pacific Island nations, when the Coalition rejects that language at home as alarmism. Were we on board with that bit – the climate crisis? Klugman replied that Australia had signed the declaration and “we associate ourselves with all parts of it, including that part”. Wong then asked whether the government agreed that emissions needed to be reduced to net zero by 2050 in order to achieve the goals articulated in the PIF declaration. Things then got a bit stickier. Clare Walsh, a deputy secretary of the department, joined the conversation. Walsh noted that achieving net zero emissions by 2050 was “an aspiration by some countries”. But the Australian government had not signed on to that “in terms of its domestic application”, she said. Wong then translated. So we’ve associated ourselves with that objective internationally in this communique, but would not take the requisite action domestically? Walsh ploughed on. She said the PIF declaration recognised the importance of that issue to the Pacific and recognised net zero by 2050 as a “commonly referenced target – but it isn’t one that Australia has signed up to domestically, no”. Wong then wondered why Australia had signed up to a document which said pursuing global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was “critical to the security of our Blue Pacific” when Australia’s domestic emissions reduction targets – the ones we’ve signed on to as part of the Paris agreement – were not consistent with achieving the 1.5C objective. Was the government planning to increase the level of ambition to square those circles, Wong wondered? “There is no change to the government’s policy senator,” noted the foreign minister, Marise Payne, who was at the table. Wong evidently thought she’d reached the moment to deliver the moral of the story. “So we go along to the PIF and tell them we think 1.5C is important but we are not prepared to put targets on the table that are anywhere near consistent with it – just so we are clear about what we are doing,” she said. Payne replied that Wong could “put it in those terms” but the government had been very clear it was persisting with the policies it took to the election. So, to cut a long story short, Morrison has signed a document with Pacific leaders, with the “family”, that suggests we are as one when it comes to managing the risks of climate change, yet in reality we have very different policies, goals and objectives. It pays to remember things like this when our prime minister asks you to trust him. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel, for the first time that I can recall, reports on how sea ice in Antarctica refuses to melt and has reached a new maximum record.
Antarctica’s record level sea ice is troubling those who were earlier convinced of the global warming science. Slowly, reluctantly, they are beginning to realize that something is wrong with the science. …

Spiegel writes that at the end of September NASA recorded a record maximum sea ice extent of 19.47 million square kilometers meters, the most since satellite measurements began 30 years ago.
This is an inconvenient development for global warming alarmists, who are now finding themselves scrambling for explanations.
Spiegel writes “when ice in the north and south pole are discussed, then it’s usually about melting caused by global warming. However, sea ice in the Antarctic, contrary to the Arctic, has proven to be amazingly robust.” Spiegel can hardly conceal its disbelief.
One scientist who is scrambling and who is visibly baffled is meteorologist Walt Meier, who seems irritated by the new puzzling Antarctic sea ice record – the second in 2 years. In the Spiegel report, he attempts to play it all down by claiming that the record amount is “only 3.6% over the 1981-2010 mean“. Meier adds: “This year the edge of the ice extends out only 35 kilometers further than an average year.”

Baffled scientists left to speculate
Walt Meier is on the defensive, and insists the Antarctic ice sheet is getting thinner- especially West Antarctica. Spiegel adds that scientists are baffled by the sea ice increase, writing that it’s “a riddle“.
According to Spiegel, “scientists suspect that a change in atmospheric currents may explain for the most part the increase in Antarctic sea ice over the last decade.” So now atmospheric air currents have teamed up with the oceans to eat up the heat.  Strange how whenever it melts in the Arctic, it’s a sure sign of man-made global warming. But when it freezes in the Antarctic, it’s a real mystery!
Spiegel floats another possible explanation for the mysterious Antarctic sea ice behavior: ocean currents of cool surface water refrigerating the Antarctic and gobbling up any heat down there. Another explanation, Spiegel writes, could be melt water from the ice sheet flowing through huge canals in the ice that end up cooling the sea surface temperature.
That of course is like saying the warming is cooling Antarctica (with melt water)! In climate science anything is possible. Anything goes.

"These days, we almost expect that any large-scale, big impact inner-city development will be a skyscraper, but for smaller cities in the UK these proposals can still appear as fairly extreme, and their approval contentious. Take, for example, Cardiff, where a new 42-storey, 132m high building of affordable student accommodation is due to become Wales’ new tallest building. At just under half the height of London’s Shard, the new building seems paltry when compared to the world’s skyscrapers – but developments like this are still big news for smaller cities.  This contention with skyscrapers is something that has been hashed out again and again in cities all over the world. But rather than focus on how high we are building new housing developments, or where they are situated, it is time that we looked at the big picture. The pressure to accommodate the housing demand in the UK is enormous. However, the opportunity is there to look more at holistic solutions that achieve balanced outcomes. Unlike London, cities such as Cardiff, Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham, to name a few, are not short of space; they still have capacity to accommodate the housing needed, while promoting happiness and well-being.  Building high rise residential units should be given a great deal of thought, even in those cases when the setting can accommodate them appropriately. There is sufficient scientific evidence of the negative health and social implications of dense living. Nottingham, for example, among other cities, is currently demolishing its iconic towers the Lenton flats, to give way to more positive residential alternatives. The issue of urban density has been the subject of debate and research for decades, if not centuries. Humans can adapt to their environments but they do so at a cost – and a number of studies have highlighted the links between density and stress as well as other physical and psychological disorders.  High-rise living can be isolating, separating residents from daily urban life and the activities that take place on the streets. Up to three or four storeys, however, one can still comfortably walk down to the street. From a window, one can connect visually and feel part of the public scene. For this reason, many built environment professionals believe four storeys is the maximum acceptable building height to achieve a decent level of connection, protect health and deliver the right level of density at the same time.  Although it may then seem better for our health, low urban density and detached housing in “out of town” locations have been branded as one of the largest causes of greenhouse gases emissions because of car use. Lower densities also make it harder to develop a neighbourhood feeling: they increase travelling distances and may be more detrimental to farming and species preservation due to their potential expansion into agricultural land.  Despite the perks and pitfalls to both inner-city and low urban density living, people’s preference tends towards the latter. A study conducted in the US found that some people prefer low density suburbs because freestanding houses in open wide areas enhance their self-esteem and sense of ownership, and are convenient for driving and parking. Large UK housing developers have also found that this “American Dream” model also appeals to customers who want “character; neighbourhoods that feel like places with their own attractive identity”. The major concern over increasing density is the public perception that privacy would be compromised and, although this issue can be resolved with intelligent design, traditional models remain largely the norm. Some aspects of design are essential to achieving a successful density level where people still find peace, a place where they can retreat from the stress of everyday life, a distinctive character, a sense of identity and community belonging.  But which approach should we choose – building up or moving out? There is still debate about whether humans should live in lower density settlements or if the damage caused to the environment through this approach is simply too large. Unfortunately, both ends of the spectrum – suburbia and high rise – still dominate landscapes. And while people’s preferences justify low density, the argument that higher density better delivers sustainability is often misinterpreted and misused to justify development led by land value and to secure larger economic gains.  Some recent schemes – such as Accordia in Cambridge and Trent Basin in Nottingham Waterside – demonstrate that common ground can be achieved, delivering models of medium density with compact yet green living as a compromise, to create desirable urban environments while also delivering on sustainability.  However, prototypes like these often require innovative and creative funding mechanisms to make schemes feasible and traditional residential development models are not currently sufficient to cope with all the pressures of the market and legislative frameworks. Until the planning, regulatory and financial mechanisms take the issues of environmental and social sustainability seriously, it is unlikely we will see positive changes in the design and delivery of residential schemes.  Perhaps a bigger effort is required from the built environment industry as a whole to find positive solutions to the issue of housing in UK urban areas. Skyscrapers should be more carefully considered for cities like Cardiff, where medium density developments are still viable and could provide the best of both worlds."
"It will probably come as little surprise that recent surveys have found the majority of adults in Europe think that international terrorism is the most pressing threat to the continent. Though this is valuable information about what adults think, little is known about what children and young people perceive as the greatest threats to life and democracy in Europe. The stereotypes of young people, particularly teenagers, are that they are disengaged from society, and not focused on national, let alone international, issues. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. For the last four years, our research group WISERDEducation has been surveying students at primary and secondary schools across Wales about aspects of their lives, education and perceptions of the wider world. In 2016 we asked almost 700 secondary school students (aged 13 to 18-years-old) what they considered to be “the most important problem facing Europe today”, to see whether their perceptions differed from adults’, and also whether views varied by age. The students were given nine different problems to choose from: climate change, economic instability, international terrorism, poverty, war, availability of energy, population growth, spread of nuclear weapons and infectious diseases. The chart below shows the proportion of students who selected the five most popular options. The remaining options, grouped as “other”, were chosen by very few participants, under 20% across all year groups. The chart below also excludes those who answered “don’t know”. International terrorism dominated as the greatest problem for Europe among our participants. But looking at different school year groups, a more nuanced picture emerged. Of Year 9 students (13 to 14-years-old), 44% considered terrorism to be the biggest problem, but this rate fell to 33% of Year 11 students (15 to 16-years-old). For Year 13 students (17 to 18-years-old), the percentage who thought terrorism was the biggest problem was much lower, at 20%. For the older students, terrorism was displaced by economic instability as the most significant problem facing Europe – which may reflect the fact that employment and the economy were becoming more relevant to them as they came to the end of their school careers. However, while economic instability topped the list for this cohort, no single problem dominated for the Year 13 group. Students’ concerns were clustered around a number of key issues, including terrorism, climate change and poverty. Interestingly, the older students were more likely to see climate change as the most important problem for Europe. Only 12% of Year 9 and 11% of Year 11 students noted climate change as their greatest concern, but this jumped to 18% among Year 13 students. In fact, this was only slightly lower than the 20% of Year 13 students who saw terrorism as the most significant problem. One reason that such a high proportion of students may have selected international terrorism as the most pressing issue facing Europe may have been the timing of our research. Students were surveyed in spring 2016, soon after attacks in Paris. In the month following the attacks, the children’s helpline, Childline, reported a surge in calls from young people anxious about the possibility of a similar attack in Britain. Previous research has also found that people tend to prioritise threats that are physically and temporally close to them. Terrorist attacks may also be seen as more threatening in general because they have clear perpetrators. By contrast no one group or individual can be blamed for climate change, making it seem less tangible as a threat. This is, of course, hugely problematic considering the large body of evidence that shows that climate change is already happening, and that other threats such as international terrorism may be linked to the disruption caused by global warming. In the context of research on the threats to Europe – in which international terrorism routinely tops the list of concerns – the surprising finding from our survey is that such a high proportion of Year 13 students considered climate change to be a pressing issue, more so than found in some studies of adults’ views.  A recent YouGov survey found that Britons are among the least concerned in the world about climate change, with only 12.8% selecting it as their most pressing issue. Considering that 18% of people aged 17 to 18-years-old in our 2016 survey believed it to be the most important issue facing Europe, and that the older the students were, the more likely they were to prioritise climate change, it seems that attitudes may be changing among the next generation of young adults."
"Saudi Arabia has given the go-ahead to the long-delayed sale of its state-owned oil company Aramco, in what will be the biggest stock market flotation in history. The milestone market debut could value Saudi Aramco at $1.5tn, significantly below initial expectations of up to $2tn, as it courts international investors for the first time. Despite the lower valuation, Aramco’s initial public offering will be the biggest in history, raising $40bn-$45bn, surpassing the record $25bn raised by China’s tech firm Alibaba in 2015. But in further signs of behind-the-scenes wrangling, the precise details of the offer price and amount of shares available are not expected to be released until 9 November, with full trading slated to begin around 12 December. It is understood that only a small portion of shares will be released on to the Riyadh market, likely to be in the range of 1% to 3% of the total stock. The size and scale of Saudi Aramco – even at the lower range of valuation estimates, it will be 50% bigger than the next largest stock market-traded firm in the world – are likely to require the financial liquidity only available on the globe’s biggest exchanges, such as Wall Street or London. The company supplies 13% of the world’s oil, and this year it revealed half-year profits of $46.9bn – more than the next six biggest oil companies combined.  Yasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic diversification and growth.”  Saudi Arabia is expected to use the listing to leverage its vast fossil fuel reserves to help modernise its economy and gain international acceptance despite its troubling human rights record. The flotation is hugely controversial among environmentalists and campaigners pushing to keep fossil fuels from being burned. An investigation by the Guardian revealed that the company has been responsible for 4.38% of the world’s carbon emissions since 1965, and named it as the biggest corporate polluter in the world. Green groups say the company’s IPO undermines global efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Aramco counters with data which a spokesperson said showed that it had the smallest carbon footprint of any of the oil majors per unit of output. The flotation documents detail the vast scale of Saudi Aramco. The company “lifts” 11.6m barrels of oil every day and has reserves of 227bn barrels. It costs just $2.80 for the company to lift each barrel of oil, compared with the $62 price per barrel on world markets, resulting in vast profits. It said its operating cashflow in 2018 was $121bn and it would pay out dividends worth $75bn this year. In an attempt to reassure potential investors, the Saudi government said it would forego its share of dividends in the event of an oil price collapse, effectively creating a company that guarantees dividends of $75bn a year. The documents also reveal that the drone attack on Aramco’s facilities in September cost it $28m, a sum that is so insignificant to the company’s scale that it was not material to the accounts. The float is expected to hand a $450m windfall to a string of international banks and advisers. The banks confirmed in the IPO announcement include Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank (NCB) and Riyadh-based Samba Capital have also advised on the deal. The likely valuation of $1.5tn-$1.6tn is a defeat for the aspirations of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who proposed the market listing three years ago and signalled a $2tn valuation. Since then Bin Salman has appealed to Saudi Arabia’s richest families to help support the flotation by buying up a stake in the company, and recruited a team of western banks to help support the listing. Historically Aramco – which stands for Arabian-American oil company – has had close links with US oil interests and American banks. Despite the Wall Street investment banks dominating the list of advisers, the flotation has mostly been handled by teams from the London offices. At Riyadh’s King Khalid airport, it is British Airways flights to and from London Heathrow that are said to be busiest with bankers.  • This article was amended on 5 November 2019. Saudi Aramco has reserves of 227bn barrels of oil, not 227m."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA miracle may be taking place in Germany! A wave of sanity actually seems to rolling across the land!
Yesterday I wrote how ZDF German television had produced a blistering parody of the country’s renewable energy project – dubbed the Energiewende. Well it seems that message may be even getting through to the country’s top politicians after all. It may be sinking in, really!
At Facebook Germany’s Sigmar Gabriel, Chairman of the socialist SPD Party and Vice Chancellor of Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU-SPD grand coalition government, issued a statement at Facebook announcing that Europe’s industrial competitiveness is indeed in jeopardy because of Germany’s and Europe’s sky high energy prices.
At Facebook he writes (original text above, right):
Germany and all of Europe are facing a huge challenge. The price of electricity in Germany is twice as high as it is in the USA. If we fail to at least provide some relief to our industry, then we are threatened with deindustrialization. This isn’t just crude propaganda from business, but rather it is bitter reality. Indeed here in Europe we have to think about how to reduce the state-induced burdens. I know how difficult this is.

However what a few years ago were high wage and social costs are today the rising energy and raw materials costs. They threaten the competitiveness of the German and European industry. And if we don’t maintain this basis for our economy, then we will neither be able to keep renewable energies nor our social and cultural standard in our country.”
This is a stunningly direct and sober statement for a politician of Gabriel’s caliber. Vice Chancellor Gabriel also serves as the economics minster in Angela Merkel’s government. His latest statement signals that the emergency brakes are about to be pulled on renewable energies. They are simply no longer affordable and are putting the country’s economic backbone at risk.
As economics minister, we suspect he has been getting an earful from industry bosses and from Hannelore Kraft, the SPD minister president of Germany’s heavily populated industrial heartland, North Rhine Westphalia.
This is an impressive turnaround for a person who in 2007, as the country’s environment minister, was so impressed by Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth that his Ministry snapped up 6000 copies and had them distributed to the nation’s upper secondary schools so that Gore’s shockumentary would be viewed by the nation’s future academics.
My how things can change.
