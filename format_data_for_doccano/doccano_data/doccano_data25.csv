By Rudolf Kipp, Science Skeptical
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
“Payments for renewable energy will cost each household on average about 1 euro per month – that’s as much as one scoop of ice cream.”  That’s what Jürgen Trittin, former Federal Environment Minister, Green Party, said in July 2004 when Germany’s EEG renewable energy Feed-In Act) was enacted.
“Now it costs as much as every item on the entire ice cream menu,” said Peter Altmaier, current Federal Minister of Environment, September 2013 at the 8th German Energy Congress “Energy Economy in Transition”.
German feed-in rates skyrocketing
Recently a press release from power grid operators 50Hertz, Amprion, TenneT and TransnetBW (link) was issued. Here is what it announced:
(…) The EEG feed-in levy is to be paid for each kilowatt-hour consumed by all end-consumers. That means that the consumers will have to pay 6.240 cents per kilowatt hour in order to support renewable energies. Thus the costs for the EEG feed-in will increase almost 20 percent compared to a year earlier (5.277 cents per kilowatt-hour).
For the year 2014 another considerable increase in the generation of renewable electrical energy is projected. The increase of approximately 15 terawatt-hours(from about 135 TWh in 2013 to almost 150 TWh in 2014) is mainly from onshore wind, offshore wind, and photovoltaic.
The following chart depicts the cost development for consumers from the EEG feed-in tariff, from 2003 to 2014, (eeg-kwk.net):

So much for renewable energies staying affordable, as politicians promised us just some years ago.
What follows are more famous quotes from politicians and hustlers, all telling the consumers how renewable energy would stay cheap and affordable for every German. You be the judge on whether or not they were truthful.
2004 Greenpeace:
….The costs to be paid by consumers for the Feed-In Act (EEG fees)) will remain practically constant compared to the current level.”
2005 German Environment Ministry:
The increase in the EEG feed-in tariffs will reduce in the future and will not cost more than 3 euros a month, even with a very dynamic expansion. The feed-in rates will then start to go down by the middle of the next decade.”
In 2005 the EEG feed-In fees were only 0.68 cent/kwh. This year Germans are paying more than 250 euros per year.
2006 Engineering Office for new energies:
As a whole the current EEG feed-in cost of approximately 0.54 cents/kwh will increase to a maximum of 0.93 cents/kwh by 2017.”
Already in 2006 the EEG feed-in tariff was 0.88 cents/kwh. In 2014 it will 6.24 cents/kwh, i.e. 7 times higher!

2007 Solarportal 24:
Already today consumers are saving significantly more than they are paying for the EEG feed-in act. The huge supply of energy from wind, water, sun, bioenergy, and geothermal is leading to a dampening effect on the price of electricity, this according to the Federal Association of Renewable Energies, BEE.”
German Environment Ministry:
Because of the EEG feed-in act, the feed-in cost for electricity will rise a bit. According to the law that applies, it will increase to a maximum of about 1.4 cents/kwh by the year 2015, after which it will again drop.“
In 2013 the EEG fee will rise to a whopping 6.24 cents/kwh, and there is no end in sight for the spiraling costs.
2009 Federal Association of Renewable Energies:
The EEG feed-in will reach its maximum of approx. 1.4 cents/kwh by 2013/2014.”
Today we know that figure will rise to 6.24 cents/kwh next year with no slowdown in sight.
2010 German Ministry of Environment:
The EEG feed-in cost for 2011 according to a current study of the German Ministry of Environment (BMU) will be about 2.8 cents. The study looks at the ‘long-term scenarios and strategies for the expansion of renewable energies in Germany while taking the development in Europe and the globe into account’, and also sees no exploding EEG feed-in costs for the coming years.”
Reality: costs have exploded.
2011
Angela Merkel on September 6 in a government address:
The EEG feed-in costs must not rise more than today’s levels; today it is at about 3.5 cents/kwh. Over the long-term we want to significantly lower the payment for electricity coming from renewable energies.”
2012 
Eicke R. Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems:
The expansion of renewable energies will lead to very little price increases for the consumers.
(…) After 2020, however, we expect renewable energies to become an important share and will stabilize the prices, and thus we will experience a dampening in electricity prices.”
The EEG feed-in cost will surge to 6.24 cents/kwh next year. There are no signs of a price slowdown.
2013
Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier:
We are not paying for the transformation over to renewable energies from petty cash.”

Perhaps you’ll recall how about a year ago a draft version of the recently appearing IPCC AR5 found its way to the public’s attention. That draft report contained an important chart that clearly illustrated the failure of all climate prognoses over the last 15 years. The actually observed temperatures of the last years were clearly below the models’ projected range, see Figure 1:

Figure 1: Chart from the Second Order Draft of the IPCC climate report (Figure 1.4. Yellow arrows show digitization of cited Figure 10.26 of AR4). 
So it’s no wonder that this chart never saw the light of day in the final version of the IPCC final report. At his blog Climate Audit Steve McIntyre took a close look and researched why the substitute chart used in the final version (Figure 2) looks so different.

His summary conclusion: Without any plausible explanation, the colored forecast ranges were shifted and the chart was set up to be confusing. Moreover, what’s worse, the new version was never subjected to professional review or quality control, and was slipped in at the last minute as a replacement chart. This is a very dubious illusory trick for which the involved parties will have to answer to in the coming years when the historical-scientific examination of the climate-alarmism era takes place.

Figure 2: In the end, this chart was used in the final version.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI watched the following  Greenpeace video clip of Camila Speziale, the youngest of the 30 Greenpeace activists. I really wonder if Greenpeace is getting the message at all.

I found it peculiar that at the end of the video Greenpeace added the text (my emphasis): “Camila is one of the 30 activists taken captive when Russian authorities stormed the Arctic Sunrise on September 19.”

When Greenpeace illegally trespasses onto a facility and rams the boats of authorities, they insist it’s “peaceful protest”. But when Russian authorities arrest activists for breaking the law, Greenpeace describes the Russian authorities as “taking captives”…like hostage takers holding people illegally. A rather hostile and confrontational choice of words by Greenpeace lawyers, I’d say.
Greenpeace seems to be confused about who the accused criminals are and who the law-enforcement authorities are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of best-selling climate science skeptic book Die kalte Sonne (German) and The Neglected Sun (English) writes an opinion piece at the site of the German Employers Association here.
His conclusion: Germany’s energy-feed-in act is a failure. What follows are some excerpts:
On the costs, Vahrenholt writes:
…wind, solar and bioenergy sources are considerably more expensive than conventional energy sources.  Currently in Germany €24 billion a year are paid because of the feed-in act. Federal Environment Minister Gabriel knows that unbraked expansion will lead to a cost avalanche of 1000 billion euros. […] The average family of three are forced to pay 250 € a year [currently]. “
On the practicality of installing so much solar capacity in a country with barely any sunshine…
Why on earth are we stalling 52,000 MW of solar energy capacity in the next years in a country that sees as much sunshine as Alaska?”
And
Wind and solar energy do not deliver a stable supply. Wind turbines produce only as much energy in a year as they would if they ran at full capacity for 1800 hours. PV systems only 800 hours. A year, however, has 8760 hours.”
What does that mean for industry? Vahrenholt writes:

The electricity costs for industry today are already 26% higher than the EU average. Compared to the USA, the difference is already 150%.  The creeping process of deindustrialization has begun.”
No CO2 reductions. Vahrenholt also writes that no CO2 is going to be saved by German green energy:
With every newly built wind turbine and every new solar roof, not a single gram of CO2 is going to be avoided. That is because of the fact that in Europe the emission of CO2 is determined by emissions trading.”
On CO2 climate sensitivity:
The scientific findings that the climate impact by CO2 is wildly exaggerated are accumulating. There has not been any significant global warming in 16 years even though one third of the historical emissions took place in the period and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has climbed year after year. The climate models, all whose prognoses have turned out to be wrong, are not able to compute the natural fluctuations of the climate. […]
Yes CO2 is a gas that has an impact on climate, but it will not cause the global mean temperature of the earth to rise more than 1 to 1.5°C  by the year 2100.”
Obsolete model. Will other countries follow Germany’s once highly ballyhooed lead?
No nation on earth is going to follow us when they see that Germany’s own industrial basis is being destroyed and citizens are being financially overwhelmed. […]
The renewable energy act in it’s current form is simply supporting the old power plants of the last decades and is not leading to any CO2 reduction and is eroding the industrial base of Germany. It is not an export hit. Rather it is an obsolete model whose consequences can hardly be managed any longer.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterBritish politician, Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Energy, interviewed yesterday with the online Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger based in Zurich. He provides his views on climate change and energy policy.
Photo right: Nigel Lawson, public domain photo
A number of leading Swiss publications have recently expressed doubts over the claims made by the IPCC and its scientists. The Tagesanzeiger interview is just the latest.
First Lawson calls the IPCC’s admission that the global temperature hasn’t risen in 15 years “notable” and that it shows the climate models are “inadequate”. “The empirical findings contradict the claims about the future being made by the IPCC. That’s not the way to do science.”
(Note: All quotes are translated from the German).
Lawson does not dispute that CO2 has a warming impact on climate, but that the real question is: how much? “On this there are many different opinions“. Lawson believes that the IPCC agenda is mostly in the hands of alarmists who believe CO2 is mostly driving the climate. But Lawson says there has to be other factors. “Without a doubt, the most important one is solar activity.”
IPCC presents excuses and speculation
Lawson calls the assumption that the oceans have soaked up the heat “pure speculation, an excuse from alarmists who are searching for a reason to explain why they erred”. He says that there are no measurements from the deep sea to support this, and also dismisses the notion that CO2 may have caused the Gulf Stream to change, calling it “nonsense”.
On Svensmark’s cosmic ray theory, Lawson says that CERN has neither been able to confirm nor refute the theory, and that the theory remains interesting.
When asked about global warming causing more storms, Lawson is emphatic, saying this is not the case and points to greedy insurance companies.
It is completely false. The number and strength of tropical storms over the last decades has not increased, even if the insurance companies always claim to the contrary in order to justify their increasing premiums.”
On sea level rise, Lawson sees no data showing sea level rise is going to speed up and warns that this is fraught with uncertainty as it is a very complex phenomena involving the movement of land masses. (Story continues below)
====================================
The article first appeared in the print edition of the Basler Zeitung:

Introduction starts on page 1 with full story on page 2. 
====================================
Fossil fuels the most efficient
In the interview, it is also clear to Lawson that global warming does not entail only disadvantages, but also brings a number of advantages. He cites the fertilization effects on plant growth from higher Co2. He also points to mankind’s ability to adapt to changing climate conditions as being far better today than ever.
On the question of whether the world should wean itself off fossil fuels:
Countries like China and India should not do so under any circumstances because it would put their economic development in jeopardy. Fossil fuels are and will remain the most efficient.”
He adds that he thinks it’s possible that Europe will go it alone on renewable energy, and claims that its “competitiveness would suffer enormously. … Except for Europe, no one on the planet believes in the end of fossil fuels. Higher energy prices would by horrible, especially for the poor!”
No consensus
The Tagesanzeiger then asks why he thinks he knows better than the IPCC scientists. Here Lawson delivers a lethal blow to the notion of “consensus”, reminding the Tagesanzeiger that many scientists agree with his position, among them Freeman Dyson. He also reminds the Tagesanzeiger that many of the climate scientists are not from the field of climate, but from other fields. Lawson was also former energy minister, and so he thinks he understands energy far better than David Cameron or Al Gore. He accuses David Cameron of populism with the climate change issue and that Cameron fancies himself as a sort of planet rescuer. Lawson reminds us that also Margaret Thatcher also had emphatically rejected the alarmist theories.
On why climate alarmism and the calls to abolish CO2 are today still very much in vogue, Lawson concludes:
After the failure of communism, new arguments were needed in order to be able to discredit the market economy. Also the belief in man-made climate change to some extent involves religious tendencies.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsing the old, worn out statistical trick of carefully selecting the start and end points of a data series, a blog site, run by a snidey Heidi Cullen, attempts to have readers believe that US winters are getting warmer. Steve Goddard explains how in just a few sentences.

Heidi’s blog site uses a cheap trick to pull warming out of her hat. Image cropped from Twitter
This is transparent even to a junior high school science student.
Cooking the weather data and weather witch-hunting: This is the level of bankruptcy that alarmist climate science has devolved to. Can it get any sadder?
An average household in northern USA only needs to look at the heating bills for the last 10 years to see that Heidi’s claim is nothing more than a big snow job.
1974: Odds of warming “at best 1 in 10,000”!
Moreover, everyone knows the USA has been keeping weather data more than 100 years, and so it’s a mystery why Ms Cullen would go back to 1972, a time that happens to be right smack in the middle of a cold phase – a time when the media and scientists were biting their nails over a coming ice age.
In fact “leading” climate scientists in 1974 were putting the odds of future warming: “at best 1 in 10,000”!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a lot going on today as the IPCC continues to clash violently with climate reality.
We’ve always suspected that governments had contracted out the results to begin with. In the beginning, the scientists played along. After all the observations nicely followed the model projections for almost 2 decades. But the wanted results are no longer possible to deliver and the observations have long since diverged from the model projections. Now bitter disputes are breaking out between client and provider as a result.
Today Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here reports:
Dispute with scientists […] Against the will of many scientists, especially delegates of the German government want to keep the pause in global warming of the last 15 years out of the IPCC Report’s summary.”
Hat tip: Ike.
Obviously “many scientists” are starting to have serious second thoughts and are getting queasy about assuming the role of science prostitute, assigned by sleazy pimping governments. This is understandable for any self-respecting scientist. After all, who is ready to go down in history as purchased whore, crackpot scientist?
Bureaucrats schooling experts on what the results are

Picture this: What we have are German politicians from the Ministry of Environment, who have little science background, literally schooling the expert scientists on what the results should be and which ones are important. What’s now happening in Stockholm is the brazen politicization and corruption of science. The picture speaks for itself. That’s why I write using the crude analogies of pimps and (potential) whores.
SPIEGEL writes:
Leading scientists are contradicting the political delegates. Jochem Marotzke, President of the German Climate Consortium and the leading scientific representative at the negotiations in Stockholm promises: ‘We are going to confront this issue head on.’ The UN IPCC has to accept a discussion about the temperature stop.”
New SPIEGEL survey: only 39% fear global warming!
The SPIEGEL report in general conveys a growing sense of desperation among German delegates. The flagship news magazine writes of waning public concern when it comes to climate change, writing of a “dramatic change in public opinion” shown by a new survey commissioned by SPIEGEL:
Germans no longer have any fear of the impacts of climate change. While in 2006 a clear majority of Germans (62 percent) feared global warming, now it’s only a minority of 39 percent.”

From Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt:

Subject: Shutting down Patterns Recognition in Physics
Dear Rasmussen,
A scientific article authored by 15 highly esteemed scientists did not please you as a publisher because their conclusions did not fit with the doctrine of the IPCC. And in a craven reaction, the journal was terminated. You regret that you were unable to prevent the publication. It is written in the fundamental law: “Censorship does not occur”. You have understood very little about science, and from scientific freedom of the fundamental law even much less so. The name Martin Rasmussen however now has found a special place in the history of science, directly on par with Trofim Denissovitch Lyssenko. His scientific understanding was also guided by the socio-political induced mainstream. Imagine what happens should the scientists end up being right with their criticism of the IPCC. Do you realize what you have done?”

From Nicola Scafetta
The steps taken by Copernicus’s publisher are quite clear in their statements sent to Mörner and from the official letter on their web-site.

It is clear that Copernicus publisher (Dr. Martin Rasmussen) was “alarmed” by a secondary implication of our research that questions the validity of the global surface temperature projections for the 21st century made by the IPCC.  Rasmussen appears to believe that the IPCC temperature projections cannot be questioned and are beyond doubt. Consequently, without any proof, he claims that the papers published in the journal PRP received poor scientific review and concluded that the journal had to be shut down because in his words: ‘We therefore wish to distance ourselves from the apparent misuse of the originally agreed aims & scope of PRP and decided today to cease the publication.’
His entire argument is disturbing. The very first statement is based on his misunderstanding of the current scientific research findings. In fact, every expert person in climate change knows that the climate models adopted by the IPCC have on average predicted a warming of about 2 C/century from 2000 to 2014, but the observed temperature has not shown this warming. Nature writes:
‘Climate change: The case of the missing heat. Sixteen years into the mysterious ‘global-warming hiatus’, scientists are piecing together an explanation. […] On a chart of global atmospheric temperatures, the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21 °C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04 °C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.’
Therefore it is clear that the conclusion of the special issue on PRP is perfectly in line with the current scientific knowledge. Essentially, it is the IPCC report and likely Rasmussen’s own knowledge on the topic that are outdated. In conclusion, it appears to me that Dr. Martin Rasmussen is quite confused about the current state of the scientific research. Our conclusions are perfectly in line with what numerous papers published in numerous journals already say. I invite everybody to read them. Everybody will acknowledge that the accusations of Dr. Rasmussen are baseless.
Overall, the wording used by Dr. Martin Rasmussen is quite disturbing and depicts a censorship attitude. Dr. Rasmussen labels scientists who simply highlight the limitations of the IPCC models using scientific arguments with the pejorative appellative of “climate skeptics”. This is a quite an offensive statement that displays intellectual intolerance. He then claims that people sharing such an idea cannot publish papers or serve as editors of Copernicus Journals.
He decided to shut down the journals because he claims that the scientific opinions of the editors were in error, but without providing any proof. Jo Nova wrote:
The reasons they gave had nothing to do with the data, the logic, and they cite no errors. There can be no mistake, this is about enforcing a permitted line of thought.”
Even more disturbing, he took his decision without even first consulting with the accused editors (Dr. Morner and Dr. Ouadfeul), who received the news as a surprise. A minimum courtesy and prudence would require first inquiring with the editors and awaiting their response. From his letters, it is evident that his actions resulted from emails of complaints he had received, and that he believed the accusations without even first listening to the opinion of the accused.  I find this approach by Rasmussen not only rude, but also highly unprofessional.
I think Martin Rasmussen should carefully read the climategate email here. He also would be well advised to update his scientific knowledge in climate science, to think hard about what he has done, and to reconsider his decision. Any time scientists are prevented, for no valid no reason, from presenting alternative explanations is disturbing. None of our papers have been rebutted and I invite people to read them.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNews of the NOAA’s miserable, failed 2013 hurricane prediction performance has spread to Europe.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site took a look at the results. They compare the official NOAA prognoses from
May 23, 2013:
NOAA predicts active 2013 Atlantic hurricane season – Era of high activity for Atlantic hurricanes continues 
For the six-month hurricane season, which begins June 1, NOAA’s Atlantic Hurricane Season Outlook says there is a 70 percent likelihood of 13 to 20 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 7 to 11 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3 to 6 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; winds of 111 mph or higher).”
to the NOAA press release from November 25 November 2013:

NOAA: Slow Atlantic hurricane season coming to a close: No major hurricanes formed in the Atlantic basin – first time since 1994 
The 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Saturday, Nov. 30, had the fewest number of hurricanes since 1982, thanks in large part to persistent, unfavorable atmospheric conditions over the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and tropical Atlantic Ocean. This year is expected to rank as the sixth-least-active Atlantic hurricane season since 1950, in terms of the collective strength and duration of named storms and hurricanes. […] Thirteen named storms formed in the Atlantic basin this year. Two, Ingrid and Humberto, became hurricanes, but neither became major hurricanes. Although the number of named storms was above the average of 12, the numbers of hurricanes and major hurricanes were well below their averages of six and three, respectively. Major hurricanes are categories 3 and above.”
Scientists Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s conclusion:
This year’s failed prognoses show just how difficult forecasts still can be. In regards to these prognoses, forecasts for an entire century into the future are even more questionable. While annual forecasts at least can be checked and compared to the actual development, this is certainly not possible for prognoses up to the year 2100. The followers of the climate catastrophe theory gleefully exploit this. Activists scientists such as Stefan Rahmstorf or Mojib Latif would be well-advised to be more careful with their argumentation and to be more clear about the huge uncertainties.”
Please note that Lüning and Vahrenholt are not being overly critical of the NOAA, but simply just want to point out that climate scientists shouldn’t be so cocky about their predictions – especially those dealing with the future, let alone 100 years out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowki comments here on the recently published paper by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way, which suggests the Arctic has warmed more than first thought and that the so-called warming pause resulted from missing data.

Spiegel warns that eerily similar studies have been seen before, e.g. Steig et al, Mann et al.
Bojanowski reminds readers that “the calculation method is in dispute” and writes that reaction from the scientific community has been split, with the warmists uncritically welcoming it with glee, and skeptics being suspicious of the study’s methodology, “underscoring the weaknesses of the new analysis“. The overall tone of Bojanowski’s article is one of skepticism, reminding readers that such studies from “newcomer scientists” have been seen before.
Bojanowski explains how the study’s authors filled in the regions of missing temperature data in the Arctic, and that other scientists are skeptical of the method used, citing Judith Curry’s blog commentary. Spiegel writes:
Among other factors, Curry points out that measurement stations in the Arctic are primarily land-based, but that the now calculated region of the Arctic data void is covered mostly by sea ice and or water.”

The Spiegel science author then warns readers that we’ve seen this kind of statistical work in other studies and that there’s a “feeling of foreboding” surrounding the overall results. He writes:
Caution is advised – as other studies from the other side of the planet have shown. Since 2007 several prominently published calculations have shown that Antarctica as a whole would warm- much to the surprise of many experts because the southern continent is considered a climatological single, isolated case. The latest UN climate report determined there is minimal confidence in the concerned temperature calculations.”
Bojanowski writes that the study is “somewhat particular” because both authors are newcomers: “Cowtan researches in crystallography, Way is a student in geography; both also write for an internet site that would like to run down climate skeptics. The constellation does bring a feeling of foreboding.”
Bojanowski then reminds readers of another similar case: citing Michael Mann and his hockey stick chart, which was debunked by “outsiders” Ross McKitrick and Steve McIntyre. He also links to the Steig’s paper.
The difference, Bojanowski writes, is that Cowtan and Way are “open for a lively discussion” and that both don’t claim that their study is the final truth.

And so applying global warming theory, which claims that CO2 is the dominant climate driver and that coal is the big source, you’d think that global mean temperatures would be skyrocketing upwards by now. But here’s a chart that tells us the reality of the time period referred to by Urgewald:
GLOBAL TEMPERATURE COMPARED TO GLOBAL COAL EMISSIONS

Global temperature (green) compared to global coal consumption (black). While coal consumption has soared 70% since 2000, global temperatures have eased since 2002.
What does that tell us about coal’s impact on the climate?
In fact by almost every measure, global living conditions for humanity have improved worldwide, this is in large part thanks to the affordable energy delivered by that 70% increase in coal. Coal has lifted millions of people worldwide out of grinding poverty and horrible lives without electric power.
The Urgewald paper is just the latest lapse into a fit of doom and gloom. There’s no denying the temperature reality of the last 15 years: no rise!
You’re more than welcome to read the 53-page report, but it’ll probably cause you to suffer a spell of Doomer Depression.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow we know what this is really all about: scaring the public into “rigorous climate policies”.
In my last post I mentioned that the English language Spiegel here has a comprehensive piece on the IPCC’s ideological struggle on whether or not to include the 15-year warming hiatus in the AR5 Summary Report.
Spiegel quotes Mike Hulme who says that the German delegation is “certainly more in the direction of ‘alarmist’” and thus are insisting that the warming hiatus not be mentioned. Why not? Spiegel tells us why (my emphasis):
German Green Party politician Hermann Ott, on the other hand, is satisfied with Germany’s conduct in the negotiations. Since Helmut Kohl’s government, Ott says, there has generally been consensus on the significance of climate protection, making it possible for “a great deal of continuity and a high level of expertise” to develop within Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment.
Despite resistance from many researchers, the German ministries insist that it is important not to detract from the effectiveness of climate change warnings by discussing the past 15 years’ lack of global warming. Doing so, they say, would result in a loss of the support necessary for pursuing rigorous climate policies. “Climate policy needs the element of fear,” Ott openly admits. “Otherwise, no politician would take on this topic.”
Unbelievable. Ott is saying that the German government and its Ministry of Environment, where his good friend Jochen Flasbarth is a director, needs a report that scares the public! We appreciate the honesty.
Also, someone needs to remind Hermann Ott that there hasn’t been any warming since Helmut Kohl’s government ended in 1998 – completely contradicting the models. In fact, there hasn’t been much warming since the IPCC’s second report from 1995!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA Christmas message for alarmists
By Ed Caryl
I am constantly struck by the extremes that the alarmists will reach attempting to convince the rest of us that we should abandon our comfortable life-styles and live in fuel poverty, burning our corn in our cars, eschewing all use of fuels that have accumulated in the ground over the eons, reaching into the winds to catch a few watts from the occasional breezes at the cost of beating to death random vistas, bats and birds, and paving our deserts and rooftops with silicon to capture a few hours of sun on the off chance it shines.
These efforts are awfully inefficient, and incredibly costly for the achieved results. Especially when the achieved result is exactly nothing. Of course, the money spent, and made by your friends, is always someone else’s, so that doesn’t count.
All this is done in supposed fear that adding a few parts per million to the carbon dioxide already in the air will somehow, in some yet to be explained way, turn our planet into another Venus. Never mind the fact that at several points in our planets history, including in the beginning, carbon dioxide was many times more prevalent than it is today, and no disaster happened, as we know because we are here. We know that carbon dioxide was a major part of the early atmosphere because of the mountains of carbonate rocks all around us, and the deep layers of carbonate rocks beneath us in vast areas of the world. Life uses CO2. Life uses it up.
Why the continuous negativity? Rejoice! Abundance surrounds us! More CO2 in the atmosphere fertilizes our crops, as those crops labor to use it up. On a warm, windless afternoon in a cornfield, photosynthesis slows because all the available CO2 gets consumed. If there is more of it in the beginning, this doesn’t happen. In a closed greenhouse, CO2 must be added to the air or growth slows as it is used up. If extra CO2 is added, growth is faster than in an open field, a lot faster. Defining CO2 as a pollutant is the worst kind of lie.
Does CO2 make it warmer? The first 200 parts per million does, but so does water vapor, and this is a water world, not a CO2 world. We really don’t have much CO2 in the atmosphere. By geological-historical standards, the atmosphere right now is in fact close to record lows. During ice ages, the amount of CO2 drops to the point that grasses outcompete trees in the tropics, and rain forests dwindle to remnant islands in vast savannas. This happens when the concentration drops below 250 parts per million as the cooling oceans take it up. Life likes more CO2. Life returns in abundance as the oceans warm and release the CO2 they took up when it was cold. If there is more CO2, plants can close the vents that let it in (stomata) and can conserve moisture, letting less water out. Life isn’t poisoned by CO2 until the concentration reaches the point where oxygen can’t be traded for it. This doesn’t happen until the CO2 concentration is 25 times what it is now. No, CO2 is not a pollutant.
Will more CO2 make it warmer? When it is from fuel used to heat our houses and cook our food, yes, but inside our houses. Outside? No one knows how much. Really! No one truly knows. Yet billions, verily, trillions of dollars and euros, will be wasted on the fear that extra CO2 will make it hotter outside in some catastrophic way. As I sit here writing this, with a fire in the fireplace, looking at the snow in the back yard, watching a squirrel feasting on sunflower seeds, I don’t think the squirrel knows either, and doesn’t care. In the Pleistocene and Holocene, man worried about staying warm. He should continue that practice in the Anthropocene.
Stay warm. Have a great Christmas and a Happy New Year. And stop worrying about an insignificant trace gas in our atmosphere!

By now, well informed people are aware that there has been no warming for the last 16 or so years. Why should this be if CO2 has increased by 8% in that time? We are told by 97% of climate researchers, that CO2 doubling must warm us by 2 to 4.5 degrees C, so that 8% increase should have resulted in something like 0.2 to 0.3° C warming in the last two decades. Despite the best efforts of the data manipulators, that hasn’t happened. What is going on?
It has not occurred to many researchers that climate sensitivity to CO2 is not a constant. As Willis Eschenbach has pointed out in several articles, here, here, here, and most importantly, here, climate sensitivity is variable over short times, long times, and areas. It varies by time of day, being high in the morning when the sun is warming the atmosphere at the highest rate, and lower in the afternoon when rising air results in cumulus clouds and thunderstorms. It varies by latitude, being low or even negative in the tropics, where there are more thunderstorms, and higher at mid-latitudes. It is generally higher over land than over oceans, though there are extremely negative local spots over some tropical rain forests.

Figure 1 from Willis Eschenbach here.
Climate sensitivity also seems to be variable over long time scales. We know that both CO2 and water vapor are involved in the process, and we know that the effect of both is logarithmic. For CO2, as it increases in the atmosphere, the effect becomes less and less. Most of the greenhouse effect takes place at concentrations less than 200 ppm.
We also know that atmospheric humidity has been decreasing as CO2 is increasing, offsetting CO2 warming with water vapor cooling.

Figure 2: CO2 and humidity over time (600 mbar altitude).
If we let MODTRAN calculate the resulting outbound long wave radiation (OLR) we see why we had cooling in the 60’s and 70’s and warming in the 80’s and 90’s. We also see the leveling in the last decade.

Figure 3: Computed OLR inverted so that warming is upward and cooling downward.
This decrease in humidity has more than offset the increase in CO2 and has decreased the climate sensitivity due to CO2 over time. This is also seen in computations of climate sensitivity versus temperature.

Figure 4: Computation of climate sensitivity from CO2 change and temperature change over 60-year time intervals to bridge AMO/PDO cycles.
Figure 4 shows that climate sensitivity has dropped from the 3 to 4°C per CO2 doubling range in the mid-20th century to below 2°C in the 1980’s, and to the 1.6 to 1.7°C range seen today. This explains the range and decreasing values seen in recent attempts to measure climate sensitivity. Water vapor is the thermostat, not CO2.

Henrik Svensmark wrote the book on cosmic rays, their possible effect on clouds, and thus effect on climate, as well as numerous papers on the subject. The CERN CLOUD experiment has looked for proof of the mechanism. A recent paper by Spencer and Braswell has looked at the relationship between clouds and temperature and found a nine month lag between a gap in cloudiness and El Niño temperature rises. Another pair of papers (Dragić et al) here and here, look at diurnal temperature variations within a few days of Forbush decreases. If cosmic ray variations result in cloud variation, which then result in temperature variation, then it is reasonable to examine the relationship between cosmic rays as seen in the surface neutron flux, and temperature.
Neutron flux data was downloaded from the Oulu University Cosmic Ray Station web site. This data is available back to 1964 in several file resolutions. Here is a plot with monthly resolution compared to the HADSST3 sea-surface temperature data set.


Figure 1 is the Oulu Neutron count plotted with HASSST3. The Neutron count has been inverted so that warming is upward in both plots. Each solar cycle has been plotted in a different color and the R-squared values computed for each cycle.
The first observation is that for the first 22 years, there is a relationship between neutron flux and sea-surface temperature. But after about 1986 that relationship breaks down.
The monthly data plot in Figure 1 does not resolve Forbush decreases because they generally last but a few days. Figure 2 is a daily data plot with the Forbush decreases highlighted. Again, the plot is inverted to indicate warming in the upward direction.

Figure 2 is a plot of daily neutron count data with the Forbush Decreases highlighted in red and green. The vertical scale is inverted. 
Twenty three Forbush decreases were found and daily data plotted together in Figure 3 with the peak of the decrease at the day zero. Neutron count data 30 days prior and 140 days after the Forbush decrease were plotted. The legend records the date at the beginning of each plot.

Figure 3 is a plot of 23 Forbush decreases recorded at Oulu since 1964.

Figure 4 is the average for all 23 Forbush Decreases. The vertical scale is NOT inverted in figures 3 and 4.
On average a Forbush decrease is about 14 days wide at the 10% point and 5 to 7 days wide at the 50% point. The average decrease in neutron flux is about 10%, but this can range widely from under 5% to over 20%.
The temperature data available on the web is generally available only as monthly or annual data. Temperature data was averaged for events in each solar cycle from two months prior to at least a year after each event. Forbush events occur randomly, and not at convenient month ends, so the nearest months to each event were plotted. This blurs the resolution somewhat. El Niño 3.4, GISSLOTI, and HADSST3 data were compared. The El Niño data is from NCAR. The GISSLOTI and HADSST3 monthly data from woodfortrees.

Figure 5 is a plot of the average temperature effects for Forbush events from 1964 to 1976, 1977 to 1986, 1987 to 1996, and 1997 to the present.
The temperature changes seen here are quite large, more than half a degree, but the averaged signal is quite noisy because there are so few events. The first period (Solar Cycle 20) shows a warming peak at four months, but the second period (Cycle 21) has the warming delayed until the seventh month and later. The last two periods show little pattern.
If the total period is split into just two portions, pre and post 1987, we get Figure 6.

Figure 6 is the temperature effect on the El Niño 3.4 area of Forbush events pre and post 1987.
Before 1987, a Forbush Event resulted in an ocean surface temperature rise in the El Niño 3.4 region of about a quarter of a degree on average, 4 to 7 months after the event, but only in the pre 1987 data.

Figure 7 is the temperature effect on GISTemp Land-Ocean Temperature Index Anomaly, pre and post 1987.
The full scale amplitude of both left and right scales is 0.2°. There is a 0.4° offset between the left and right scales. A peak at seven months is seen only in the pre-1987 data.

Figure 8 is the temperature effect on HADSST3 pre and post 1887. Left and right scales are the same amplitude, just offset 0.3°.
Again, only in pre-1987 data do we see a sea-surface temperature warming 4 to 7 months after Forbush events. Why should this be?
What changed in the late 1980’s? There seems to have been two steps in warming: the first with the spring of 1987 El Niño, the second with the spring 1997 super-El Niño. These El Niños were not started by any Forbush event.
They seem to have arisen from natural ENSO cycles. Perhaps sea surface temperatures simply reached a point where Forbush event cloud changes have little added effect.
We know that warming has stopped at the step of 1997. We see the cosmic ray/neutron flux levels increasing, which should result in cooling, yet we don’t observe cooling yet. The results above would seem to indicate that since 1987, natural ocean cycles may have overwhelmed cosmic ray affects. There seems to be a natural limit to sea surface temperatures at about 30°C, which is regularly reached in much of the tropical Pacific, and lack of clouds will not drive it higher. I would like to see input from Henrik Svensmark, Roy Spencer, Bob Tisdale, Willis Eschenbach or Nicola Scaffetta.

Like a number of readers, I’m also quite puzzled by what is going on here. Maybe someone could fill us in on the background. It’s not the kind behavior we want to have. We’d prefer to see the long knives returned to the drawer.
Again I’m not taking any sides. But I will say I don’t like watching big guys beat up on little ones. Science is supposed to stay factual with emotions left aside as best as possible. If a scientist has something to say, I say let him get it out there on the table so everyone can see it and decide for himself.
Nicola posted a reader comment that I’m upgrading to a post. It can’t be that all a man has left to defend his reputation with (which he’s worked so hard for) is to post reader comments at a little blog like mine. Nicola’s comment is being upgraded to a post. His science is just as entitled to go through the process of rigorous review as anyone else’s, and to be so without petty attacks from the hinterhalt.
Maybe his science is completely wrong, but let it go through the process. What’s the BFD?
Nicola’s comment:
================================
Because Pierre has linked above a new post on WUWT of Willis that criticizes one paper of the collection, I think that also the readers here might be interested in my comment.
Willis appears to criticize a paper without reading it. He picks up something extrapolated from the context like the famous guy jumping around the Bible who concludes that It says “There is no God.” while the full sentence says: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”

The same graph discussed above by Willis was discussed with Anthony’s great approval here and here. 
The graph is essentially taken from Shaviv (2008): Shaviv, N. J.: Using the oceans as a calorimeter to quantify the solar radiative forcing, J. Geophys. Res., 113, A11101, doi:1029/2007JA012989, 2008. It has been properly referenced by Solheim and where a lot of details are present. Solheim does not need to repeat the details given the fact that those are in the referenced work.
The uncertainty noted by some above is also discussed in Solheim’s paper and it is due to the fact that the decadal climatic cycle may be due to a soli-lunar oscillation at about 9.1 years and to the 10-12 year solar cycle.  This is clearly shown in numerous figures of the paper such as Figure 7, which is taken from one of my papers, which are these:
Scafetta, N.: Solar and Planetary Oscillation control on climate change hind-cast, forecast and an comparison with the CMIP5 GCMs, Energ. Environ., 42, 455–496, 2013a; and
Scafetta, N.: Discussion on climate oscillations: CMIP5 general circulation models versus a semi-empirical harmonic model based on astronomical cycles, Earth-Sci. Rev., 126, 321–357, 2013b.
Willis, unfortunately, has not mastered the work of reading a scientific paper.
Is this all your science, Willis?”
================================
One last note. One factor that motivated me to get active in climate science debate was having watched small, poorly-funded skeptical scientists and dissenters get dragged through the mud by the huge multi-billion dollar climate change industry. Even if the dissenters had been shown wrong, I still would have jumped in. Without an open and fair debate, society cannot possibly progress.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI don’t have any solid information on the Kelud volcano’s explosivity index, but preliminary indications show it may have a VEI of 3, possibly 4. The plume has reached 17 km.

This would have very little impact on climate.
But still, look for desperate warmists to seize upon it and to blame it for cooling over the next year or two, thus buying a few more months of precious little time for which to sustain their climate fraud.
From Reuters…
More than 100,000 people fled their homes and flights were grounded across most of Indonesia’s densely populated island of Java on Friday after a volcanic eruption sent a huge plume of ash and sand 17 km (10 miles) into the air.
The ash cloud from Thursday night’s eruption of Mount Kelud in the province of East Java moved west over the island, forcing the closure of seven airports and stranding thousands of passengers. The only major airports still operating on Java were two in the capital, Jakarta. […]

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel, for the first time that I can recall, reports on how sea ice in Antarctica refuses to melt and has reached a new maximum record.
Antarctica’s record level sea ice is troubling those who were earlier convinced of the global warming science. Slowly, reluctantly, they are beginning to realize that something is wrong with the science. …

Spiegel writes that at the end of September NASA recorded a record maximum sea ice extent of 19.47 million square kilometers meters, the most since satellite measurements began 30 years ago.
This is an inconvenient development for global warming alarmists, who are now finding themselves scrambling for explanations.
Spiegel writes “when ice in the north and south pole are discussed, then it’s usually about melting caused by global warming. However, sea ice in the Antarctic, contrary to the Arctic, has proven to be amazingly robust.” Spiegel can hardly conceal its disbelief.
One scientist who is scrambling and who is visibly baffled is meteorologist Walt Meier, who seems irritated by the new puzzling Antarctic sea ice record – the second in 2 years. In the Spiegel report, he attempts to play it all down by claiming that the record amount is “only 3.6% over the 1981-2010 mean“. Meier adds: “This year the edge of the ice extends out only 35 kilometers further than an average year.”

Baffled scientists left to speculate
Walt Meier is on the defensive, and insists the Antarctic ice sheet is getting thinner- especially West Antarctica. Spiegel adds that scientists are baffled by the sea ice increase, writing that it’s “a riddle“.
According to Spiegel, “scientists suspect that a change in atmospheric currents may explain for the most part the increase in Antarctic sea ice over the last decade.” So now atmospheric air currents have teamed up with the oceans to eat up the heat.  Strange how whenever it melts in the Arctic, it’s a sure sign of man-made global warming. But when it freezes in the Antarctic, it’s a real mystery!
Spiegel floats another possible explanation for the mysterious Antarctic sea ice behavior: ocean currents of cool surface water refrigerating the Antarctic and gobbling up any heat down there. Another explanation, Spiegel writes, could be melt water from the ice sheet flowing through huge canals in the ice that end up cooling the sea surface temperature.
That of course is like saying the warming is cooling Antarctica (with melt water)! In climate science anything is possible. Anything goes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Bild newspaper here quotes German meteorologist Dominik Jung: “For the coming winter give a probability of 70:30% that it’s going to be a colder-than-normal winter.”

Photo: SnowKing1, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported.
Jung is not the only meteorologist forecasting a colder-than-normal winter. Bild also reports that also Michael Klein of Donnerwetter.de expects better than even chances of bitter cold months: “The first trend points more to a colder-than-normal winter. At least it is not going to be mild.“
The southern Germany’s online Wasserburger Stimme reports here that the chances of an “extreme winter” are as high as ever this year. The site also quotes German meteorologist Dominik Jung, who says that winters in Central Europe in general began to become milder after the 1960s thanks to mild winds coming in off the Atlantic. Jung adds that the highpoint was reached in the 1990s. But: “In the last 5 years the winters have been normal or slightly colder than normal. The series of extremely mild winters appears to be over.”
A meteorologist who believes anything?
Jung feels that this winter could be a really harsh one – the sort not seen in 50 years. But cautions that such a forecast cannot be made with high certainty. Jung adds:
But the probability of a new XXL winter has increased considerably. New theories claim that extended ice melt at the North Pole could lead to significantly colder winters in Europe. It is not that the climate over the whole world will warm up. There are regions that will indeed get warmer, and there are also regions that will get cooler.”
Here Jung is subscribing to the after-the-fact nonsensical theory that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) desperately had to cook after being caught off guard by cold winters that took Europe by surprise. It’s a dubious theory based solely on IPCC-quality models with no data to support it.
Jung adds that the US NCEP models are also forecasting a slightly colder normal winter than usual (1961-1990 mean).
UK meteorologist predicts possibly “the worst for decades”
Forecasts of a harsh winter are also circulating in Britain. The online Express here bears the title: Worst winter for decades: Record-breaking snow predicted for November.” It writes:
Long-range forecasters blamed the position of a fast-flowing band of air known as the jet stream near Britain and high pressure for the extreme conditions. Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, said: ‘We are looking at a potentially paralysing winter, the worst for decades, which could at times grind the nation to a halt.'”

It’s hard to tell how much all of this is headline-grabbing. Some meteorologists may be getting carried away. My WAG is a more or less normal winter.
Greenpeace Arctic Activists Update
Complaints that the cell is too cold
The UK leftist Independent here writes that some of the 30 arrested Greenpeace activists are complaining of harsh conditions and that their cells are too cold. The Independent quotes the father of a detained activist:
‘There’s no regular access to such simple things as clean water, regular meals and a warm enough air temperature,’ Mr Golubok said.”
What do the activist expect from a Russian prison? Five-star resort accommodations, massages and a sauna?
Captain says he needs to go home because of heart problems
Meanwhile the English language Ria Novosti reports that the captain of the Arctic Sunrise ship Peter Wilcox now regrets going to the Arctic to protest:
RIA Novosti’s legal reporting agency RAPSI quoted Willcox as saying he had never faced such severe charges in 40 years of activism, and that he would have stayed in New York if he could choose to go back. […] Denial of Willcox’s appeal came despite his lawyer expressing concern over his health complications stemming from a heart condition.”
Oh, now suddenly he has heart problems. Strange how just a month ago his heart had been in good enough shape to allow him to venture off into the harsh Arctic conditions for a little protest and boat ramming.
Lavrov warns external parties “not to interfere”
Yesterday Ria Novosti here wrote that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that the environmental activists “clearly violated the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea” and that “the issue should be left in the hands of the courts“. He also warned external parties “not to interfere“.
Ria Novosti writes that “All 30 have appealed their detention, seeking release on bail or home arrest. The Murmansk Regional Court has rejected all 11 appeals it has heard so far, ordering the activists to remain behind bars until a hearing on November 24.”
Looks to me like none are going to be released on bail. There’s just too much material to sort through and no one wants to decide prematurely. Besides, the Russians have lots of time and there’s no hurry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe print edition of the Swiss Die WeltWoche has a story on the IPCC and accusations that climate scientists have misled policymakers: The Silence of the Climate Scientists, authored by Markus Schär.
In it Schär claims that “the IPCC lead by Thomas Stocker concealed good news in its report” and that “a new report shows that the warnings of climate change have to be called off.” 
Weltwoche writes that in view of the record Antarctic sea ice, 17 years of no global warming and cold records peppering the globe, it is obvious that “the climate models of climate scientists can’t be right“.
The Swiss news weekly cites a recent report by Nicholas ­Lewis and science journalist Marcel Crok that was recently released by the British think tank Global Warming Policy Foundation. In it Lewis and Crok claim the IPCC kept silent about important findings because “they contradicted their warnings of a climate catastrophe“.
Weltwoche describes Lewis and Crok as persons who don’t let themselves be labeled deniers and that the report’s foreword was written by renowned Georgia Tech Professor Judith Curry, “a leading atmospheric physicist who as a critic of climate science has advised the US Congress over the last weeks. For this reason the report stimulated attention worldwide, even if not in the media, who still prefer to warn of catastrophes“.
In the report’s foreword, Curry calls the GWPF report “technically sound, well-organized and readily comprehensible”.

Weltwoche writes how Lewis und Crok pointed to a number of recent studies indicating that CO2 climate sensitivity has “a far lesser value of between 1.5 and 2°C” and that “there is no reason for warnings of catastrophe.”
Weltwoche writes:
For this reason the IPCC people are silent about the recent papers in their summary for policymakers, refrain from providing the most probable values and instead spread the message that despite all the uncertainty, their certainty is greater than ever.”
According to Weltwoche IPCC lead author Thomas Stocker was rankled by claims in the GWPF report, accused them of cherry-picking and that he had no intention of responding to a “non-peer-reviewed paper published by a think tank.”
WeltWoche appears somewhat surprised by Stocker’s irritability, concluding:
­Lewis and Crok actually only did what the IPCC should have done: that is to look at the important studies and to draw the obvious conclusions from them. The lessons of their report are recommended for Stocker to consider.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNature here today has a commentary acknowledging that the warming pause is real and that it has grown into a full blown trend – it is no longer just noise! “Sixteen years into the mysterious ‘global-warming hiatus’, scientists are piecing together an explanation.”
Hat/tip: Barry Woods. Nature writes:
The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. […]
For several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field.”
Don’t let Nature fool you here. It’s actually a major crisis of confidence. Nature even acknowledges natural factors are in play after all.
An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), […]
…and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998.″

On climate models:
…none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time.”
And Susan Solomon is now moving the goal posts once again, claiming that the “main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years”!
So why the unexpected hiatus? Nature floats out a number of possible reasons: aerosols, ocean cycles, solar activity – no one knows!
But Kevin Trenberth refuses to give up hope, and keeps clinging to the climate catastrophe: “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.”
In the meantime, only one thing is sure: Scientists haven’t been “on the right track” – not in 15 years!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe public by now has heard every climate scare story at least five times over the last three decades. They’ve stop listening years ago.
Yet, the last remaining, diehard alarmists are reaching ever deeper into their bag of tricks in an attempt to reawaken the good old days of climate alarmism. We certainly can tell we are now in the run up to the release of the IPCC AR5 Report.

September, 2013 front cover of National Geographic shows sea level rise of 65 meters. At current rate it’ll take 30,000 years! 
The most recent is the latest National Geographic cover everyone is now ridiculing (see above). It is turning out to be another alarmists’ own-goal, much to the delight of the skeptics.
The semi-submerged Statue of Liberty used to convey a catastrophic sea level rise is actually just an old trick used by Spiegel…27 years ago, August 11, 1986!

27 years ago, Spiegel showed a semi-submerged Cologne Cathedral. Source: www.spiegel.de/spiegel/html
If that doesn’t tell us that the warmists are intellectually bankrupt and have lost the debate. Even the annual children’s ritual of Halloween scares grown-ups more.
So what will be on National Geographic’s cover next month? Bacon sizzling in a frying pan accompanied by warning, “Be scared, be very scared!“? Now wouldn’t that be creative and original?

Both Spiegel and National Geographic depict on their covers a sea level rise on the order of 60 meters or so. Totally preposterous with regards to today’s scientific knowledge. Spiegel has long since cranked back its global warming alarmism, and even occasionally publishes articles critical of climate alarmism claiming even 1 meter of sea level rise by 2100.
Bjorn Lomborg: “exhaustion and lack of interest”
At FaceBook Björn Lomborg comments:

This is the kind of scare pictures that are unnecessary for the public conversation on global warming. The new National Geographic cover shows the Statue of Liberty covered in 65m (214ft) of water — 80 times more than even the highest expected sea level rise in the upcoming IPCC report. Yes, global warming is a problem, but screaming way over the top hasn’t helped the last 20 years. Arguably it has lead to panic, poor policies that have cost trillions of dollars with little benefit, and now almost exhaustion and lack of interest. 65m calculated here: http://bit.ly/158KG7x, National Geographic here: http://bit.ly/17sRKKQ.”

Reader comments at FB:
George Breckenridge:
National Geographic has been part of the propaganda machine for some years. Whores for hire.”
Matt Greenwade:
What’s going to happen is these predictions will turn out to be false, or at the very least inaccurate, and people won’t pay attention anymore.”
Well Matt, people stopped paying attention long ago. NatGeo is just the latest example telling us why this is so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHistory is chock full with doomsday scenarios, peddled by profiteering charlatans, scenarios that time and again keep getting postponed decades into the future. Man running out of oil in 20 years has been around for a century. The claim still keeps getting made even by people who really should know better. And every time the goal posts end up getting pushed back.
A German industrial news site PROCESS here reports that leading German consulting group Roland Berger has recently released a new study titled: “Are we running out of oil?”
The answer is “no”. Moreover, Roland Berger writes that the future is oil.
PROCESS writes: “The core message of the study on the topic of oil supply: Supply bottlenecks are not to be expected because of the increasing number of oil reserves.”
The doomsday scenario of depleted oil reserves gets postponed again. PROCESS writes that the price of oil is poised to fall below 70 dollars a barrel. The primary reason for the downward crude oil prices is the increasing number of global oil reserves that are resulting from improved drilling methods. The Roland Berger study writes that currently there are an estimated 2.6 trillion barrels of crude in easily accessible reserves and 3.3 trillion barrels in unconventional reserves like oil sands and shale.

Challenges faced by alternative energy will spur demand for crude oil
The study also writes that the supply of oil will be less subject to political instability due to a supply that is becoming increasingly diversified and that production will increase in non-OPEC nations. According to PROCESS, demand for oil worldwide will also increase, with strong consumption growth taking place in the Middle and Far East, particularly China.
One reason for the expected demand in oil? PROCESS write (my emphasis):
In view of the rapid GDP growth after the financial crisis, the minimal state regulation in emerging countries and the challenges that the operators of alternative energies have to deal with, the demand for crude oil will increase.”
In summary, a global caliber consulting group concludes that alternative energies aren’t going to be able to meet the needs. The future is oil.

The ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) forecasts that the number of heat-wave days will double in just seven years, so reports CO2 Handel website here. The forecast appeared in Nature.
Recall that the PIK is the outlier panicky institute that insists sea levels may rise 2 meters by the year 2100 and believe that the planet is warming faster than ever, even though global temperatures have dropped slightly over the last decade. Its director is Professor Dr. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the chairman of the WBGU, a 12-man advisory committee of “renown scientists” who are calling for the rapid transformation of the global economy to one that is driven mostly by renewable energies. The WBGU also calls for a watering down of democracy, insisting that professors in academia must have the say on how the planet is governed.
Back to the subject of heat waves, the German Press Agency DPA writes:
Strong heat waves for this time of the year will double by 2020, calculates a team led by 2020 Dim Coumou of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (Pik). By 2040 such weather patterns will even quadruple. Droughts, heat waves, and storms could in turn enhance climate change in the future, the scientists add in the journal Nature.”
The scientists also add that “soil and plants absorbed up to 30 percent of the man-made carbon dioxide over the past 50 years and thus have slowed climate change.” But they say forests are no longer absorbing the CO2 as well, and so the climate is going to get a lot worse.
“Robust” fortune-telling

Based on models – that’s the good news because so far every PIK model projection has been completely wrong. The opposite of what they projected is actually happening in reality. No temperature increase in 15 years.
The PIK fortune-telling doesn’t stop at the year 2040; it even looks at the year 2100. Now that must be some really powerful fortune-telling. For you non-believers and skeptics, think again:
‘The Pik study delivers more robust results than of the earlier studies,’ comments Stefan Hagemann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg on inquiry. ‘What today is the exception, is what we will have to get used to in the future.'”
Dim Coucou claims that things are going to get a heck of a lot worse:
While today only 5% of the globe’s land surface sees heat extremes in the summer each month, that will go up to 85 percent. ‘In many regions the coldest summer months will become hotter than the hottest months today,’ Coumou says.”
Overall the German angst-spreading PIK scientists say it’s too late to prevent the massive heat waves foreseen for 2020 or 2040 – there’s just too much CO2 in the atmosphere. But if we act now and change our carbonic ways, then there’s still hope to avert the catastrophe that awaits our grandchildren in the year 2100, Coucou wants us to believe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnvironmentalists for years have preached that wildlife and nature needed to be protected. But today to accomplish that aim, they tell us it’s necessary to industrialize our landscape with skyscraper-size noisy wind turbines.

Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment buries its own study that windmills kill wildlife on a massive scale. Photo: Espen Lie Dahl. Photo not from Germany, for illustration only.
And we warned them that the wind farms were inefficient, unpredictable, and especially deadly to airborne wildlife. That of course clashed with their climate -rescue fantasies and so they just poohed-poohed that accusation. In Germany they have since erected 25,000 turbines.
Now, just 3 days ago, the online daily Kreiszeitung here reported on a new study about the devastating impacts of wind turbines on birds and bats:
According to a study, wind turbines in Germany kill hundreds regularly, and quite possibly even thousands of bats. The study could be explosive because it could lead to limitations for the turbines. But the scientists are not permitted to reveal the details.”
Cover-up – plain and simple. According to the Kreiszeitung, the study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Environment (Germany’s equivalent of the EPA), and was carried out by scientists of the University of Hannover.
The study showed that the wind turbines between the Alps and the coasts killed tens of thousands of bats each year.”
The Kreiszeitung also quotes experts from the Society for the Preservation of Owls (EGE) to give readers an idea of the scale of killing taking place annually:
Based on the findings if you calculate for the current 25,000 wind turbines in Germany, a quarter million bats are killed every year.”

All this is going on in a country where construction of projects are routinely shut down in Germany so that birds aren’t disturbed from spring until mid summer during the mating season.
The embarrassing, but gory details of the study are being kept under tight wraps: “The scientists assured the windpark operators anonymity in the project, in which Germany’s branch leader Enercon assisted as a partner,  in exchange for their willingness for cooperation in the study.” The EGE Preservation of Owls Society is now demanding that the publicly funded results be released so that it can be determined exactly where the flying mammals are getting killed and so that appropriate action can be taken.
The EGE is citing Germany’s Nature Protection Act which forbids the killing of endangered species. This has turned into a really messy situation for the Federal Ministry of Environment. In a law-abiding society, permit applications for the construction of windparks in such regions would have to be rejected, and existing ones curtailed, or even shut down. But in an environmental tyranny based on tampered, clandestine science, the law simply gets trampled on. The Kreiszeitung writes:
What is explosive in this case: The German Federal Ministry of Environment (BMU) supported the study with 1.1 million euros. The accusation by the EGE Owl Society is now plain to see: The federal government gives tax money for a project, from which we discover that the studied windparks possibly must be subject to new requirements so that they conform to the law. But nothing is happening.”
The study is getting swept under the carpet. My guess is that another study (a dubious corrupt one) will be commissioned and it in turn will show that very few bats are being killed after all. And in the end, should the bats end up disappearing, then they’ll just blame it on climate change.
The Kreiszeitung ends its report by reminding readers that wind energy isn’t so rosy after all:
They don’t feed in power at a constant rate and thus still require baseload power from conventional power plants. Critics fear a forest of windmills covering the landscape. And for the wind power variant of offshore windparks, a cable would have to rip through the world heritage Wadden Sea. Offshore, there are hardly any bats but the construction noise is driving the whales away.”
By now it should be clear: The biggest threat to the environment are the dishonest bureaucrats who want us to believe they are saving it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel today describes a COP 19 UN climate conference that has descended into a stunning chaos. NGOs are fuming that governments are no longer taking IPCC science seriously, and are now boycotting in anger.
The situation is so bad that environmental activist groups have had enough and are walking out. According to Spiegel, Oxfam, Greenpeace, WWF, Nabu, BUND, Friends of the Earth and others are now boycotting the conference.
German environmental organization BUND-chairman Hubert Weiger says, “The governments of the industrial countries and also the German government in the end are allowing themselves to be directed almost exclusively by the interests of the large fossil energy companies.”
I wonder if the seemingly clueless activists have ever stopped to think about where governments get most of their revenue, let alone the power and energy they and we need for survival. Maybe it’s, errr, industry?
One thing that should be becoming clear to them: The countries are no longer impressed by the doomsday projections issued by a seemingly desperate climate science. Countries aren’t taking it seriously anymore. The sham is over. As a result, COP 19 is shaping up to be a debacle of grand dimensions.

According to Spiegel much anger is being directed at host country Poland. Denise Loga of the WWF says the UN conference “has descended into a climate circus“.
The environmental activist groups are also angry that rich industrial countries are refusing to pony up billions for “climate protection” for poor countries, and that industrial China is pretending to be a developing country in need of handouts. Spiegel writes that Australia and Japan are also targets of activist fury.
Spiegel writes that the activists are also seething over emerging countries like China, India and Brazil who “in a few years will surpass the entire historical output of CO2 western industrial countries.” My oh my – it’s just terrible that emerging countries are finally pulling themselves out of the decades-long, grinding poverty.
“Not a single issue that’s not in dispute”
According to the German delegation, there isn’t a single issue that is not in dispute, and it’s been like that since Day 1. There have been lots of declarations, which are nothing more than “repeats of old declarations“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany has always been viewed as one of the leaders in “fighting climate change”. But when you examine what the country has really accomplished in reducing CO2 emissions, we see that country’s actions tell another story.
And when you examine its current activities, one thing stands clear: Germany is no longer taking the futile fight against climate change seriously and has abandoned its efforts to fight nature, likely having realized that the climate is going to change naturally anyway and there’s nothing you can do about it – except adapt. Thus in most respects, Germany has de facto joined the ranks of Japan, Australia and Canada.
German climate scientist Mojib Latif, a loud proponent of radical CO2 reductions, has a commentary at Spiegel titled: The fight against greenhouse gases: Germany mutates into a climate protection obstructionist.
Latif writes that in 1995, under the leadership of Helmut Kohl, Germany unilaterally committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2005 (using 1990 as the reference period). The Kyoto Protocol then mandated that Europe’s largest economy only needed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 21% by 2012. That target was reached; Germany patted itself on the back and posed as a model for the rest of the world.
But as Latif points out, the target was reached not because of planned and executed efforts to do so, but thanks in large part to a one-time unique event: the collapse of East Germany and its notoriously outdated and dilapidated industry. Moreover, Germany’s economy shifted a large portion of its energy-intensive industry to foreign locations, thus merely offshoring its CO2 emissions (gray emissions). The result, Latif writes: Germany has in reality made little or no tangible progress in greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The 21% achievement was a book-keeping trick, and nothing more.
Latif writes:
Taking the reunification into account and gray emissions, when it comes to climate protection, Germany has hardly undertaken any serious efforts since the Kohl government announced its ambitious plans.”

Kohl’s announcement was made in 1995, meaning Germany has done practically nothing but blow hot air on climate for almost 20 years! What’s worse, Latif writes, is that Germany is now actively obstructing progress on global emissions reductions. This in reality, confirmed by its actions, puts the country in the same ranks as Japan, Canada, and Australia: countries who have realized that the situation is not that serious after all and that there isn’t a crisis.
The obstructive actions Latif cites include Germany’s obstruction of stricter CO2 upper limits for new cars, delay tactics to prevent a reform of CO2 emissions trading, its scaling back of subsidies for renewable energies, and its recent plans to bring coal-fired power plants back on line. Indeed Germany’s CO2 emissions have risen for the second year in a row, ironically because of the unusually cold winter. Latif writes:
This is a sad result for the self-named class leader in climate protection.
While Germany may appear quick to lecture other countries on their environmental and climatic responsibilities, the reality is completely different. Europe’s industrial engine has realized that fighting climate change is an excruciatingly expensive and senseless endeavor and that the science underpinning it isn’t what it was cracked up to be after all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest Greenpeace activist has been denied bail by a Russian court in the Arctic port city of Murmansk.
The online Mail here features photos of a young Greenpeace woman-activist behind bars – the face of innocence. Greenpeace portrays itself as the moral and ethical conscience of the planet and insists it is simply an innocent victim of a state that is greedily attempting to exploit a virgin region.
The latest to be denied bail is 27 year-old Briton Alexandra Harris. Harris is among the youngest of the 30 arrested. Now that she has been denied bail, there is little hope of any of the 30 activists getting released. This is truly a tragic development, especially for the younger, naïve activists. They will now get plenty of time to reflect on how they wound up doing long, hard time in a Russian prison.
With time they may come to realize that they had been enticed by a Greenpeace deal: accept hate in exchange for the title of “moral champion of the globe”. An irresistible deal for any soul in the possession of a young, naïve, or just plain dim mind.
Greenpeace is not a peaceful organization. It is one of violence, condescending intolerance, and confrontation, all hiding behind a guise of moral superiority. It recruits the young, teaches them to hate opposing views and to never compromise with them. It rejects dialogue, always claiming the discussion is over and that they are the ultimate keepers of the truth. Greenpeace teaches the young that they can justify acts of violence and law-breaking by simply claiming moral superiority and the struggle for a noble cause.
Perhaps the young activists will come to realize in a few months (or years) that they had been brainwashed into thinking they were environmental saints who in reality had only been used as publicity pawns for a multi-million dollar publicity machine. What moral, peaceful organization does the following to the young?

What’s the difference between the boy above and the following radicalized Islamic boy?

I’d say there is very little difference. Both rants are based on religious faith, both children are irreversibly convinced they are the keepers of the Truth, both have been filled with hatred, both are very angry, and both had been programmed by a powerful organization.
Today Greenpeace higher-ups are all acting indignant that their members would be locked up in prison, under harsh conditions even, and insist their protesters were peaceful and were only demonstrating to rescue the planet’s future. “Does this young girl really look like a pirate to you?” …”Alex is a caring, sensitive person, who cares for the environmental future of  the planet.” … “She was on board the Arctic Sunrise as part of a peaceful protest, in international waters, in the radio room doing her job.”
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo calls the charge of piracy “absurd”. After all, the highest moral conscience and authority on the planet would never engage in such activity. 
Naidoo appears to have never bothered reading the Law of the Sea. Legally Greenpeace executives acted recklessly. Now one of their crews has to pay a massive price for it. Could Greenpeace lawyers and executives be sued for legal incompetence?
Naidoo adds:
Now these 30 people are prisoners of conscience and we are all responsible for their fate.”
Now we are all responsible. In Naidoo’s mind, all of humanity must follow, without questioning, his belief, his Truth. This man is a dangerous egomaniac who has completely lost his marbles.
The families of all young Greenpeace activists would be wise to wake up to this quickly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn Climate Sensitivity – Thunderstorms
By Ed Caryl
Everyone Is Correct – Just At Different Times.
Since the time of the patron saint of Climatologists, Svante August Arrhenius, climate researchers have been attempting to pin down climate sensitivity, the amount of warming that various constituents will cause when present in the atmosphere. This is not limited to carbon dioxide, as other gases and substances also warm and cool the atmosphere to varying degrees.  The chart below is from the IPCC AR4 Summary for Policymakers.

Figure 1:is found here as figure as SPM2
The IPCC believes carbon dioxide as about 55% of the positive forcing, and methane as about 16%. But water vapor is missing as a contributor in this chart, except as clouds, a reflector. Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas. Water vapor is highly variable in the atmosphere. Over oceans relative humidity is usually close to 100%, over deserts it can be close to zero. Absolute water vapor content is also variable with temperature. In the tropics water vapor is very high. In the Arctic and Antarctic, in winter when it is very cold, water vapor is very low.

Figure 2 is Global Relative humidity in the Troposphere. Source here. A similar chart is available here  along with global maps for water vapor and methane. Click on Greenhouse gases in the sidebar, then select the gas of interest. Methane sources are mostly tropical.
The IPCC believes that water vapor increases with temperature, acting as a positive feedback, further increasing temperature. But this is not happening. Global weather balloon data shows that water vapor has been decreasing over time, not increasing.
Why should tropospheric humidity decrease with temperature increasing? The answer is that humidity in the upper atmosphere is largely driven by thunderstorms (convection), and thunderstorms have been increasing.

Figure 3 is the thunderstorm frequency at Hong Kong since 1947. Source here.

Most thunderstorm activity is in the tropics, and Hong Kong is subtropical at 22°N latitude, so should be representative of global activity. The data shows a low during the cool 1960’s, and a high in the warm 1990’s, with an increase of 1.7 days/decade, roughly tracking global and local temperature. Local temperature at the Royal Observatory in Hong Kong has not been corrected for local heat island, or “homogenized” by GISS. I could find no global data for thunderstorm frequency.

Figure 4 are the steps in thunderstorm maturation. Source Wikipedia.
 
Figure 5 is the aftermath of a thunderstorm/hailstorm, near La Luz, New Mexico, USA, August 2009. Source is the author.
Thunderstorms operate by convection. As the surface heats up, air rises. If that air contains moisture, as the air rises and cools, the moisture condenses, giving up more heat. This can result in towering clouds that produce hail and rain. This leads to rapid surface cooling and heat transport to the stratosphere. The rising air is depleted of water vapor resulting in drying at all levels in the troposphere up to the stratosphere. If there are more thunderstorms, there is more drying and surface cooling. The heat transported to the stratosphere is then transported poleward by Hadley Cell circulation and radiated to space. This is one reason for the poles (at least the north pole) warming more than the tropics.
Thunderstorms are nature’s thermostats. This is easily observed. On a hot summer’s day, in the heat of the afternoon, rising thermals turn into cumulus clouds and then into rising thunderheads, followed by rain and sometimes hail. Surface temperatures under the clouds of 105°F (40.5°C) can drop to 60°F (15.5°C) in minutes. The winds felt on the ground are just the bottom portion of a loop of air that extends up through the clouds outside or trailing edge and down in the rain. At the end of the storm, when the clouds dissipate, what is left is dry air. The moisture is now on the ground as water or hailstones and the heat has been lifted to the tropopause. In temperate latitudes it may take several days for heat and humidity to build up and begin the cycle again. In the tropics, the cycle may begin the next day.
The most important area for climate regulation on earth is the tropics, and the tropics are where there is the most water vapor and where most thunderstorms occur. Thunderstorms do two things: they move heat from the surface to the top of the tropopause, and the associated clouds reflect solar heating to space. They also set the earth’s sea surface temperature thermostat to 30°C. See Willis Eschenbach’s article on the subject here. As the earth warms, more sea surface will reach the thermostat set point, and more heat will be shunted away by clouds and thunderstorms, either as short-wave reflected from the cloud tops, or long wave radiated from the top of the atmosphere. This naturally reduces climate sensitivity to more greenhouse warming. Climate sensitivity has changed over time. This is the reason that the early 20th century warming was as dramatic as it was with a small CO2 rise, and the late 20th Century warming was the same amplitude with a much greater CO2 rise. Here is a plot of 60-year window equilibrium climate sensitivity from 1880 to 2010 using GISStemp data and a combination of Law Dome and Keeling CO2 data.

Figure 6 is a plot of equilibrium climate sensitivity assuming a 60 year window (1880 to 1940, 1881 to 1941, and so on). The window length bridges the natural climate cycles.
As the plot shows, climate sensitivity in the early 20th Century was about 4°C for CO2 doubling, but by the turn of the Century, this had reduced to about 1.5°C. It is likely approaching zero if we take out all the GISS “adjustments” and use the true temperatures. This explains the “pause” of the last 17 years. The temperature cannot rise higher because we can’t warm beyond Mother Nature’s thermostat set point, set by the maximum sea-surface temperature.

The “nepotism” accusation was a dubious at best, mostly entails personal intrigue and was added later to cover up the real motivation. It is only a side show to distract from the real reason behind the magazine’s shut down.
Clearly this really gets down to suppressing alternative views that threaten the popular global warming science. It’s a sad example of Germany succumbing to behavior of darker times.
Please restrict comments to the issue of suppressing alternative scientific explanations and the efforts involved therein and the merits of the science presented in the banned journal.
Roger of Tallbloke’s Talkshop recently had an interesting post on the suppression of science that’s well worth reading. The harboring of disagreement with a particular science is not a reason for shutting it down.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRebound and Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
During the peak of the last ice age, enough ice was collected in the great ice sheets that the global sea level was reduced by more than 120 meters. The ice sheets themselves were, in places, more than two kilometers thick. The great weight of that ice depressed the earth’s crust and mantle by hundreds of meters. In some places, ground that is now a hundred meters above sea level, was pressed down below the sea level that existed before and shortly after the ice melted. Because the earth’s mantle has a high viscosity, and the earth’s crust a high bending strength, these areas are still slowly rising after 12,000 years, and will rise for another 12,000, barring another ice age to press them down again. This “isostatic rebound” or “post-glacial rebound” (PGR) complicates sea levels worldwide because it continually changes the sea bottom and coastline shapes. The University of Colorado sea level measurements add 0.3 mm/year to sea level rise to “adjust” for this. Is this adjustment reasonable?
Locally, this rebound can be measured by precision GPS. Geological studies have also determined the prehistoric amount of rebound that has taken place. I will just mention three areas that have been and will be vastly changed by rebound: the St Lawrence Seaway area in Canada and northern New England in the U. S., an island beach in Nunavit, northern Canada, and Finland in northern Europe.

Figure 1 is a world map of PGR from the Wikipedia article on that subject, here.
The present day St. Lawrence River Seaway sits at the edge of the present PGR area that marks the boundary of the great Laurentide Ice Sheet of the last ice age. North of the river, the Provence of Quebec is rising. South of the river, southern New England is rising much slower or falling. This is apparent at Lake Ontario, where the tilting has resulted in the northern shore rising faster than the southern shore, and wetlands on the north draining and drying out, while on the southern shore, beaches are drowning and wetlands are being created from formerly dry land. The whole lake is very slowly rolling southward.
At the end of the last ice age, ice had blocked the St. Lawrence valley and formed the glacial Lake Candona, covering what is now the lower three Great Lakes, Ontario, Erie, and Huron. When the ice dam failed, the water level fell 300 feet (100 meters) in a few days. At this point, Lake Ontario may have been connected to the world ocean through the Champlain Sea. The Champlain Sea covered the whole area that is now Lake Champlain and all the St. Lawrence River Valley up to Lake Ontario. Pierre’s boyhood home in Northern Vermont was under seawater, or at the shore during this period. The Champlain Sea lasted from 12,500 years ago up to 9800 years ago, when the rising land finally cut off Lake Champlain from the waters to the north. The land has continued to rise in the Lake Champlain area, and now the lake is 29 to 30 meters above mean sea level.
In the far north of Canada, where the center of the ice sheet was thickest, the land is currently rising at nearly 2 cm a year. In the past, when the last ice had melted, the rate was even higher, and the land will continue to rise into the future until the next ice age returns. The PGR uplift is constant, without fits and starts, in contrast to land in tectonically active areas like California and Japan, and other areas that are near plate boundaries where earth movements will abruptly change sea level.

Here at Rebound Beach are many fossil beaches, one above the other, preserved because for most of the year the ground is frozen and snow-covered, there is little rain, and very little tidal action. The beaches seen here are like a stereo tape recording (with a stream dividing the tracks) of rising and falling sea levels recorded on a steadily rising, evenly sloped land form. It appears that since the last time the tape was erased, when the ice scrubbed the slope clean over 12,000 years ago, there have been about 20 rises, falls, or hesitations in the sea level, where the rate was different from the steady PGR. A dating of each of these fossil beaches would result in a good record of sea level over the last 12,000 years.
Figure 3 (left) is a map of Finland as of 11,000 years ago. Source. The blue area was water.
Finland 11,000 years ago was mostly sea-bottom with an archipelago of islands. Many place-names in Finland reflect this history with high ground that has island or other maritime feature names. As the land rose, lakes were cut off from the sea, and the Gulf of Bothnia became smaller. The current rate of uplift here approaches 1 cm a year in the northern Gulf. On this map, at the left edge just below center is a narrowing of the Gulf of Bothnia at Kvarken. This narrowing separates Bothnian Bay from the outer Bothnian Sea further south. The water at this point is only about 25 meters deep. Bothnian Bay is already nearly fresh water due to the number and size of the rivers flowing into it. The salt content is now too low to be tasted and there are many freshwater fish species. In about 1500 years uplift will create a further narrowing, reducing the depth to about 10 meters, creating a river flowing south across the Kvarken. At that time Bothnia Bay will be a freshwater lake.
The rising of the bottom of the Bay of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea in general will reduce the volume of the Baltic and force that water into the world ocean, raising the sea level generally. Just to estimate the amount of rise, if the average PGR is 5 mm/year for the Baltic, and the Baltic is roughly 1/1000th of the total ocean area, then the world ocean will rise 0.005 mm/year.
But the Baltic is small compared to Hudson Bay, and Hudson Bay is also rising. The tide gauge at Churchill is rising (sea level falling) at 1.2 cm/year. Hudson Bay is 0.34% of the World Ocean. The PGR here will contribute 0.041 mm/year to general sea level rise. The other waters around the islands of Nunavit in northern Canada will contribute about another 0.004 mm/year, making a total for the Baltic and Canada about 0.05 mm/year.
But the PGR rising is offset by sea bottom sinking. As the earth’s mantle rises, the mantle in the surrounding area must flow down and under to compensate. As can be seen in figure 1, the North Atlantic, the bottom between Newfoundland and Greenland, and the ocean bottom north of Canada, is sinking. These areas are totally under ocean, unlike the rising areas that are mostly land. The sink rate seems to be 3 to 4 mm/year over an area much greater than the rising sea bottoms, which would appear to more than cancel any sea level rise due to PGR. The 0.3 mm/year positive “adjustment” to sea level rise by the UC sea level group does not appear to be justified.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo illustrate the absurdity that global warming science has become, global warming is claimed to cause climate change, which in turn now causes winters to be too cold! This is what some leading German state officials would like to have people believe.

1000-year old oak tree in Germany ailing because of “climate change”. Photo released into the public domain by Thomas Berendes.
Today FOCUS here reports that Lower Saxony Forestry Minister Christian Meyer (Green Party) released the 2013 Forestry Status Report, which concludes:
Lower Saxony’s forests are suffering from too much nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and climate change. This is the conclusion of the state Forestry Status Report introduced Friday.”
Here it turns out the three causes named above just happen to be by-products of the three things environmentalists love to hate: 1) agriculture – responsible for the nitrogen, 2) industry – responsible for the sulfur dioxide and 3) humans responsible for the climate change. In summary, when you get down to it, all three are because of man. Precisely who activists want to frame. Meyer says:
Especially old beech and oak trees are ailing”.
Imagine that, old trees aren’t healthy!

Report confirms cooling
Climate change, i.e. global warming, being cited as one of the reasons would lead a normal person to believe that German forests are likely suffering from too much warmth – due to the global warming. But the report says the climate-related ailments that forests are suffering are because of the “drier summers and more frosty winters.”
Forests are ailing because the winters have been too cold, the report claims. How is this due to global warming? This tells me global cooling is the problem, and not warming.
10 of the last 11 summers have been normal or too wet
And have summers really been drier? According meteorologist Dominik Jung, 10 of  the last 11 summers have been normal or wetter than normal in terms of precipitation. There’s only one conclusion we can reach about Meyer’s report: It is seriously flawed and more a political instrument that has little or no merit.
What’s another sign that the forest report is lots of activist hooey? The above pictured oak tree, for example, has been around 1000 years. Obviously it endured a broad range of conditions that occurred during the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age and the current Modern Optimum. It’s seen and survived it all.
And because it is 1000 years old, nobody should be surprised that the tree is sick.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt yesterday’s online Spiegel, science journalist Axel Bojanowski reported on a discussion with ultra-alarmist, former NASA GISS director James Hansen.

Photo by Bill Ebbesen, public domain.
Hansen believes that nuclear energy is the only way of effectively preventing global warming from fossil fuel greenhouse gases. He called the policy of scaling back nuclear power “a big mistake” and claimed that “environmental groups for fear of losing funding would prevent a successful fight against climate change by following a false energy policy”.
That “false energy policy” Hansen’s here refers to is the attempt to satisfy the world’s energy needs almost exclusively with renewable energy, mainly intermittent sun and wind. Hansen and some of his fellow scientists call that narrow approach unrealistic.
Spiegel quotes Hansen further on funding:
There are various funders who would stop their support of environmental organizations if they came out calling for nuclear power.”
Hansen is increasingly at odds with environmentalists:

The environmental organizations are against nuclear power even though only an increase in the use of the power is able to put the brakes on climate change.”
Hansen says that renewable energies will not be able to supply the world’s demand for energy and that they are “too expensive“. Spiegel quotes Hansen:
There is no realistic way to stabilize the climate where nuclear power is not a substantial part of it.”
Moreover, Hansen and three other leading scientists published an open letter last November calling for “the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems” and that the risks nuclear power” are orders of magnitude smaller than the risks associated with fossil fuels.”
Environmental groups, not surprisingly, have reacted harshly to Hansen’s remarks, calling Hansen’s funding claims “absurd” and that his energy arguments are “unsubstantiated. and that nuclear power has major safety issues.”
But Hansen counters, saying that “today’s generation of nuclear plants are considerably safer than older models“.
Environmentalists have put themselves in a catch 22 situation. By overblowing the consequences of fossil fuels, they have only succeeded in strengthening the arguments for a source of power they regard as being just as evil.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Moscow Times here writes that a Russian court has denied the Greenpeace activists bail, and the prospect of spending a long time in a Russian prison is increasingly becoming a grim reality. But unlike in the past, Greenpeace is now also being sharply criticized worldwide.
The English-language Voice of Russia aims harsh criticism at Greenpeace, writing that “experts doubt the adequacy and altruism of that international organization“.
The first thing that jumps out at you in the Voice of Russia article is the photo of Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The front is completely bent in. Have they been engaging in a little ramming lately? Some excerpts from the Voice of Russia (my emphasis):
The Western press launched a loud campaign in support of the Greenpeace. But many experts not to mention ordinary people call the actions of the activists ecological extremism. Here is the view of the situation of Mikhail Voytenko, the editor-in-chief of the Maritime Bulletin:
Everybody was afraid of getting involved with the Greenpeace, starting with corporations and ending with whole countries. And now it encountered somebody who did not get scared. And it is now getting its due. […] In reality, the Greenpeace is a dubious organization, which frequently uses illegal methods in quite different countries. […] On the whole it is practically an extremist organization.”
Voice of Russia quotes Ortis Andres Carlos, an Argentinian expert in economics and energy, a PhD in economics, is of a similar opinion:
It was a real attack on the Russian platform, the activists acted very roughly and provocatively. To call things their names, we are talking about «ecological terrorism». Greenpeace activists are a lot more interested in creating a social response.”

Meanwhile The Mirror here reports that arrested British journalist Keiron Bryan has gotten a letter out to the media in which he expresses real fear of what lies ahead. The Mirror writes: “…he fears a long jail sentence” and that he is feeling “horrible uncertainty and anxiety“. He believes that those arrested were “pieces in a game we didn’t want to  participate in“. Obviously Keiron and the activists initially thought they’d be handled with kids’ gloves, maybe spend a night in jail before strutting out the next day in the limelight of the big sympathetic media. Instead they are now staring at a Russian judge through the bars of a cage.
The biggest problem for the two journalists is the mountain of incriminating evidence Russian authorities likely have seized. All the computers and their contents in the form of e-mails, comments, documents etc. will tell if the journalists were truly objectively reporting, or if they were acting as powerful media representatives aiding and abetting the cause. One gets the sense that Greenpeace hired the journalists for the very purpose of high powered promotion.
“Chilly attitude towards suffering humanity”
Today the Mail Online has a story that is also highly critical of the environmental organization. It writes that the international organization “has a  decidedly chilly attitude towards suffering humanity. It has led a campaign to harass and frustrate ‘the Golden Rice Project’, a not-for-profit scheme backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation“. The Mail writes regarding Greenpeace’s overzealous opposition to the testing of gene modified foods (GMOs): “… it destroys such tests physically, thus showing its fundamental contempt for the scientific method”. In short: Luddites.
Now the reality and the gravity of the situation is dawning on the activists. They are in deep trouble. You can almost see what’s coming ahead: a process involving damning evidence, a harsh sentence, followed by tears and sadness, then by anger and rebellion – and maybe later a hunger strike. That will all pass, however. And after a year or two of deep reflection and thought in their cells, many will probably realize that they indeed had been on an out-of control path and that they had it coming. After a couple of years of good behavior, they’ll be back out on their feet- very likely a whole lot wiser and far less naïve about the world-saving cause they had been indoctrinated with by Greenpeace and its directors.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes it takes awhile for bad science to be exposed.
Often it starts with one person finding an inconsistency, digging a little deeper, and then announcing that something is rotten. That person in turn gets attacked and smeared as an outcast. But a few other, open-minded persons take a closer look and they too realize that something is indeed wrong. Before you know it, other scientists and experts in the field are joining in and chipping away, and soon the whole thing collapses.
German meteorologist Dominik Jung (right) wonders why climate “hysteric scientists” have come out of their cave.
This is what is happening now in climate science in Germany – lots of skeptic people are now chipping away and that process has become a run-away train.
Just a few years ago, the science was as good as settled in Germany. Yet, a few skeptical, mainly retired scientists looked into the dissent coming from America and found that the AGW hypothesis was indeed full of holes. They formed into the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and before too long more than 60 German scientists signed an open letter rejecting man-made global warming. Eventually some small-scale media outlets, journalists and blogs joined in. They in turn were followed by skeptical major articles appearing in flagship news magazines such as Spiegel and Bild, see here, here, here, and here, for example.
In 2012 one of the fathers of the modern German environmental movement, Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, teamed up with geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and released a best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. That book shook up the German climate establishment. The alarmists scrambled and put on a full-court press, but failed to contain the book’s spread. Now that book is appearing worldwide in English next month.
Recently, Germany’s leading meteorologists have begun taking note and have used their immense skills to analyze the climate data. They too have concluded that the science is far from convincing, see here, here, here, and here. Earlier, many simply had accepted the IPCC findings as truth, but for whatever reason they began taking a closer look just to be sure. And when they did, they too quickly realized that much was rotten with AGW science. Today that fact is so obvious that German meteorologists are now openly ridiculing the once highly respected institutes as opportunist prophets of doom scamming for public funding. The German skeptic train is now running away.
The latest prominent meteorologist to express harsh criticism is Dominik Jung, who I follow at Twitter. Here he linked to a short commentary at his wetternet site where he takes a slap at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for their recent fit of alarmism in projecting an 8-fold increase in heat waves in Germany by the year 2040 – based on failed models.
Here’s his commentary at wetternet.de:

Weather: The Climate Hysterics Are Back!
Wiesbaden (wetter.net), 16 August 2013 – Hard to believe: heat and drought in the middle of the summer – now who’d have ever expected that? Hardly a summer was dryer or nicer in the last 10 years, and already the climate experts are coming out on stage.
Drought?
After a really warm July and a very hot start in August, it had to be expected: the climate experts are again coming out of their caves and warning us of extreme heat summers that are supposedly now imminent.
At least that’s what we read last Thursday and Friday in the media. There are going to be more and more heat-waves until 2040, so claim the prognoses. Yet, we are still waiting for the German winters with no snow and ice which were prophesized in the year 2000 . Perhaps the lady and gentleman climate scientists should simply once ask the workers of the road maintenance and winter snow clearing crews?
Weird: Over the last two rather cool and unsettled summers, we heard or saw almost nothing from the climate prophets. Also during the last colder than normal winters there was silence. Perhaps it is once again time for applying for new research funding …who knows, who knows…

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m short on time today, so this post will be a bit brief.
Germany’s Energiewende and renewable feed-in act are often touted as huge, jobs-creating success stories. But as the prices for electricity skyrocket into the stratosphere and renewable energy companies bite the dust all over Europe, it’s turning out that the green jobs wonder is nothing short of a fraud.
Germany’s Wirtschaftswoche (Business Week) here writes that Professor Fritz Vahrenholt calls the green jobs machine a “labeling fraud”. The bottle doesn’t contain anything what the label says.
Fritz Vahrenholt, former CEO of German power company RWE renewable energy arm, contests the claims made by green industry lobbyists that green energies are a jobs machine. Vahrenholt tells Wirtschaftswoche:
With green jobs, what we have here is labeling fraud.”

Vahrenholt calls the claimed jobs number a product of “naïve calculations”. And according to the statistics office of the German federal government, only 4719 workers remain employed in the production of solar cells and modules.
Yet according to the Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft – BSW – (Federal Association for Solar Business), the number for the entire industry is “around 60,000”.
But this number is wildly exaggerated says other experts and Vahrenholt. Even according to the Centre for Solar Marketing in Berlin says:
Even when you use the very broad definition of the BSW, you can only come up with a maximum of 35,000 employees in the solar industry.”
Anyone looking at a list of solar bankruptcies taking place over the last two years can see that the solar industry is an economic catastrophe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here reports on the efforts by a gaggle of Senate Democrats to wake up America to the “risks” of climate change, But as FAZ Washington correspondent Patrick Welter reports, the event wound up having the bounce of a dead cat.
The FAZ writes: “The political happening was a bit bleak and infirm.”
Maybe it had something to do with the US experiencing one of it’s coldest and most brutal winters in memory thus making the whole thing seem a bit foolish. People weary of shoveling snow probably aren’t going to take warnings of warming too seriously. FAZ comments:
It can be assumed that the event on TV was no hit with viewers. The litany of complaints about climate change deniers, rising sea levels and flooding, threatening icy winters and large droughts quickly got tiresome with the viewers.”
Welter also writes that there wasn’t going to be any vote taken when all the talking was done because Obama has long since decided to circumvent Congress when it comes to regulating CO2, opting to do it through the EPA instead.
Welter then brings up America’s success in reducing CO2 emissions, all thanks to fracking – a technology that US environmentalists are also against. Welter concludes:
In a completely unscientific comparison, during the night the environmental protectionists in the Senate appeared somewhat infirm. […] In this marathon session more than two dozen senators would vent 15 hours long until Tuesday morning.”
While pretty much dismissing the event as a sideshow, Welter at the end of his report commits an huge unfortunate gaffe that reveals how little understanding he actually has of the climate change debate, framing it as “one between the opponents and supporters of environmental protection.” If Welter bothered to do a minimum of research, he’d find that there are many environmentalists on the side of the skeptics. Ultimately, only people who really view data critically and with skepticism are able to protect the environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhy The Hiatus?
By Ed Caryl
One of the climatologist’s explanations for the 17-year hiatus in global warming is the effect of aerosols. This explanation seems weak for the simple reason that we don’t see aerosols in this time period.
We do see the impact of aerosols from volcanic activity in previous periods, however. Here is the satellite view of monthly global temperature since 1979, along with the El Niño index and atmospheric transmission from the Mauna Loa atmospheric observatory.

Figure 1 is RSS Global TLT, El Niño 3.4 index, and atmospheric transmission.
Atmospheric transmission is the ratio of direct solar radiation from the near UV to infrared wavelengths (0.3 microns to 2.8 microns) that makes it through the atmosphere. www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/mloapt.html.
Two volcanic eruptions CAUSED significant stratospheric haze from sulpher dioxide (SO2) injected into the stratosphere,
El Chichon in 1982 and Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. Both caused significant solar energy obstruction for four years or more. Here are pictures of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1991 on the left, and of the resulting stratospheric haze in August 1991 on the right, taken from the Space Shuttle.

Figure 2 is (on the left) Mt Pinatubo in eruption, and (on the right) the earth’s limb showing the stratospheric haze, the purple line across the middle, above the cumulonimbus clouds. Source here.
The 34-year satellite observation era can be split into two halves, the 17 years before the El Niño of 1998, and the 17 years since, including the El Niño. During the first 17 years there were 2 significant volcanic eruptions and three El Niños. Two of those El Niños occurred after eruptions, but during the periods where SO2 haze was present. The SO2 hazes prevented any temperature increase, and in fact produced cooling for nearly four years in each case. Despite that, during the 17 years, temperatures increased by 0.12°C, 0.072°C/decade.
Look closely at the temperature pattern associated with El Niños. Each El Niño produces a global temperature spike a few months later, followed by a cooling rebound that is as about as negative as the El Niño is positive, and lasts as long. But there is one exception. There was a small El Niño in 1995 for which there was no negative rebound as it was followed by the super-El Niño of  1998. These produced a step in temperature of about a quarter of a degree.
Most of the warming in the years from 1979 to 1997 are in that two-year period from the El Niño of 1995 to 1997. We are now in a slow cooling from that step, thus the hiatus in temperature. There is very little temperature trend since the end of the Pinatubo eruption haze in 1995 as the result of aerosols. With the exception of two very short volcanic events, atmospheric transmission as measured at Mauna Loa was almost flat at around 93% for that whole period.

Figure 3 is a magnified view of atmospheric transmission pre- and post-1997 with trend lines.
The two minor volcanic events were Shishaldin volcano in the Aleutian island arc of Alaska, producing an ash cloud to at least 45,000 feet in the stratosphere on April 19, 1999, and on March 22, 2009, Mount Redoubt volcano, 106 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, began a series of eruptions with the ash plume reaching 60,000 feet in the stratosphere during two of the six significant eruptions. Neither of these eruptions produced very much SO2, and the ash fell out of the stratosphere in less than a month, the resolution of the above plot.
If the very significant solar obscuration due to El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo pre-1995 resulted in warming, there is no way that the dearth of activity in the post-1995 period could have produced the observed lack of warming. But, the 0.25°C step in warming in the period from 1995 to after 1998 can be explained by the lack of volcanic activity in the later period. The average atmospheric transmission in the first period is about 1.5% less than in the second period. Allowing for average albedo, that is about 2.5 Watts/m2 difference in average solar radiation at the earth’s surface. This, plus the two El Niños in 1995 and 1998, explains the step in warming. This also means that the climate sensitivity, Lambda is very low.
Delta T = lambda * delta F, T is temperature in degrees C, F is the forcing in Watts/m2.
Lambda = delta T/delta F = 0.25°C/2.5 Watts/m2 = 0.1°C/Watt/m2.
This figure has some caveats, the temperature measurement is from the global satellite (RSS) temperature data, and the atmospheric transmission data is from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, which was on the edge of the SO2 plumes from Pinatubo, so it should be viewed as an approximation.
But it agrees with what Willis Eschenbach found yesterday for tropical regions, here. The Pinatubo eruption was the larger of the two eruptions and had the largest impact, but it was limited to tropical latitudes where lambda is low or negative.

Figure 4 is an optical depth plot of the Pinatubo SO2 plume three weeks after the eruption. Source here.
The lack of warming for the last 17 years cannot be due to an increase in aerosols, as there was no significant increase.
The hiatus in warming, with little volcanic activity to provide cooling, with the peak reached in the AMO, solar activity declining, increasing sea ice, sea temperatures hitting the limit, and the very low climate sensitivity measured above, all indicate that we have reached the peak global temperature in this cycle. It will get no warmer. It may never get warmer. The thermostat is open.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFiery hell and Biblical floods: This is what’s in store for mankind in the future, so suggests chief climate modeler Stefan Rahmstorf of the ultra-alarmist and catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in an interview with the German Press Agency (DPA) here.
As sure signs of the approaching climate catastrophe, the DPA cites “floods in Great Britain, icy frost in USA, extreme snowfall in Japan, and droughts in Australia. Climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf warns of the consequences of climate change.”
Already we get the sense that some climate science institutes fancy themselves as prophets who possess credible visions of future doom and gloom. Unbelievable as it may seem, once again we see scientists returning to the Dark Ages, a time when priests sought out witches on whom to blame bad, famine-causing weather on. We’re back, at least in Potsdam, to the Medieval witch hunts and burnings.
So how dramatic is the situation today? Rahmstorf says in the interview:
Again and again we have to deal with weather extremes like heat waves and heavy rains, which are increasing in intensity and frequency due to climate change.”
Rahmstorf then tells the DPA that the climate change is all caused by human CO2-induced global warming and that…(my emphasis)
The number of heat records in the monthly mean values is today already five times higher than one would expect it to be during a stable climate.”
Here Rahmstorf is actually implying that humans could see a stable climate – if only they simply changed their behavior or if governments took bold action aimed at controlling the behavior of humans. This is nonsense and reminds us of the Medieval belief that bad storms and weather could be prevented if only “witches and sorcerers” were burned in public.

Rahmstorf also claims that sea level rise is accelerating due to the melting of the large ice masses on Greenland and Antarctica”. He adds:
It is depressing how man is running into the crisis with open eyes without resorting to already determined counter-measures. Foremost great efforts by governments would be necessary.”
Rahmstorf concedes models have little predictive value
Rahmstorf claims that swift action in the form of “great efforts” by governments is warranted by hard science and data. So we can assume that they have a pretty good idea of what to expect in the future. However, at the end of the interview, Rahmstorf is forced to admit that they don’t have an idea of what the future holds.
Model simulations are able to show how a possible future might look like. However, it is very difficult regionally to make reliable conclusions as we run against the limits of what is possible with climate models today. You can only fathom the possibilities.
That’s the disadvantage of leaving the known, stable climate of the past and charging into waters where the old data of experience are no longer applicable. Man is living with increasing uncertainty and has to anticipate more surprises.”
True. And some of the big surprises include the massive cold and snow gripping the northern hemisphere, 17 years of no global warming, and record sea ice in Antarctica.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientist turned film-maker Randy Olson is interviewed here by Spiegel Online’s science journalist Axel Bojanowski. From the interview it becomes glaringly clear that the AGW movement has failed to communicate its message of climate catastrophe and the need to profoundly re-order society. It’s over.

Olson starts by saying that climate change as an issue “is truly important, and that it is a major tragedy how poorly it’s been handled.” and that it is up against one particularly nasty obstacle: “it’s the most boring subject on earth“.
AIT a failure – “for hard-core lefties”
Other interesting comments Olson makes include his belief that Al Gore’s AIT was only successful because of his personality, but that “the same movie starring any NASA scientist would have lost money” and that “there was almost no narrative structure to it. It failed to tell an interesting and compelling story.”
All in all, Olson says the film was mostly for “hard-core lefties” and that he was told by a movie distributor: “no more environmental documentaries!” Too bad DiCaprio didn’t listen.
“Skeptics spun circles around the climate crowd”

In the interview Olson also believes that the skeptics have been very successful in their “all-out assault” on “the brand” and says that in 2009 with “Climate Gate” the skeptics “spun circles around the climate crowd“.
So boring “it makes a robot want to commit suicide”
The major problem with climate science, Olson seems to say, is that it is so damn boring: In the interview he describes papers on tree rings as follows as “boredom so purified and crystalized it’s in an unadulterated form that could make even a robot want to commit suicide.”
Overall Olson thinks it’s over and it’s too late: “the brand has been ruined” and tha the only thing that could resuce it is that the story be told by “media people, professional storytellers, actors, etc.” 
Not sure what Olson is getting at here. Haven’t movie distributors just made it clear that no one is interested in climate stories?
In summary the climate issue is boring people to death. As a result it’s going to be awfully damn tough to get people to listen to a dead-boring story for the hundredth time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a segment of the press conference video of COP 19 from CFACT.

Verna from the UK Youth Climate Coalitions is stunned how anyone could doubt the global warming religion, asking the panel, “How you can sleep at night?” Clearly the young lady has never read the science and refuses to be aware that there are lots of skeptics among the 97% who believe man is causing (to some extent) global warming, but reject there’s a problem. There’s no consensus among the consensus. Her only rebuttal? A childish: “Like, everything you said is BS…how can you sleep at night?”
“Just fine,” the panel reassured her – because the data show CO2 has been overblown and there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years.
I thought the question was handled very well by the panel. The question the young lady really needed to ask was how can anyone sleep at night knowing energy is being priced beyond what poor people can pay…24,000 high energy related deaths in UK alone last winter. 600,000 people in Germany alone are having their power turned off every year because it has become a expensive luxury.
You can watch the whole video here.
I thought Marc Morano should have stuck to more scientific results, and avoided the political aspects. But then again, I’m not familiar with the kind of environment they have to contend with at the Warsaw Conference. I guess it’s more politics than science.
Walter Cunningham did a good job on explaining how science works, and that the AGW theory is in deep trouble. Cunningham speaks of an “absence of supporting data…their climate models have never successfully predicted anything“.
In Germany, not sure about the rest of Europe, there really hasn’t been that much reporting on COP 19; it’s a stale, worn out issue. The enthusiasm is gone and the activists know it. That’s why they’ve become so shrill. It’s the last ditch effort to get a little attention.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman meteorologist Dominik Jung has a commentary today at his wetternet.de site where he looks at the Atlantic Gulf Stream. The commentary is titled: “Is the Gulf Stream Now Losing Its Steam?”
Over the last few days Central Europe has been enjoying almost summerlike temperatures as a weather system is drawing warm air from Mediterranean to the south. But this  of course is a temprrfary weather situation and things will soon be cooling off.
There have been a number of signs pointing to another cold winter, and meteorologist Jung today points to yet another: a disrupted Gulf Stream.
The Gulf Stream is a powerful, warm Atlantic ocean current that originates at the tip of Florida and pumps warm water along the eastern coastlines of the North America and across the Atlantic over to Europe, thus keeping the north of the old continent relatively warmer in the wintertime.
Jung shows two charts of the Gulf Stream, which I’ve placed side-by-side. The left one from 14 October 2012 and the right one a year later from 14 October 2013.

Jung describes the charts as follows:
One year ago off the coast of North America there was a strong continuous current which one could describe as quite healthy. From Florida and along the entire coast of North America the current speed was more or less uniformly high.
But compared to 2012 this year’s Gulf Stream shows a considerably disrupted flow. Already at the coast of North America the speed breaks down considerably compared to last year (see red arrow). At some places the speed is down to one half.”
So could this have an impact on Europe’s coming winter? Jung thinks this is a real possibility. He continues:
For now it is not clear what exactly the origin of the flow speed anomaly is. Of course the Gulf Stream remains intact and is not interrupted – an interruption would undoubtedly be fatal for our climate [in Europe]. In any case the flow has reduced considerably and thus the transport of heat to Europe has been considerably throttled, and that right before the coming start of winter. Never over the last 5 years has the Gulf Stream along North America been so weak as it is at this time of the year.
That could be another sign for an unusually colder than normal winter.”
It would be interesting to see what other meteorologists have to say on this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter a record five consecutive colder-than-normal winters, this year’s 2013/14 German meteorological winter (DJF) is coming in as a mild one, reports Germany’s DWD Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service) here.
This will be the first winter in 6 years that has been above the long-term mean, calculated for the reference period 1981-2010.
According to German weather statistics as of February 15, 2014 the DWD writes:
The summary thus far of this meteorological winter shows that the mean temperature across German was about 2.6°C. The average for the reference period of the years 1961 to 1990 is only 0.2°C, which means the current level is 2.4°C warmer. The current winter will likely be in the Top 10 warmest winters since 1881, as we reported here yesterday.”
The DWD provides a link to a page with the following chart:

The DWD writes that the 2013/14 winter likely will not make it into the Top 3 (1975, 1990 and 2007), unless an unusual warm spell takes hold for the remainder of the month.
The latest forecasts show that the mild weather will continue, thanks to the latest in a long series of low pressure systems moving in from the Atlantic which have that have pumped plenty of mild maritime air over Europe during much of the winter.
Overall, German winters over the last 20 years have been trending significantly cooler, contradicting climate models.
The chart above also shows that after the unusually warm winters, cold ones followed immediately or just a couple of years later. So don’t export this year’s surplus road salt over to the US just yet!

Share this...FacebookTwitterSWR German Public radio had a segment today featuring the warmist director at Germany’s Ministry of Environment, Harry Lehmann, climate scientist Hans von Storch and Spiegel science reporter Axel Bojanowski.
LISTEN HERE IN GERMAN
What follows is my report on the segment.
SWR moderator Gábor Paál says right at the outset regarding the 15-year global warming stop, “Climate science is no longer certain like it was a few years earlier“.
Hans von Storch (HvS) says from 0:52 to 2:21 that the temperature has not developed like the models said it would, saying that there could be several explanations for that: 1) could be just a grand coincidence, 2) the models have gotten natural variations all wrong, 3) it could be that CO2’s assumed climate sensitivity is somewhat exaggerated, and 4) it could be that there is another factor out there that we never considered, like the sun. HvS adds that he sees himself and his fellow scientist “as hard pressed to explain what’s going on” and that this is so because “climate science is so highly politicized and because we have colleagues who claim things with great certainty that later turn out to be not so certain.”
At the 2:30 mark the warmist Ministry of Environment Dr. Harry Lehmann is asked if all the uncertainty is a problem for him. He responds with “yes and no“, and claims that there is a 90-95% certainty that there is manmade climate change and that policymakers have to act as a precaution. Surprisingly he admits that there has been a warming stop and that the models were wrong and that more research is necessary. But he insists climate protection measures are still necessary as before.
At the 3:50 mark geologist and Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski explains that the uncertainty in climate science is indeed headline news and that today there is an overdue need to discuss these uncertainties, which was something the media neglected in the past.
At the 4:42 mark on whether the oceans may be responsible, von Storch says that “this could be an explanation” but that the main problem is the models are failing to show what we are now observing. Hans von Storch states in no uncertain terms that climate scientists have not been taking the scientific approach of examining all potential hypotheses. Instead some climate scientists are motivated by certain special interests, and are choosing the hypothesis that best suits their needs, and are thus choking off real science. HvS adds: “We need to take the time to formulate the various hypotheses and to sort them out. This is going to take some time. And that may be inconvenient for the political business.” He adds in response to Fritz Vahrenholt’s The Neglected Sun book that “the sun is a candidate that needs to be checked over.”
At the 8:19 mark HvS makes his displeasure with politics clear in no uncertain terms. “As a scientist. I tell policymakers absolutely nothing. Politics does not result from science. Activists like to claim that it does.” Lehmann responds by claiming that politicians are obligated to act as a precaution based on the best science at hand so that the human species can survive in 15 years or 100 years time.
On the upcoming IPCC AR5, Bojanowski says that except for the sea level rise projection being pushed up, little has changed from AR4. On the 95% certainty that man is responsible for the climate change, Bojanowski says flat out: “This is naturally not a scientific number, but a number that was voted on by a few scientists” and this figure is based on very shaky ground.
Lehmann says that the deficiencies in the AR4 have since been resolved, but HvS is unconvinced, saying “that remains to be seen” and that the IPCC report is still vulnerable to activist scientists who fancy themselves as planet rescuers – there’s nothing in place to prevent that type of a conflict of interest. Bojanowski adds that the improvements to the IPCC process have only been partially implemented and that there is still a big problem with transparency and that we are still “dealing with a very difficult construct that we need to be critical of.”
At the 15:00 mark Bojanowski is asked about whether or not the 15-year pause is going to be mentioned in the upcoming summary report, to which he responds that this is being hotly disputed. HvS reminds Lehmann that especially he, as a director in the Environment Ministry, really needs to know about the 15-year pause and what the implications of this are for the future. It really needs to be mentioned. Lehmann insists: “Even though the models failed to foresee the 15- years pause, they do show that the climate change is man-made“. At this point HvS sits Lehmann down and schools him, reminding him: “Models don’t show climate change is man-made, data do. Not the models!” Von Storch adds that right now the models are not adequate for projecting the future because they only look at increased CO2 concentrations and not a host of other factors. At this point, HvS is tearing poor Lehmann apart, getting close to humiliating the poor environment director.

HvS goes on to explain to listeners that climate is “horribly complex matter” and that there are just so many variables that are poorly understood, citing clouds, aerosols and that the oceans are not even close to being modeled adequately. He says he expects research to yield surprises here.
Later there’s much discussion about the 2°C target. HvS tells listeners that it’s a political number that gladly gets used by politicians and activist scientists, and that it is not a scientific one. HvS advocates regions and countries developing their own adaptation strategies and that a centralized IPCC is not really what’s needed. Local regions know better what needs to be done to adapt to local climate changes. HvS advocates reductions in CO2, but what’s affordable for each area.
The discussion drags on for awhile about the effectiveness and value of the IPCC. Bojanowski mentions again that the IPCC process is far from transparent and that too much is taking place behind closed doors. This is not how science is supposed to be.
HvS believes a good scientific report includes both consensus and dissent. The IPCC strives only for the “best science”, and how does on differentiate between good and bad science? The exclusion of dissent is not the idea.
At the 32-minute mark, moderator Paál brings up the notorious brochure/ that Lehmann’s office published in May, which singled out and pilloried dissenting scientists and journalists. Paál correctly points out the brochure’s one-sidedness and asks why it failed to discuss the obvious uncertainties, and claimed the science was settled. “Why can’t your Ministry truthfully deal with the uncertainties?” But Lehmann insisted it does deal with uncertainties and that it serves as an information guide for the citizens. Paál: “But like I said, there was nothing about the warming phase in it“. Lehmann here shamelessly tries to weasel out, claiming that the warming pause discussion started only 2 years ago.
Concerning the brochure’s infamous pillory of skeptic journalists and scientists, Lehmann also tries to deny that they were pilloried. Hans von Storch immediately shot back “Yes they certainly were pilloried“. Again Lehmann tried to deny the brochure’s one-sidedness. Bojanowski interjected, saying “the brochure was not balanced” and he wonders what business is it for a federal ministry to “warn the public of certain journalists“.
Paál asks Lehmann if the federal Environment Ministry is more cozy with some institutes (like the Potsdam Institute) than with others. HvS answers: “Certainly”. Lehmann shamelessly denies that, too. Unbelievable. Then Lehmann flat out lies about his ties and function in support organizations of the Potsdam Institute.
On the subject of media quality, HvS feels the print media has been doing a good job on reporting climate, but that television leaves much less to be desired, saying some outlets are too focused on catastrophic images and alarmism. He also senses a public that is growing weary of the topic, that they are losing interest, and no longer want to be bothered with the dubious predictions of global downfall.
In then end von Storch sums up saying: “If the warming pause continues another five years, then perhaps our understanding of climate was more faulty than we thought.”
If this 45-minute SWR German public radio discussion was meant to be a debate, Lehmann lost it big time, at times looking foolish and lacking understanding of climate science. HvS definitely looked like he lost patience with the politicization of climate science. Bojanowski overall made a good impression of a careful and balanced science journalist who understood the material at hand.
German readers are invited to listen to and comment on the SWR interview.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I would like to debunk the claim that we have to act now because there’s a “97% consensus”.
In debates I keep hearing the claim that “97% of scientists agree” on global warming science and thus, with such an overwhelming consensus, taking action is a no-brainer. For example Hollywood actor and college dropout George Clooney recently parroted the argument that if 97 of 100 doctors recommend a procedure and 3% don’t who are you going to listen to?
Would you listen to the 97 if you knew they had been wrong for 16 years and the remaining 3 had been right all along?
First of all, this “97%” of all climate scientists agree on global warming is bogus to begin with, and is based on a faulty paper by John Cook and Dana Nuccitelli. read here and here.
So in climate science and policy, should we listen to the “97%” and act now? Or should we listen to the outlier 3% fringe group? The answer to that question is: Don’t listen to the winner of the popular vote, rather listen to the group that is right. And it turns out that the “97%” have been wrong for the last 16 years and the 3% minority have been right.
97% have been wrong for 16 years
Let’s look at the models coming from the “97% consensus” and see how they are doing compared to the real observed data. Here’s a plot by Dr. Roy Spencer:

Source: www.drroyspencer.com/
Almost all the models from the “97%” have been flat out wrong.

But isn’t Dr. Roy Spencer one of those deniers? Don’t we need to look at a really objective source like the IPCC? Next is a chart from an early, untampered draft of the IPCC 5AR, with additional information from Dr. Ira Glickstein:

Source: wattsupwiththat.com/. “IPCC AR5 draft figure 1-4 with animated central Global Warming predictions from FAR (1990), SAR (1996), TAR (2001), and AR5 (2007).” Graphic by Dr. Ira Glickstein.
Once again we see the models from the “97%” have all been wrong.
There are other charts out there, and they all tell us the same story: The models have been wrong from the first day.
Observed data show that the 3% are right
Even the IPCC’s own chart shows that the models from the 97%” have all overstated future warming.
The next time someone uses the consensus argument, ask him/her if we should believe the 97% who are wrong, or the 3% who are proven right.
Science is not decided by a show hands. If that’s how science had been done in the past, then man would still be walking on four limbs. Science moves by one voice showing the consensus is wrong.

“Would you say the Antarctic has less ice than it used to?”
From NBC’s Meet The Press.
Er, Bill, that graphic you’re holding up is one of the Arctic, and not the Antarctic. Nye doesn’t even know north from south!
And concerning global sea ice, today it is at near normal levels. Nye cherry-picking the single data-point of September 2012 at the single location of the Arctic is not a persuasive argument – never mind him using the wrong chart.
Finally, I’ve never seen an issue with so much consensus be so hotly disputed. Why is that so? It is because, obviously, the claimed climate consensus is a complete myth.
I would have taken both Nye and Gregory apart with half of my regular average brain tied behind my back.

The planned speakers include renowned scientists like Richard Lindzen, Henryk Svensmark and Nir Shaviv. Complete program and info here.

Also among the distinguished speakers are geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning (above), co-author of the book “The Neglected Sun” and co-publisher of the German skeptic climate science site Die kalte Sonne.
Recently I had the chance to get some of his insights on the climate issue. First question I asked was why he thought there has been a pause in global warming. He believes the answer is the combination of the downward phase of ocean cycles and lower solar activity, and he expects the plateau or a drop to continue until the 2030s. It is not a surprise that the oceans are now ‘eating heat’, he says.

Lüning then says it’s pretty clear that the global climate of the last 1000 years has been primarily driven by solar activity and ocean cycles and that “the body of evidence supporting this is massive and overwhelming”.
Dr. Lüning has not been very impressed by the IPCC climate models (97% of them have markedly overestimated the projected warming) and I asked him if he thought the models were getting better with time as we keep hearing that they are being “fine-tuned”. Dr. Lüning doesn’t believe so. “They continue to overestimate CO2 and volcanoes and seriously underestimate solar and ocean cycles.” On CO2 climate sensitivity, he thinks a doubling will lead to a temperature increase of only 1.0 to 1.5°C.
I also asked him about energy policy in Germany and the news that an expert commission recently concluded that the German Energiewende has been extremely costly and ineffective and thus if he thought a slowdown in Germany’s renewable energy sector was ahead? He answered: “Yes. Very likely. We cannot risk losing competitiveness altogether. Now is a good moment to correct the direction.”
Finally I asked what message he wished to convey at the EIKE conference:
Study the climate of the past to identify the processes that influence today’s and tomorrow’s climate.”
And with that I’d say you can expect to see an exciting scientific presentation by Dr. Lüning, and from all the other speakers for that matter, at the 7th EIKE Climate Conference in Mannheim next month.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Voice of Russia today has a report titled Scottish in fear of bad weather more than terrorism. At first I thought it was about just another twisted survey to give the impression that people fear global warming climate change and the extremes it’s supposedly brings.
But when you actually read the report, you quickly discover what Scots are really far more worried about: brutal winters!
The Voice of Russia writes (my emphasis):
Nearly half of Scottish people are afraid of being clobbered by an ‘extreme weather’ emergency this winter season… . Concern has been mounting over power and water cuts, and Scots are in fear of being stuck in vehicles or trains in blizzard-like conditions.”
Here we see that the report is talking about ice-age-like winter conditions! The kind that climate scientists, like David Viner, said we’d rarely ever see again in the future.
Today 49% of Scots fear the coming winter this year. Last year the figure was 38%. Alarm over cold winters is rising rapidly.
So why are Scots getting ever more scared of brutal winters in times of purported warming?
The answer is because it hasn’t been warming at all in Europe over the last years. If anything winters have been getting harsher, more dangerous and are completely the opposite of what Europeans were told to prepare for a few years ago.

The Voice of Russia writes that Scots have fresh memories of brutal, life-threatening winter conditions (again my emphasis):

‘Severe weather can strike quickly and at any time of year. In March, we saw the impact of severe snowstorms on communities in Arran, Kintyre and Dumfries and Galloway,’ Transport minister Keith Brown said and added, ‘So whether it is making your home energy efficient, protecting your pipes, packing an emergency kit for the car or looking out for vulnerable neighbors, we can all play our part in helping Scotland get ready for winter.'”

Does this sound like people getting ready for global warming?
It also appears that Scottish citizens are losing faith in their energy supply.
It has been estimated that 28 percent experienced some delay in their gas, water, or electricity in the past year. In rural areas the percentage was much higher, at 41 percent.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media today are raving over Angela Merkel’s “huge victory“, with some even calling it “historic” or even a “blowout”, as Drudge does.
But this isn’t so by any means. Merkel’s government LOST and will soon no longer be in power. The perception of media outlets from Great Britain and in the USA surely has been distorted by a dense fog across the English Channel and the Atlantic. Merkel’s government was defeated. Her current government failed to get the votes needed to continue.
Somewhere along the line Merkel forgot that her government was a team effort and involved other team players. Although her party scored lots of goals and made spectacular plays that wowed the viewers, her team lost. She is the MVP, but on the losing team.
Typical of Merkel: when the going gets tough, she abandons her partners, throws them under the bus, but not without first giving them a swift, hard kick to the face. Had Merkel’s CDU/CSU party received a scant half a percent of the vote less and her junior FDP a scant half a percent more, her government would be sitting firmly in power today. But no, Merkel and her players insisted on being stars and abandoned their team mates. This is going to come back around soon enough.
We saw the same pattern when she ditched Germany’s nuclear power in the wake of Fukushima, and later when she brutally threw Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen under the bus after his disastrous CDU election defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia. Immediately Röttgen resigned his position as head of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and on 16 May 2012 he was fired by Merkel and replaced by Peter Altmaier as the Federal Minister for Environment.
So in the aftermath of yesterday’s elections, what’s left is superstar Merkel on a defeated team searching for a new coalition partner. Now it’s her turn to beg.

Merkel’s CDU/CSU party only has two options: 1) form a coalition with rival socialist SPD party, or 2) try to forge a coalition with the hostile Greens.
Should the runner-up SPD party agree to form a coalition with Merkel’s CDU/CSU, then look for such a government that will try to force through the “Energiewende” (transition to renewables) with renewed vigor. Her previous liberal, business-friendly FDP party was the only element in German politics who to some extent applied the emergency brakes on the out of control renewable energy subsidies and feed-in tariffs. An SPD coalition partner will surely let up on the brakes, if not completely abandon them. A huge, almost two thirds majority CDU/SPD government would practically allow them to ram through any energy policy desired.
Should the Greens agree to form a coalition with Merkel’s party, a very unlikely scenario, but not one that can be excluded with the opportunistic Merkel, then the Energiewende gas pedal would surely get pushed to the metal.
With the FDP liberal coalition partner gone and licking its wounds, there is nothing left (except a fleeting chance to some rationality) in place to slow down the Energiewende and climate policy.
There is one other remaining possibility: both the Greens and SPD will refuse to form a coalition with Merkel’s conservatives. That would leave superstar Merkel without a team to lead, and wishing she had not thown the FDP under the wheels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Telegraph here has the story about what was in my eyes one of the most abhorrent crimes ever committed by science…in this case the chemical castration of a brilliant mathematician and war hero only because his sexual preference went against what was considered the moral, psychiatric, medical and scientific consensus of the time, i.e. homosexuality was criminal and an act of miscreants. Homosexuals were viewed as a threat to society and thus had to be subjected to mind and body altering treatments. Scientists at the time all agreed and said it was necessary.
And people (skeptics) who challenged this “consensus” were immediately labeled immoral and were ridiculed. Sound familiar?
History is filled with many other similarly horrific examples…some very recent: lobotomy and eugenics to name just two. Others include human sacrifices to appease angry gods, or the burning of witches at the stake for storm-brewing. All were sanctioned by consensus.
These are the kinds of things that happen when science runs completely amok.
Today we have an elitist group claiming that global warming/climate-weirding is the consensus of the science and anyone who disagrees is equal to being a “Holocaust denier” and is immoral, or just plain ignorant.
Some zealots have even called for “Nuremburg-type trials” for the criminal “bastards who deny global warming”. Indeed an elitist group of green supremacists and political leaders are calling for global society to undergo an energy-lobotomy, one that would leave our global economy and society in a vegetable state.
Whenever the medical and science professions start appealing to the authority of consensus, then think back to the horrors this invariably has led to countless times in the past. History is filled to the brim!
Their claims to consensus only mean they are completely in the dark.

Not only climate science seems to have been corrupted by unscrupulous scientists, but so has the food and nutritional sciences in what appears to be in a way that immensely benefits Big Pharma and swindles the consumer. Hat-tip DirkH

“You need to get scientists that are not paid by the drug companies to determine what the cholesterol guidelines should be”.

Not long ago I did a report on a study showing that meat-eaters are much healthier than vegetarians – coming from the University of Graz in Austria. I didn’t expect the story to attract so much attention. So far it has been shared over 8000 times and may reach 10,000 shares. The study contradicts everything we’ve been told about what a healthy diet is.

I used to have a lot of respect for the scientific community. But the more I look into things like climate, and now nutrition and medicine, the more I’m realizing that much of it is rotten to the core and has long been overrun by greedy, swindling bastards who crave money and/or power.
My advice: Don’t trust any of today’s “renowned scientists” claiming the science is settled. Chances are they are profiting at the expense of others.

In a nutshell: they are a threat to the cozy establishment.
Last September the AfD party barely missed reaching the 5% hurdle in Germany’s national elections, and thus just missed taking seats in Parliament. Some claim the results were tampered with in order to keep the enfant terrible party out. No matter the result, the party did send a clear message, and it continues to send such messages today.
In it’s latest press release, the AfD announces its position on Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act, calling for its abolishment.
The energy summit last Tuesday at the federal Chancellor’s Office missed its targets. The planned, low-impact slowdown in the expansion of wind and solar was softened considerably using tricks. The rise in the renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) subsidies will continue to gallop on ahead unhindered, so concluded even a proponent of the transition to renewable energies, Holger Krahwinkel, of the consumer associations. Share prices of wind energy plant builder Nordex at times shot up by 7%.
‘The EEG charges is driving the electricity costs dramatically upwards,’ explains Dr. Alexander Gauland, spokesman for the Alternative für Deutschland. ‘Already they are among the highest in Europe. Since the start of the EEG act, the payments made by power grid operators to the owners of renewable energy plants have totaled to be more than 120 billion euros – paid by the consumers. Just in 2013 the figure was 23 billion euros – the tendency is strongly upwards.’
Gauland summarizes: ‘That’s why every ‘correction’ or ‘reform’ amounts only to a senseless doctoring of the symptoms. The cost burden on the German consumer is already very immense and is no longer bearable for more than 600,000 households. At the same time more industrial jobs are moving to cheaper foreign countries. That number is already tens of thousands, and also here the trend is strongly upwards. This is why the AfD is requesting the immediate abolishment of the EEG act. It has made this request an official position in its European election program.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a first and quite possibly a watershed event when it comes to media sentiment towards green energies. It appears it’s no longer taboo in Germany to mock green energy.
In the past German public television and mainstream media always kept the wagons circled around the anthropogenic global warming theory and the Energiewende (transition from fossil fuels and nuclear power over to renewable energies). Now it is becoming the butt of jokes and surprisingly sharp satire on late-night German comedy shows.
)
Last Friday ZDF German television (Germany’s version of the BBC) launched a blistering parody at the now collapsing Energiewende. The German government obstinately refuses to acknowledge that it is a monumental failure and will never work. Late-night comedian Oliver Welke openly calls the Energiewende a religion: “All you have to do is believe.”
When ZDF television mocks the project, then you know it’s in very serious trouble.
The parody stems from Angela Merkel’s grand coalition government’s refusal to accept the findings of an expert commission who gives the Energiewende project a grade of “F-minus”. Welke openly asks if Angela Merkel’s Grosse Koalition (grand coalition) government – abbreviated GroKo – formed with Sigmar Gabriel’s center-left SPD Social Deomcrat party “has gone nuts” after refusing to listen to the advice of the experts.
At the 0:57 mark, Welke reiterates the findings of the commission: “The green power subsidy is causing the power price to go up and leads to less climate protection.” Adding at the 1:17  mark: “Why are they doing that? It’s totally illogical.”
Albrecht Humboldt joins Welke in the parody, confirming at the 1:28 mark that the Energiewende makes no sense but that this is all beside the point. It is something “you just have to believe in! The Energiewende works only if we all really believe in it!” he proclaims sarcastically.
At the 1:47 mark Welke demonstrates to the audience just how nuts the Energiewende has become:
Last year every German forked out €240 for green power fees…babies, seniors, every German. A total of 21.8 billion euros for power that on the market has a value of only €2 billion. That’s sick!”

This quality of criticism Welke aims at the Energiewende in Germany is unprecedented in sharpness and cynicism for mainstream media. The wheels the green-energy wagon are truly coming off in Europe. The green-energy dream is in irreversible collapse.
The remainder of the harsh parody mocks the Energiewende as a religion that requires full faith from its followers. Though the brunt of the jokes is aimed at the GroKo (grand coalition government) the real target is the Energiewende and the policy of early retirement at age 63.
At the 4:25 mark Tina Hausten sarcastically tells the audience:
Stop questioning the policies. Thinking about them just gives you a headache! Just pay and be happy!”
To which everyone responds by singing: “Oh happy days!”
At 4.29 Welke says: “This new GroKo sect is starting to scare me!”
At the very end at the 6:10 mark Welke makes it official:
Yes, so the GroKo is now officially deemed a religion.”
I’ve prepared a rough transcript of the entire parody in English and have sent it over to Hajo Smit at Climategate.nl here, who will add English subtitles to above video.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s much ballyhooed Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) was supposed to show the whole world how switching over to green energy sources could reduce CO2 emissions, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, provide cheap electricity to citizens, and heroically rescue the planet.

Australia’s Tony Abbott says the hell with market-distorted, expensive, unreliable, poor-to-rich capital redistribution machine green energies. Cites German failure as reason to abandon them. Photo credit: MystifyMe Concert Photography (Troy) – Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
Ten years later, the very opposite has happened: Germany’s CO2 emissions have been increasing, electricity prices have skyrocketed, the green jobs bubble has popped, and tens of thousands of jobs have disappeared. Worse: tens of billions are being redistributed from the poor to the rich.
Other countries around the world have noticed and are thus having serious second thoughts about industrializing their landscapes with green energy systems like wind, solar and biogas. Germany has proven that green energy does not work well after all.
Spiegel reports here how Australia’s conservative government led by Tony Abbott is now using Germany’s failure as one of the main arguments for getting out of green energies and getting back to affordable and reliable coal power.
Spiegel, perturbed by Abbot’s direction, writes of his doing away with the CO2 emissions trading scheme and his plans to abolish the CO2 tax. Australian industry has been burdened by a 15 euro per tonne CO2 tax while in Europe it is only 5 euros. Spiegel writes:

The prices for raw materials are crumbling, auto manufacturers Ford and Holden, a GM arm, have announced plans to close factories. Mining companies such as BHPBilliton are rethinking their expansion plans. ‘The Australians have their backs up against the wall,’ says Heribert Dieter, expert at the Science and Policy Foundation in Berlin.”
What’s especially embarrassing for German greens and the green media like Spiegel is that countries around the world are now citing Germany’s failure in marshaling through the Energiewende as a reason to abandon the green path. Germany is showing the world how not to produce energy.
In Germany the mad rush to green energies has led to skyrocketing electricity costs, crony capitalism, massive redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich, and an unstable power supply. Moreover, energy-intensive companies are exempted from paying the green energy feed-in surcharges, and thus leaving the lowly consumers to foot the entire bill.
One German mid-size company I know in the local area covered its sprawling factory roof with thousands of square feet of solar panels and today sells the solar energy produced to power companies at an exorbitant price (approx. $0.50/kwh). Then, to power its factory, the company turns around and buys the very same power at a fraction of the price (roughly $0.20/kwh). What’s really perverse is that the same company is also exempt from paying the green energy feed-in surcharge, because it claimed excessive hardship from its “energy-intensive” manufacturing operations and associated energy costs. Twisted and distorted or what!
In summary: Germany’s energy market has been transformed into a grotesque market distortion and redistribution of wealth scheme from the poor to the rich. Abbott is absolutely right not to go down this socially and politically dubious path.
Spiegel sniffs that Abbott has simply brushed aside all the criticism from environmental organisations being fired his way. Spiegel writes “quotes translated from the German):
The premier does not let himself be misled, and reminds everyone that in Germany the costs for the Energiewende have exploded. The country that was once a model is now a dissuasive example. “We can’t afford to follow Germany’s example,” Ron Boswell, Senator of the state of Queensland is quoted as saying in ‘The Australian’. Because of its expansion of renewable energy sources, Germany has the highest energy prices in the world. “We would be better off learning from the United States,’ Boswell believes. There energy is about three times cheaper than in Australia.”

I particularly like the following he said:

The problem for the climate scientists is that they have got nothing left but anecdotes and witch-hunting. They are exposing themselves as charlatans. In essence, Krauthammer is calling the whole thing a scam.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe purpose of the House Climate Change Hearing is to shed light on the question of: How much is man contributing to climate change, and how responsible is Obama’s energy policy?
So far the skeptics feel that the hearing has been successful in communicating their case to the public. The office of Rep. David McKinley P.E. (photo right) has distributed his remarks and graphics on the subject:
– CO2 is undeniably increasing.
– Some scientists and climatologists say their energy models reflect that CO2 levels coincide with temperature increases.
– But here’s a chart with 73 models and actual observations:

Not a single climate model has been correct so far. Warming has been minor. 
– Temperatures have been at a virtual standstill for the past 40 years while CO2 levels have increased.
– In fact Arctic sea ice has grown 60% despite increased CO2 levels.
– And if that was not enough, the ice surrounding Antarctica is also expanding.
– The United Nations’ reports also indicates that “most experts believe that by 2083, the benefits of climate change may still outweigh the harm.”

Chart provided by the office of DAVID B. MCKINLEY, P.E.
McKinley adds “that even if the U.S. stopped all its coal-fired power plants, CO2 levels would be reduced by merely two tenths of one percent globally” and that “the Obama Administration fails to tell the American people that 96% of emitted annually occurs naturally“. Also Obama does not tell us that its proposed regulations “would cast hundreds of thousands of workers out of work” while doing nothing noticeable for the environment.

Rep. McKinley also says “the rest of the world is not listening to the President’s energy policy” and that “China, India, Russia and Europe are all expanding their use of coal“.
Ensuring affordable energy to the poor is a moral imperative
Worse, McKinley points out that Obama’s proposed policy will hurt the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet:
Nations struggling to come out of poverty will continue to suffer, lives will be lost and children will be sick and perish as a result of the President’s support on this policy.”
McKinley adds that “one of the biggest moral responsibilities for the United States should be help emerging nations out of poverty” and that this can be done using “the most abundant and affordable source of power: coal“. Access to affordable energy is absolutely essential.
McKinley asks citizens:
Please take this message back to your agencies: This President must not prevent people around the globe from obtaining affordable, dependable energy; and threatening American workers and businesses with the loss of affordable energy from coal and natural gas is not an acceptable energy policy. Crushing America’s economy to reduce CO2 by 0.2% is an abuse of this Administration’s authority.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat would be the appropriate thing to say about a government that pours a monstrously disproportionate amount of money into an issue no one really cares about, and does so at the huge expense of the very issues that people really do care about? Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne and newnostradamusofthenorth.blogspot.
I’d say it’s just a question of time before serious economic and social instability erupts. It’s a socio-political disaster waiting to happen.
This is precisely the case in Europe. Hundreds of billions of euros are being pumped into environment and “climate protection” which a recent survey clearly shows is not at all the main concern of EU citizens. The survey tells us in no uncertain terms that the essential issues of economics and jobs are being seriously neglected and that the stability of the continent is at serious risk. People are genuinely worried about their jobs and the economy.

In a comprehensive European survey on issues that matter to citizens, climate and environment finished almost dead last, not even making the top 10.
The chart above compares sentiment from last spring to last autumn. Note that despite the IPCC’s dramatized and hyped release of its 5th assessment report last autumn, concern for climate and environment climbed only a mere 1 percent. Even dead cats have much more bounce.
Clearly, economics jobs and prices are far more important for European citizens, as the challenge for citizens to make ends meet are far more real than the abstract computer-generated “climate catastrophe”, which is allegedly due 100 years from now.

Only in the very rich countries do environment and climate have any meaning.
So why does the EU pour so many billions into a non-relevant issue when in some countries, like Greece, societies are on the verge of uprising because of economic hardship? On the surface it makes no sense. But closer examination shows us what happens to a society when its government becomes so irrationally obsessed with an irrelevant issue that it literally puts its existence at risk. Ideology and dogmatism are blind.
More astonishing is that despite the 2-decades long multi-multi billion euro climate campaign and persistent mass media blitz, climate still remains an irrelevant fringe issue. Unless you find yourself in North Korea, it goes to show that brainwashing is not easy to do in today’s decentralized multi-media environment. Mainstream media has lost its influence. The Internet media is playing a more important role then ever.
Another point the survey reveals is that climate is an issue, and only a moderate one at that, in mainly very rich countries where people have nothing better to worry about, e.g. Sweden and Germany. It’s about soothing guilt.
Of course everyone agrees environment is an essential issue. But pouring literally tens of billions into fictitious “climate protection” year after year while neglecting the real, pressing issues is becoming a dangerous game. The observed data do really tell us: the climate catastrophe is nothing more than a computer model-generated hallucination.
Hopefully eurocrats will quickly take the survey results very seriously and acknowledge that their economic problems are truly pressing and that neglecting them further will only increase the risk of serious social consequences and civic instability. The EU is keeping its socioeconomic powder kegs tinder dry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn attempt by a group of climate science skeptics to perhaps bypass climate-science gate-keeping and marginalization used against their scientific hypotheses has taken a turn for the worse, with accusations of “nepotism” within the peer-review process at the PRP journal.
Jo Nova has a new post on the situation, implying that peer-review is a mere formality that’s subject to corruption and that in the end “science is not done by peer or pal review, but by evidence and reason.”
Given the corruption and gate-keeping we’ve seen in climate science over the past 2 decades, We can be glad that we have real data and observations. But even some of those are being massively tampered with. Such is the sad state climate science has devolved to.
Roger Tattersall, one at the centre of the controversy, has reacted to the accusations of peer-review “nepotism” at the PRP journal as follows:
Pierre, thanks for adding the links. Martin Rasmussen’s excuse for shutting down the journal have shifted from “PRP was never meant to be a platform for climate sceptics.” to “the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis, which we regard as malpractice”
This grubby accusation remains a vague and unsubstantiated smear. The Handling Editor, Nils-Axel Morner is mystified, and has made an official complaint to the EGU, which publishes many journals through Copernicus. We await developments. Meanwhile, lukewarmer website Wattsupwiththat has rushed to judgement, finding the editors of the PRP special edition, myself included, guilty. Watts has emailed me to say I am ‘now a Pariah’. Mother nature will be our judge, when in due course she shows whether our dynamical model, which successfully hindcasts 1000 years of solar variation, remains on course or not in the future. Experimentum summas judex – Albert Einstein.”
I can certainly understand the frustration on the part of some scientists with regards to the known pal-review corruption and gate-keeping at some renowned journals and at the IPCC, and the overall difficulties encountered to get alternative views out. And God knows the hostile environment skeptics in Germany have had to deal with. Yet I agree with the expectation that the ethics of peer-review process must be upheld and lived by on all sides. There’s no other way.
But on the other hand, let’s not forget that peer-review is not the universal Stamp of Final Truth and that the real test is time and scrutiny. As I said, damn good thing we have data and observations.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Resonator, the research podcast of the German Helmholtz Research Group conducted a long interview (1 hr 40 min!) with climate scientist Hans von Storch director of the GKSS Research Center. In the interview von Storch was asked about his views on a wide variety of climate science related issues.
Hat-tip: klimazwiebel.
Overall the interview saw a Hans von Storch who spoke frankly and openly. Some of the remarks he made raised my eye brows. In general von Storch, best described as a non-alarmist warmist, views the climate debate as being dominated by the more extreme positions from both sides, with voices in the middle getting drowned out. He levels a fair amount of criticism at the climate science community, but does so without naming any persons in particular.
Due to the sheer length of the interview, I will only look at the points that I found interesting and relevant as skeptic.
Scientists too quick to accept dramatic scenarios
At the 15-minute mark von Storch describes a science that is so politicized with both sides are trying to make it black and white, and a debate that has been overly shrill. Some scientists, he says, have tended to accept dramatic scenarios and consequences even when there’s little evidence behind them. He also talks of a group of scientists who fancy themselves as the ultimate authority and who have the last word. All the exaggerations and projections of doom, gloom and disaster have led to an overall discrediting of the field.
“Science and Nature are pretty bad journals”
At the 29-minute mark von Storch says he sees himself as someone who needs a lot of time before he is convinced of anything. I was surprised to hear him call both Science and Nature “pretty bad journals” when it comes to the quality of their articles. Hans von Storch cites an article published by Science claiming that the climate was going to tip in the year 2047, calling the report “a real doozy“. He says that science journals must remain sufficiently critical and not let themselves get caught up with the zeitgeist. Von Storch admits that he has not always been popular among the community.
Overall von Storch doesn’t blame the media much for the hysteria, implying that the hysteria stems more from scientists communicating poorly. The media are only interpreting what the scientists are spewing. Projections of snowless winters, for example, were hardly helpful in lending credibility to climate science.
Scientists dramatizing for attention and prestige

At the 37-minute mark von Storch believes some scientists succumbed to drama in order to get attention and prestige, and says that the such are only damaging the credibility of climate science.
Models too CO2-centric
At the 40-minute mark von Storch discusses possible reasons why the warming has stalled and thinks other explanations need to be examined, such as solar activity and aerosols. He finds climate models too CO2-centric in general. Here he appeals for more patience to let the science unfold.
At the 45 minute mark he fires harsh criticism at scientists who promote a society governed by an elite technocracy, calling the idea “stupidity”. He calls the proposals made by a group of scientists in favor of appointing future councils to represent the interests of future generations “peculiar”.
At the 59-minute mark, on whether storms are becoming more frequent and severe, von Storch says he doesn’t think this is the case and that the disasters are more about the over-development of coastal areas.
Hockey stick was “something dumb” – an attempt to steer politics
On the hockey stick chart, at the 63 minute mark, von Storch has some blunt words on how it was possible for it to become the icon it became. He recalls having examined the chart himself and finding it deficient.
I believe it was something dumb by scientists who wanted to steer politics.”
He thinks the climate science community were too quick to call it the last word. Hans von Storch sees critique of the hockey stick and confirmed and that’s why it no longer appears in the IPCC reports. Scientists, von Storch reminds us, should not be so quick to claim absolute truth.
Also, von Storch believes that the oceans could be warming up, but that there is very little data out there to confirm it.

Steve McIntyre here looks at the so-called Oxburgh Panel’s “exoneration”. In his conclusion McIntyre writes (my emphasis):
However, it is evident that the Oxburgh panel did not interview Mann or carry out any of the steps necessary to conduct an investigation of Mann’s work and that they did not provide the wide-ranging ‘exoneration’ asserted in Mann’s pleadings.  Furthermore, public statements by members of the Oxburgh panel on Mann’s work were highly critical and, far from indicating the widespread exoneration claimed by Mann, suggested the opposite. Indeed, Mann himself at the time perceived these opinions as damaging to himself, as he dismissed Hand’s as a ‘rogue opinion’ and unsuccessfully sought an apology from Hand.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe fallout surrounding the profound failures of the climate models used by the IPCC continues. If the German media is anything to go by, then IPCC science is virtually disintegrating before our very eyes.
Europe has always been a bulwark against climate skepticism. No more. The online German ‘Die Welt’ daily reports today that the upcoming IPCC AR5 is a de facto withdrawal of the scientific basis for climate regulation.
Die Welt writes that “global warming is currently advancing considerably more slowly than assumed a few years ago” and has stalled over the last 15 years and that “scientists are unable to explain why“.
Basis for climate regulation crumbles
Die Welt then adds that the failed models and prognoses of the climate scientists will have profound implications for policymakers:
The IPCC results likely not only usher in a small change in the direction of the climate discussion and a retreat from the loudest alarmism, they also withdraw the firm basis of assumptions, which policymakers had considered undisputed for European and national climate regulations.”

Until recently, policymakers had always fallen back on “settled science” to justify painful measures to revamp energy supply. But now that “settled science” is gone. Justifying the vandalism of the landscape with windparks and selling high priced, unstable renewable energies to a skeptical public is about to get a whole lot tougher.
So why hasn’t warming increased as projected earlier? Die Welt writes:
One reason for that, according to the report, is that the calculation of the global warming by carbon dioxide emissions in the computer models was too heavily weighted.”
Already politicians are now calling for a new policy approach with regards to climate policy.
“It is being admitted for the first time that the climate is warming less than predicted,” European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer is quoted by Die Welt. “It’s reason enough to refrain from making emissions trading more strict, to rethink the CO2 targets which are dangerous to the German automotive industry, and to stop further ecological bans of products.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online Spektrum.de science magazine conducted an in-depth interview with two leading international climate scientists, Professor Mojib Latif and Professor Hans von Storch.
For the record, both now concede that global temperatures have indeed defied the vast array of (expensive) model projections and have not gone up in 15 years. Now more than ever before they are forced to concede that the models have been giving CO2 too much weight as a climate driver.
But Latif, who 10 years ago predicted Europe would hardly see snow and frost in the wintertime, now claims that he “isn’t at all surprised in any way by the warming hiatus” (and that all the models have been wrong). To his credit, Latif in the past predicted that ocean cycles needed to be better taken into account and that the warming would pause due to ocean cycles.
Hans von Storch, on the other hand, says he is surprised by the stalled warming: “It hasn’t gotten as warm as we expected. […] We really have to think about whether or not our models can really project the future development.”
Too much complexity and uncertainty
Spektrum then asked if the scientists perhaps overestimated CO2. The warmist Latif admits the following:
There are uncertainties regarding CO2 climate sensitivity. This is stated in the upcoming IPCC report, which summarizes the latest of science and looks at a very broad range. Here it is not appropriate to boil the whole problem down to a single magnitude: the global mean temperature. Rather it is necessary to understand exactly what is happening regionally, how the temperature develops at a location. But we are not yet that far, and perhaps we will never get that far because it is far too complex. This is why I’d prefer not to stay stuck on climate sensitivity.”
Moreover, Die kalte Sonne website here points us to a presentation by Latif. On page 31 he concedes the powerful role played by ocean cycles and concludes:
The most recent decades contain a strong contribution from the AMO (MOC) even on a global scale. This raises questions about the average climate sensitivity of the IPCC models.”

What we have here is a devout warmist, Mojib Latif, conceding that average climate sensitivity of the IPCC is truly under serious question and that nothing is settled after all. Therefore any claims to certainty made in the AR5 will have no credibility whatsoever.
When it comes to the impact of the sun, von Storch warns:
We should not declare this discussion over too soon. When we look at the 20th century, the climate fluctuations cannot be exclusively attributed to CO2 alone or to internal factors. Also the sun naturally played a role. The question is whether or not we correctly quantified it.”
Warming stop may continue until 2025!
Also Spektrum asks how much longer should we expect the warming stop to continue. Latif:
I wouldn’t be surprised if the temperatures remain at a high level until 2020 or 2025.”
That would mean almost 30 years without any warming. That also means the temperature will in 2025 will be 0.6°C below what the models projected. Meanwhile Hans von Storch says he is starting to get nervous:
I would get nervous if the temperature continues to pause more than 5 years more. The we would really need to question our climate models. But I also do not expect a cooling.”
My feeling is that we’ll be checking in 2018. But then again, in five years time both will probably be retired.

Have you gotten a lot of criticism or any threats because of the video?
Indeed the video has brought me a lot of criticism. Some bad articles have been written, some nasty insults have been made, some artists even refused to work with me because of that. Really unbelievable how the massive propaganda works on people’s mind – and especially with this topic the mass media does its best to manipulate the thinking. It’s just too important for too many things – like lots of taxes, many many laws, etc. – to let it go. 
But the reactions were not just bad. Also a lot of listeners have been open to the argumentation, starting to dig right through the mass of information. So the video is doing its job! That’s what I want to reach with my music – to get people to start thinking by themselves and searching for information on their own – not through the filtered television-screen in their living rooms.
Do you feel there are attempts being made to marginalize you?
There have been some attempts to marginalize me – and even today. But it’s not only because of the climate-change music video that has been a part of the whole story. A political rapper has his difficulties because the media either first try to black-out my music or insult me and try to marginalize me before they get to the topics. It’s always the same story – try to discredit the speaker to prevent people from listening to the message.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA flurry of Middle Eastern and Asian news websites are reporting on “unusual” cold sweeping across vast areas of Asia and the Middle East.
The online Thailand pattayamail.com reports “Hundreds of thousands of residents of northern and northeastern Thailand are suffering from the current cold snap, with many areas having been declared disaster zones. […] Some 100,000 people are suffering from the cold and in need of winter clothing. ”
The German language thailand-tip.com reports that the “Meteorological Institute forecasts temperatures in the north to fall another 4 – 7°C by Thursday.”
Snow – in Vietnam!
The Asian Correspondent here writes that residents in North Vietnam “were treated to a rare sight Monday: snow“, writing that “the white stuff” is a “rare sight in this part of the world“.
Not only Southeast Asia is being hard hit by unusually bitter cold, but also vast areas of Central Asia, Middle East, and North Africa. Some of these regions are typically famous for agreeably warm temperatures. The charts on this page are the forecast temperature anomalies for the coming 7 days.
 
Asia to remain gripped by bitter cold. Forecast anomaly for the next 7 days, source: http://wxmaps.org
Warm Arctic causing cold winters in tropics makes no sense
Extreme cold is forecast to hit much of Asia for the next 7 days at least. This should lead us to ask if less sea ice in the Arctic is causing extreme cold all the way down to the tropics, 7000 km away, months later. Over the recent years some scientists defending the global warming hypothesis have suggested that a warm Arctic is causing the rest of the northern hemisphere to see more severe winters.
Animals “literally freezing where they stand”

Also the entire Middle East and parts of Northern Africa are suffering from bitter, wintery conditions. Cairo last week saw its first snowfall in 112 years. Jerusalem saw its worst snowstorm in almost 70 years.

Turkey also has been gripped by severe cold – for weeks. The rocketnews24.com reports: “Turkish cold snap literally freezes animals where they stand.”
Syrian rebel commander freezes to death
In Syria refugee camps are struggling to stay warm. The bitter cold and rare snow have even cost the life of a rebel commander. According to Australian ABC here, “A Syrian rebel commander has frozen to death in the bitter cold brought on by a snowstorm that has swept the country this week. … the body was ‘frozen’.”
Tropical South America stays cool
Even the tropical zone of South America is struggling to stay warm. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast there for the next 7 days as well.

It’s strange how NASA likes to focus on one single region (Siberia), and inflates temperature data there for evidence of warming, and neglects the rest of the planet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems every time Stefan Rahmstorf makes a claim about climate, there’s almost always something very creative and acrobatic about the statistical approach he uses on which to base that claim. Rahmstorf seems to feel very much at home with the climate-Armageddon-theorists at his ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute.
===========================================
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Wringing his hands, Potsdam Climate Impact research Institute’s Stefan Rahmstorf keeps up his efforts to pour cold water on the warming pause. In an article at his Klimalounge blog on November 1, 2013 he posted a chart depicting the September temperatures over the last 130 years, represented by a bold red-colored moving average curve that shows no pause in warming (Figure 1). Rahmstorf has always said: The warming continues unabated.

Figure 1: Global September temperature for the last 130 years. Source: Klimalounge / Stefan Rahmstorf.
But wait, upon closer examination, September temperatures do show a plateau that is already more than 10 years long.
Weather Central Forum contributor DH7FB has taken a close look at the data and discovered where Rahmstorf used tricks to get warmer results. First with curve smoothing, if an especially long smoothing interval is used, then the plateau at the end disappears. Here Rahmstorf uses an enormously long period of more than 30 years without mentioning it in his blog. If one uses a smoothing period that is more common, say 5 years, then the warming pause becomes clearly visible also for September temperatures.

Using 5-year smoothing: light blue curve = September; bold blue mean = June, July, September, bold red = July-December. Source: wzforum.de/forum2/msg-2768981.
And why did Rahmstorf choose September and not some other month? DH7FB made a comparison with other monthly combinations and discovered that the Pinatubo-eruption in June 1991 had a significant impact on September and that it significantly steepened the global September mean value curve.
Reading tip: Take a look at the reader comments at Rahmstorf’s blog. It’s peppered with criticism.
==================================
It should be noted that in his blog article and comments, Rahmstorf repeatedly equates climate skeptics to the Tea Party, “the radical climate skeptical wing of the Republicans” and that “climate skeptic think tanks are financed mainly by the Koch brothers”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIs Cyclone Activity Increasing?
By Ed Caryl
In the aftermath of the sole very strong tropical cyclone we experienced this year, all the catastrophists have since piled on claiming it was all caused by a warming world. They conveniently forget that one of their claims is that the polar regions are warming faster than the tropics. Of course temperature differences are what drive weather.
This is true of both tornadoes and cyclones. If the northern and southern temperate regions are warming faster than the tropics, then temperature differences should be falling, and storms should be decreasing in strength and number, not increasing.
So what is really happening?
Monthly accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) data were downloaded from Ryan Maue’s WeatherBell site here, and cyclone energy was totaled for the years from 1970 to the present. Next average annual cyclone energy was graphed by decade. Figure 1 is the result:

Figure 1 is the annual average Northern and Southern Hemisphere ACE for the decades since 1970 including the partial decade from 2010 to the present. 
Both northern and southern hemisphere ACE increased from the 1970’s through the 1990’s, then decreased after 1999. What were temperatures doing?

Figure 2 is the zonal warm season (May to October) temperature anomalies downloaded from GISS here, for the same five decades as in Figure 1. 
In Figure 2, for the first three decades, the mid-northern and southern latitudes lagged the tropics, warming faster only in the last two periods. If we chart the tropical temperatures minus the northern and southern mid-latitude temperatures, Figure 3 results.

Figure 3 is a chart of tropical temperatures from Figure 2 (from -19° to +19° latitude) minus the temperate zone temperatures from -21° to -45° and +21° to +45° latitude for each decade. The temperature anomalies between the two zones have been declining since 2000, just as ACE has. 
In both hemispheres, ACE follows the temperature difference between the tropics and the temperate zones. Compare Figure 1 and Figure 3. Since 2000, both temperature difference and ACE have been falling. In the southern hemisphere the temperature difference has always been negative, and so not surprisingly ACE has been low. It peaked in n the 1990’s when the temperature difference was highest. If the doomsayers had only looked at the data, they would have known they were wrong.
In fact, the doomsayers should be hollering that lower cyclone activity is real evidence of a warming planet. Of course that would be good news, but the doomsayers just don’t want any of that. No wonder the latest IPCC report claims there’s now data showing a link between extreme weather and warming. There is, but they don’t want you to see it.
What will happen in the future? The trends point to the tropics not warming further, the mid-latitudes continuing to warm, and the poles to cool. The trend is for ACE to decrease. And with the current 15-year warming pause showing no signs of abating, expect cyclone activity to stay at relatively low levels. Good news for every one!
Scream all you want, but the data tell the real story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA miracle may be taking place in Germany! A wave of sanity actually seems to rolling across the land!
Yesterday I wrote how ZDF German television had produced a blistering parody of the country’s renewable energy project – dubbed the Energiewende. Well it seems that message may be even getting through to the country’s top politicians after all. It may be sinking in, really!
At Facebook Germany’s Sigmar Gabriel, Chairman of the socialist SPD Party and Vice Chancellor of Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU-SPD grand coalition government, issued a statement at Facebook announcing that Europe’s industrial competitiveness is indeed in jeopardy because of Germany’s and Europe’s sky high energy prices.
At Facebook he writes (original text above, right):
Germany and all of Europe are facing a huge challenge. The price of electricity in Germany is twice as high as it is in the USA. If we fail to at least provide some relief to our industry, then we are threatened with deindustrialization. This isn’t just crude propaganda from business, but rather it is bitter reality. Indeed here in Europe we have to think about how to reduce the state-induced burdens. I know how difficult this is.

However what a few years ago were high wage and social costs are today the rising energy and raw materials costs. They threaten the competitiveness of the German and European industry. And if we don’t maintain this basis for our economy, then we will neither be able to keep renewable energies nor our social and cultural standard in our country.”
This is a stunningly direct and sober statement for a politician of Gabriel’s caliber. Vice Chancellor Gabriel also serves as the economics minster in Angela Merkel’s government. His latest statement signals that the emergency brakes are about to be pulled on renewable energies. They are simply no longer affordable and are putting the country’s economic backbone at risk.
As economics minister, we suspect he has been getting an earful from industry bosses and from Hannelore Kraft, the SPD minister president of Germany’s heavily populated industrial heartland, North Rhine Westphalia.
This is an impressive turnaround for a person who in 2007, as the country’s environment minister, was so impressed by Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth that his Ministry snapped up 6000 copies and had them distributed to the nation’s upper secondary schools so that Gore’s shockumentary would be viewed by the nation’s future academics.
My how things can change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got a news e-mail from Craig Rucker of CFACT. It turns out that the environmental movement is turning into a mob of angry, frustrated white males who go around terrifying people. Look familiar?

Scary, angry mob bearing torches threatens to shut you down. Image source: CFACT.
If that isn’t spreading a message of terror. Ah shucks, you mean the masked men are just holding candles that symbolize hope and peace?
Craig Rucker writes:
Throwback to uglier times:
Torch bearing radicals descend on pipeline executive’s private home. It’s the kind of scene we’d like to think we’d put behind us.
Yet here it is again. How would you like to look outside and see masked radicals with torches on your front lawn?
That’s what greeted Mark Maki and his family. Maki was targeted for this shameful act of intimidation because he is a member of the board of Enbridge Energy Management which works with oil pipelines.
The masked perpetrators refused to identify themselves, or their group, claiming only that they represent “the people.”
This comes at a time when both parties are coming around to the realization that pipelines are the safest, most economical and environmentally sound way to move petroleum, particularly after several bad train accidents.

The radicals are in danger of losing the pipeline issue and they know it.  Their response is to act out and threaten sabotage.
Not too long ago Marc Morano, who edits CFACT’s award-winning Climate Depot news and information service, asked an anti-pipeline protestor if they were ready to engage in “eco-terrorism.”  The protestor replied that they would do “whatever it takes” to prevent the project.  It appears now that such threats are more than mere hyperbole.  Law enforcement needs to be on alert.
The most high profile pipeline project in the country right now is the Keystone XL.  It has been the subject of years of wasteful and foolish obstruction.  It is time for President Obama to end all delays, listen to his own State Department, pick up his vaunted pen, sign his name and authorize Keystone XL once and for all.
Paul Driessen has the facts on Keystone XL at CFACT.org.  They are important.
Mister President, the time has come.  Authorize Keystone XL today.  Will you side with ignorance, radicalism and intimidation, or the economic, energy and environmental needs of the nation?
No American, no matter who they are or where they stand, should ever fear threats from masked radicals with torches outside their home again.
Such intimidation cannot be tolerated.
For nature and people too.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the president chooses to bypass Congress and the usual institutions to enact minority-supported regulation, and decides to decree it on his own, then he’s proven his utter failure to lead and has embarked on the ruinous path to tyranny.

Hat-tip: Marc Morano at Climate Depot
That path is one of arrogance, a despise for the will of the people, leadership failure, and eventual civil strife that could shatter a nation.
I disagree with Marc Morano on one point above. This isn’t brilliant, it’s desperate and frightening.

Krauthammer: “appalling…scandalous” 
Charles Krauthammer, a doctor of psychiatry, calls Sally Jewell’s most recent comments about “climate change deniers” in her department:
…shockingly arrogant and anti-scientific. The idea that science is closed and that a science is settled, and that anybody who brings evidence and questions it, is suddenly somehow a flat-earther is appalling. … The idea of science is that you are open to contrary evidence. It’s the definition of a scientific theory. And particularly climate science, which is young and is new – it’s built on all kinds of assumptions and data which contradict each other. The idea that it is a closed issue is incredibly unscientific and arrogant. And that these bureaucrats and political hacks are decreeing this is scandalous.”

I’ve never been a fan of Obama, but he won the elections and I thought he deserved his chance to lead. But with his latest attitude, he is clearly proving himself to be unfit to be the leader of democracy and looking more and more qualified to lead Burma.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI see New York Times science journalist Andrew Revkin has applied his musical talent to record and release a song criticizing evil black carbon:

I’m still trying to figure out people like Revkin. They constantly rail against the very things that make their lives pleasant, safe and fulfilling. To me it’s as rational as hating African-Americans, yet loving jazz and blues music to death. Makes no sense!
They want everybody else to stop using carbon, yet seem to immensely enjoy the benefits the black stuff brings. Society today without the petroleum industry is like an ice cream cone without ice cream. Without lights, we’re back in the dark ages.
If you don’t like carbon, well then don’t use it. Don’t use any fossil fuel, don’t use anything made of plastics, and don’t buy from any vendors that use plastics or carbon fuels…i.e. like hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, food processors, airlines, taxis, etc.. We’d all love to see you yourself live without plastic and petroleum first, i.e. bathing in a cold river, running around, donning a piece of hide, eating bugs and berries filled with parasites, and squatting over a hole to do your biz.

Man used to live without carbon fossil fuel, and it really sucked. They lived to be about 20 – on average!
Anyway I hope you like the music, I like it. But a Neil Young he’ll never be.
I’ll buy his CD (minus one song), but only after he says thank you to the petroleum industry, who made it possible for him to compose and produce the music in the first place. We all live in this world together, and it’s time people start appreciating everyone else’s effort. Stop being idiot ingrates.
============================
UPDATE: Andrew left a reader comment, which I repost as follows (my emphasis):
I’ve got to differ with you on this being a song about evil. It describes clearly all the stuff carbon does for us (“it’ll spin your wheels, it’ll nuke your meals, it’ll turn your night to day..”) and the downsides (greenhouse buildup, the occasional oil war). I did shift the lyrics a few years back to take out “Satan.” That resulted in some jabs (appropriate). I explained why here (and I think this constitutes the “thank you” you talk about): http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/qa_andrew_revkin.php?page=all [F]olk music is a plastic and evolutionary process. Originally, it said, “Satan came along and said, ‘Hey, try lighting this.’ He opened the ground and showed us coal and oil.” And, you know, I thought a lot about that. I probably approached the song initially in the voice of your traditional, Bob Dylan rabble-rouser. And now I look back, and I think, you know, it’s not Satan; it’s normal. It’s just us. So I changed it to, “Someone came along and said, ‘Hey, try lighting this,’” which is much more human and real. And as many of my free-market, blog-commenter friends would say, look at all the benefits that have come from burning fossil fuels.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been so quiet in the mainstream media this year when it comes to polar sea ice. So I figure there must be something going on there that they just don’t want us to see.
The Arctic is refusing to melt like it did last year, and there’s hardly a chance it’s even going to get even close to a record low there. The other story is Antarctica, where I noticed a new record was set…quietly and already months ago.

Antarctica sea ice above normal, uninterrupted almost 2 years. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/seaice.anomaly.antarctic.png.
That record is not sea ice area, but rather the duration that sea ice at the South Pole has remained above the long-term average – now close to 2 years! Never has it even come close to being above average for that long since records have been kept.
From the above chart we observe that it’s rare for South Polar sea ice to be above normal even for just 1 year. Now we are almost at two years. This is unprecedented.
The last time sea ice around Antarctica was below normal was in late 2011.
The warmist scientists who warned us of the albedo tipping point up in the Arctic have to be really trembling about what’s happening at the South Pole – if the albedo theory is correct.
Is this vast yea ice extent a sign of global warming? I think only a real moron would answer yes. Sure there are lots of factors, but ice just doesn’t grow and grow when it gets warmer. Obviously it’s cooling down there, and we need to be very concerned about it.

=============================
There are lots of accusations flying about concerning the PRP journal controversy. What’s disturbing is that the whole thing seems to be on the verge of devolving into mob rule. So far there have been only accusations and mudslinging. There has been no formal investigation or due process to get to the bottom of the matter.
The law of civilization tells us that the accused are to entitled to a fair hearing before the stones get cast. There’s something out there called due process, the presumption of innocence, and allowing the accused to present a defence in an objective forum. Last I checked, most everyone was damned glad to have it.
I’M NOT PICKING SIDES HERE. My sole interest is to see to it that the accused are at least given a fair chance to present their case.
Unfortunately climate science does not operate like the other fields of science. It’s a mess and stinking-rotten to the core. Can it be that some potentially valuable, groundbreaking science gets dismissed outright because MAYBE its authors did not properly go through what has long become the climate science circus tent called peer-review?
Nicola Scafetta has asked me to publish his case here and I ask those holding the noose to first hear it out before tightening it one last time.
==============================
Before putting the noose on, could we at least get a trial?
Nicola Scarfetta
Here I would like to briefly add some comments to my previous post and also respond to two blogs articles authored by Anthony Watts on WUWT following the suppression of Pattern Recognition in Physics by the publisher, Dr. Martin Rasmussen:
1) The ‘planetary tidal influence on climate’ fiasco: strong armed science tactics are overkill, due process would work better
2) The Copernicus-PRP fiasco: predictable and preventable
I found both posts by Anthony highly misleading and subtly malicious. I would like to address the two major points here:
1) In the first post Anthony insinuated the journal was stopped because of the topic of our special issue (the planetary theory of solar and climate variation). Anthony titled his post: “The ‘planetary tidal influence on climate’ fiasco”. However, the “planetary theory” did not play any role in the decision of Rasmussen.
In fact, in a letter sent to Mörner, the accused editor of the journal, Rasmussen wrote: “While processing the press release for the special issue ‘Pattern in solar variability, their planetary origin and terrestrial impacts’, we read through the general conclusions paper published on 16 Dec 2013. We were alarmed by the authors’ second implication stating: ‘This sheds serious doubts on the issue of a continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC project’.” In the official version published on the PRP web-site, Rasmussen wrote: “Recently a special issue was compiled titled ‘Pattern in solar variability, their planetary origin and terrestrial impacts’.” Besides papers dealing with the observed patterns in the heliosphere, the special issue editors ultimately submitted their conclusions in which they doubted “the continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC project” (Pattern Recogn. Phys., 1, 205–206, 2013).
Thus, it is evident that Rasmussen was not disturbed at all by the astronomical aspect of our study, as Anthony Watts insinuated in his first post, which was the primary topic of our works. By his own words, Rasmussen was “alarmed” only and exclusively by a single secondary statement in our Conclusion paper (a 2-page article) where the global surface temperature projections of the IPCC for the 21st century were questioned based on our analysis. That single statement was evidently interpreted by Rasmussen as a kind of “heresy” that required the instantaneous “burning” of the entire journal without even first inquiring with the accused editors.
Very likely Rasmussen overreacted because he ignores similar questioning of the IPCC temperature projections that have recently appeared in numerous scientific papers. Indeed from his statement there is no evidence that he has read any of the papers of the special issue where one finds the arguments which the statement in the Conclusion is based on, and which is supported by numerous references to other works already published in the scientific literature.
In fact, the IPCC models have predicted a 2oC/century warming from 2000 to 2014. But this warming never materialized. The scientific community is currently wondering about the causes of the large discrepancy between the climate models and the data. A possibility that we put forth in the special issue is that solar-astronomical effects and natural cyclical variability are currently underestimated by the IPCC models and, because for the next decades the sun is projected to experience low activity, this will likely slow down the warming. When one reads the papers of the special issue, he sees that they shed serious doubts on the issue of a continued or accelerated warming that is claimed by the IPCC project, and would also easily realize that the concept is perfectly consistent with the current scientific knowledge. Rasmussen’s “alarm” is incomprehensible.
Also an article on BBC, Has the Sun gone to sleep?, published on January 17, 2014 supports our conclusion that projected low solar activity would imply colder weather for the imminent future. But Rasmussen evidently did not know anything about this recent research and misinterpreted the meaning of our research by taking a sentence out of context.
Going back to Anthony Watts’ first blog, it seems to me Anthony, who is a notorious skeptic of the planetary theory discussed in our special session, took advantage of this unfortunate situation in order to discredit the planetary theory, as Rasmussen clearly stated he had been “alarmed” not by the planetary theory, but by some secondary climatic implication of doubting IPCC temperature projections. Ironically, Anthony fully agrees that the IPCC projections are significantly overestimated but he is apparently very allergic to the fact that the physical explanation might be found in astronomical causes.

In his second post, Anthony switched the focus of his attack against the authors and editors of the special issue. Here the claimed offence was deduced from an accusation present in Rasmussen’s statement declaring that: “In addition, the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis, which we regard as malpractice in scientific publishing and not in accordance with our publication ethics we expect to be followed by the editors.”
Rasmussen’s accusation is paradoxical for several reasons, and therefore invalid as I will demonstrate below. Firstly it was not present in the email sent to the editor, Dr. Mörner. In this email a weaker statement had been written: “we also received information about potential misconduct during the review process.”
Note the difference between the two statements. The statement written in the email to Mörner simply indicates a complaint over a “potential misconduct” that the publisher received from somebody. Here it would be interesting to know who complained – an IPCC AGW advocate with conflict of interest against our theories? The sentence then reported in the official statement, on the contrary, is a definitive verdict of “guilty.”
Rasmussen found an editor “guilty” of a malpractice without first properly investigating the issue. In fact a proper inquiry requires asking the accused to respond to the accusations: a fact that did not occur because the editors were not informed of anything. This is a case of censorship that is even worse than what was suffered by Galileo and, ironically, Copernicus himself, whose works at least were subject to a trial before being put into the index of the forbidden books.
Rasmussen’s “guilty” verdict was based on the claim that “the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis”. The literal meaning of the accusation implies the editors selected as referees were “blood-relatives” of the authors. I suspect that Rasmussen would have hard time in demonstrating his claim in a court room. But let us interpret his accusation figuratively as meaning that the editor selected as referees people who fraudulently favored the authors.
Was the review process scientifically fraudulent? This is the very point that needs to be demonstrated. 
The obligation of an editor, as I understand it, is to select honest referees who can provide a professional scientific review of a paper to prevent that papers containing evident scientific flaws are published. An editor should avoid referees who are not expert in the topic and/or who could fraudulently favor or harm an author.
It is evident that simply selecting (as a referee) an expert in a scientific field who might happen to share a similar scientific interest or opinion of an author is not “nepotistic malpractice”. Would a paper advocating IPCC AGW being reviewed by a scientist who shares the same scientific view be considered “nepotistic malpractice” by Rasmussen? Moreover, for a special issue on a very narrow scientific topic, when an editor invites a restricted group of experts it may not be unusual to ask authors of other papers of the same issue to serve as referees of a paper of another author. This actually could improve the scientific quality of the special issue because authors would not want to publish their papers in special issues containing evidently flawed papers.
The problem that I have with Rasmussen’s “pal-review” accusation is that he did not demonstrate that the reviews of the papers of the special issue, as well as of the entire journal were fraudulent, (nor did he demonstrate that editors, referees and authors were blood-relative to each other). To prove the fraudulent claim he should have pointed out the existence of evident scientific errors present in all papers published by the journal so far. It is the presence of evident errors that would have demonstrated that those papers had received a poor and unprofessional review and that the editors were fraudulently trying to promote a personal ideology instead of advancing a specific field of science. But Rasmussen did not provide any evidence that the papers published in the journal contain evident erroneous claims. Rasmussen’s only “scientific” argument against our work was his erroneous claim that the IPCC temperature projections for the 21st century are valid beyond doubt and, therefore, those who questions that claim should be ignored and treated as anti-scientists. To “distance” himself from these scientists he closed the journal.
Rasmussen’s argument is not only offensive, but also absurd and hollow. Thus his accusations are groundless and based on a prejudice. He evidently rushed to judgment in fear that our research could in some way displease the IPCC establishment. For the same reasons also the accusations of Anthony Watts at his blog are equally groundless and in large part based on prejudice. Many times on his blog he was asked to point to factual errors in the papers, but he could not find any and focused only on the “appearance” of the facts interpreted in a malevolent way.
I can only testify that my papers received very professional reviews from the reviewers and especially from the editor, Dr. Morner, who dedicated a lot of his time to this project by personally reviewing and editing my papers as best as he could and, I suppose, each paper of the collections. I am fully satisfied on how my papers have been handled.
Basically it appears that Rasmussen skipped trial and hastily rounded up a lynch mob, and some in the blogosphere appeared to have been quite happy to join in.
It is evident that our work will stand or fall based on its scientific validity.
I invite the readers to study our works and judge by themselves: http://www.pattern-recogn-phys.net/special_issue2.html.”
 
Comment from Nils-Axel Morner (e-mail to Tallbloke):
(1) We were alarmed by the authors’ second implication stating: ‘This sheds serious doubts on the issue of a continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC project’
So what? This is the direct inference of the 12 research papers (especially Papers 1,4,5,7,9,11,12).
(2) ‘the editors selected the referees on a nepotistic basis’
Nepotism is to favor friends and relatives without respects to qualifications. We did the opposite; the reviewer chosen were all specialists on the topics in question. It is true that they primarily were chosen among the authors of the special issue with some additional from outside. This does not mean “pal-reviewing”, but serious colleague reviewing. Most members of the author-team only new each other superficially or as authors. It is common practice when printing proceedings or collective volumes to seek the reviewers within the group, not in order to make the reviewing process less serious, but because those persons are the true experts within the field. And almost always they do a tremendously good job to improve the papers in constructive ways. So also in our case: our reviewing was simply excellent, which I am sure all persons involved would happily testify. This includes strong points and forces for relevant changes and updating. And what we achieved was a wonderful collection of papers that together make a very strong impact of elevating an old hypothesis into a firm theory saying that the solar variability is, indeed, driven by the planetary beat.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterPIK scientist Stefan Rahmstorf at Twitter directs our attention to an interview he gave on German Public Radio.
The interview is about new models that predict the frequency of heat waves globally will double in the next seven years alone, i.e. by 2020, and quadruple again by 2040. I wrote about this yesterday here.
In the interview Rahmstorf says “the probability of experiencing extreme weather events multiplied over the last decades, simply as a consequence of global warming.” Rahmstorf then explains how models have discovered this:
Colleagues looked: Today’s climate models can well reproduce this trend of increasing heat extremes in the past. And as you have confirmed, they used these models to look into the future and have determined that these heat extremes will double by the year 2020 and then once again quadruple in frequency by the year 2050.”
Here Rahmstorf claims that if a model is able to reproduce the past, then it can reproduce the future. Just forget that any model can be made to reproduce the past and then project any future you so desire. Rahmstorf is sounding more and more like a swindler selling phony fortune-telling services with each passing interview. And above I understand from his words a frequency increase of 8 times.
German Public Radio moderator Fecke then asked what exactly makes the projections so robust? Rahmstorf:
Robust is that we use the measured data of the last 130 years and look at how well the newest generation of climate models, that is the complete range that we have from the various research groups from the whole world, can reproduce the past. And it has been determined that they can do this very well, and for this reason we are confident that the results are also robust for the future development.”
Good hindsight automatically means good foresight?

How good were the “old” models? Here’s what the IPCC told us late last year:

Not very good at all. Worse, Hans von Storch and his colleagues just assessed the performance of the climate models. Here’s the result:
…for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012 , only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend.”
That’s Epic failure.
But I guess these were just the “old models”. Rahmstorf is now talking about a “new generation” of super-tuned models, which are now more robust than ever.
But does it really matter how new or how old the models are? The only fact that matters is that temperatures haven’t risen at all in 15 years, and if that trend continues, then Rahmtorf’s much ballyhooed new generation of robust models are going to be just as wrong. Heat waves aren’t going to quadruple should temperatures remain stagnant or fall.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Rahmstorf, and the likes of him, have quit talking about the global mean temperature. Instead they are using a new yardstick for measuring global warming: the undefined vague frequency of weather events. No alarmist wants to talk about the global mean temperature anymore.

From the chart that follows we do see that global sea ice did take a small hit in the 2000s, especially the Arctic. However the trend for the last three years is definitely a strong upward one.

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/global.daily.ice.area.jpg
Moreover, mean global sea ice over the 2013 year was above average, and that for the first time in 9 years (since 2004). If we look closely we also see that global sea ice is little different than it was in 1986, i.e. 27 years ago, which was just a few years after satellite measurements began.
Ice thickness is also increasing in the Arctic:

But things seem to be swinging the other way now. This year has not been a good year for the Arctic meltdown catastrophists.
Not only has the Arctic seen one of its coldest summers since data has been kept and sea ice up there has jumped an astonishing 60%, now we are getting news about Greenland from markvoganweather.com/ who writes that a temperature of -40°C was recorded there already in mid September! He writes:
A deep area of low pressure spinning over the northeast Atlantic has brought the 2nd spell of snow to parts of Iceland and 100 mph wind gusts over the tops of the Scottish Highlands. In the wake of the deepening low, skies cleared, winds fell light and bitter cold settled over Greenland with a rapid rise in surface pressure. These conditions, all thanks to the exiting low to the south, allowed the temperature to plummet to -40C over the Greenland interior last night, the lowest value so far this autumn.

Climate science and policy panel discussion in Berlin, March 17, 2014. Photo: Helmholtz Association
I wrote about this almost 6 weeks ago, read here. What’s a bit special about this podium discussion is that one skeptic, Dr. Peter Heller of Science Skeptical, was allowed to take part on the panel of 5 experts.
The five experts discussed climate science and the uncertainty surrounding it. The Helmholtz Association has since released a report on the event.
There is no concensus
On the claim there is a consensus, the Helmholtz Association panel discussion clearly dumps cold water on that in its article right off the bat, writing in the introduction:
Experts dispute the extent, consequences and causes of climate change.”
Hans von Storch, a critic of science actively telling policymakers what to do, however then said:
Global warming is a fact and cannot be scientifically explained without the observed increase in greenhouse gases.”
But this is statement that everyone agrees on, including skeptics. Unfortunately von Storch does not say how much of the warming is due to greenhouse gases, which is not a surprise because no one knows the answer to that question. Is it 5%? 20% 50% or 95%?

Andreas Hense, Professor for Climate Dynamics and the University of Bonn, reminds that there is uncertainty involved in the science and adds:
But what we do know with a relatively high accuracy, with high probability, is that certain climate variables such as the upper air temperature over the last 100 or 120 years have changed due to man-made influences, but not only because man-made influences but also volcanic influences or solar influences.”
So natural factors are being acknowledged after all. The Helmholtz article writes that the panel member opinions on the magnitudes the different factors have on climate “diverged”, thus confirming that there is no consensus.
Von Storch fears a role for science in policymaking
The Helmholtz article also writes that many scientists feel they are being crowded into a role in which they do not feel comfortable:
Hense said that he now avoids all discussions with the media. Von Storch said he even fears science taking a role in the political decision processes which they are not entitled to take.”
Schellnhuber’s approach roundly rejected
Werner Krauss at Klimazwiebel also reports on the podium discussion, and writes that the 2°C target of was rejected unanimously by the panelists (4 of 5 of whom were warmists) and that “a Herr Schellnhuber was sorely missed and thoroughly dissed – everyone agreed on the rejection of the scientifically dubious limits such as the 2°C target or measures that are not democratically legitimized.”
So all of us here in Germany can breath a sigh of relief in that even warmists think the Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s master plan for a great transformation of society and its calls for a watering down of democracy is going too far.
Hopefully the Helmholtz Association will post the video of this worthwhile event in the days ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmists would like to have everyone think that “white Christmases” were normal back in the days before global warming and that human behavior has ruined it all.
But Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski looks back at the statistics of snow on Christmas Day and finds that a white Christmas in Germany happened with a higher frequency in the past is a myth. He writes, “Scientists trace back the nostalgia of a wintery Christmas season to postcards from the year 1863, among other things.”
Later in the article we read that the 19th century postcards stem from New England, mainly Vermont, my home state! The postcard shown from sister state New Hampshire, judging from the vegetation, is definitely high elevation White Mountains. And having spoken to my sister in Vermont yesterday, there’s white stuff on the ground right now in Vermont as well. As I write, the temperature at the Champlain Valley Westford station is a nippy -19°C www.westfordweather.net/.
Bojanowski quotes the findings of the German Weather Service (DWD):
“Despite global climate warming, white Christmases have not become less frequent over the last 100 years.”
He writes that Munich is Germany’s large city that has the highest chances of seeing a white Christmas, with chances at only 40%. Clearly a green Christmas is far more common than a white one. Bojanowski writes the belief that Christmases were whiter in the past also stems in part from the older folks who remember the harsh winters of the 1940s – 1970s, a time when scientists were warning of a coming ice age, i.e. a time that corresponded to a negative phase PDO and AMO.
The DWD findings confirm a quick check of the statistics I made awhile back for snow on Christmas Day in northern Germany near where I am now currently living. Since 1890, there have been on average about 2 white Christmases per decade (Bremen). The last 2 white Christmases were in 2010 and 2011.
Globally, statistics seem to be showing that snowfall is trending upwards. Polar sea ice is getting close to record levels. Global temperatures over the last 8 years have been dropping somewhat. These are hard facts warmists are going to have to start getting used to.
Snow or not, hope you all have an enjoyable Christmas!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Rise And Fall Of The Hockey Stick Charts
By Michael Krüger, Science Skeptical Blog
(Translated, condensed, edited by P Gosselin)
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in November 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Organization for Meteorology (WMO). The main task of the UN Climate Framework  Convention (UNFCCC) was to assess the risks of global warming and to draw up mitigation strategies. One important role was to determine the global climate development over the last 1000 years in order to see if the warming of the last century was “unique” and to see if today’s supposed manmade warming was a threat.
An examination of the five IPCC reports published thus far reveals a remarkable scientific reversal. What follows is the evolution of the 1000-year temperature curve: from double hump (1990) – to hockey stick 2001) – and back again to double hump (2013).
1st Assessment Report, 1990
In the First Assessment Report of 1990, page 202 depicts the following chart:

Figure 1: Page 202 of the IPCC FAR.
In Figure 1 we see that the period of the 11th to 13th century, the Medieval Warm Period, was considerably warmer than today. The above graphic appears to be based on the publication from LAMB from 1965, H. H. LAMB, 1965, THE EARLY MEDIEVAL WARM EPOCH AND ITS SEQUEL Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. The climate data were taken from Central England and extend up to 1970.
2nd Assessment Report, 1995
But already in the Second Assessment Report of 1995 the curve looks much different. On page 174:


Figure 2: Page 174 of the Second Assessment Report
And instead of showing the last 1000 years, as the section title states, the chart starts only in the 15th century, i.e. exactly at the end of the Medieval Warm Period. And there’s another oddity that stands out: The drawn mean curve does not match the depicted temperature curve.
3rd Assessment Report, 2001
In the Third Assessment Report of 2001 the following curve was presented by the IPCC (as to Mann, M.E, R.S. Bradley and M.K. Hughes (1998) Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries.- NATURE, VOL 392, 23 April). In the literature often cited under (Michael E. Mann and Raymond S. Bradley (1999). Northern Hemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, Uncertainties, and Limitations) (original chart in Figure 3).

Figure 3: Hockey Stick chart from the IPCC Third Assessment Report
In a single stroke the Medieval Warm Period gets deleted altogether. The chart shows a relatively stable climate all the way up to 1900 with an overall slight cooling tendency. This then gets followed by a dramatic temperature increase. It became known worldwide as the “Hockey Stick chart”. It was cited endlessly, often times without the gray zone of uncertainty – for example in Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth movie.
However, the chart became highly criticized because of the methodology employed by lead author Michael Mann. The methodology produced a hockey stick no matter what data were input. Even today Mann refuses to fully disclose the method he employed. Moreover, it was determined that the tree-ring data methodology suppressed the climate jumps of the past. Furthermore the reconstructed data was simply truncated at 1980 and replaced by the instrumental data. This was done because the data derived from the tree-rings did not deliver the desired temperature rise at the end of the data series.
4th Assessment Report, 2007
In the Fourth Assessment Report of 2007 on page 467, the IPCC presented a new climate spaghetti curve.

Figure 4: 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment report, page 467.
It contained the hockey stick curve of Michael Mann (MBH1999), which however was only one of many. New temperature reconstructions depict once again more or less a pronounced Medieval Warm Period.
5th Assessment Report, 2013
The Fifth Assessment Report has been just released. In it the IPCC now shows the following Figure 5.7 climate curve, a new spaghetti chart:

Figure 5: IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Figure 5.7.
Here we now clearly see that Michael Mann’s hockey stick curve of 1999 has disappeared altogether. The new temperature reconstructions once again show a very pronounced Medieval Warm Period, thus rehabilitating the MWP of the First Assessment Report from 23 years ago. Today’s warming, it turns out, is nowhere near as dramatic as it was claimed for a long time.
The IPCC has gone from a double hump curve – to hockey stick – and again back to double hump curve. This is a remarkable scientific reversal over the course of 23 years.
Hide the decline
Michael Mann’s hockey stick curve of 1999 is not the only climate curve that has disappeared from the 5th Assessment Report. Also Keith Briffa’s curve from 2000 and 2001 have disappeared. The following may be the reason they have disappeared.
Most reconstructions do not extend all the way to the present even though they provide enough data to do so in most cases. The reason for this is because the curve designers do not want to deal with the gaping differences between the values derived from the proxy reconstructions and the values recorded by modern instruments. So they simply truncate the proxy reconstructed values where a divergence between the two datasets begins. The discarded proxy reconstruction data are then simply replaced by the instrumental data obtained from the weather stations.
Example
Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart from 1998 uses reconstructed proxy data only until 1980. Mann writes in his 1998 publication: “the training interval is terminated at 1980 because many of the proxy series terminate at or shortly after 1980)”. This truncate-and-substitute trick is even mentioned in one of the Climategate e-mails from Phil Jones (Director of the Climate Research Unit): “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (ie from 1981 onwards) amd from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”
Keith Briffa (CRU) also used the truncate-and-substitute trick. The Briffa reconstructions from 1998 (as well as 2000, 2001) extended only up to 1960 even though the reconstructed data ranged from 1402 – 1995. This is explained as follows in an internal e-mail: “The data are attached to this e-mail. They go from 1402 to 1995, although we usually stop the series in 1960 because of the recent non-temperature signal that is superimposed on the tree-ring data that we use.”
Here’s how it’s done

Figure 6: How “Mike’s Nature Trick” works.
Figure 6 shows Keith Briffa’s reconstruction. The data from the reconstruction extends all the way to 1995 (red curve included). But the red part of the curve (1961-1994) gets deleted because it does not show any real warming and gets replaced by instrumental data from weather stations (green, 1871-1997) . This trick was used to conceal the drop in temperature at the end of the reconstruction and to cover up the considerable discrepancy with the instrumental data of the weather stations, i.e. “to hide the decline”.
The same was done with Michael Mann’s reconstruction, which got chopped off at 1980.
Without the work of the “climate skeptics”, one of the greatest scientific reversals of the last century very likely would have never taken place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA number of websites have thoroughly and deservedly thrashed Germany-based Copernicus Publications for terminating one of its scientific journals: Pattern Recognition in Physics. Read here, here and here.
The reason for terminating the entire publication was an IPCC skeptical paper titled: General conclusions regarding the planetary–solar–terrestrial interaction, authored by an impressive roster of leading maverick scientists.
A Copernicus Publications statement claims that “scientific dispute is controversial and should allow contradictory opinions which can then be discussed within the scientific community“. But unfortunately anything that disagrees with the IPCC isn’t going to be tolerated – data and observations be damned. Clearly the dogmatism of IPCC global warming science rules at Copernicus Publications. The director of Copernicus Publications, Thies Martin Rasmussen, appears to be simply too young, naïve and closed-minded to know better and is thus intolerant to alternative explanations.
Growing German intolerance
The move by Copernicus Publications should not come as a surprise, though. The move simply once again confirms a growing intolerance to climate science dissent that we’ve been seeing in Germany over the past years. Today dissent is being met with increasing scorn and viciousness. Those who express dissent are routinely singled out and marginalized as heretics. And the more the data refute anthropogenic global warming, the more intense the dogmatists become.
From “Jewish science” to “denier science”
Unfortunately, Göttingen, where the publisher is based, has a long history of caving in to this brand of intolerance and remaining silent when things get out of hand. Jacob Bronowski in Knowledge or Certainty reminds us of a dark period in Gottingen’s history:
It’s a major tragedy that in my lifetime and yours, that here in Göttingen scientists were refining to the most exquisite position of the principle of tolerance and turning their backs on the fact that all around them tolerance was crashing to the ground beyond repair.”
The same is true today in Germany’s climate science community. The move by Copernicus Publications once again represents how science and debate can be suppressed by arrogance and elitism. Albert Einstein was also attacked by German scientists, who called his theories “Jewish science”. The only difference today is that we’ve gone from “Jewish science” to “denier science”. Today’s skeptical scientists in Germany, and elsewhere, are held with an eerily similar contempt as Einstein was held in the Nazi days. Some have already left the country.

Even lukewarmers get disinvited
One particular glaring example occurred two years ago, when lukewarmer Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of the then newly released IPCC critical book “Die kalte Sonne“, was abruptly disinvited by administrators from giving a speech at the University of Osnabrück after immense pressure was applied on the university and threats were made by powerful, radical green forces.
Germany’s Environment Ministry goes after skeptics
Last year Germany’s Ministry of Environment, a major federal government body, published and distributed a 123-page pamphlet that singled out, publicly named, isolated and discredited leading German climate dissenters, warning the public not to listen to them. Jewish journalist Henryk Broder wrote that the move by the Ministry of Environment smacked of tactics used by the Reichskulturkammer, read here.
Move by Copernicus defends anti-science and dogma
With its rash, poorly contemplated move, Copernicus Publications has turned its back on the principles of open scientific debate and demonstrated an obstinate insistence that certainty exists in the complex science of climate change. The publisher is not defending science at all, rather he is defending anti-science and the preservation of dogma. With it’s move Copernicus Publications is stymying debate and dissent.
The authors of the controversial paper General conclusions regarding the planetary–solar–terrestrial interaction, are among the most esteemed in the field, and thus cannot be dismissed as crackpots. Collectively they have published hundreds of scientific papers, an immense contribution to the field and expansion of knowledge. Their only “wrongdoing”? They refuse to tag along with the fashionable dogma of anthropogenic global warming. They insist of remaining scientitific, i.e. being critical and skeptical of claims that cannot be supported by observations.
Copernicus Publications has made a terrible, cowardly and narrow-minded mistake that will become a huge embarrassment to Germany’s scientific community and spirit of open discussion. Reversing this grotesque decision and apologizing to the scientists is in order.

The NOAA claims the US was near normal, when in fact it was much colder.
Bastardi then goes on to say the USA has seen the biggest drop in temperature this year that it has ever had. The satellite data also show that temperatures for November were much cooler, see Saturday Summary video at the 9-minute mark. Joes asks: “Why doesn’t the media actually go look at what is going on here?”
Joe then reminds us that global sea ice is at the second highest level in the satellite era.

Near record sea ice hardly indicates record warmth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Der Spiegel writes here that the EU is moving to abandon its ambitious climate protection targets. This, Spiegel writes, is now a real threat to Germany’s much ballyhooed Energiewende (energy transformation to renewable energies).
The EU used to be a leading, unrelenting proponent of CO2 emissions reduction, even often ostracizing other industrial nations like the USA for not following its lead on carbon emissions. Many EU countries even implemented laws and generous subsidies to promote large-scale renewable energy systems. But now, some ten years later, EU policymakers are waking up to the exorbitantly high costs of green energies and their unpredictable, uncontrollable supply.
Originally the EU’s target was to reach 27% renewable energy by the year 2020, and 40% by 2030 (Germany is even pushing for 60% by 2036). Today the EU insists it’s still sticking to that target but Spiegel writes that emissions cuts will be voluntary in the future:
Upon request from Commission president José Manuel Barroso, the EU member states will no longer receive concrete requirements for expanding renewable energies in the future.”
Moreover, Spiegel writes that the EU wants to begin clearing the way for fracking. The controversial method is now widely used in the USA and natural gas prices there are some 65% cheaper than in Europe as a result, thus creating a serious competitive disadvantage in key industries – such as chemicals.
Germany, a vocal proponent of rash CO2 reductions and climate protection, has reacted critically to the EU’s new intentions. German economics minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) criticized the EU and wrote that it “cannot afford to let this opportunity to get away.”
The Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) claims that more relaxed EU targets and less support for renewable energies could have real impacts on German climate policy: “In such a context it is going to get increasingly difficult for Germany to successfully maintain a national leadership position.”
In other words, as Europe abandons aggressive climate change policy, Germany eventually will be forced to follow.
In summary, Europe’s backing down from pushing through a radical green transformation of its economy appears to be in large part driven by the high costs to consumers and a worsening capability to compete globally. Rescued again by the free markets!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe preliminary results of Germany’s national election are rolling in. What’s sure is that Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU/CSU party is the winner, with projections showing them currently capturing a massive 42.5% of the votes.

Preliminary, early results show the Greens (Grüne) collapsing to 8% (2009: 11%) thus eliminating the possibility of a socialist/green coalition government made up of the SPD/Greens. Source: www.tagesschau.de
The Green Party is among the big losers, with early projections showing them picking up only 8% of the vote. In 2009 they received almost 11%.
With climate change losing importance in Germany as an issue and the Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) turning into a chaos that threatens the country’s economic stability, the Greens, who were polling near 16% earlier in the year, have since lost almost half of their voter base.
In a reaction to the preliminary results, Green Party co-leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt said on ARD television that they “failed to convince voters of an ecological transition and sustainability“.
The element of fear, which the Greens have always effectively used in the past to motivate its voter base, was absent during the campaign as the issues of nuclear power and climate change didn’t play a role.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPredictions of the climate’s development in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels started in earnest over 25 years ago. James Hansen led the way beginning in 1988. In Germany the director of the prestigious Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology Hartmut Grassl was vocal.

Around 1990 former Max Planck Institute of Meteorology director Hartmut Grassl (left) and former NASA GISS director James Hansen predicted global temperatures would rise 1.5°C by 2020.
Both men played instrumental roles in getting governments to take action against the emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2. Since 1990 global CO2 emissions have actually even surpassed the worst case scenarios of the climate science community, meaning temperatures indeed should have increased even more then what the two scientists projected.
Both Hansen (1988) and Grassl (1990) predicted that global temperatures would rise about 1.5° by 2020, under business-as-usual CO2 emissions. Today plotted observed temperature data show that their predictions completely overshot and even resemble the ravings of an end-of-world lunatic, see the following chart, bold red line. This is nothing short of embarrassing,

Chart above depicts Hansen’s and Grassl’s predictions from 1988 and 1990 respectively. Other model predictions also overshot actual observed temperatures, which are given by the HADCRUT4 surface and UAH lower troposphere curves. Original chart: www.drroyspencer.com/wrong/.

 In 2012, Die kalte Sonne site here researched Grassl’s earlier predictions and found this quote from 1990:
Already in the next 30 years the earth will warm up with high probability by one to two degrees Celsius.”
The plot above is the average of that, i.e. 1.5°C, which corresponds to Hansen’s 1988 bleak outlook. Moreover Grassl in 1994 already declared the debate over:
On the scientific side, the process of indications when it comes to the subject of the greenhouse effect is over, the guilty verdict is in. It is no longer about getting more evidence, rather it is about reducing the sentence a bit. The global mean temperatures will rise between 1 and 2°C in the next decades.”
Hansen at the time was pretty much saying the same thing.
Both men have gone on to receive many medals and awards for their work, and still continue today being taken seriously by policymakers and media outlets. How much longer that can be sustained is a question climate science critics are watching very closely.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel journalist and geologist Axel Bojanowski reports on a heated climate debate in the online Spiegel today.

Climate scientist Daniela Jacob (left) completely overpowered by Vahrenholt (right) in debate in Hamburg. Jacob admitted climate models and science are filled with uncertainty, concedes model failure. Photo Jacob: climate-service-center.en.  Photo Vahrenholt: RWE.
Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, one of the fathers of the modern environmental movement, and today persona non grata for having published a skeptical climate science book last year, met IPCC climate scientist Daniela Jacob in a head-to-head debate before an audience of 100 at the Scandic Hotel in Hamburg yesterday evening. The debate was organized by Angela Merkel’s CDU Christian Democratic Party.
Vahrenholt trounced the former NCAR scientist, who was broken down into making a number of admissions.
Spiegel writes in the photo caption:
Unusual debate at the CDU in Hamburg: A renowned climatologist debates scientist critic and RWE supervisory board member Fritz Vahrenholt. The dispute reveals a new stage in the handling of climate prognoses.”
The days of uncritical acceptance of climate prognoses are over. The trust is gone. Open criticism of climate science is gaining traction in Germany as climate prognoses from renowned institutes are being viewed by the public and media with increasing skepticism. Spiegel writes:
After Vahrenholt and Jacob each made a presentation and duked it out in a heated dispute, the duel appeared to decide: “When the climate models do not agree with the reality”, Vahrenholt thundered, “then reality is not what’s false!”
Hostile audiences are becoming a thing of the past for climate skeptics – even among the generally climate alarmist CDU conservative party audiences. The overall reaction by the Hamburg audience signals a growing, pent-up resentment among Germans as the inkling that the climate catastrophe is more charade than fact begins to sink in.
Failed climate models “the wound of climate science”
In its article, Spiegel calls the growing disagreement between model results and measured observations “the wound of climate science“.  Spiegel writes on Vahrenholt’s claim of faulty models:
With that statement Vahrenholt bored into the wound of climate science: For 15 years the global mean temperature has remained stagnant, the computer models had not foreseen the warming pause. The models could not reproduce the surprising temperature trend, reported climatologists surrounding Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz-Zentrum GKSS in a new study. The probability that the simulations in this respect are faulty is higher than 98 percent. The climate catastrophe is refuted, believes Vahrenholt, who made his audacious claims into a bestseller.”

That German establishment-shaking bestseller is now coming in English in September: North America and UK. And there are discussions to have the book out in Polish.
Vahrenholt scoffed at the excuse that the oceans had swallowed up the heat, saying it was not credible. Jacob even desperately had to cite the Bible to explain the missing heat: “We know this already from the Bible: Seven goods years follow seven bad years.”
Prognoses with “concrete numbers was an error”
Jacob reluctantly had to admit the shortcomings with the models, blaming poor communication for the model failures: “We do however have to improve the communication with the public,” Jacob admitted. “One error was giving out concrete figures for the prognoses.” She then conceded that we ought not be surprised that the models projections were wrong and that there’s lots of uncertainty, adding: “In the economy and in a marriage they aren’t any better.”
Untypical for an IPCC scientist, Jacob also admitted that the models exaggerated. “I don’t think highly of that. we all have learned from it.”
Why did no scientist intervene?
With that admission, Bojanowski writes that Vahrenholt didn’t pass up the opportunity to capitalize, loudly demanding:
Why is it then, when panic was rampant, no moderate climate scientist intervened? … You too must sometimes publicly distance yourselves from the agitators at the Potsdam-Institute, Frau Jacob!”
Applause from the audience, Bojanwski writes. Vahrenholt continued:
The catastrophic heightening of some scientists now threatens to destroy Germany as a place to do business.  … 1000 billion euros for the Energiewende, who is going to pay for it?”
Good question. And what does a scientist feeding on the public trough like Jacob care? Her answer, Spiegel writes:
 I makes statements in my field of study as a scientist, and not politically.”
Germany is slowly awakening.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFire in the sky, torrential rains, droughts and Biblical floods – all supposedly brought on by the sins and wickedness of man. Is it really a surprise we are hearing it all once again today?

Hail storm in Dordrecht, Holland, May 17, 1552. Image: Taschen Verlag, amazon.de.
The online Spiegel today has a report on a new book titled The Book of Miracles which presents and examines a collection of 16th century depictions of celestial phenomena and portentous signs. They were recently discovered as part of a collection of 169 illustrations created in Augsburg, Germany around 1552. End-of-world visions, it turns out, are a human mental disorder that has been around for as long as civilization itself.
The images were created as Europe was in the grips of the Little ice Age, a time of bad weather, bitter cold, storms and crop failures, starvation and human misery. The 16th century depictions reveal images of a civilization obsessed with the end-of-the-world. Priests and elitists of the time conducted terrifying witch hunts to find those allegedly responsible for the black magic that cooked up the extreme weather.
Sound familiar?
The book containing the collection of images was authored by Joshua P. Waterman of the University of Indiana and Till-Holger Borchert of the University of Oregon. The collection of images depict demons, fire, drought, and torrential rains – of blood, stones and hail falling from the sky, which brought or warned of unimaginable misery for sinners on earth.
When one compares these hallucinatory depictions to today’s bleak climate scenarios coming from climate scientists, and their shrill demands that we radically change our behavior, the parallels could hardly be more striking.
Spiegel writes:

The Augsburg Book of Miracles (German title: Wunderzeichenbuch) illustrates how mankind from antiquity to the Renaissance imagined the end of things. As a rule: frightening. Only very few positive heavenly appearances are seen in between.”
Nowness site here quotes co-author Borchert on what the dire images signified.
The Protestant viewer would have reflected on the greater significance of these wonders: Why are there dragons in the sky? Why does it rain blood? Why are there three suns overhead? We know from contemporary sources that the answer was general: Things are wrong in the world. Repent and prepare for the end times, which are possibly now.”
Aren’t the similarities to the climate science establishment absolutely stunning? Once again today mankind is being led by obsessive, paranoid charlatans warning of unprecedented colossal weather disasters. Really, there is no other way to accurately describe today’s climate science schizophrenia.
Spiegel writes that the book’s 167 pages “illustrates the angst” of the times, many having to do with weather extremes. For example one illustration (see above) shows a massive hailstorm hitting Dordrecht Holland on May 17, 1552. Note the perceived “weirdness”.
Spiegel writes:
Lightning strikes, comets and the unknown were regarded as the Wrath of God, or as omens for bad things to come. … Starvation, disease, locusts and falling stars. Many of these signs were distributed as pamphlets. And many of these phenomena indeed happened, says Waterman. But the ten-headed monster with horns and a crown of course never existed.”
Extreme weather events being taken as signs for the coming end, unless sinful ways are repented, is as old as civilization. Today’s climate panic is merely just the latest relapse into a very old mental disorder that has afflicted mankind for thousands of years. The only antidote is reason and knowledge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowly, almost imperceptibly, but surely, the once diehard the-science-is-settled mainstream media are conceding that the climate debate isn’t over after all – and likely not by a long shot. And if you pay attention, you can see them quietly opening that back door for the quick exit.
The cracking started long ago, and now chips and pieces of the global warming science are starting to fall on the floor around us.
Earlier today the BBC featured a short report “Has the Sun gone to sleep?”
This report looks at the implications of a protracted quiet solar period, potentially lasting decades. Global cooling is turning out to be a real possibility, now even at the BBC!
Today we know a huge body of historical observations shows there is a pronounced relationship between cold winters in Europe and low solar activity. Moreover there’s a huge body of persuasive evidence, comprising mainly proxy datasets, that show the phenomenon is not regional, but global. As much as the BBC tries to play that down, the video holds a couple of big surprises.
Mirrors the Maunder Minimum!
The BBC starts by telling its viewers that the current solar maximum “is eerily quiet“. Solar physicist Professor Richard Harrison says the sun hasn’t been this quiet in 100 years and that the current activity mirrors the activity of the 17th century – the Maunder Minimum, the time of the dreadful Little Ice Age. What we have here is the BBC telling viewers to associate low solar activity with potential cold.
At the 3-minute mark, the BBC reporter asks the key question: “Does a decline in solar activity mean plunging temperatures for decades to come?” For an answer the BBC interviews three scientists.
Could impact the climate – “not fully understood”
Scientist Dr Lucie Green actually thinks that low solar activity could affect the climate, but she isn’t sure “to what extent“, and then even points out that varying amounts of solar radiation impact the globe’s upper atmosphere and that this is something scientists “don’t fully understand“. Therefore, don’t rule anything out.

“Fastest solar decline in 10,000 years”!
At the 4:17 mark, Mike Lockwood says we are witnessing the fastest decline in 10,000 years. He then claims that there’s a close to 20% chance that we may be actually entering a Maunder-like minimum. As one of the scientists who is more than 95% sure that man is now causing the climate change, 20% seems to be a very high figure and so we might suspect Lockwood’s true probability figure to be much higher than 20%.
Note how Lockwood does his best to portray solar impacts on climate as being regional phenomena, affecting the Jet Stream and Europe’s climate, but not the global mean climate. Lockwood here is not being completely forthcoming.
Sun now on par with human activity?
At the 5:26 mark the BBC journalist asks the right question, and the answer the BBC provided truly surprised me. Question:
The relationship between solar activity and weather on earth is complicated. But if solar activity continues to fall, could the temperature on earth as a whole get cooler? Could there be implications for global warming?”
The answer, provided by Dr. Lucie Green:
On the one hand you’ve perhaps got the cooling sun, but on the other hand you’ve got human activity that can counter that. And I think it is quite difficult to say actually how these two are going to compete and then what the consequences are for the global climate.”
Wow. The BBC has really opened the door, perhaps looking to upgrade the impact of solar activity to be on par with human activity. That’s huge compared to what the IPCC scientists claim about the impact of solar activity (negligible). You almost get the feeling that even the BBC is starting to have doubts about the supposed coming warming, and are opening up to the possibility of cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the title Die Achse Des Guten here bears at its website.
Few countries have spent as much as Germany on measures to reduce CO2 emissions. Today German website Die Achse Des Guten here links to a blurb appearing in German “intellectual” weekly Die Zeit here which unwittingly tells readers what Germany has gained for its 100-billion-euro investment in green energies so far: nothing!
DIE ZEIT writes:
Actually, the German government wanted to decrease the emissions of CO2 – also through the transition to renewable energy. However our chart shows the opposite is the case.
Greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing for three years in Germany, 1.2 percent for last year.”
The DIE ZEIT chart shows Germany emitted 913 million tonnes in 2009 (due in large part to the global financial crisis) with emissions rising steadily to 951 million tonnes in 2013. The lion’s share of Germany’s post 1990 reduction stems from the shutdown of dilapidated communist East Germany and it’s dinosauric industry.
For the taxpayers who may be angered by the lack of return on investment, 2014 may post a slight emissions drop…but not because of anything the government and the 100 billion euros have done, but because of the warm winter Germany saw this year.

What follows is a video of North Korea’s military going green, installing a wind turbine that will produce climate-friendly energy, and so protect the planet for future generations of brainwashed North Korean robot slaves.

Wonderful world without dissent.
Let’s be honest. Isn’t this exactly the kind of green-energy enthusiasm the UN, IPCC scientists, and devout climate activists have wet dreams about? This is what they’d love to see. You see what’s possible without dissent?!
This is precisely the kind of enthusiasm the whole world would see – were it not for those damn dissenters and flat-earth deniers ruining everything!
Moreover, what’s really great is that dissent in North Korea never sees the light of day. They have supreme leaders who know what’s best for the people, and they really know how to deal with pesky dissenters. Wouldn’t that be wonderful in climate science?

———————————
New study from the Geosciences Center Potsdam: There have been 18 flooding phases in upper Austria over the last 7000 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Tanslated, edited by P. Gosselin)
The pattern in society today is clear to see. Whenever a storm hits a region and submerges terrain in water, or if a drought destroys crops, then the one to blame is quickly found: It has got to be man and his debaucherous CO2-spewing lifestyle that is bringing the climate into a state of catastrophic instability. In former times witches and sorcerers were made responsible for meteorological extremes, and they were burned at the town square so that future bad weather could be prevented. Like today, back then no one really cared about scientific arguments.
But here one only needs to look over the scientific literature in order to recognize that storms and weather extremes have always been the case and things really aren’t any different today. Yet another new study has just come out showing this, appearing in the November 2013 edition of the Quaternary Science Reviews, by a team of scientists led by Tina Swierczynski of the Geoforschungszentrum (GFZ) Potsdam. The scientists examined sediment deposits taken from the Austrian Mondsee and they were able to identify the development of flooding phases of rivers in the region caused by heavy rainfalls in the spring and summers. The geological archive goes back more than 7000 years.
In total Tina Swierczynski and her colleagues found 271 flooding events that had occurred during 18 flood-rich phases, each having a duration of 30 – 50 years. The most important of these phases took place during the Neolithic (7100–7050 vyr BP and 6470–4450 vyr BP), the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age (3300–3250 and 2800–2750 vyr BP), the late Iron Age (2050–2000 vyr BP), throughout the Dark Ages Cold Period (1500–1200 vyr BP), and at the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (810–430 vyr BP). The scientists found that summer flood episodes in Lake Mondsee are generally more abundant during the last 1500 years, often coinciding with major advances of Alpine glaciers.
The study provides an historically important context that absolutely needs to be taken into account when assessing modern day flooding events. It is clear that there were always heavy rain phases in pre-industrial times. Therefore it also scientifically doubtful that the flooding events of today can be automatically connected to man-made climate change. Those who allow themselves to be seduced by the hypothesis of man-made climate are seriously under-estimating the potential of the natural fluctuation range of extreme weather occurrences.

It’s the book they don’t want you to read.
The Neglected Sun is back on sale (at least in the UK) after the first printing was sold out.
Some readers wrote me saying that they were no longer able to order the book. I don’t know how many copies were printed this time around, but if you are planning to pick up copies to give away for Christmas, for someone’s birthday, or to educate some hysterical warmist, then do get them while you can.
The book makes a strong case against the one-sided IPCC AR5 report, whereby unbelievably its authors are now struggling with whether or not to mention the significantly 15 year warming pause that embarrassed their models.
The German version was released one and half years ago, and so far all the recent studies are confirming precisely what Vahrenholt and Lüning are claiming and showing: no warming, Co2 exaggerated, oceans play a major role, models are totally inadequate, etc.
Last I’ve heard, the IPCC AR5 authors will claim sea ice will be melting faster as temperature slows down. Now that’s confusion. Obviously they are bending over backwards to insert alarmism in the report.

This short illustrated essay questions government efforts to combat global warming and climate change from three points of view:
1. The influence of CO2 on temperature
2. Decarbonisation outcomes
3. Politics
This essay examines quantifiable and hopefully non-contentious aspects of the question.
1. Influence of carbon dioxide CO2 on temperature
The temperature-increasing capacity of atmospheric CO2 is known and widely accepted to diminish as its concentration increases.
Global warming advocates and climate change skeptics both agree on this. IPCC published reports acknowledge that the effective temperature increase caused by growing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere radically diminishes with increasing concentrations. This information has been presented in the IPCC reports, yet it is well disguised for any lay reader, (TAR3, Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate) . It is not acknowledged in their Summary For Policymakers.

Figure 1: Logarithmic warming diminution of CO2.
The rapid diminution effect is an inconvenient fact for global warming advocates, nonetheless it is well understood within the climate science community, but it is certainly not much discussed. This logarithmic diminution effect is probably the reason why there was no runaway greenhouse warming caused by CO2 in earlier eons when CO2 levels were known to be at levels of several thousands ppmv.
– Up to 200 ppmv, the equivalent to about 82% of the temperature increasing effectiveness of CO2, is essential to sustain photosynthesis in plant life and thus the viability of all life on earth.
– A further 100 ppmv was the level prior to any industrialisation, this atmospheric CO2 made the survival of the biosphere possible. It was responsible for a further 5% of the CO2 greenhouse effect.
– Following that, a further 100 ppmv, (certainly man-made in part), adding 4.1% of the CO2 effectiveness brings to the current level 400 ppmv.
– CO2 at 400 pmmv is already committed and immutable. So CO2 has already reached about 90+% of its potential warming effect in the atmosphere.
Only 10% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a warming greenhouse gas now remains:
400-500 ppmv 3.25%
500-600 ppmv 2.65%
600-700 ppmv 2.05%
700-800 ppmv 1.44%
800-900 ppmv 0.84%
900-1000 ppmv 0.24%    Total 400-1000 ppmv 9.63%
Both skeptics and the IPCC publish different views of the reduced effect on temperature of as  CO2 concentration rises.  Theses alternates are closely equivalent proportionally but vary in the degree of warming that is attributable to CO2. The range is from 3.13°C to 14.55°C.  The graphics showing IPCC published views on the diminution below:

Figure 2: Temperature as a function of Co2 concentration.
A comparison between all four estimates are set out below in the context of the whole approx. 33°C greenhouse effect.  This graphic shows the remaining temperature effect of CO2 in orange that could be affected by global decarbonisation policies.

Figure 3: Greenhouse gas
It is anachronistic that some of the IPCC data sets shows very large proportions of the temperature effect attributable to CO2. The concomitant effect of those higher levels of CO2 warming is that the proportion of the total approx. 33°C then attributable the water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere is reduced so as to be unrealistically low.
Is it plausible that CO2, a minor trace gas in the atmosphere, currently at the level of ~400 ppm (0.04%) achieves such radical control of global temperature when compared to the substantial and powerful Greenhouse Effect of water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere?
Global warming advocates stipulate that all increases in the concentration of CO2 are solely man-made. This is not necessarily the case, as the biosphere and slightly warming oceans will outgas CO2. The man-made CO2 contribution at maximum is only a minor part of the CO2 transport within the atmosphere, at ~3% of the total [i]. The recent IPCC report now admits that probably increasing CO2 levels are only approx. 50% man-made.
There are the clearly divergent views of the amount of warming that can result from additional CO2 in future, but even in a worst case scenario whatever change that may happen in future can only ever have a marginal effect on global temperature.  
So any de-carbonization policy, however widely applied, trying to control CO2 emissions can only ever achieve a minor future temperature reduction.
Whatever political efforts are made to de-carbonize economies or to reduce man-made CO2 emissions, (and to be effective at temperature control those efforts would have to be universal and worldwide), those efforts can only now affect at most ~10-11% of the future warming potential of CO2.
So increasing CO2 in the atmosphere can not now inevitably lead directly to much more warming.  Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere cannot give rise to any dangerous temperature increase.  
Decarbonization policies could never have any useful impact to realistically control any rising world temperatures and the future world climate.
As the future temperature effect of increasing CO2 emissions is now so minor, there is no possibility of ever attaining the much vaunted political target of less than +2.0°C by the control of CO2 emissions.
It is likely that any current global warming is largely a natural process, is within normal limits and is probably beneficial.
The probability is that any current global warming is not man-made and, in any case, it could be not be influenced by any remedial action, however drastic, taken by a minority of nations.
In a rational world, that prospect should be greeted with unmitigated joy.
If it is so:

All concern over CO2 as a man-made pollutant can be entirely discounted.
It is not essential to disrupt the western world’s economy.
The cost to the European economy alone is considered to be approx. £165 billion per annum until the end of the century, not including the diversion of employment and industries to elsewhere.
This deliberate economic self harm can be avoided and the vast resources could be spent on much more worthwhile endeavours.
If warming is happening, it provides a more benign climate for the biosphere and mankind.
Any extra CO2 has already increased the fertility of all plant life on the planet.
If warming is occurring at all, a warmer climate within natural variation would provide a future of greater opportunity and prosperity for human development, especially so for the third world.

2 Decarbonisation Outcomes

To quantify what may be achieved by political action for de-carbonization by Western economies, this comparative table below shows the remaining effectiveness of each 100 ppm increment up to 1000 ppmv, with the total global warming in each of the four diminution assessments.

Figure 4: Little impact for  trillions of dollars in cost.
The table below shows the likely range of warming arising from these divergent (sceptical and IPCC) views, (without feedbacks), that would be averted with an increase of CO2 for the full increase from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm. This table assumes that the amount of CO2 released by each of the world’s nations or regions is reduced universally by some 20%: this is a radical reduction level but conceivable.

Figure 5: Temperature reduction by nations, regions.
The results above for countries and country groups show a range for whichever scenario of only a matter of a few thousandths to a few hundredths of a degree centigrade. However it is extremely unlikely that the developing world is going to submit to non-development on the grounds of reducing CO2 emissions. So it is very likely that the developing world’s CO2 emissions are going to escalate no matter what is undertaken by developed nations.
These figures show that whatever the developing world does in terms of increasing CO2 emissions, the outcome is likely to be non-beneficial.
The extreme, economically destructive and immensely costly efforts by participating nations to reduce temperature by de-carbonization should be seen in context:

The changing global temperature patterns, the current pause and probable impending cooling.
The rapidly growing CO2 emissions from the bulk of the world’s most populous nations as they continue their development.
The diminishing impact of any extra CO2 emissions on any temperature increase.
Normal daily temperature variations at any a single location range from 10°C to 20°C.
Normal annual variations value can be as much as 40°C to 50°C.
Europe as a whole only accounts for approx. 11% of world CO2 emissions.
The UK itself is now only about approx. 1.5% of world CO2 emissions.

As the margin of error for temperature measurements is about 1.0°C, the miniscule temperature effects shown above arise from the extreme economic efforts of those participating nations attempting to control their CO2 emissions.  Thus the outcomes in terms of controlling temperature can only be marginal, difficult to detect and thus irrelevant.
The committed nations by their actions alone, whatever the costs they have incurred themselves, may only have virtually an undetectable reduction on world temperature.  So it is clear that all the minor but extremely expensive attempts to limit CO2 emissions undertaken by a few convinced western nations will in the end be inconsequential.
Professor Judith Curry’s congressional testimony 14/1/2014 [i]:
Motivated by the precautionary principle to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change, attempts to modify the climate through reducing CO2 emissions may turn out to be futile.  The stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15+ years demonstrates that CO2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales.”
Professor Richard Lindzen UK parliament committee testimony 28/1/2014 on IPCC AR5 [ii]:
Whatever the UK decides to do will have no impact on your climate, but will have a profound impact on your economy.  (You are) Trying to solve a problem that may not be a problem by taking actions that you know will hurt your economy.”
and paraphrased “doing nothing for fifty years is a much better option than any active political measures to control climate.”
It remains absolutely clear that our planet is vastly damaged by many human activities such as:

Truly toxic environmental pollution, (whatever is asserted CO2 is neither toxic nor a pollutant).
Over fishing.
Rain forest clearance, especially for the production of biofuels [iii][iv].
Biosphere destructive industrial farming at all levels.
Wild habitat destruction throughout the biosphere.
Many green and renewable energy activities actually detrimental to the environment, etc.

The world indeed should be strenuously finding ways to improve these situations.
But the unwarranted concentration on reducing CO2 emissions has deflected even well-meaning green activists and green-indoctrinated politicians from these more immediate and more worthwhile objectives.
As global temperatures have already been showing stagnation or cooling [v] over the last seventeen years, the world should fear the real and detrimental effects of global cooling [vi] rather than being hysterical about limited, beneficial or now non-existent warming [vii].
3 The Politics
It is clear that all the minor but extremely expensive attempts by the few convinced western nations at the limitation of their own CO2 emissions are inconsequential.
The IPCC acknowledges that the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentrations exists, but it does not explain its consequences. Like the Medieval Warm Period that the IPCC attempted to eliminate with the hockey stick graph in 2001, the IPCC knows that wide public knowledge of the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentration would be entirely detrimental to their primary message.
It is increasingly clear that policymakers and global warming advocates have long been headed down the wrong path.
Matt Ridley has a clear opinion on this:
So we are doing real harm now to impede a change that will not produce net benefits for 70 years. That’s like having radiotherapy because you are feeling too well.”
Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it all [xv]:
Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early twenty-first century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree, and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections combined into implausible chains of inference, proceeded to contemplate a roll-back of the industrial age.”
On the other hand, a cooling world as both Hemispheres have seen in the years since the turn of the millennium leads to much more dire consequences for the biosphere and mankind, than any realistic amount of warming that could arise from man-made CO2 emissions. The damage can be seen from the current 2014 winter weather in North America, Asia and Siberia and the significant cooling winters across Europe up to 2013.
Cold is a much greater threat than any moderate amount of additional warmth that would ever result from the release of Man-made CO2. National policy makers and the United Nations are neither recognizing nor are they preparing for a cooling eventuality.
With a quietening sun, changing ocean circulation patterns and the growing evidence of much colder winter weather in both Hemispheres, that cooling could already be upon us [xvi]. The cooling climate could well last for many decades or even centuries.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDieter Dürand and Sven Titz write at Germany’s flagship business weekly Wirtschaftswoche (English: Business Week) that it’s high time for a new climate policy in the wake of the massive IPCC failures.

Germany’s “Wirtschaftswoche” publishes unusually harsh article on IPCC science.
Fear-driven science is a failure
The authors write of scientists using “horror scenarios” to scare leaders into rash policymaking. Wirtschaftswoche cites three examples: hunger, war, and species extinction. They add:
The facts refute many end-of-world prophesies or at least greatly diminish them. …the time is ripe for a new climate policy.”
Wirtschaftswoche describes a science that has been dominated by doomsday-sayers and shoddy computer simulations and gives a list of examples of totally botched predictions.
The German business weekly is the latest in a string of German flagship media outlets to openly express skepticism and dissastisfaction with IPCC science and to harshly criticize IPCC results. Wirtschaftswoche writes:
Humbly and quietly the IPCC is forced to admit that the central mechanism for global warming is not functioning like the scientists said it would, at least for the time being. […] Even though CO2 concentrations are increasing like the scientists have said it would, global warming has paused for 15 years. No IPCC climate model had predicted that.”
Moreover, Wirtschaftswoche adds that “scientists are urgently scrambling for an explanation“:
One thing is clear, something cannot be right with the previous simulations. The climate is obviously reacting far less sensitively to the rise in greenhouse gases than feared.
Mann’s hockey stick among top 5 climate bloopers

Wirtschaftswoche also highlights the top 5 grossly blundered claims made by IPCC scientists: 1) increasing cyclone frequency, 2) the hockey stick chart, 3) rapidly melting sea ice, 4) melting Himalayan glaciers, 5) Africa threatened by starvation. All of these have turned out to be false, writes Wirtschftswoche.
On Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart: The magazine writes:
There’s a suspicion that scientists led by US climatologist Michael Mann ‘smoothed’ the climate curve in order to underscore drama.”
Wirtschaftswoche also expresses surprise that Antarctic sea ice is near record highs and that cyclones are not growing in frequency, and that the IPCC only mentions extreme weather frequency on the very fringes of its report. In summary the business weekly concludes that much is rotten with the current state of IPCC science, and thus it is indeed “time for a new climate policy“.
Richard Tol: all cost, no benefit
To be fair, Wirtschaftswoche insists that the risks of manmade climate change cannot be underestimated and that steps should be taken to curb emissions. But the authors also caution against throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Climate policy has to make sense, and this has not been the case, Wirtschaftswoche writes. The magazine cites economist Richard Tol:
Dutch environmental economist Richard Tol has compared the costs and benefits. By the year 2100 the EU will have pumped nearly 15 trillion euros into climate protection. That amount of money however brakes the temperature rise only 0.05°C.”
Moreover, Wirtschaftswoche writes stricter CO2 emission standards for automobiles would add 3600 euros to the price tag of each automobile, making mobility for the poor a daunting task.
Wirtschaftswoche has nothing against those who wish to protect the climate, but argues that “the means must be effective. In the end if both climate and the economy are driven into the ground, no one will be helped.”
Wirtschaftswoche’s top 6 doomsday sayers
Wirtschaftswoche also lists its top 6 doomsday-sayers of climate change: 6) Michael Mann: past climate like a hockey stick, 5) Angela Merkel: 4°C rise likely, 4) Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber: Sahara may extend to Berlin, 3) Nicholas Stern: worst climate in 30 million years, 2) Rajendra Pachauri: heatwave warnings, and no. 1 (no surprise here) Al Gore for his catastrophic sea level rise warnings.
It’s beginning to dawn on Germans that climate science has been much less about science, and much more about hoax. Expect more critical articles soon. The climate change issue is sinking faster than the Titanic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Schleswig Holstein Zeitung (SHZ) here features an interview with prominent IPCC climate scientist Professor Hans von Storch titled: A climate scientist against the spread of panic.
Hans von Storch also runs the respected Klimazwiebel blog and has at one time or another harshly criticized both sides of the climate debate. See yesterday’s NTZ story here.
Climate science losing its credibility
In the SHZ interview, the introduction writes as follows with regards to extreme weather events:
Climate scientists Hans von Storch, Director of the Helmholtz Center for Coastal Research in Geeshacht, fears that all of climate science will lose its credibility if panic keeps being spread.”
Haiyun no record storm
On whether Haiyun is a wake-up call for policymakers, von Storch reminds us that “extreme events are all part of normal weather” and that Haiyan was no record storm and that there has been no unusual increased frequency in the region over the last years. This storm can hardly be understood as a sign of man-made climate change.”
Models may have underestimated natural factors
On the models inadequate performance over the last 15 years, von Storch believes that the models may have underestimated natural factors like the sun, or that CO2 has been overrated. But he also says he sees no reason to discard the models altogether.
Acid rain scientists lost much of their credibility
Later in the interview von Storch gives his opinion on the acid-rain forest-die-off scare of the 1980s. He thinks that because of the unwarranted hysteria, few people today listen at all to forest scientists, and that he would prefer that “climate science should not become a Greenpeace arm of the government.”

Some scientists think they are keepers of the truth
Next the SHZ asks von Storch how it can be that some of his colleagues have succumbed to panic spreading. Hans von Storch:
We can think of other people in the 20th century who felt compelled to create a better world and who thought they were the keepers of a higher truth. In our case there are some that think they can derive this privilege from the scientific. Improving the world and people here mostly end up on the wayside.
I don’t believe this is the majority of climate scientists. There are a few especially visible climate scientists who are pushing such thoughts.”
Some climate scientists are abusing climate science
Hans von Storch then adds that he feels that “us scientists have to take the subject seriously and not to abuse it as a vehicle for fundamental world and population improvement.”
Fracking as an “effective bridge technology”
At the end of the interview, Hans von Storch offers some support for fracking, citing the USA’s fracking for natural gas, which he says has made a considerable contribution to “decreasing the US CO2 emissions” and calls it an effective bridge technology.
In Germany this measure is being almost unanimously rejected – obviously decreasing CO2 is ‘good’ only under certain conditions”.
In summary, more harsh criticism and even words of warning from Hans von Storch aimed at alarmist scientists and the overzealous policymakers who feel compelled to rush through a fundamental transformation of global society in a fit of panic.

========================================
New update: nofrakkingconsensus.com/look-again/
Greenpeace tweet from 17 September: “…we’ve got 4 boats in the water heading towards Gazprom’s Arctic rig. We’re going to try and stop the drilling.”
========================================
Online Spiegel today has an analysis by Benjamin Bidder and Christoph Seidler on the motives behind the detention of the 30 Greenpeace activists who tried to storm a Gazprom platform in September and the role of Russian politics. According to Spiegel, the story here is one of Russian energy behemoth Gazprom taking revenge on Europe for raids the EU had conducted on Gazprom European offices in 2011.
Spiegel reminds readers that Greenpeace was actually very much admired by Vladimir Putin, and that the environmentalist group until recently “enjoyed cover from the Kremlin“. Last year Greenpeace had even carried out a similar platform-climbing action in the Russian Arctic and had even used its strong connections to the Kremlin to facilitate the publicity-grabbing stunt. The stunt of 2012 was even led by Greenpeace director Kumi Naidoo himself (this year he stayed away). Spiegel also describes a number of special privileges Greenpeace seemed to enjoy with Putin’s government. Greenpeace seemed to have the Kremlin’s blessings.
But obviously something has gone terribly awry in the relations between Greenpeace, European environmentalism, and Russia. As the Greenpeace controversy sizzles, Putin is nowhere to be found on the issue and seems to have delegated the matter entirely to Russia’s justice authorities. Spiegel writes that the tone now appears to be one set by hardliners such as Alexander Prochanov, “one of the ideologues of Putin’s new, nationalistic course” who, according to Spiegel, openly said that they “regret not having blasted the dogs into the sky so that not a trace remains“. Another Russian politician accuses Greenpeace of “environmental extortion“.
So what happened?
Greenpeace claims that it all happened without warning. Spiegel writes that this year the FSB Russian special forces were waiting for the activists and were perfectly happy to watch them “impale themselves on an open knife“. Spiegel writes that according to Moscow-based CPI think-tank director Alexei Muchin, “Putin had nothing to do with it“. But for Gazprom, the “last bit of patience had been exhausted. The company not only wanted to send a message to Greenpeace, ‘but also to the European Union.’ The Commission among other actions had ordered raids of Gazprom offices“.
According to that linked Spiegel article from October 2011, with the Gazprom raids the EU wanted “to break Gazprom’s monopoly“, which was shown “by correspondence and documentation confiscated in an investigation within the scope of the raid from last Tuesday.”

One could speculate that this all seems to point to a very cunning trap set up by Moscow, whereby the Russians pretended to be still best of friends with Greenpeace even after the October, 2011 raid of Gazprom offices in Europe. This false charm in turn emboldened Greenpeace to believe they could get way with anything, even with protest activities in Russia. Finally, last month, Greenpeace activists ran straight into the trap and into FSB handcuffs.
This is all a very messy situation for Europe – and just how the Russians like it. For example Germany’s former socialist chancellor Gerhard Schroder sits on the board of a major Gazprom project, acting as one of the key facilitators who made the construction of the North European Gas Pipeline from Russia to Germany possible. Schroder, a close pal of Putin, was Germany’s chancellor from 1998 to 2005 in a coalition government with the German Green party. Does anyone expect Schroder to lift a finger against Gazprom? Moscow surely has that base covered to insure he never does, and one gets the sense that the Russians are at least a dozen moves ahead of Europe in this complex, multi-dimensional chess game.
What’s more, Spiegel adds that today Gazprom is very closely tied to the FSB, “The son of ex secret service director Nikolai Patruschev is Vice President of Gazprom Dobytscha Schelf, a subsidiary company for offshore production.” For the time being, Europe appears hopelessly outmatched in its chess game against Russia. They need to find a Bobby Fischer quickly.
In its latest move the EU now views the seizure of the Arctic Sunrise as a “hostile act“. Spiegel writes:
The ‘Arctic Sunrise’ is sailing under the Dutch flag and the government in Den Haag is losing patience.”
Dutch Foreign Minster Frans Timmermans has had his staff write a letter of complaint for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg, claiming that the storming of the Arctic Sunrise “was illegal” and that “the crew should be free until the matter is checked for human rights“. Spiegel adds:
We are giving the Russians time until Monday, says the Ministry. Then we will contact the judges in Hamburg. ‘We will be prepared.'”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language Spiegel magazine has lengthy piece on the crumbling climate science consensus. Yes folks, soon we’ll be hearing that 97% of all climate scientists say there is no consensus.
This Spiegel piece is tantamount to yet another cruise missile direct hit on alarmist climate science. The alarmist climate science bunker appears to have finally been breached. Now even IPCC scientists are abandoning ship.
The AR5 has not even yet been released and already it’s facing Cat 5 hurricane headwinds from major global media outlets. Keep in mind that Spiegel used to be as warmist as they came. Now they are as non-consensus as they come.
Warming Plateau? Climatologists Face Inconvenient Truth
Data shows global temperatures aren’t rising the way climate scientists have predicted. Now the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change faces a problem: publicize these findings and encourage skeptics — or hush up the figures.
For a quarter of a century now, environmental activists have been issuing predictions in the vein of the Catholic Church, warning people of the coming greenhouse effect armageddon. Environmentalists bleakly predict global warming will usher in plagues of biblical dimensions — perpetual droughts, deluge-like floods and hurricanes of unprecedented force.

The gig is up, my friends. It really is disintegrating.
