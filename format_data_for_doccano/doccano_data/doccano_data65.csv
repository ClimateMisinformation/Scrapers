"The number of electric cars in the world accelerated past the 2m barrier last year, as prices fell and manufacturers launched new models. The number of battery-powered vehicles numbered just hundreds globally in 2005 and passed the 1m milestone in 2015, but sales jumped 60% in 2016. China, the US and Europe accounted for more than 90% of electric vehicle sales last year, with China the single biggest market, according to research by the International Energy Agency. In some European countries, growth has been so fast that electric cars are taking significant market share from petrol and diesel cars.  Nearly a third of new cars sold in Norway are electric, the highest proportion worldwide, followed by 6.4% in the Netherlands and 3.4% in Sweden. While the UK lags behind on annual registrations, industry figures this week showed that a record 4.4% of new cars sold in May were hybrid or pure electric models. More than 100,000 electric cars have been sold in the UK under a grant scheme launched in 2011. The growth globally indicated a “rapid market evolution” in electric cars, the IEA said, but it cautioned that they made up only 0.2% of all passenger cars.  Greg Archer, clean vehicles director at the Brussels-based Transport and Environment group, said: “The rapid rise in electric vehicle sales is a consumer-driven phenomenon rather than being down to the efforts of suppliers.”  Decreasing costs, longer battery ranges and an increasing number of charging points were driving demand, he said. Worldwide, the IEA found there were 2.3m charging points, although public ones were outnumbered more than six to one, suggesting most drivers were recharging at home. The agency estimates that there will be 140m electric cars by 2030 globally if countries meet the Paris climate deal’s goal of avoiding dangerous temperature rises. Previous forecasts for the growth of the cleaner vehicles has been overly optimistic. Barack Obama hoped US drivers would have bought 1m by 2015, but the actual number was 280,000. In May, Angela Merkel admitted that her goal of 1m electric cars on Germany’s roads by 2020 would also be missed. However, the IEA said government policies to tackle air pollution and global warming would buoy electric cars.  The vehicles also got a boost this week from 10 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany and Japan, which have committed to an aspirational but non-binding target of 30% of market share for electric vehicles by 2030. Oil companies have been sceptical about the impact electric cars will have on oil demand. BP projected this year that even with a hundred-fold growth in electric cars by 2035, oil demand will still be growing.  However, the company’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, said recently that in the 20 years “obviously sales of electric vehicles will accelerate”. Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP’s chairman, told shareholders at the group’s AGM in May that the company would benefit from producing the gas to generate electricity for the increasing number of battery-powered cars."
"Actualmente sumido en una crisis de agua potable, Chile enfrenta las consecuencias de las políticas de la dictadura del Gral. Augusto Pinochet que pusieron casi todos los suministros de agua dulce y los servicios relacionados con el agua del país en manos de las corporaciones multinacionales. Pero la solución a esta crisis, que está empeorando, la tiene un inopinado grupo de maestros canadienses.  En 1981, el código de agua de Pinochet re-definió a este recurso como un bien comercializable. Desde entonces, las corporaciones han podido presentar ofertas para el uso de los derechos estatales del agua, para su reventa mediante un sistema de asignación basado en el mercado, con mínimo control por parte del gobierno. Sólo unos cuantos otros países han apostado por una reducción tan drástica del control del estado sobre los recursos de agua.  El sistema de mercado ha creado conflictos sobre los recursos hídricos y la pérdida de derechos de agua de las comunidades indígenas, como los atacameños, quienes perdieron el acceso a vastas cantidades de agua que sustentaban sus modos de vida y actividades culturales a lo largo del río Loa. Asimismo, Chile cuenta con la mayor cantidad de servicios privatizados de agua y saneamiento en el mundo; el 95.8% de la población utiliza servicios privados. Sin embargo, globalmente, más del 90% de los servicios de agua y saneamiento son financiados y gestionados públicamente gracias a una feroz oposición al manejo del agua con fines de lucro, que típicamente resulta en tarifas más altas y menos rendición de cuentas.  Alrededor del mundo, han habido comunidades que han detenido la privatización del agua y los servicios de saneamiento; el Transnational Institute, una ONG holandesa, ha documentado los casos de 235 comunidades que, entre 2000 y 2015 [pdf], recuperaron el agua, devolviéndola a manos de los poderes públicos [pdf].  Una creciente oposición a la privatización en Chile ha seguido esta tendencia pero con un giro inesperado. El Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (Plan de Pensión de Maestros de Ontario, u OTPP por sus siglas en inglés) es actualmente el inversionista más grande en materia de agua y saneamiento en Chile, con participación mayoritaria en tres grandes servicios de agua chilenos – Essbio, Esval y Aguas del Valle – controlando el 41% del sector.  Chile cuenta con cobertura de agua casi universal; el 99% de la población utiliza una fuente mejorada de agua potable. La casi total universalidad a menudo se pone como un ejemplo de los beneficios de la privatización, pero ésta en realidad se logró mediante la financiación pública [pdf], antes de que el sector fuera privatizado. A pesar de que, durante la era de Pinochet, otros bienes públicos fueron vendidos, el estado continuó realizando grandes inversiones en el agua y saneamiento, el cual fue el último sector en privatizarse. Las corporaciones privadas heredaron sistemas en buen funcionamiento en 1999: en ese momento las políticas de la era de Pinochet habían creado un ambiente altamente favorable para los inversionistas privados, incluyendo una tasa de beneficio del 7% garantizada. En medio de los patrones meteorológicos extremos vinculados con el cambio climático, las inversiones en las mejoras y el mantenimiento de la infraestructura por parte de los servicios financiados por la OTPP no cumplen con los lineamientos chilenos. Los registros gubernamentales de Chile muestran [pdf] que Aguas del Valle invirtió tan sólo 49% del mínimo recomendado en 2014, mientras que Essbio y Esval invirtieron 75% y 64%. Y todo esto mientras que las tarifas de agua son más altas en Chile que en cualquier otro lugar de Latinoamérica. Mientras tanto, los servicios corporativos han mantenido el derecho de determinar a qué áreas dar provisión, lo que ha resultado en varias “zonas sin servicio” fuera de los rentables centros urbanos. Éstas a menudo son dirigidas por voluntarios de la comunidad, en un esquema sin fines de lucro, mediante asociaciones conocidas como Agua Potable Rural (APR). En la provincia de Petorca, donde el agua es escasa, las concesiones por parte del estado para la extracción del agua exceden los recursos disponibles. En el pueblo de Cabildo, los pequeños agricultores reclaman que un permiso concedido a Esval ha causado grandes impactos en sus propios suministros de agua, pero sus esfuerzos legales para rescindir el acceso de Esval no han tenido éxito. Mientras tanto, las APR, que opera con recursos insuficientes en las zonas del área sin servicio, muchas veces se quedan sin agua durante los períodos de sequía.  Ricardo Sanguesa Botella, presidente de la asociación local de irrigadores, y Modatima, la red regional de pequeños agricultores, aseveran también que cuando las fuentes de agua se secan durante la temporada de sequía, Esval compra agua de pozos ilegales – aquellos que operan sin licencia – con el fin de proveer agua por medio de camiones de emergencia. Al ser contactados para pedir un comentario, Esval dijo: “Chile, y específicamente el área de Petorca, se han visto afectadas por sequías severas durante los últimos ocho años. Enfrentar este escenario ha significado un gran esfuerzo por parte de nuestra empresa, y gracias a un trabajo arduo logramos para nuestros clientes un suministro continuo sin alteraciones. Durante este periodo, tuvimos que reforzar nuestra producción con la contribución de fuentes externas. Contamos con proveedores externos que, como requisito básico, poseen derechos de aprovechamiento de aguas subterráneas en la zona, las cuales garantizan su operación; así aseguramos que la fuente de agua esté en orden y cumpla con la legislación vigente.” Sin embargo, la obtención del agua por medio de pozos ilegales es un problema que va en aumento en Chile, ya que las multas impuestas son muy bajas para ser un factor disuasivo eficaz. Además, el estado chileno no supervisa los orígenes del agua transportada en camiones por compañías privadas durante los períodos de crisis. El mito del éxito del modelo chileno ha sobrevivido porque las consecuencias de la privatización han sido menos severas que en otros países más pobres. Pero a medida que los beneficios de las décadas de fuerte inversión pública van escaseando, y la realidad del cambio climático se hace evidente, los servicios privados están siendo expuestos. Varios grupos de justicia del agua en Chile – tales como Modatima, Fundación Terram y ChileSustentable – están exigiendo poner fin a la privatización, pero no será fácil arrebatar el poder de las manos de las corporaciones en la era de los acuerdos de libre comercio. Chile ha firmado 26 acuerdos comerciales cubriendo 62 países, incluyendo Canadá, desde finales de la década de 1990. Estos acuerdos instauran los derechos de las corporaciones, que tienen el poder de demandar a Chile si el gobierno intenta endurecer la normativa. Recientemente, grupos ambientalistas, sindicatos y organizaciones comunitarias chilenas han colaborado con el Council of Canadians para poner de manifiesto el papel de la OTTP en la crisis de agua de Chile. Pero la interacción entre mercados de agua, servicios privados, el cambio climático y el derecho humano al agua es compleja. En lugar de luchar por un retiro inmediato de las inversiones, los grupos de justicia del agua piden que los maestros de Ontario se unan a la discusión en torno a una transición justa y sostenible del control privado del agua hacia el control público en Chile. El primer paso tomado es firmar una petición pidiendo a la OTPP sumarse al diálogo con los grupos chilenos para explorar estrategias, así como un plazo realista para devolver el agua y saneamiento a las manos de los poderes públicos. La crisis del agua en Chile es compleja, pero ofrece una oportunidad única a los maestros canadienses para apoyar al creciente movimiento anti-privatización, y ayudar a liberar a los chilenos de las cadenas de la era de Pinochet.

"Increasingly vulnerable “chokepoints” are threatening the security of the global food supply, according to a new report. It identifies 14 critical locations, including the Suez canal, Black Sea ports and Brazil’s road network, almost all of which are already hit by frequent disruptions. With climate change bringing more incidents of extreme weather, analysts at the Chatham House thinktank warn that the risk of a major disruption is growing but that little is being done to tackle the problem. Food supply interruptions in the past have caused huge spikes in prices which can spark major conflicts. The chokepoints identified are locations through which exceptional amounts of the global food trade pass. More than half of the globe’s staple crop exports – wheat, maize, rice and soybean – have to travel along inland routes to a small number of key ports in the US, Brazil and the Black Sea. On top of this, more than half of these crops – and more than half of fertilisers – transit through at least one of the maritime chokepoints identified. “We are talking about a huge share of global supply that could be delayed or stopped for a significant period of time,” said Laura Wellesley, one of the authors of the Chatham House report. “What is concerning is that, with climate change, we are very likely to see one or more of these chokepoint disruptions coincide with a harvest failure, and that’s when things start to get serious.” The chokepoints are already suffering repeated disruptions, the report found. US inland waterways and railways, which carry 30% of the world’s maize and soy, were hit by flooding that halted traffic in 2016 and a 2012 heatwave that kinked rail lines and caused derailments.  The Panama canal has been hampered by drought, while the Suez canal has been closed by sandstorms and threatened by attempted terrorist bomb attacks. Brazil’s muddy roads are often closed by heavy rain, with 3,000 trucks stranded earlier in 2017, while its vital southern ports have been closed by storms and floods. The only chokepoint that has not recently been disrupted is the Straits of Gibraltar, which connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic.  The Middle East and North Africa region is particularly vulnerable, the report found, because it has the highest dependency on food imports in the world and is encircled by maritime bottlenecks. It also depends heavily on wheat imports from the Black Sea. In 2010, a severe heatwave in Russia badly hit the huge grain harvest, leading the government to impose an export ban. As a result, prices spiked in 2011 and this was a significant factor in the Arab Spring conflicts. Other factors were important too, said Wellesley, but she said: “At the start, it was about the price of bread.” The risks posed by the chokepoints is rising as the international trade in food is growing but also because of global warming, according to the report. It says climate change is bringing more storms, droughts and heatwaves which can block chokepoints and also damage already ageing infrastructure. But it is also likely to fuel armed conflicts, which can also shut down the bottlenecks. Other countries especially at risk from disruption are poorer nations reliant on imports such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Sudan, as well as richer nations like Japan and South Korea, according to the report.  China is also a major importer but it has done the most to mitigate its exposure to chokepoint risk, the report found. It has diversified its supply routes, for example building a railway across South America to lessen reliance on the Panama canal. Chinese companies also own and operate ports around the world. The report recommends increased global cooperation to plan for food supply crises and more investment in crucial infrastructure. Wellesley said: “The straits of Hormuz [which Iran has threatened to close] is a really interesting example of where the energy sector is sitting up and taking notice – the food sector should be doing the same. Those same countries that rely on Hormuz to export their oil rely almost entirely on the same strait for their food supply.”"
"Labor could support the government’s proposed low emissions target (LET), the party’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, has said, but wants conditions to achieve policy certainty and ensure it can be scaled up to meet more ambitious emissions targets. In an interview on Radio National on Tuesday, Butler reiterated comments to Guardian Australia that the opposition would consider supporting what he called the “second best” option to Labor’s emissions intensity scheme.  The comments suggest Labor could accept a compromise position designed by the government to limit greenhouse gas emissions and achieve investment certainty for power generation, despite hostility from Coalition conservatives to any mechanism that directly prices carbon. Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is expected to recommend a low-emissions target in his report to the Council of Australian Governments on Friday.  The target would require that a percentage of electricity be generated annually from “low-emissions” sources, effectively working in practice as a technology-neutral renewable energy target. On Monday the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, warned that the government’s policy had to change, because doing nothing would drive up power prices. After telling Guardian Australia that Labor had an open mind on the LET, Butler said on Tuesday it was “not going to pretend that this is not a second-best option”. He argued there was an “extraordinary consensus” that an emissions intensity scheme was the “first best way forward” but Malcolm Turnbull had been unable to convince the Coalition of its merits. Butler said the proposal was still unclear because there were two options, one involving a subsidy to particular types of clean energy and the second involving trading of clean energy certificates.  “There will be some conditions that we match this model – again. There has to be enduring reform. If we’re going to junk a policy that we took to the election, then we’ll want to be confident this is something that will stand the test of time. “[We’ll want this to] be something that does end the investment strike and is able to be scaled up into the future as Australia has to lift its level of ambition.” Butler said an LET, or clean energy target, could do that but it was important to get its design right and Labor would consult industry to do so. Asked if the opposition would accept the LET to avoid a scare campaign on power prices against Labor’s policy , Butler said it was responding to the business community saying “enough is enough” and demanding a long-term policy solution. The uncertainty of Australia’s carbon policy has caused reduced investment in electricity generation, including in renewable energy, pushing up prices. Butler said the Business Council of Australia and Australian Industry Group’s support for a LET had been “heavily qualified”.  “They want to see what the design is, they want to ensure this is a long-term enduring framework that will not be up for change after the next election – that’s what we want as well.” Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt, warned on Tuesday that any new LET cannot be weaker than John Howard’s proposal in 2007, which defined a “low-emissions” energy source as one that emitting fewer than 200kg of greenhouse gas per megawatt of electricity generated. He said if gas and coal-fired power stations qualified as clean energy the government will have “capitulated to the Trumps” on its backbench. “We might as well all pack up and go home, because it’s game over for the climate and the planet.” Asked if coal with carbon capture and storage could be part of the mix, Butler said it could be a “very low carbon source or zero carbon source” but it had not been built at scale anywhere in the world. Last week the Turnbull government began a move to overhaul rules governing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to allow the so-called “green” bank to invest in carbon capture and storage technology. Butler said that “in theory” carbon capture and storage could be part of the mix. “The problem is, though, the government expects a technology that hasn’t even begun to crawl yet suddenly to be foisted upon a bank [the CEFC] that requires a commercial rate of return – it’s a hollow gesture.” Frydenberg’s advocacy for a new emissions policy and Labor’s openness to a LET come after an internal breakout within the Coalition to follow the US president, Donald Trump, in withdrawing from the Paris climate treaty. Compounding the government’s difficulties, the Minerals Council of Australia has signalled it will oppose a new regulation that would “deliberately cast aside coal from the energy mix”."
"Very soon, a large portion of an ice shelf in Antarctica will break off and collapse into the ocean. The name of the ice shelf is Larsen C; it is a major extension of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and its health has implications for other ice in the region, and sea levels globally. How do we know a portion is going to collapse? Well, scientists have been watching a major rift (crack) that has grown in the past few years, carving out a 5,000 sq km section of floating ice, nearly the size of Delaware. The speed of the crack has increased dramatically in the past few months, and it is nearly split through.  Project Midas provides frequent updates on the Larsen C shelf. You can read a summary there, which reports: In the largest jump since January, the rift in the Larsen C Ice Shelf has grown an additional 17 km (11 miles) between May 25 and May 31 2017. This has moved the rift tip to within 13 km (8 miles) of breaking all the way through to the ice front, producing one of the largest ever recorded icebergs. The rift tip appears also to have turned significantly towards the ice front, indicating that the time of calving is probably very close. The rift has now fully breached the zone of soft ‘suture’ ice originating at the Cole Peninsula and there appears to be very little to prevent the iceberg from breaking away completely. When it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10% of its area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded; this event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula. We have previously shown that the new configuration will be less stable than it was prior to the rift, and that Larsen C may eventually follow the example of its neighbor Larsen B, which disintegrated in 2002 following a similar rift-induced calving event.  Dr Stefan Rahmstorf provided me an excellent image from his book Our Threatened Oceans. This image shows prior breakup of regions A and B (along with the location and size of part C). Why does all this matter? Well it is important for a number of reasons. First, when an ice shelf melts or collapses, it can unpin other ice that is sitting on land, which allows it to flow more quickly into the ocean. It is this secondary effect – the loss of ice resting on land – that changes the rate of sea level rise. Loss of a major ice shelf can also activate ice that rests on bedrock topography that makes it fundamentally unstable – ice that, once moving, will move faster and faster, until a large region is afloat.  The entire Larsen Ice shelf, which is the fourth largest in Antarctica, covers nearly 50,000 square km (20,000 square miles) according to reporting at ABC science. The ice on the land upstream of the shelf is enough to raise sea level, eventually, by 10cm. This is not, by itself, a major threat to the world’s coastlines, but it reveals the path that other, even larger areas are likely to take in the future. Perhaps a quotation from a seminal work on Antarctic ice sheets best sums up the situation. In a 1978 paper, John Mercer from the Institute of Polar studies concluded:  One of the warning signs that a dangerous warming trend is under way in Antarctica will be the breakup of ice shelves on both coasts of the Antarctic Peninsula, starting with the northernmost and extending gradually southward. These ice shelves should be regularly monitored by Landsat imagery.  Why is part of the ice shelf going to break off and collapse into the ocean? Since large calving events are so rare, and since our measurements in and around ice shelves don’t go back in time far enough, it’s hard to say whether this is a natural progression, variability, or a result of human activity (or more likely a mixture of both). One reason may be human-caused warming, which has led to melting from both above and below in nearby areas and is widely accepted to have contributed to the disintegration of nearby Larsen A and Larsen B. The Western Antarctic (the parts south of the US) is warming quite quickly, faster than most of the planet. In addition, warmer waters can reach underneath the ice shelf and can melt it from below. That being said, there are vigorous discussions within the scientific community about how much, if any of this can be attributed to humans. Some scientists think there is strong connection; others are much less sure and see little or no evidence that humans are the cause. From my vantage point, part of this relates to our limited ability to measure what’s going on, and part of this is a common sticking point of whether an absence of evidence is evidence of an absence.  I’ve heard from multiple differing views on this very topic while preparing this post. From my research and experience in climate science as well as in many other areas of research where risk analysis and evidence are weighed, we should assume that human-caused warming is having an effect. We can measure the incredible amount of heat that is being stored in the oceans as well as the increase in temperatures that have occurred over the Western Antarctica and changes to the ocean currents in the region – there must be some implications to the health of the ice. The real question, in my mind, is how much of the effect is humans? That is something a lot more research will be required for answering. What we are really concerned about isn’t just this breaking event that will occur quite soon. We are more concerned about the rest of the Larsen C ice shelf. Will it disintegrate when the protective shelf is gone? If it does disintegrate, will the ice up-land follow suit, and flow into the oceans thereby further increasing sea levels? When people ask, how much will sea levels rise by 2100, my answer is “one meter”. Why do experts think this when we’ve only had a fifth of that over the past 100 years? Sea level rise is accelerating – it’s getting faster and faster as the accumulated heat from greenhouse gases takes hold. Part of the reason for the acceleration is phenomena such as ice shelf loss. It may take a while for an ice shelf to melt but when it does, the losses occur quickly. Just a week or so after President Trump withdrew from the world’s best hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, the consequences keep stacking up. One of the unstoppable consequences of melting ice and rising seas is the inundation of coastal communities. In the US, Miami is our bellwether city. It is a large city built on the coast, and it will be devastated by rising seas. You cannot build a sea wall around Miami – the porous substrate means that water will just soak up from below. As Miami deals with a devastating one meter of sea level rise by 2100, they can thank their senator Marco Rubio along with Donald Trump.  Marco Rubio has long argued against taking action on climate change and he has even supported anti-environmental decisions made by Trump. Now, because of rising sea levels, even very high tides are causing flooding in Miami. I cannot imagine what another one meter of sea level will do. But, certainly there will be a lot of money spent and resources lost dealing with this problem that could have been avoided. "
"The Global Seed Vault, built in the Arctic as an impregnable deep freeze for the world’s most precious food seeds, is to undergo a multi-million dollar upgrade after water from melting permafrost flooded its access tunnel. No seeds were damaged but the incident undermined the original belief that the vault would be a “failsafe” facility, securing the world’s food supply forever. Now the Norwegian government, which owns the vault, has committed $4.4m (NOK37m) to improvements.  The vault is buried 130m inside a mountain in the Svalbard archipelago and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. The vault was opened in 2008, sunk deep into the permafrost, and was expected to provide protection against “the challenge of natural or man-made disasters” and “to stand the test of time”. But the vault’s planners had not anticipated the extreme warm weather seen recently at the end of the world’s hottest ever recorded year. “The background to the technical improvements is that the permafrost has not established itself as planned,” said a government statement. “A group will investigate potential solutions to counter the increased water volumes resulting from a wetter and warmer climate on Svalbard.” One option could be to replace the access tunnel, which slopes down towards the vault’s main door, carrying water towards the seeds. A new upward sloping tunnel would take water away from the vault.  A former Svalbard coal miner, Arne Kristoffersen, told the Guardian most coal mines on the islands had upward sloping entrance tunnels: “For me it is obvious to build an entrance tunnel upwards, so the water can run out. I am really surprised they made such a stupid construction.” Hege Njaa Aschim, the Norwegian government’s spokeswoman for the vault, said: “The construction was planned like that because it was practical as a way to go inside and it should not be a problem because of the permafrost keeping it safe. But we see now, when the permafrost is not established, maybe we should do something else with the tunnel, so that is why we have this project now.” An initial $1.6m will be spent on investigating ways to improve the access tunnel, with the group’s conclusions delivered in spring 2018. “They are going in with an open mind to find a good solution,” said Aschim. “$4.4m is for all the improvements we are doing now.” The vault cost $9m to build. A transformer station, which gives off heat, has already been moved out of the tunnel, and drainage ditches are to be dug into the mountainside above the seed vault, to channel melt water away from the tunnel. A waterproof wall is also to be constructed inside the access tunnel to provide extra protection for the seed vault itself. “The measures form part of a long-term plan to provide additional security to the seed vault, based on a precautionary approach,” said the government statement. The vault was supposed to be able to survive without the need for human intervention, but is currently being watched 24 hours a day, with pumps readied to remove any water. Aschim said the seeds would remain safe at the -18C temperature in the deep vault: “But to be sure, and to take precautions in case something happens, we are doing these other measures now to protect the seeds from anything.” Kristoffersen began work in 1980 in coalmine Number 3, which later became the site of a pilot seed storage project that preceded the construction of the Global Seed Vault. He said he took part in an initial planning meeting for the seed vault but was not involved in the subsequent development of the plans. “The whole reason for the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard in the permafrost area is it has to be self sufficient, in case of a really big disaster in the world,” he said. “[If] all the humans in the lower part of the world are destroyed, perhaps a 100 years later the survivors can come here and find the seeds. The seeds will be OK as they are in the [deep] permafrost layer. But as it is today, the whole entrance will be filled up with water and this will freeze and it will be blocked after a few years, so it will not be possible to get into the seed vault. There will be a big iceberg in the tunnel.” “The solution is easy and I give it for free,” Kristofferson said. “Make a new access tunnel going upward so the water can run out, not into the seed bank. It is not very hard, but it will cost a lot of money.”"
"As humans put ever more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, the Earth heats up. These are the basics of global warming. But where does the heat go? How much extra heat is there? And how accurate are our measurements? These are questions that climate scientists ask. If we can answer these questions, it will better help us prepare for a future with a very different climate. It will also better help us predict what that future climate will be. The most important measurement of global warming is in the oceans. In fact, “global warming” is really “ocean warming.” If you are going to measure the changing climate of the oceans, you need to have many sensors spread out across the globe that take measurements from the ocean surface to the very depths of the waters. Importantly, you need to have measurements that span decades so a long-term trend can be established.   These difficulties are tackled by oceanographers, and a significant advancement was presented in a paper just published in the journal Climate Dynamics. That paper, which I was fortunate to be involved with, looked at three different ocean temperature measurements made by three different groups. We found that regardless of whose data was used or where the data was gathered, the oceans are warming. In the paper, we describe perhaps the three most important factors that affect ocean-temperature accuracy. First, sensors can have biases (they can be “hot” or “cold”), and these biases can change over time. An example of biases was identified in the 1940s. Then, many ocean temperature measurements were made using buckets that gathered water from ships. Sensors put into the buckets would give the water temperature. Then, a new temperature sensing approach started to come online where temperatures were measured using ship hull-based sensors at engine intake ports. It turns out that bucket measurements are slightly cooler than measurements made using hull sensors, which are closer to the engine of the ship. During World War II, the British Navy cut back on its measurements (using buckets) and the US Navy expanded its measurements (using hull sensors); consequently, a sharp warming in oceans was seen in the data. But this warming was an artifact of the change from buckets to hull sensors. After the war, when the British fleet re-expanded its bucket measurements, the ocean temperatures seemed to fall a bit. Again, this was an artifact from the data collection. Other such biases and artifacts arose throughout the years as oceanographers have updated measurement equipment. If you want the true rate of ocean temperature change, you have to remove these biases. Another source of uncertainty is related to the fact that we just don’t have sensors at all ocean locations and at all times. Some sensors, which are dropped from cargo ships, are densely located along major shipping routes. Other sensors, dropped from research vessels, are also confined to specific locations across the globe.  Currently, we are heavily using the ARGO fleet, which contains approximately 3800 autonomous devices spread out more or less uniformly across the ocean, but these only entered service in 2005. Prior to that, temperatures measurements were not uniform in the oceans. As a consequence, scientists have to use what is called a “mapping” procedure to interpolate temperatures between temperature measurements. Sort of like filling in the gaps where no data exist. The mapping strategy used by scientists can affect the ocean temperature measurements. Finally, temperatures are usually referenced to a baseline “climatology.” So, when we say temperatures have increased by 1 degree, it is important to say what the baseline climatology is. Have temperatures increased by 1 degree since the year 1990? Since the year 1970? Since 1900? The choice of baseline climatology really matters. In the study, we looked at the different ways that three groups make decisions about mapping, bias, and climatology. We not only asked how much the oceans are warming, but how the warming differs for various areas (ocean basins) and various depths. We found that each ocean basin has warmed significantly. Despite this fact, there are some differences amongst the three groups. For instance, in the 300-700 meter oceans depths in the Pacific and Southern oceans, significant differences are exhibited amongst the tree groups. That said, the central fact is that regardless of how you measure, who does the measurements, when or where the measurements are taken, we are warming. The lead author, Dr. Gonjgie Wang described the importance of the study this way:  Our study confirms again a robust global ocean warming since 1970. However, there is substantial uncertainty in decadal scale ocean heat redistribution, which explains the contradictory results related to the ocean heat changes during the “slowdown” of global warming in recent decade. Therefore, we recommend a comprehensive evaluation in the future for the existing ocean subsurface temperature datasets. Further, an improved ocean observation network is required to monitor the ocean change: extending the observations in the boundary currents systems and deep oceans (below 2000-m) besides maintaining the Argo network.  In plain English, it will be important that we keep high-quality temperature sensors positioned throughout the oceans so in the future we will be able to predict where our climate is headed. We say in science that a measurement not made is a measurement lost forever. And there are no more important measurements than of heating of the oceans."
"Renewable energy capacity around the world was boosted by a record amount in 2016 and delivered at a markedly lower cost, according to new global data – although the total financial investment in renewables actually fell. The greater “bang-for-buck” resulted from plummeting prices for solar and wind power and led to new power deals in countries including Denmark, Egypt, India, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates all being priced well below fossil fuel or nuclear options. Analysts warned that the US’s withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement, announced last week by Donald Trump, risked the US being left behind in the fast-moving transition to a low-carbon economy. But they also warned that the green transition was still not happening fast enough to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, especially in the transport and heating sectors. The new renewable energy capacity installed worldwide in 2016 was 161GW, a 10% rise on 2015 and a new record, according to REN21, a network of public and private sector groups covering 155 nations and 96% of the world’s population. The new record capacity cost $242bn, a 23% reduction in investment compared to 2015, and renewables investment remained larger than for all fossil fuels. Subsidies for green energy, however, are still much lower than those for coal, oil and gas.  New solar power provided the biggest boost – half of all new capacity – followed by wind power at a third and hydropower at 15%. It is the first year that the new solar capacity added has been greater than any other electricity-producing technology.  “A global energy transition [is] well under way, with record new additions of installed renewable energy capacity, rapidly falling costs and the decoupling of economic growth and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the third year running,” said Arthouros Zervos, chair of REN21.  “Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement is unfortunate,” said Christine Lins, executive secretary of REN21. “But the renewables train has already left the station and those who ignore renewables’ central role in climate mitigation risk being left behind.” Vivien Foster, global lead for energy economics at the World Bank, said: “Over 2016 there has been a dramatic and sustained improvement in the competitiveness of renewable power generation technologies. The most spectacular renewable energy prices were revealed through auctions that are gaining in popularity in many countries.” Renewable energy capacity in 2016 rose 17% to 921GW, excluding hydropower, and rose 8.7% to 2,017GW when including hydropower.  At the end of 2016, more than 24% of global electricity was produced by renewables, dominated by hydropower and with wind contributing 4.0% and solar 1.5%. For all energy, renewable energy – excluding traditional wood-burning – contributed 10%, overshadowed by the 80% coming from fossil fuels such as oil and gas. Lins said the switch to green energy needed to speed up and, crucially, start converting transport, heating and cooling to renewable sources. “The world is in a race against time,” she said. Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who delivered the Paris agreement and is now convenor of Mission 2020, said: “The economic case for renewables as the backbone of our global energy system is increasingly clear and proven. Offering ever greater bang-for-buck, renewables are quite simply the cheapest way to generate energy in an ever-growing number of countries.” But to start bringing global carbon emissions down, she said, “the uptake of renewables needs to happen faster across all nations. This is a race to the top and the cost of being left behind is significant. As the US waivers on its commitment to climate action, those who turn their back on renewables risk being left behind.” • This article was amended on 7 June 2017. An earlier version of the graphic attached to this article said “new renewable power capacity”. This has been changed to “total renewable power capacity”."
"Hundreds of people across the UK are likely to be killed by a natural disaster this week, but their deaths will not be the subject of ministerial statements or newspaper reports, even though a failure of government policy is partly responsible. The heatwave conditions are causing preventable deaths partly because large swaths of the population wrongly believe that extremely hot days are becoming less common.  While the hot weather is not as obviously newsworthy as the recent terrorist attacks or the Grenfell Tower fire, it should be treated as a national emergency that is every bit as serious. Public Health England warned on Friday before the high temperatures over the weekend that “for some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, the summer heat can bring real health risks”. It drew attention to the Heatwave Plan for England, published in May 2015, noting that there were about 2,000 “excess deaths” during the heatwave in August 2003, with 680 more in summer 2006 and 300 killed in 2009. The lethalness of heatwaves is often hidden because the total number of deaths is not reported until many months after they have happened. In its annual report last November on deaths over the previous 12 months, an analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that, while there were markedly more deaths during the winter, a spike in casualties was evident on 19 July 2016. On that date, there were 1,661 deaths recorded in England, compared with the five-year daily average of 1,267. The ONS pointed out that this peak coincided with the hottest day of the year, with maximum temperatures of 31C in some parts of the country. Public Health England on Monday raised the level of its “heat-health watch” in anticipation of further hot weather this week, with the Met Office forecasting daytime temperatures of more than 30C across parts of the country. The level-three amber warning, one level below a national emergency, advises people to stay out of the sun, keep homes cool, and check that anyone “at special risk” knows how to cope with the conditions. However, the Committee on Climate Change has highlighted a worrying lack of understanding of heatwave risks which is increasing the number of people that succumb in hot weather. The 2014 progress report to parliament by its adaptation sub-committee found that heat contributes to about 2,000 premature deaths each year in the UK, and that this figure could rise to about 7,000 annually in the 2050s due to the impact of climate change and population growth. It concluded that “the uptake of measures to increase cooling capacity in existing homes is currently very low”, and suggested that this may be because “the public appear to perceive that heatwaves and hot weather have become less common over time”. It cited research on a representative sample of the UK public who believed that hot weather had become less common during their lifetimes. The study did not explore the influence of coverage of extreme weather by the UK media. Many national newspapers and broadcasters have downplayed the risks of heatwaves and flooding by amplifying the false claims of climate change sceptics that there has been no increase in extreme weather events. Nevertheless, the Met Office has indicated that the UK appears to be warming more quickly than the global average and refers to research showing that “the maximum daily temperature and minimum daily temperature in the UK have risen by just over 1C since the 1950s”, adding that “there is a suggestion that the warmest daily temperature extremes are rising faster in summer, whereas the coldest daily temperature extremes are rising faster in winter”. In its assessment two years ago of the government’s National Adaptation Programme, the Committee on Climate Change warned that “there is low awareness amongst the general public about how the risks from heat are changing”. It recommended that the updated version of the programme, due to be published in January 2018, “should contain specific actions to increase public awareness of the risks of climate change, with lead responsibility for increasing awareness assigned to a single department”. However, the government’s response rejected the committee’s advice. Subsequent cuts to the funding for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – which has lead responsibility for ensuring the nation’s resilience to climate change – and the Environment Agency have eliminated most activities aimed at increasing public awareness of the risks of climate change impacts in the UK. The last few environment secretaries have largely ignored the importance of climate change adaptation. Will Michael Gove break with the dismal record of his predecessors and try to save lives by raising public awareness about the growing risks of heatwaves and other impacts of climate change?"
"Jeremy Corbyn has hit back against Theresa May’s attempt to portray him as unpatriotic and soft on terrorism, condemning as “utterly ridiculous” and “offensive” her claim that he “doesn’t believe in Britain”. As the campaign enters its final furlong, the Labour leader said he would not indulge in personal insults, despite the relentless mud-slinging from senior Tories – but accused the prime minister of exploiting her position to politicise the London Bridge terrorism attacks. May sought to shore up Tory support with a series of attacks on the Labour leader last week, claiming in a speech on Brexit that he “doesn’t believe in Britain” days after saying he would be “alone and naked in the negotiating chamber” when Brexit talks begin on 19 June. But Corbyn dismissed her remarks as “complete nonsense” in an interview with the Guardian. “I want us to play a constructive role in the world. I want us to have a decent and harmonious community in Britain. Does that make me anti-British in some way? It’s a ridiculous argument. It’s utterly ridiculous. Actually it’s offensive,” he said. As he travelled across north-east England in Labour’s battlebus at the close of a month-long campaign that has seen May’s poll lead narrow sharply, Corbyn said that if he won on Thursday he would: • Contact Donald Trump and urge him to retract his “unacceptable” remarks about London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan. • Call Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on Friday to kick off Brexit talks, saying his win would give him a mandate to negotiate tariff-free trade. • Set a date for a quick budget to implement key policies, including lifting the public sector pay cap.  • Confront Saudi Arabia over its funding for terrorist groups. May and her team have sought to refine their campaign message to the simple claim that she would make a better job of defending Britain’s interests in Brexit talks. But Corbyn said he would strike a constructive tone with the German chancellor and French president on Friday morning, in contrast to a combative speech by May last month when she accused Brussels of meddling in Britain’s election. “We will immediately guarantee rights of EU nationals living in Britain unilaterally,” Corbyn said. Of Merkel, he said: “I would hope she would make sure the same would be done for British nationals in her country and Europe but this is not a negotiation; we would do it anyway.” He said he would invite the German chancellor to the Emirates stadium to watch his team Arsenal in an effort to develop a friendly relationship. “With Angela Merkel, we can discuss football and Brexit. I want to say to her that I like the German fanbase model [of running football clubs]. Then I’ll invite her to come and watch Arsenal.” Dismissing fresh claims by the Conservatives that he is against “shoot-to-kill”, Corbyn said he supported the actions of armed police who shot dead the three London Bridge attackers on Saturday night. “They were defending themselves and defending innocent people. It was a proportionate response,” he said, describing their actions as “defensive shooting”. He has remained sanguine in the face of the blows levelled against him throughout the election campaign, describing himself several times as “monsieur Zen”.  “There is a lot of negative campaigning against me, but the best way of dealing with a negative campaign is to be positive,” he said. He deplored May’s decision to make what he called a “political speech” outside No 10 Downing Street on Sunday, setting out new policies on tackling terrorism just hours after the attack on London. Unlike in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing a fortnight earlier, Corbyn said the Conservatives had refused to engage with Labour about whether to suspend election campaigning as a mark of respect and for how long. “May chose to make a political speech in the middle of the day – which I thought was inappropriate. It should have waited until the evening as I did,” he said. Corbyn caused a flurry of excitement on Monday after telling an ITV interviewer that he backed calls, including from David Cameron’s former adviser Steve Hilton, for the prime minister to resign over her record as home secretary in light the latest terrorist attacks. But he played down his earlier remarks, blaming the furore on “the kind of excitement that happens during an election campaign, between different buses in different parts of the country, held together by the umbilical thread of a mobile phone signal”. He said: “What I want is for her to be held to account. There are many very responsible people, fire service, police, many others, who are very concerned about how she performed as home secretary – presiding over 20,000 cuts to the police and the underfunding of the prisons service. The problems of the prisons have got to be addressed as well. There are a lot of people who in normal circumstances if she was still home secretary would be calling for her resignation. I’m just saying: hold her to account at the election on Thursday.” Asked if he was going to win on Thursday, Corbyn did not hesitate before responding: “Yes.” He said the campaign had “changed completely” from the start, when Labour trailed the Tories by more than 20 points in the polls. “We are getting an enormous amount of cut through,” he said. “This is the Labour party at its best. The support is very, very strong.” Corbyn has previously been pressed on whether he would resign if Labour lost, as Ed Miliband did in 2015. He said his team would “apologise for nothing” because they had done everything they could to try to win the election. He claimed the election boiled down to the Conservatives cutting services and leaving “lots of young people shortchanged and older people isolated and not cared for”. Corbyn said he was keen to confront the US president about global warming. “One of my first conversations with Donald Trump will be about climate change,” he said, claiming that US support for the Paris climate agreement, which the president is planning to withdraw, was crucial. “A lot of people worked very hard to get India and China on board. To have achieved that, it is very sad that the US president decides to remove them from it.” However, Corbyn said there was time to persuade Trump to reconsider. “It is going to take them a few years to withdraw anyway.” Corbyn said a phone call to the US president, which he would make quickly after taking office if he won the election, would include a reaction to Trump’s misleading Twitter attack on Khan for telling people not to be alarmed by the presence of extra police on the streets after Saturday’s terrorist attack. “I would ask him if he would kindly reconsider that,” the Labour leader said. “It is not acceptable to make those sort of remarks about someone who has been elected to be mayor of our biggest city.” Corbyn described his own style of leadership as featuring two key traits: never to indulge in personal attacks and to reach out beyond those who originally supported his first attempt to take over at the helm of the party.

"Farmers have been obsessed with weather for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks and Babylonians sought guidance on planting and harvest by surveying the sky for patterns in clouds and stars and by communing with gods – through prayers and animal sacrifices. Modern-day farmers, such as Steve Pitstick, a fifth-generation farmer in Illinois, count on sophisticated instruments for predicting the weather instead. During the planting season, Pitstick says, he checks the weather forecast three or four times a day. Too much rain means he can’t plant because the heavy machinery will compact the wet soil, smothering the seeds; too little and the seeds won’t germinate. “Weather is huge in our business. We use the forecast during planting season to get a sense of what we’re doing and to know the level of urgency to get the crops planted,” says Pitstick, who grows corn and soybeans. Weather is big business in many other industries, too, and an ambitious plan is underway to revamp the country’s weather forecast system. It’s the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, the first major weather legislation that Congress has passed since the early 1990s. The legislation empowers the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to boost its ability to predict major weather-related events, such as hurricanes, droughts, floods and wildfires. To accomplish that, NOAA plans to use new technology and data and to work more closely with academic and industry groups. It will also aim to improve the public warning system, such as issuing alerts earlier or using new technology for broadcasting those messages. NOAA, which runs the National Weather Service, is the primary government agency that collects and analyzes weather data. It holds the world’s largest archive of weather and climate data, which is widely used by other public agencies, businesses and academic institutions. For example, solar and wind farm operators rely on weather data to help them forecast their electricity generation. Some tech and insurance companies rely on NOAA data to develop the software for predicting crop yields or flood risks. The forces of nature can cause a heavy financial toll. Even routine weather such as rain and cooler-than-average days can have an annual economic impact of as much as $485bn in the US, as it affects every economic sector, the National Center for Atmospheric Research says. Some industries see more impact than others. For airlines, weather caused 32.05% of flight delays, according to March data from the Bureau of Transportation statistics. One minute of a delayed flight costs airlines $65 on average, according to Airlines for America, an advocacy group. Already, the US experienced five weather and climate disasters where losses exceeded $1bn between 1 January and 6 April this year, says the National Centers for Environmental Information. “I think the whole economy is going to benefit” from the new law, says Barry Lee Myers, chief executive officer of Accuweather. Industries such as transportation, which may see fewer delays in moving goods to stores and less food spoilage, he notes. The new law doesn’t inject more money into NOAA’s budget; it simply directs NOAA to prioritize weather research, says Keith Seitter, executive director of the American Meteorological Society. Congress will have to decide whether to fully fund the research over the next five years. Weather prediction has improved since humans began methodically catalog and analyze their observations. Five-day forecasts today are as accurate as four-day forecasts were 10 years ago. Using faster, more powerful computers and more detailed data of weather patterns could increase the accuracy, Seitter says.  “If you look back through time and look at the improvements in our forecasting capabilities, it tracks pretty tightly with bigger, faster computers. Every time there’s an upgrade in computing power, the models become better and more accurate and that improves the forecasting process,” he says. NOAA already collects massive amounts of data from sources including its own satellites. But lawmakers want the agency to save money by paying for private data rather than launching new satellites, especially when an increasing number of private satellites have be dispatched in recent years, some capturing different or richer sets of data than those from government satellites. “I think using the data from private satellite sources and private instrumentation, we can perhaps make in a relatively short period some nice advances in tech and nice advances in our forecasting ability,” says House Republican Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, a sponsor of the weather legislation. The new law directs NOAA to improve forecasts ranging from two weeks to two years, which has traditionally been a benchmark for weather prediction for farmers. The current atmospheric models provide highly accurate forecasts for up to 10 days, says Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a consortium of more than 100 colleges and universities in North America. To extend that, meteorologists will start including measurements such as heat stored in the oceans and soil moisture levels on land. Heat influences the intensity of storms and rainfalls and moves slower through oceans than it does in the air. Using additional heat data will help meteorologists better understand how earth interacts with its atmosphere. The resulting longer-term weather cycles will then help them build computer models that create more accurate seasonal forecasts, Busalacchi says. “It’s something we don’t do routinely right now. That’s why it’s a whole new era of forecasting capability,” he says.  Results from closer research collaboration could have significant business impacts. Jeff Waters, a climate expert and product manager at RMS, which assesses risks of catastrophic events from hurricanes to terrorism, says the new research can help his firm to better calculate risks and design more effective responses for his customers, which include insurance companies. Waters notes that after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, more than 10 insurance companies became insolvent because they weren’t prepared to handle the severity of the damage caused by the storm. Businesses have been able to access accurate, customizable weather forecasting online only in the last decade or so, says Bill Gail, chief technology officer at private forecaster Global Weather Corporation. Xcel Energy, who uses Gail’s firm to anticipate wind energy production, improved its wind forecasting accuracy by nearly 35% from 2009 to 2015. That improvement contributed to $60.6m in fuel savings (fuels that would otherwise be needed to keep natural gas power plants ready in case the wind farms didn’t produce enough to meet demand).  Weather forecasting data is still underused, Gail says, citing a study by the US Department of Transportation showing weather-related delays adds $3.4bn to freight costs annually. Even “if you could only reduce the impact of severe weather by 5 or 10%, the economy will grow in a noticeable way. It’s huge,” Gail says."
"  This story was a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity and StateImpact Oklahoma, a reporting project of NPR member stations in Oklahoma. Jennifer Merritt’s first graders at Jefferson elementary school in Pryor, Oklahoma, were in for a treat. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, the students gathered for story time with two special guests, Republican lawmakers Tom Gann and Marty Quinn. Dressed in suits, the two men read aloud from “Petro Pete’s Big Bad Dream,” a parable in which a Bob the Builder-lookalike awakens to find his toothbrush, hard hat and even the tires on his bike missing. Abandoned by the school bus, Pete walks to Petroville elementary in his pajamas. “It sounds like you’re missing all of your petroleum by-products today!” Pete’s teacher, Mrs Rigwell, exclaims, extolling oil’s benefits to Pete and fellow students like Sammy Shale. Before long, Pete decides that “having no petroleum is like a nightmare!” The tale is the latest in an illustrated series by the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board, a state agency funded by oil and gas producers. The board has spent upwards of $40m over the past two decades on providing education with a pro-industry bent, including hundreds of pages of curriculums, a speaker series and an after-school program – all at no cost to educators of children from kindergarten to high school. A similar program in Ohio shows teachers how to “frack” Twinkies using straws to pump for cream to emulate shale drilling. A national program sponsored by companies including BP and Shell claims it’s too soon to tell if the earth is heating up, but “a little warming might be a good thing”. Decades of documents reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity reveal a tightly woven network of organizations that works in concert with the oil and gas industry to paint a rosy picture of fossil fuels in America’s classrooms. Led by advertising and public-relations strategists, the groups have long plied the tools of their trade on impressionable children and teachers desperate for resources. Proponents of programs like the one in Oklahoma say they help the oil and gas industry replenish its aging workforce by stirring early interest in science, technology, engineering and math. But some experts question the educational value and ethics of lessons touting an industry that plays a central role in climate change and air pollution. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, likened industry-sponsored curriculums that ignore climate science to advertising. “You’re exploiting that trusted relationship between the student and the teacher,” he said. Leiserowitz – whose research has focused on how culture, politics and psychology impact public perception of the environment – said fossil-fuel companies have a stake in perpetuating a message of oil dependency. As early as the 1940s, the industry’s largest and most powerful lobby group targeted schoolchildren as a key element of its fledgling marketing strategy. By the 1960s, the American Petroleum Institute was looking to shake its reputation as a “monopoly which reaped excessive profits” and set out to cultivate a network of “thought leaders” that included educators, journalists, politicians and even clergy, according to an organizational history copyrighted by API in 1990. The idea caught on. Hundreds of oil-and-gas-centric lesson plans are now available online, walking a blurry line between corporate sponsorship and promotion at a time when climate science has increasingly come under siege at the highest levels of government. On 1 June, Donald Trump, flanked by EPA administrator – and former Oklahoma attorney general – Scott Pruitt, announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Oklahoma is among a dozen states that have opted for watered-down versions of Next Generation Science Standards, a joint effort by states and educational organizations to revamp science teaching that has met with political backlash since 2013. The Oklahoma version strips provisions on evolution and the human causes of global warming. Along with Colorado, Kansas and Montana, Oklahoma legislators have also championed bills requiring educators teach “both sides” of those scientific concepts. A 2016 study confirmed that America’s youth receive “mixed messages” on climate change. Nearly a third of middle-and-high-school science teachers nationwide have wrongly suggested global warming is naturally occurring. A quarter have spent as much time rebutting evidence of warming as they have presenting it. Schools and libraries across Oklahoma have received more than 9,000 complimentary copies of Petro Pete’s Big Bad Dream since it was published last year. The story has been a hit with Jennifer Merritt’s students, who won the storytelling visit from lawmakers last November after submitting a Facebook photo to the energy resources board. Posing on a jungle gym, the students clutched stuffed animals and footballs – their “favorite petroleum by-products”. “It’s not some boring thing,” Merritt said of the board’s “Little Bits” curriculum for children up to age eight, which features alliterative characters like Freddie Fuelless and Oliver Oilpatch. Without it, she said, “I probably wouldn’t have taught first graders about energy.” Merritt is one of 14,000 Oklahoma teachers who have attended workshops on how to use the board’s “innovative, one-of-a-kind science and energy curriculum in their classrooms.” Participants are reimbursed for supplies year-round and can register their classes for free museum field trips – so long as the exhibits highlight petroleum. On a recent Saturday, a workshop was in session at Choctaw high school, east of Oklahoma City. The parking lot was bustling as teachers loaded their cars with heavy tubs, each stuffed with up to $1,200 worth of calculators, lab equipment and other materials. In classrooms, some teachers plotted oil-production trends while others watched bubbling brews simulating how the industry wrings oil from depleting fields. In an email, board chairman Danny Morgan wrote that the organization doesn’t use public funds and “does not function like a typical agency”. Under state law, half of its revenues from oil and gas producers are spent restoring abandoned oil wells. Morgan pointed to a board safety campaign aimed at preventing children from playing on dangerous pumpjacks that dot the state, writing, “if just one child is kept safe through the awareness this program created, it is well worth the effort.” While the board’s curriculum enlightens students about the benefits of “black gold,” their teachers are hard-pressed to find any information on climate change or other drawbacks of fossil fuels – even as Oklahoma struggles to curb a slew of man-made earthquakes tied to its fracking boom. Morgan, an oil company executive and a former state legislator, declined to say why the board’s materials fail to address global warming. Cheerleading for the industry has been central to the energy resources board’s mission from the start. Lawmakers created the board in 1993 as a “privatized” state agency funded by a voluntary tax on local oil and gas producers to publicize the industry. Kansas, Illinois and Ohio followed suit with similar legislation. But Oklahoma remains the epicenter of oil-industry puffery in the classroom. The board’s curriculums are used in an estimated 98% of Oklahoma school districts and have been adopted in neighboring Kansas. Records show that the board’s programs and pro-industry ads have been held out as models to trade groups and legislators in Montana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Wyoming and Texas. Oklahoma’s board appears to have taken cues from the American Petroleum Institute – the country’s leading oil and gas lobby group, representing more than 625 companies. The plot of Big Bad Dream bears uncanny similarities to API’s 1996 educational film, “Fuel-less: you can’t be cool without fuel”. Records show that the board’s education director, who wrote Big Bad Dream, has ordered hundreds of copies of “Fuel-less” to distribute locally – most recently in 2013. API did not respond to requests for comment. API’s vice-president of communications delivered a special presentation to the board in 2012 on marketing strategies. The same year, an API lobbyist asked the board to host a fracking workshop on its behalf as part of the trade group’s effort to reach out to legislators, regulators and other stakeholders nationwide. Morgan wrote that the board did not participate in the workshop because API “never followed up on the request.” He added that the board itself doesn’t engage in lobbying. Copied on API’s communications with the energy resources board was Bill Whitsitt, a Devon Energy executive who helped draft Pruitt’s letters during his tenure as Oklahoma attorney general. In 2014, the New York Times reported on Pruitt’s extensive industry ties — which included oil and gas companies, utilities and lobby groups.  As the state’s legal chief, Pruitt vociferously litigated against environmental regulations like the Clean Power Plan, branding them job killers and federal overreach. Devon Energy has been cited as an early beneficiary of rollbacks under Pruitt’s watch since he took the helm of the EPA in late January. Carla Schaeperkoetter, the energy resources board’s education director, is the creator of “Big Bad Dream” and “Lab Time with Leo” – a video series featuring a bowtie-wearing scientist not unlike Bill Nye the Science Guy. Instead of exploring fundamentals like the solar system, Leo delves into the nuances of oil refining, teaching kids as young as eight about “fractional distillation” and “residuals.” Schaeperkoetter doesn’t have any teaching experience and isn’t a state employee. Board staff, including Schaeperkoetter, are consultants hired by a private foundation affiliated with the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. The state trade group is listed as a partner of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a lobbying organization that worked closely with API to roll back federal rules on fracking. Schaeperkoetter’s name appears on curriculums reassuring teachers that “companies are spending more dollars protecting the environment than drilling new wells.” A jump-rope rhyme reads, “We need oil. We need gas. Where are the oil products in our class?” And a high school guide asks students to create 30-second commercials on how “oil and natural gas will help America be energy independent”. Charles Anderson – a professor at Michigan State University who studies environmental literacy and develops curriculums – said the board materials are upfront about their pro-industry agenda but only tell “half the story” by omitting global issues like climate change in favor of niche oil knowledge. “The children of Oklahoma are getting a raw deal – they are getting educationally ineffective materials teaching content that will be of little use to them if they want to leave the state,” Anderson said. Students also are being sold short in more immediate ways: an increasing number of Oklahoma districts are adopting four-day school weeks amid budget cuts due partly to tax breaks for the petroleum industry. “The state government of Oklahoma, in its wisdom, has decided that oil and gas companies should have a whole lot of money and schools should have hardly any money,” Anderson said. “That’s a social decision that values oil and gas extraction over the public good of public schools.” Oklahoma’s state department of education promotes energy board lessons online and in newsletters. Though the curriculums are described by the board as having been developed in “a collaborative effort” with the state, the education department has “not reviewed, endorsed or had any oversight” over the materials in two decades, spokeswoman Anne Price said. “We value curricula that align to our state standards and are at no cost to educators, but ultimately we encourage educators to investigate further to choose what is best for their classrooms,” Price wrote in an email. Without explicit guidance, experts say, it’s difficult for educators to assess which materials are appropriate – especially elementary-school teachers who don’t have extensive science training. Historically, energy curriculums have been scarce. “This provides an opportunity for anyone who has a particular point of view, whether it’s an oil company or an environmental concern,” said David Evans, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association, which co-developed the Next Generation Science Standards. The standards specify which concepts students should grasp by grade level – like the greenhouse effects of gases like carbon dioxide and methane – but don’t provide curriculums, leaving educators to find or create lessons themselves. So far, the standards have been adopted by 18 states and the District of Columbia. When it comes to climate change, Evans urges teachers to stick to facts and avoid politics. “Science is about understanding the physical world that we live in,” he said. “We wouldn’t say, ‘Why should people understand gravity?’” But education is inherently political, said Nicole Colston, a researcher at Oklahoma State University who has studied overlap between groups that push against evolution and climate change education. “It’s this implied thing that you can’t talk about climate change,” she said of her interviews with Oklahoma teachers. “It’s almost, like, impolite or uncomfortable.” Prominent Oklahomans like Pruitt and Republican US senator James Inhofe are climate-science deniers, a fact not lost on the state’s residents. Just 46% of adult Oklahomans believe global warming is caused by human activities, below the national average of 53%, according to 2016 data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. In 2014, Oklahoma lawmakers tried but failed to block the state board of education from adopting its version of Next Generation Science Standards. The same year, a state law was passed to give local school districts ultimate authority over curriculums. Merritt said she chose to use energy resources board materials because they were age-appropriate, factual, and free. “It’s just a way of life,” she said of the curriculum’s laser focus on petroleum. “We live in Oklahoma. There’s a lot of oil.” Joe Wertz, a reporter with StateImpact Oklahoma, contributed to this story                                      "
"Nearly a third of the world’s population is now exposed to climatic conditions that produce deadly heatwaves, as the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere makes it “almost inevitable” that vast areas of the planet will face rising fatalities from high temperatures, new research has found. Climate change has escalated the heatwave risk across the globe, the study states, with nearly half of the world’s population set to suffer periods of deadly heat by the end of the century even if greenhouse gases are radically cut.   “For heatwaves, our options are now between bad or terrible,” said Camilo Mora, an academic at the University of Hawaii and lead author of the study. High temperatures are currently baking large swaths of the south-western US, with the National Weather Service (NWS) issuing an excessive heat warning for Phoenix, Arizona, which is set to reach 119F (48.3C) on Monday.  The heat warning extends across much of Arizona and up through the heart of California, with Palm Springs forecast a toasty 116F (46.6C) on Monday and Sacramento set to reach 107F (41.6C).  The NWS warned the abnormal warmth would “significantly increase the potential for heat-related illness” and advised residents to drink more water, seek shade and recognize the early symptoms of heat stroke, such as nausea and a racing pulse.  Mora’s research shows that the overall risk of heat-related illness or death has climbed steadily since 1980, with around 30% of the world’s population now living in climatic conditions that deliver deadly temperatures at least 20 days a year.  The proportion of people at risk worldwide will grow to 48% by 2100 even if emissions are drastically reduced, while around three-quarters of the global population will be under threat by then if greenhouse gases are not curbed at all. “Finding so many cases of heat-related deaths was mind blowing, especially as they often don’t get much attention because they last for just a few days and then people moved on,” Mora said. “Dying in a heatwave is like being slowly cooked, it’s pure torture. The young and elderly are at particular risk, but we found that this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone.” The study, published in Nature Climate Change, analyzed more than 1,900 cases of fatalities associated with heatwaves in 36 countries over the past four decades. By looking at heat and humidity during such lethal episodes, researchers worked out a threshold beyond which conditions become deadly. This time period includes the European heatwave of 2003, which fueled forest fires in several countries and caused the River Danube in Serbia to plummet so far that submerged second world war tanks and bombs were revealed. An estimated 20,000 people died; a subsequent study suggested the number was as high as 70,000.  A further 10,000 died in Moscow due to scorching weather in 2010. In 1995, Chicago suffered a five-day burst of heat that resulted in more than 700 deaths. However, most heat-related deaths do not occur during such widely-covered disasters. Phoenix, for example, suffered an unusually hot spell last June that resulted in the deaths of at least four people. Hyperthermia, an excess of body heat, can lead to heat stroke and a potential inflammatory response that can kill.  Mora said the threshold to deadly conditions caries from place to place, with some people dying in temperatures as low as 23C. A crucial factor, he said, was the humidity level combined with the heat. “Your sweat doesn’t evaporate if it is very humid, so heat accumulates in your body instead,” Mora said. “People can then suffer heat toxicity, which is like sunburn on the inside of your body. The blood rushes to the skin to cool you down so there’s less blood going to the organs. A common killer is when the lining of your gut breaks down and leaks toxins into the rest of your body.” Global warming is a potent instigator of deadly heat, with research from University of California, Irvine this month finding the probability of a heatwave killing in excess of 100 people in India has doubled due to a 0.5C increase in temperature over the past 50 years.  “The impact of global climate change is not a specter on the horizon. It’s real, and it’s being felt now all over the planet,” said Amir AghaKouchak, UCI associate professor and co-author of that study.  “It’s particularly alarming that the adverse effects are pummeling the world’s most vulnerable populations.” Elevated temperatures and dry conditions have been exacerbated by the clearing of trees, which provide shade and cooling moisture, in urban areas. Mora said that while adaption such as government heat warnings and the increased use of air conditioning has helped reduce deaths, this was not a viable long-term solution. “The heat means that we are becoming prisoners in our own homes – you go to Houston, Texas in the summer and there’s no-one outside,” he said.  “Also, the increased use of air conditioning means that electrical grids fail, as has happened in New York City, Australia and Saudi Arabia. We need to prevent heatwaves rather than just trying to adapt to them.”"

"Greater emissions reductions and delivering on the Paris climate agreement are now “the only opportunity” to save coral reefs the world over from decline, with local responses no longer sufficient, a report by Unesco has found. The first global scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on the 29 world heritage-listed coral reefs, published on Saturday, found that the frequency, intensity and duration of heat-stress events had worsened with increasing global warming, with massive consequences for the 29 world heritage sites. The reported level of coral die-off can hardly be seen by anyone to be acceptable Analysis of recent studies and newly-developed data from the US national ocean and atmospheric administration (NOAA) coral-reef watch showed that 13 of the 29 listed reefs had been exposed to levels of heat stress that cause coral bleaching, on average more than twice per decade from 1985 to 2013. Bleaching had occurred more frequently in recent years than in decades prior, with coral mortality during the third global bleaching event from mid-2014 to mid-2017 “among the worst ever recorded”. Twenty-one listed sites had suffered severe and/or repeated heat stress in the last three years. Compounding the devastating impact of bleaching – which can take coral communities at least 15 to 25 years to recover from – were more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, increasing ocean acidification, and pollution. The Great Barrier Reef, “one of the world’s most iconic coral reef systems” and among four of the total 29 listed located in Australia, had been “seriously affected” by back-to-back severe bleaching events this year and last, despite considerable investment in efforts to build resilience. Professor Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council centre of excellence for coral reef studies in Townsville, provided an analysis of bleaching records for the report. “It basically makes the point that everywhere is bleaching,” he said. “It’s certainly not a phenomenon only on the Great Barrier Reef.” Australia’s scientific community had appealed to the UN world heritage committee to list the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger” last year. Hughes said this was “not on the current agenda”, as the committee awaited the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s third outlook report due in 2019. The Unesco report found that local efforts to increase reefs’ resilience “remain necessary but are no longer sufficient” without complementary national and international efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – the most ambitious target set by the Paris agreement, and understood to be the maximum possible to secure coral reefs’ long-term survival. “We need all of the above,” said Jon Day, a former director with the Great Barrier marine park authority, now at James Cook University. “We can’t just assume local responses are enough, and they must be augmented by global’s efforts too.” He said while the world heritage convention aimed to “transmit the world heritage values” of listed sites for future generations, a natural system would inevitably change with time. “The question is what is acceptable change, and the reported levels of coral bleaching and coral mortality can hardly be considered by anyone to be acceptable.” The report found that, if emissions were to follow their current trajectory and not decline – similar to a “business-as-usual scenario” – 25 of the 29 world heritage reefs (68%) would suffer severe bleaching twice per decade by 2040, rapidly killing most corals present and preventing successful reproduction necessary for their recovery. Reducing emissions so that they peak around 2040 and then decline would reduce that number of affected sites to 14 (48%), and allow an extra 12 years, on average, for them to recover.  Hughes said the prospects of coral reefs’ long-term survival was at a crossroads, with the worst-case scenario able to be avoided only “if we quickly adopt the 1.5C target”.  “1.5C or 2C degrees won’t be a particularly comfortable place for reefs – they will still see quite regular bleaching and they will be different to how they were 15 or 20 years ago – but they will be able to survive.” He said he was optimistic about reefs’ prospects, given that the business-as-usual path was looking “increasingly unlikely” as cities and states the world over moved to exceed federal or commonwealth commitments to curbing emissions. A draft decision prepared by Unesco, to be addressed by the world heritage committee at its meeting in Krakow in Poland from 2 to 12 July, had stated the report’s findings were of “utmost concern”. But Day said it was “very disappointing” that the draft decision only committed to further studies at this stage: “How much evidence do they need?”"

"It could have been the edge of the Sahara or even Death Valley, but it was the remains of a large orchard in the hills above the city of Murcia in southern Spain last year. The soil had broken down into fine white, lifeless sand, and a landscape of rock and dying orange and lemon trees stretched into the distance. A long drought, the second in a few years, had devastated the harvest after city authorities had restricted water supplies and farmers were protesting in the street. It was a foretaste of what may happen if temperatures in the Mediterranean basin continue to rise and desertification grows. All round the world, farmers, city authorities and scientists have observed changing patterns of rainfall, temperature rises and floods. Fifteen of the 16 hottest years have been recorded since 2000. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions steadily climb. Oceans are warming and glaciers, ice caps and sea ice are melting faster than expected. Meanwhile, heat and rainfall records tumble. The evidence for the onset of climate change is compelling. But who and where is it hitting the hardest? How fast will it come to Africa, or the US? What will be its impact on tropical cities, forests or farming? On the poor, or the old? When it comes to details, much is uncertain. Mapping the world’s climate hotspots and identifying where the impacts will be the greatest is increasingly important for governments, advocacy groups and others who need to prioritise resources, set goals and adapt to a warming world. But lack of data and different priorities make it hard. Should scientists pinpoint the places most likely to see faster than average warming or wetter winters, or should they combine expected physical changes with countries’ vulnerability? Some hot-spot models use population data. Others seek to portray the impacts of a warming world on water resources or megacities. Global bodies want to know how climate might exacerbate natural hazards like floods and droughts. Economists want to know its impacts on resources. Charities want to know how it will affect women or the poorest. What follows is a subjective appraisal of the seven most important climate hotspots, based on analysis of numerous scientific models and personal experience of observing climate change in a variety of places. Delta regions, semi-arid countries, and glacier- and snowpack-dependent river basins are all in the frontline. But so, too, are tropical coastal regions and some of the world’s greatest forests and cities. For Wolfgang Cramer, scientific director of the Mediterranean Institute for Biodiversity and Ecology in Aix-en-Provence, France, climate change impacts are already visible not only in the vicinity of Murcia, but across much of the Mediterranean basin. If pledges to cut emissions are not met, catastrophe looms. He and his colleague Joel Guiot, a paleoclimatologist, last year studied pollen locked in layers of sediment over the past 10,000 years and compared them with projections about climate and vegetation from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If warming is allowed to rise to 2C, the scientists concluded, much of southern Spain and the Mediterranean basin could become desert. Their paper, published in Science, was shocking because it showed that even a small temperature increase could be enough to create ecological havoc in a very heavily populated region with relatively wealthy countries. They warned that North African countries would see increased temperatures and drought that would drive the southern deserts further north; that deserts would expand in the Middle East, pushing temperate forests higher into the mountains; and that ecosystems not seen in the Mediterranean basin in more than 10,000 years could develop. “We are more certain of the drying trend in the region than almost anywhere else on the planet. Temperatures have risen 1C globally but 1.4C in the Mediterranean region. The trend is for it to become ever warmer,” says Cramer. Increasing temperature, he says, drives droughts. “More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means rising temperatures, less precipitation and then more drying that leads to desertification.” Meanwhile, water stress, heat waves and an extended drought linked to climate change in the eastern Mediterranean has been widely implicated in the long Syrian war and an underlying driver of conflict in Middle East and North African countries. The World Resources Institute concurred in 2015 that the Mediterranean basin was a climate hotspot when it placed 14 of the world’s 33 most water-stressed countries in 2040 in the Middle East and North Africa region. “Drought and water shortages in Syria likely contributed to the unrest that stoked the country’s 2011 civil war. Dwindling water resources and chronic mismanagement forced 1.5 million people, primarily farmers and herders, to lose their livelihoods and leave their land, move to urban areas, and magnify Syria’s general destabilisation,” it said. The fast-growing, heavily populated region is climatically vulnerable, it concluded. The food supplies and the social balance of places like Palestine, Israel, Algeria, Lebanon and Jordan are all highly sensitive to even a small change in water supplies. As climate change intensifies, communities face grave threats from both droughts and floods. The combined impact of many more people, higher temperatures and changing weather patterns on the region’s already scarce freshwater resources poses further potential for conflict. But optimists hope it could force compromise between competing states and water users. Rural areas already have no option but to switch to more efficient irrigation systems and drought tolerant crops, and urban areas are learning to conserve water. I met Honufa soon after she arrived in Dhaka 10 years ago. Erosion and saltwater intrusion on her family’s land on one of the low-lying islands in the mouth of the Ganges River had forced the young Bangladeshi woman to leave her village for the capital. She had taken a boat and then an overnight bus and ended up in a slum called Beribadh. Honufa is a climate refugee, one of thousands who have struggled to grow their crops. Millions are likely to follow her if current trends continue. “In the next 20 years we would expect five to 10 million people to have to move from the coastal areas,” says Saleemul Huq, director of the Bangladesh-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development. “The whole country is a climate hotspot, but the most vulnerable area is the coast. Dhaka is the place where people head to,” he says. Huq, who has advised the Bangladesh government at successive UN climate summits, says there is strong evidence that climate change is now impacting Dhaka. “Temperatures have already gone up by 1C. We can see that the weather patterns have changed. Ask anyone in the street, and they will say the frequency of floods has changed. Bangladesh has a long history of floods, but what used to be a one-in-20-year event now happens one year in five. It is what we would expect with climate change models.” Huq and other Bangladeshi climate scientists expect to see more extremes. “Changing rain patterns suggest we will not get more rain over the coming years but it will be distributed differently, with less in the dry season and more during the monsoons. Paradoxically, this will lead to more floods and droughts, and heavier monsoons,” he says. “We are beginning to see sea levels rising and increased salinity in coastal areas. It is a slow onset, which will get worse. It is a climate change phenomenon and not something we had before.” Huq leads research into how Bangladesh can adapt to climate change. “We’ve done a lot of research looking at the most vulnerable hotspots. We are learning by doing,” he says. “Government has now invested in a major climate change action plan. To counter coastal salinity there is a big program of rainwater harvesting and coastal protection. Scientists are developing saline-tolerant rice. People and government are proactive. “The trouble is that we are always catching up with the problem. There is a limit to what we can grow. At some point we will run out of options, then people will have to move. We know that if we don’t take action people will all end up in Dhaka, so [we] need to invest in other towns and cities.” Late last year, the temperature in southern Malawi in southern Africa rose to more than 46C. A long regional drought crossing Zimbabwe, Zambia, Madagascar and Tanzania had scorched and killed the staple maize crop and millions of people who had not seen rain for more than a year depended on food aid. Long-term climate data in southern Africa is sparse, but studies backed by oral evidence from villagers confirm the region is a climate hotspot where droughts are becoming more frequent, rains less regular, food supplies less certain, and the dry spells and floods are lasting longer. With more than 90% of Malawi and the region depending on rain-fed agriculture, it does not need scientists to tell people that the climate is changing. I sat down with villagers near Nsanje in the south of Malawi. “I know what it is to go hungry,” says Elvas Munthali, a Malawian aid worker. “My family depended on farming. The climate is changing. Now we plant maize at the end of December or even January; we used to do that in November.” Patrick Kamzitu, a health worker in Nambuma, says: “It is much warmer now. The rains come and we plant but then there is a dry spell. The dry spells and the rains are heavier but shorter.” One of best studies comes from the Chiwawa district near Nsanje, close to the Mozambique border. Detailed research by the University of Malawi, backed by 50 years of rainfall and temperature data, established that rains, floods, strong winds, high temperatures and droughts were all becoming more common. The story is more or less repeated across southern Africa and backed by governments and scientific modeling. USAid, the African Development Bank, the World Bank and IPCC assessments suggest average annual temperatures rose nearly 1C between 1960 and 2006. Looking ahead, scientists expect average annual temperatures across southern Africa to soar, possibly as much as 3C by the 2060s, to 5C by the 2090s – a temperature that would render most human life nearly impossible. But estimates vary greatly. Rainfall, says USAid, could decrease in some places by 13% and increase in others by 32%. All African countries know that they must adapt their farming, restore their forests, improve their water supplies and grow their economies quickly to have any chance of surviving climate change. But the adaptation money pledged to these, the world’s poorest countries, by the rich at successive UN climate summits has barely started to trickle through. Changes could be catastrophic. In North Africa, Egypt could lose 15% of its wheat crop if temperatures increase 2C – 36% if they rise 4C. Morocco expects crop yields to remain stable up to about 2030, but then to drop quickly afterward. Conversely, a study of 11 west African countries from the International Food Policy Research Institute expects some farmers to be able to grow more food as temperatures rise and rainfall increases. Climate change may mean Nigeria, Ghana and Togo can grow and export more sorghum, raised for grain. But most African countries are extremely vulnerable to climate change and have no reason to expect it will improve their lot. Instead of waiting for western money, they are pressing ahead where they can with water conservation, tree planting and small-scale irrigation schemes. Drought and flood resistant crops are being adopted by the few, but the odds of more severe droughts and floods are high and the resources to resist them are slim. The temperature in Longyearbyen on the Svalbard archipelago about 650 miles from the North Pole, averaged about –4C in April. If that sounds cold, consider that it was nearly 8C warmer than the 30-year average for the time of year, and that April was no outlier. The average temperature for the whole of 2016 in Longyearbyen was near freezing. Usually it is –10C. “No region on the planet is experiencing more dramatic climate change than the Arctic,” says Kim Holmén, international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, who has lived on and off in Svalbard for 30 years. Although he is unsure precisely why temperatures are rising so fast there, he says, “make no mistake, there has never been a run of temperatures like this ever recorded.” Holmén works at the Zeppelin research station at Ny-Ålesund, where 11 countries study climate change, air quality and ice. “Water temperatures on Svalbard have increased 10C or more in my time here,” he says. The fjord, which used to be covered with ice one-metre thick in winter, no longer freezes over. “We see temperatures changing, snow melting earlier, new species of fish. We are seeing big unexpected changes.” Longyearbyen, home to some 2,100 people, is on borrowed time, Holmén says. “There have been two avalanches there in the last year, both defined as 1,000-year events. These are the types of events we expect to see increasing. A whole part of Longyearbyen may have to be abandoned. “The changes taking place now will influence [many other places]. The global climate is clearly influenced by the Arctic. There will be ramifications everywhere. We already see more precipitation in northern Scandinavia and low pressure weather systems taking a more northerly route.” Holmén is backed by Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation at University College London. I first met her in 2012 on a Greenpeace ship which steamed north from Longyearbyen to within 300 miles of the pole across a sea that would normally be iced over. She spoke from Cambridge Bay in the Canadian high Arctic. “2017 is already setting records,” she says. “There was a record low [ice cover] for March this year, so that makes six months in a row with record [or near record] low ice conditions. There are many ways the Arctic is changing. You see it in melt season starting earlier than it used to and taking longer to freeze up, in the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and the Arctic glaciers, the warming of permafrost temperatures, in increased coastal erosion, the northward migration of the tree line and species, and in how local communities can no longer keep their food in the ground because the thaw increased.” Both Stroeve and Holmén are by nature cautious scientists, not given to dramatic statements. But both say they are astonished, even scared, by the speed at which the Arctic changes are happening. “Given our current emission rates of 35 to 40 gigatons [of carbon dioxide] per year we should see ice-free conditions in September in about 20 years,” says Stroeve. Longyearbyen residents are getting used to more extreme weather and coming to terms with what it means for them. The town has created a new risk assessment map and an avalanche warning system. Some parts of the town may be deemed unsafe and will have to be moved. Others may be protected by snow fences or walls. “What is happening here is a very obvious case of climate change with consequences for animals, plants and humans,” says Holmén. It is happening across the Arctic much faster than we thought possible, and I expect now to see an ice-free Arctic in 20 or so years.” When Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s leading climatologists, lived in Manaus in the 1970s, the population was a few hundred thousand and the highest temperature ever recorded in the city had been 33.5C. The city was surrounded by cool, dense forest and the greatest river on Earth. Heat waves were rare and floods regular but manageable. Today Manaus has more than 2 million people, and it and the wider Amazon region are changing fast. In 2015, Nobre says, the temperature in Manaus soared to 38.8C. “The Amazon is tropical and very hot, but when I lived there the hot spells were rare,” he says. “Now we see many more of them.” Not only that, he says, but dry seasons are longer by a week than they were a decade ago and weather is more erratic. Nobre notes that tree loss is exacerbating the effects of climate change. “In many parts of continental South America one sees about 1C warming in the Amazon, which can [be] mostly attributed to global warming. In areas like Rondônia, where there has been widespread deforestation, we see an additional 1C warming due to replacement of forest – which is a high-evaporating vegetation – to pasture, which is less evaporating.” Hot spells in such a humid climate are a real hazard to health. Yet adaptation to climate change in a teeming, poor city like Manaus is non-existent for the many people who must struggle just to survive. For the middle classes, air conditioning is now essential. The most city authorities can do is plant trees to cool the streets and protect the river banks from flooding. The great uncertainty is how far the drying of the Amazon could affect the rest of the world. “If you change the rainfall in the Amazon, you could transport the impacts very far away,” Nobre says. “According to my calculations, there will be a lot of impacts in southeastern Brazil and also over equatorial Africa and the US. But we cannot pinpoint what will happen.” Perhaps most ominous is the fact that a positive feedback loop appears to be in play. As the Amazon dries, Nobre says, tropical forest will gradually shift to savanna, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and further adding to global warming. “When we see a dry season of over four months, or deforestation of more than 40%, then there is no way back. Trees will slowly decay, and in 50 years we would see a degraded savanna. It would take 100–200 years to see a fully fledged savanna.” The Amazon then would be unrecognizable, along with much of Earth. New York state may seem an unlikely climate hotspot, but research confirms its status in the top league of potential change. Drawing on the US national climate assessment and research by leading federal agencies and academics, it calculates that temperatures statewide have risen about 1.3C since 1970, spring begins a week sooner than it did just a few decades ago, there is less winter snow and more intense downpours. Meanwhile, sea levels are rising at nearly twice the global rate and birds and fish populations are all moving north. Even more dramatically, the latest scientific projections suggest trouble ahead. By the 2050s, says the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, sea levels could rise nearly 76cm (30 inches), storm surges and flooding will be more common in coastal areas, and West Nile virus and many other diseases could be prevalent. But, says Carl Pope, climate advisor to the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, if climate change is to be addressed, it must be led by big cities like New York, which release nearly 70% of the global emissions but also have the capacity to create solutions. “Cities will always trump countries when it comes to climate change,” he says. “Cities are where emissions are. They are mostly consumers of fossil fuels, so they would like to use them as little as possible; they have a natural instinct to save on fossil fuels. Also, they are not very ideological. Improving quality of life is seen as a good.” Mayors, Pope says, are now well ahead of most governments, leading attempts to reduce air pollution which contributes heavily to climate change, and eager to introduce electric cars and renewable energy. “There is a great public will to improve the quality of life in cities,” he says. Pope identifies three groups of cities which he thinks will lead others on climate: “Cities in Nordic countries that will be meticulous about everything. Then there are a few in Latin America and Africa, which will be unbelievably creative. A third group is in east Asia and China, which will do things on a massive scale.” When Typhoon Haiyan struck the city of Tacloban in November 2013, Yeb Sano was the Philippines’ climate commissioner. He was distraught when I met him. He believed that his brother who lived there had been killed along with many thousands of others. One hour later Sano broke down as he addressed the world’s diplomats. It was the third super typhoon to hit the Philippines in three years, and five of the 10 strongest typhoons had come in the previous eight years. “Climate change is real and now,” he told them in tears. The Philippines is regularly ranked in lists of the top few countries most affected by climate change. “We are already experiencing climate change impacts, including sea-level rise, hotter temperatures, extreme weather events and changes in precipitation,” says Sano, who has now left government to direct Greenpeace SE Asia. “These in turn, result in human rights impacts, such as loss of homes and livelihoods, water contamination, food scarcity, displacement of whole communities, disease outbreaks, and even the loss of life.” Scientists widely agree that the country, along with nearby Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia, is a hotspot. Analysis of 70 years’ of government data, published in the International Journal of Climatology last year, shows a small decrease in the number of smaller typhoons that hit the Philippines each year, but more intense ones. It is not conclusive evidence, but previous studies have suggested the increase may be due to rising sea-surface temperatures since the 1970s. There is no doubt temperatures are rising on land. In Manila and the surrounding metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 12m, the tropical storms are more intense, the floods are more frequent, the nights are hotter and there are fewer cool days, says the state meteorological office, Pagasa. “There has been a significant increase [in the last 30 years] in the number of hot days and warm nights and a decreasing trend in the number of cold days and cold nights,” Alicia Ilaga, head of climate change in the government’s agriculture department, told me in 2015. “Both maximum and minimum temperatures are getting warmer. Extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent. In most parts ... the intensity of rainfall is increasing.” It’s not just Manila feeling the heat. In its latest 2014 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it expects life in major Asian and African coastal cities like Manila, Guangzhou, Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata and Shanghai to worsen as temperatures rise. “Urban climate change–related risks are increasing (including rising sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, drought, increased aridity, water scarcity, and air pollution) with widespread negative impacts on people (and their health, livelihoods, and assets) and on local and national economies and ecosystems,” it says. “These risks are amplified for those who live in informal settlements and in hazardous areas and either lack essential infrastructure and services or where there is inadequate provision for adaptation.” Food supplies are also threatened. I visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) outside Manila. This research centre, funded by the world’s richest nations to develop better strains of the crop that feeds nearly half the world, has seen temperatures soar. A few years ago, IRRI’s deputy director general, Bruce Tolentino, called climate change the greatest global challenge in 50 years. “The challenge now is to rapidly adapt farming to climate change with modern varieties and feed a fast-growing global population, half of which depends on rice as a staple food. One billion people go hungry every day. In the 1990s, rice yields were growing 2% a year; now they are just 1%. Temperatures here have risen 2–4C. Climate change will reduce productivity. Rainfall is unpredictable and rice is grown in areas like deltas that are prone to sea level rises. We have to gear up for more challenging agro-ecological conditions, we need to be able to use swampy areas and develop varieties that can be grown in salty or flooded areas.” IRRI has been working to develop rice varieties that can withstand extreme climatic conditions such as droughts, floods, heat and cold, and soil problems such as high salt and iron content. New drought-tolerant varieties that can produce up to 1.2 metric tons more per hectare [0.54 tons per acre] than varieties that perform poorly under drought conditions have been introduced to India, Nepal and elsewhere. “Every city and every sector of society in the region is at risk,” says Sano. “The IPCC tells us it will probably get 4C warmer. That means everything will be compromised, from food and energy to settlements. We are not ready. The challenge is too huge. We are very vulnerable.” Whether it’s faster than average warming, more vulnerable than average populations, or more severe than average drought, floods and storms, it’s clear that some places are being hit harder than others by Earth’s altered climate, and so face extra urgency when it comes to adapting to a new reality. But the bottom line is that climate hotspots intersect, and nowhere will we escape the changes taking place. What happens in the Amazon affects West Africa; the North American growing season may depend on the melting of Arctic ice; flooding in Asian cities affected by warming on the high Tibetan plateau. And urban areas ultimately depend on the countryside. We’re all in a hot spot now."
"Currently in the throes of a freshwater crisis, Chile is facing the consequences of Pinochet-era policies that have left nearly all the country’s freshwater supplies and water-related services in the hands of multinational corporations. But the solution to this worsening crisis lies in the hands of some unlikely suspects: Canadian teachers.  In 1981, Pinochet’s water code redefined water as a tradable good. Since then, corporations have been able to bid for water usage rights from the state and resell them through a market-based allocation system, with little public oversight. Only a handful of countries have attempted such a drastic retrenchment of state control over water resources. The market system has led to conflicts over water resources and to the loss of water rights of indigenous communities, such as the Atacameño people who lost access to large amounts of water that sustained their livelihoods and cultural activities along the Loa River. In addition, Chile has the most privatised water and sanitation services in the world; 95.8% of the population is served by private utilities. Globally, however, more than 90% of water and sanitation services are publicly-funded and managed thanks to fierce opposition to for-profit water, which typically results in higher tariffs and reduced accountability.  Communities around the world have stopped the privatisation of water and sanitation services; the Transnational Institute, a Dutch NGO, has documented the cases of 235 communities taking water back into public hands between 2000 and 2015. Growing opposition to privatisation in Chile follows this trend but has an unexpected twist. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP) is currently the largest investor in Chile’s water and sanitation, holding majority shares in three large Chilean water utilities – Essbio, Esval and Aguas del Valle – and with 41% of the sector under its control. Chile has near universal water coverage; 99% of the population uses an improved source of drinking water. This near-universality is often claimed as one of the benefits of privatisation but was in fact achieved through public financing, before the sector was privatised. While other public assets were sold off during the Pinochet era, the state continued to invest heavily in water and sanitation – it was the last sector to be privatised. Private corporations inherited well-functioning systems in 1999, by which point Pinochet-era policies had created an environment highly-favourable to foreign investors, including a guaranteed 7% profit rate. Amid extreme weather patterns linked to climate change, investments in infrastructure upgrades and maintenance by OTPP-funded utilities fall short of Chilean guidelines. Chile’s government records show that Aguas del Valle invested just 49% of the recommended minimum in 2014, while Essbio and Esval invested 75% and 64%. And all while water tariffs are higher in Chile than anywhere else in Latin America.  Meanwhile, corporate utilities have maintained the right to determine which areas to service, leading to a number of “non-utility zones” outside profitable urban centres. These are often run by community volunteers on a not-for-profit basis through associations known as Agua Potable Rural (APR). In the water-scarce province of Petorca, water extraction permits granted by the state exceed available resources. In the town of Cabildo, smallholder farmers claim that a water permit granted to Esval is having drastic impacts on their own water supplies, but their legal efforts to have Esval’s access rescinded have been unsuccessful. Meanwhile, under-resourced APRs operating in the area’s non-utility zones often run out of water during periods of drought. Ricardo Sanguesa Botella, president of the local irrigators’ association, and Modatima, the regional smallholder farmers’ network, also claim that when water sources run dry in the drought season, Esval purchases water from illegal wells – those operating without permits – in order to provide water through emergency trucks. When approached for comment, Esval said: “Chile, and specifically the Petorca area, have been affected by a severe drought over the last eight years. Facing this scenario has meant a great effort for our company and thanks to arduous work we achieve a continuous water supply without alterations for our clients. During this period we had to reinforce our production with the contribution of external sources. We count on external suppliers who, as a basic requirement, have groundwater rights in the area that guarantee their operation, so we ensure that the water source is in order and complies with current legislation.”  Esval did not reply to questions regarding the measures taken to ensure compliance of third party sources with Chilean regulations. However, obtaining water through illegal wells is a growing problem in Chile as the penalties imposed are too negligible to be an effective deterrent. In addition, the Chilean state does not track the origins of water trucked by private companies during periods of crisis.  The myth of the successful Chilean model has survived because the consequences of privatisation have been less dire than in poorer countries. But as the benefits of decades of strong public investment wane, and the reality of climate change sets in, private utilities are being exposed. Water justice groups in Chile – such as Modatima, Fundación Terram and ChileSustentable – are demanding an end to privatisation, but it will not be easy to wrest power from the hands of corporations in the era of free trade agreements. Chile has signed 26 trade agreements covering 62 countries, including Canada, since the late 1990s. These agreements lock in the rights of corporations who have the power to sue Chile if the government attempts to tighten regulation. Chilean environmental groups, labour unions and community organisations recently partnered with the Council of Canadians to highlight the OTTP’s role in Chile’s water crisis. But the interplay between water markets, private services, climate change and the human right to water is complex. Rather than pushing for an immediate divestment, water justice groups would like Ontario teachers to simply join the discussion around a just and sustainable transition from private to public control of water in Chile. The first step they can take is to sign a petition asking the OTPP to engage in a dialogue with the Chilean groups exploring strategies and a realistic timeline to bring water and sanitation back into public hands. The water crisis in Chile is complex, but it provides a unique opportunity for Canadian teachers to support the growing anti-privatisation movement, and help to free Chileans from the shackles of the Pinochet era.

"On Thursday when the announcement hit that Trump was taking America out of the Paris Climate Accord, my social media feed predictably blew up. As an environmental journalist with a lot of left-leaning friends, you can imagine what it looked like: anger, frustration, shock, sadness, another outrage from the world’s most outrageous leader. All of a sudden every one I knew was talking about climate change; I’ll admit it was a nice change of pace, but after nearly ten years of covering climate change I also knew it would be fleeting.  Liberals have been the champions of climate action for decades, but they’ve largely championed it as an after thought, something that comes near the end of a long to-do list, like the brussels sprouts you conveniently forget to pick up at the grocery store (polling bears this out). When I bring up climate change during chats with left-leaning friends, I often get that pause – that suspended moment – when I can see someone in the group look askance. I can see what they’re thinking, “Again, Jeremy, with the climate change?”   And I want to yell: “Yes, again! Again and again and again! Of course, again. Don’t you get that this is a crisis of civilization? Don’t you understand that all your other concerns will be swallowed by this one?” But I’m a polite Midwesterner, so after spouting my two-minute climate piece, haltingly and in eloquently, I let the topic shift to something everyone is more comfortable with like civil rights, health care, or crippling student debt.  You see, the GOP has made it too easy for liberals in the US to simply shrug their shoulders and say: it’s their fault we can’t get anything done. And, of course, this is true. In part. Of course, the GOP is world’s only major party that still denies climate change. Of course, the GOP has been corrupted by fossil fuel industries to the extent that they willfully ignore the world’s greatest national security threat.  But Obama’s 2010 climate legislation in the US didn’t just fail because the GOP refused to support it. It also failed because Democrats didn’t support it enough, some of the them even openly opposed it. The Democratic Party has been in general timid, conservative, and coy on climate change. Oh, at times their rhetoric has been inspiring, but their actions have no-where near measured up to the what the science demands. They include it in their platform, but rarely prioritize it. Yes, Obama got more done than any other president before – but even during the administration best moments it never felt like the planetary emergency it is.  Liberals: climate change belongs on it’s own tier above all others, shared perhaps with nuclear war – only climate change is already here and inevitable, future nuclear wars are not.  But communicating that to anyone who isn’t required to spend their work days (like me) reading up on the latest climate science is almost impossible. This is not exactly surprising. Psychological research shows that people simply don’t respond to a problem that is viewed as a future-oriented or too big to make a difference (neither of which is true of climate change, but it is often been communicated that way). Sure, we like to watch the civilization collapse on shows like The Walking Dead, but no one likes to confront the possibility that they and their loved ones may one day see a world melting down. Health care feels so much more present (and I get it, I have a precondition and my family wouldn’t have access to insurance without the Affordable Care Act) but for all its importance, health care legislation isn’t going to prevent the collapse of the world as we know it.  Climate change is the great aggravator. Let me say that again, because it is so important: climate change is the great aggravator. Every single issue that liberals care particular about – whether it is economic inequality, racism, sexism, injustice, war – is going to be made worse by climate change. Climate change will hit people of color, the poor, indigenous, and marginalized communities hardest and first, whether they live on eroding islands or high-rises in the middle of Brooklyn. And, yes, climate change will disproportionately injure women over men. Of course, climate change will also strike what conservatives care about most. The global economy will be absolutely shattered by climate change and national security threats will popup like overheated groundhogs – even the most rich and powerful will not get away unscathed. Imagine a world with millions of migrants escaping from rising sea waters, with agricultural systems failing and the price of food rising. Imagine a world where every nation suffers from the same water scarcity currently plaguing the Middle East. Imagine a world where hurricanes, rainstorms, wild fires, and blizzards are taking more and more steroids. Imagine a world of mass extinction, where species and entire ecosystems – like coral reefs – vanish from under us. Such impacts will add stressors to every society in the world; they will compound and aggregate.  What happens when a society becomes overstressed? It’s not pretty. Historian Christopher Wickham, has described the period following the end of the Roman Empire as “extreme material simplification”: population declined, technology stagnated, conflicts erupted, the standard of living plummeted and the written record vanished – hence the popular term ‘Dark Ages.’ It’s not just centuries ago: the unimaginable horror and stress of World War I allowed the rise of totalitarianism in both Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia.  In especially extreme cases, civilization as we know it simply collapses in on itself: witness the mute statues on Easter Island, testament to a conflagration and ecological overreach that is lost to time. Witness the temples of the Mayans overrun by jungle or the multiple societies that rose and fell in South America’s Atacama Desert. But before this happens, extremism, xenophobia, civil war, internecine conflict are the products of a society under extreme stress. When stressors compound, majorities lash out violently. They scapegoat minority groups, whether it’s the Jews or people of color. Law breaks down and the rule of strong over the weak becomes the norm.  But even these impacts aren’t some future thing. Climatologists have linked the civil war in Syria in part to water stress exacerbated climate change. Changing rainfall patterns in sub-Saharan Africa are contributing to food crises there, increasing the chances of famine, and you can bet, the possibility of worsening civil and national conflicts, such as what we see in South Sudan. Desertification in the Sahel is resulting in rising extremism. None of this is to say that climate change is solely to blame for any these conflicts or disasters, but you have to be particularly naive to think that a hotter world won’t have violent, destabilizing consequences. The US military has been studying climate-stressed conflict – and performing war games – for decades.  The worst thing about climate change won’t be its physical impacts; it will be what it makes us do to each other.  So, what can liberals do? First off, if your understanding of climate change is only passing, educate yourself. Some good places to start: here, here and here. Learn too about off-shoots like ocean acidification, deforestation, mass extinction. Next take action: march, protest, divest your money from fossil fuel companies, use public transit, eat less meat (especially beef), trade in for an electric car, put solar panels on your house, buy carbon credits, do something, do many things.  But of course the biggest changes need to come not at the personal level, but at the societal one. So, reach out to your representatives, whether liberal or conservative, and tell them: this is a top tier issue. Tell your representative you don’t vote for politicians who aren’t aggressive on climate change. And then make good on that in the ballot box. And if you ever get a call from a pollster who asks what your most important issues are – don’t say the economy or health care. Lead off with climate change. And if they say: oh climate change is not one of the issue their list, then ask them why the hell not?  Finally, yes, once you feel confidant in your knowledge, then reach out to your liberal, center, and conservative friends or families and open up about climate change. Do it respectfully, be ready to listen – maybe even to some crazy conspiracy theories or really misinformed science – but explain your views and have evidence at hand. Maybe they’ll come around, maybe they won’t – but some research has shown that such one-on-one interactions with loved ones may be the best way to move the dial: candid conversations can change society. So, yes, good on you liberals: you’re on the right side of history and science when it comes to climate change. Pat yourself on the back. But here’s the thing: your kids aren’t really going to care that you believed in climate change, if we don’t stop climate change. They aren’t going to listen to excuses like ‘but it’s the Republicans’ fault’ or ‘but Trump, Trump’. If you continue to view climate change as a lower tier issue, liberals, I guarantee you it will be the only issue for your children and grandchildren. And all those other things you cared so much about will be subsumed in a planet of storms, heat, floods, fires, extremism, xenophobia, injustice, violence, war, death, and suffering. This issue will burn away all the others. "
"Australia’s chief scientist says a new clean energy target will deliver lower power prices to consumers than the status quo, but his report also models a scheme with a low target for emissions reduction from the electricity sector. In his much anticipated review of the national electricity market, Alan Finkel has examined a scheme with an emissions reduction target of 28% on 2005 levels by 2030, rather than the reductions of 60% that some experts say would be necessary for Australia to meet its whole-of-economy pollution reduction target under the Paris climate accord. Finkel’s report, given to the Turnbull government and the premiers on Friday, says the clean energy target (CET) modelled by the review would result in lower residential and industrial electricity prices than leaving policy settings unchanged. It says the CET scenario is more favourable to the hip pocket than an emissions intensity trading scheme – a form of carbon trading supported by a range of experts and industry stakeholders – but the CET would see more electricity produced by brown coal “because there is no penalty for high emissions generators”. The report also warns governments that setting a higher target for electricity than a 28% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 trajectory “may have consequences for security, cost and reliability”. The proposed CET would replace the existing renewable energy target in 2020. Modelling undertaken for the review estimates that by 2030, 42% of electricity demand will be met by renewable generation. As reported by Guardian Australia on Thursday, the Finkel report recommends that power generators face new security and reliability obligations, and it says ageing power plants should provide energy regulators with three years’ notice before they close. Finkel says all new generators intending to connect to the national electricity market must meet technical requirements to contribute to fast frequency response and system strength. He says the new rules would require minimum levels of inertia in each region. “This will make the system better able to withstand disruptions like generator outages or interconnector failures,” the report says. In addition to the notice before shutdown requirements, which are designed to stop a repeat of the Hazelwood closure, the report says the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) should also publish a register of expected closures to assist long-term investor planning. With a new CET encouraging gas fired power, Finkel recommends Aemo be given “expanded visibility on gas contracts so that it can plan responses to shortages”. He also calls for an expansion of gas supply. “Governments should also work with communities to encourage safe exploration and production, based on best available evidence, performance data and appropriate financial rights for landholders”. Ahead of the release of the report, the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said he would be happy to accept a new CET provided it allowed for the construction of new coal-fired power stations. Joyce said if Australia walked away from coal exports and coal-fired power generation people would need to be “prepared to be poorer”. The former prime minister Tony Abbott declared on Wednesday it would be a “big mistake” for the government to adopt an emissions target that knocked out new high-efficiency coal-fired power stations. While Labor has been signalling it will bring an open mind to the review, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said “you can’t have a clean energy target that defines clean energy to include coal-fired power”. “Barnaby Joyce was out this morning saying that a clean energy target must accommodate the building of new coal-fired power stations. A CET that accommodates new coal-fired power stations is an oxymoron; it is a contradiction in terms”. Speaking to reporters at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in Hobart, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said there was “no barrier to building a coal-fired power station” in the system envisaged by Finkel. “There is nothing in the clean energy target that would prevent a new coal-fired power station being built,” the prime minister said. Challenged on whether a coal fired power station would be built in the absence of substantial government subsidy, Turnbull said: “Thank you for your opinion on that but others would differ. Time will tell”. Turnbull said a CET had a number of “very strong virtues.” He said the system was technology neutral and administratively familiar. “It would follow on from the renewable energy target and business is used to it”. The Greens climate and energy spokesman Adam Bandt said the new arrangements proposed by Finkel were weaker than the system proposed by John Howard in 2007. “The Finkel report is full of good ideas, but the key proposal of a CET is far worse than the version John Howard announced in 2007 and will see consumers subsidise gas and let coal keep polluting,” Bandt said. “Bill Shorten and Labor cannot end the climate wars by running up the white flag and blindly signing up to a deal with the Liberals.” Finkel told reporters after Friday’s Coag meeting in the system he was proposing, there was “no prohibition of any kind that prevents that coal from being built.” The chief scientist said it was “conceivable” that new coal fired power stations could be built, and he said it was “probably more likely that the existing coal stations will run longer than they would under a business as usual model” because there was now a price signal to determine future investment decisions. He said his recommendations did not have an eye to political considerations. Finkel said he approached the task “absolutely objectively”. Asked whether the 28% target was too low ball to meet Australia’s Paris commitments, Finkel said his intention was to ensure “the electricity sector does at least its fair share in meeting those international obligations”. He said it was up to the government to determine whether a 28% target was acceptable and it was beyond the scope of his terms of referene to determine how the economy wide emissions reductions should happen. “How those obligations are met across the whole of the economy is beyond the terms of reference,” Finkel said. Asked whether the low target in the Finkel report meant that the government had now given up on meeting Australia’s Paris commitments, the energy minister Josh Frydenberg said Australia had “a very good record of meeting our international targets.” “Every sector has to do its bit, but I do point out that Dr Finkel in his report does issue a note of caution about adopting targets for the electricity sector beyond 28% because of the ramifications it would have for energy security and affordability,” Frydenberg said. The Climate Institute’s acting chief executive, Olivia Kember, said it was clear emissions reduction of 28% was too modest. “It’s absolutely clear that aiming for 28% emissions reductions in electricity isn’t enough,” Kember said. “For a start, reducing emissions in electricity is much easier than reducing emissions from agriculture and parts of industry, so the smart way to meet a national emissions reduction target is to make deeper emissions cuts in the power sector so that those other sectors have a bit of room”.  “Secondly, under the Paris agreement which Australia signed up to along with 195 other countries, the long-term goal is to limit temperature rise to 1.5-2° celsius. That means net zero emissions by 2050, and so 28% by 2030 just doesn’t take us far enough along the path to net zero”. The review examined the relative market share of technologies under a business as usual case and a CET system. By 2030, if policies remained as they currently are, 14% of generation would come from wind, 8% from hydro, 3% from large scale solar, 1% from biomass, and 9% from rooftop solar. Coal would make up 57% and gas 8%. Large scale intermittent generation – from wind power and large scale solar – would be 17%. By 2030, under a CET, the relative mix would see 18% of generation from wind, 8% from hydro, 6% from large scale solar, 1% from biomass, and 9% rooftop solar. Coal would drop to 53% and gas to 5%. Large scale intermittent generation would be 24% of the market."

"Malcolm Turnbull will use a national security update to parliament to urge Labor to support the government’s proposed overhaul of citizenship requirements, arguing new arrivals need to “join us as Australian patriots”. The government intends to press ahead with its new citizenship regime once parliament resumes on Tuesday for the last sitting fortnight before the winter recess.  On Monday the government confirmed the new laws would give the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, the power to reject decisions on citizenship applications made by the administrative appeals tribunal if he doesn’t believe they are in the national interest. On Tuesday Turnbull will deliver a national security update which flags the introduction of the citizenship package. The prime minister will tell parliament there is no more important title in our democracy than “Australian citizen”. “And we should make no apology for asking those who seek to join our Australian family to join us as Australian patriots – committed to the values that define us, committed to the values that unite us,” the prime minister will say. He will also use his security statement to argue that the privacy and security of a terrorist “can never be more important than public safety”. At the weekend the government flagged it would seek changes to the law to allow intelligence agencies to decrypt communications of terrorist groups on the internet. The attorney general, George Brandis, will travel to Canada this month for talks with the Five Eyes intelligence network, and lobby for greater legal obligations on device makers and the social media giants requiring cooperation with police and intelligence agencies in decrypting private communications. Turnbull will tell parliament on Tuesday that an “online civil society is as achievable as an offline one”. “And the rights and protections of the vast overwhelming majority of Australians must outweigh the rights of those who will do them harm. That is truly what balancing the priority of community safety with individual liberties and our way of life is about – and my government is committed to that. “We will not take an if-it-ain’t-broke-we-won’t-fix-it mentality. This government doesn’t simply set and forget.” The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, will use his contribution to the security debate to endorse the proposed changes in principle. “Daesh has used the internet as an instrument of radicalisation,” Shorten will tell parliament. “Through Twitter and Facebook they boast of a propaganda arm that can reach into every home in the world: spreading hate, recruiting followers and encouraging imitators. “And with encryption technology like WhatsApp and Telegram they can securely communicate not just a message of violence – but instructions in how to carry it out.” Shorten will acknowledge many internet providers and social media platforms already work hard to detect and remove offensive content “but we need more – and these companies have the resources and the capacity to do more”. “Terrorists don’t self-police, so we cannot rely on a self-policing system.” With its proposed citizenship overhaul, the Coalition wants to extend permanent residency from one year to four before people can apply for citizenship, toughen English language competencies, introduce a values test and require people to demonstrate they have integrated into Australian society. Labor is yet to say whether it will support the package. The frontbencher Andrew Leigh said on Monday if the government wanted genuine bipartisanship on the changes, it would need to work constructively with the opposition. Leigh said Labor was “up for a constructive discussion about improving laws” but said the government had thus fair failed to produce a detailed proposal. “There’s very little detail out there on the public domain about issues that really matter.” Tuesday marks the opening of the final parliamentary sitting week before the winter break. The government will be looking to use the coming fortnight to progress its budget measures, including the banking tax and school funding, which is deadlocked. The government has also been hopeful of passing its proposed reforms to media ownership, but One Nation has signalled it will not support scrapping the so-called “two out of three rule” which prevents media companies owning television, radio and newspaper assets in a single market. For now, the media ownership issue remains deadlocked. The Coalition party room will also meet on Tuesday for the first time since the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, released his review of the national electricity market. Ahead of that meeting, conservative MPs have been flexing their muscle about the proposed clean energy target. The former prime minister Tony Abbott declared on Monday the new clean energy target sounded like a “magic pudding” and he said the Coalition must not adopt a new tax on coal. The conservative Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chair of the Coalition’s backbench committee on climate change and energy, also flagged “real concern” about the impact of the proposed clean energy target on power prices and industry competitiveness. Some government MPs fear the debate over the Finkel report could trigger a split in government ranks along the lines of 2009, when Abbott used an internal fight about emissions trading to take the Liberal party leadership from Malcolm Turnbull. "
"  World leaders’ response to Donald Trump’s announcement that he would withdraw the US from the Paris agreement was strong and unified. But did it sting the president and his administration? To deter other potential backsliders and maintain the integrity of the Paris agreement, the perpetrator of a defection of this magnitude should be made to feel the pain. But how?  Trump – and other leaders that may later try to wiggle out of their commitments – must be shown that there will be real consequences to their credibility and influence and relations with other countries. Ensuring the vitality of the agreement requires countries to show Trump that his ability to achieve other core diplomatic objectives will depend on honouring US commitments, and that he must consider more than the parochial interests of his most extreme supporters in determining how he will contribute to the global effort. If countries fail to offer a strong response, it risks setting the disastrous precedent that commitments can be treated as provisional, progression is not expected, and free-riding will not entail significant costs. This will only invite further defection. In an important 2007 essay, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance Michael Liebreich proposed a strategy for countries to deter defection and achieve strong international climate outcomes. Liebreich argued that the best approach is for countries to be “nice, retaliatory, forgiving and clear”. That is, they should unilaterally offer to do as much as possible, retaliate against those who do not reciprocate, reward recalcitrant countries when they do step up, and let other countries know in advance that this is their strategy. Since the US election, most countries have bent over backwards to be nice to Trump. Even as Trump wavered, more than 40 countries have joined the agreement and numerous others have reconfirmed their pledges. Few countries have called him out for his aggressive efforts to reverse Obama-era climate policies. Now that he has said he will withdraw, leaders have clearly expressed their dismay at this decision. But these words surely will not be enough to persuade him to change course, or to deter others from weakening their commitments. Where is the retaliation? Many have suggested that border carbon adjustments on American goods might be an appropriate response. And for good reason: no country wants to expose its manufacturers to competition from countries that are free riding on its efforts. But since trade sanctions can be a blunt and self-defeating tool, countries should also seek leverage points in other areas of concern to the administration. One obvious and immediate step would be to curtly decline his invitation to renegotiate the agreement, followed by an effort to isolate the US within the ongoing Paris negotiations. Because the Trump administration cannot leave the agreement until November, 2020, the administration could muck up the development of the “rulebook” that will guide its implementation. Arguably, with one foot out the door, the US may not retain much influence in these discussions.  But the US also negotiates in concert with the Umbrella Group, an informal bloc of countries that includes Japan, Canada, Russia, Australia, and New Zealand. By suspending collaboration with the US and declining to coordinate common positions, these countries could signal both their ongoing commitment to the agreement and their displeasure with Trump’s decision, while limiting the administration’s ability to make mischief in the rulebook negotiations. Countries could also seek leverage outside of the climate policy space, focusing on issues of particular concern to the Trump administration. Consider Nato financing. As with the Paris agreement, Trump feels aggrieved that Nato is profoundly unfair because he believes that the US pays a disproportionate share of the costs. At the same time that he has refused to contribute the “billions and billions and billions” that he bizarrely claims the Paris agreement obliges the US to pay in climate assistance, he has demanded that the other Nato members shoulder more of the costs of the alliance. Linking these two issues provides an opportunity to gain leverage. Nato members could reiterate their willingness to contribute more to collective security, but make clear that they view climate stability as critical to that security. They could then say that if the US will not address the climate dimensions of their common security challenges, they will need to pick up the slack, and that that may not leave much room for increased military expenditures. In fact, Angela Merkel has already made a similar argument with regard to Germany’s willingness to absorb a disproportionate share of the costs of ameliorating the ongoing refugee crisis. Such cross-issue linkages are common in other areas of international relations, but have not been widely used to advance climate action. No doubt, it will not be easy for countries, even in coalition, to implement such an assertive climate diplomacy against the Trump administration. Confronting a bully never is. But because the precedent they will set in responding to Trump’s attack on the agreement may well determine whether the ambition mechanism can work as planned, nothing less than the integrity of the Paris agreement depends on it."
"Less than two weeks ago, Alan Finkel told the Senate his landmark report would help Australia meet the commitments it made in Paris to reduce its economy-wide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. But his recommendations on the future of the National Electricity Market, released today, appear to fly in the face of those very commitments.  Before Senate estimates Finkel said: “We are very cognisant of the commitment that the nation has made through the Paris accords. “We absolutely need to deal with the issue of ensuring that the electricity sector can do its fair share in helping the nation to meet its obligations under the Paris accord – the COP21 accord.” Now today, his landmark review of the National Electricity Market has modelled cuts to emissions of the electricity sector that are the same as what the entire economy needs to do: 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. He said anything deeper, which had been suggested in other reports, would cause problems. Finkel suggested those cuts should be achieved with a “clean energy target” – which is equivalent to what has been called a Low Emissions Target. The result by 2030 will be one where renewables are responsible for just 42% of electricity generation. Well it’s a lot more than that recommended by Finkel’s report. How do we know it needs to be higher? We can look at a report from the Climate Change Authority, that Finkel himself co-wrote, that examined how much the electricity sector needed to do. After examining several scenarios for meeting Australia’s emissions reduction targets, it concluded: “The common finding is that the electricity sector can contribute deep, cost-effective emissions reductions as part of national action to meet global temperature goals.” The electricity sector has to do much of the heavy lifting for several reasons.  That last point was made by the Climate Change Authority report. “Substantial decarbonisation of electricity supply can facilitate emissions reductions in other sectors, as electricity can displace their direct use of fossil fuels,” it said. But in his report today, Finkel said any deeper cuts could be problematic. “The adoption of a more ambitious target would have larger consequences for energy security as such a target would likely see a higher level of [variable renewable energy] incentivised,” Finkel wrote. Bill Hare, the a leading climate scientist and CEO at Climate Analytics has spent a lot of time modelling precisely this issue  “From a scientific perspective this is quite shocking because the almost universal consensus from the modelling exercises for how to achieve the Paris agreement has the power sector doing a lot more than the rest of the economy everywhere in the world,” Hare said. “I think this conclusion appears to have been crafted to fit with the politics of the present government rather than the science and understanding of these systems,” he said.  Hare said he doesn’t know of any work globally that supports Finkel’s claim that deeper cuts to emissions will put the system’s reliability or security at risk. Dylan McConnell from Melbourne University said an additional problem with having shallow cuts in emissions in the electricity sector, was that it was the cheapest place to make the cuts – so the overall cost to the economy of meeting our Paris commitments will be more expensive. Finkel’s report for the Climate Change Authority can help us answer that. The report found the electricity sector’s emissions intensity should drop by about 69% between 2015 and 2030. (From 0.81 tonnes per megawatt hour in 2015 to 0.25 tonnes by 2030.) According to their modelling of a Clean Energy Target making this cut, they found it would reduce total emissions from the electricity sector by more than 60% from 2015 levels. (While Paris commitments are made with reference to 2005 levels, when total national emissions were much higher, emissions from the electricity sector, were roughly similar in 2005 and 2015.) So, far from Finkel’s recommendation actually getting the electricity sector to do it’s fair share, if implemented, it would guarantee Australia does not meet its targets made in Paris, since it is about half as demanding on the electricity sector as it needs to be. McConnell said there is no evidence that deeper cuts will cause problems for the security or reliability of the system – and modelling from the Australian Energy Market Operator has demonstrated that. It seems likely that the weak recommendations made by Finkel were intended to give something palatable to a Coalition government containing a conservative rump that wants state-subsidised fossil fuel generation, seemingly just for the sake of it. But as things stand, Australia doesn’t have an emissions reduction policy. In fact, Australia has emission growth policies, with the government’s own projections demonstrating current policies will cause carbon emissions to grow for decades.  A mechanism like the one Finkel proposed will at least cut emissions, even if by an amount that will still lead to catastrophic climate change. But more hopefully, if it is implemented in the right way, it could be “ratcheted up” by future governments  For example, if the 28% target is not legislated, but rather left as a regulatory leaver, it is something that could be increased later. To maintain confidence among investors looking to build energy infrastructure, it would help if the legislation required the target to move in only one direction (up). Others have lined up to criticise Finkel’s recommendations on how to deal with the variability of some renewable sources, as their penetration increases. Finkel has proposed a “generator reliability obligation” which would set a minimum level of dispatchable generation in a region, and when that threshold is crossed, all new generators would be required to be paired with some dispatchable power – batteries, other storage, or gas that can be switched on quickly. Hugh Saddler from the Australian National University says that’s a badly designed mechanism. “If implemented, this recommendation would seem certain to greatly complicate, slow-down and add to the administrative overhead cost of building new renewable generation. It would involve putting together a consortium of multiple parties with potential differing objectives and who would otherwise be competing with each other in the wholesale electricity market,” Saddler said. He said that instead, a separate market mechanism should be created to incentivise dispatchable generation. “The would be far more economically efficient, and thus less costly to electricity consumers, than the messy processes required under the Report’s obligation approach.” Consumer advocates at the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac) also criticised Finkel’s approach. “Requiring new renewable energy operators to invest in energy storage technologies or come up with other ways of addressing their variable output is expensive and unnecessary,” Craig Memery, team leader at Piac’s energy and water consumers’ advocacy program, said. “Requiring new renewable energy operators to invest in energy storage technologies or come up with other ways of addressing their variable output is expensive and unnecessary,” Memery said. This particular recommendation was endorsed by the coal industry, though.  The chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, Brendan Pearson, said: “The minerals sector also welcomes the concept of Generator Reliability Obligations and Energy Security Obligations. These could provide an important means of ensuring that new generation can provide reliable and secure power,” "
"The vast majority of Australians want the government to focus on renewable energy, even if that means more money needs to be spent on making the system reliable, according to polling by the Lowy Institute.  Of 1,200 adults polled in March, 81% agreed with the statement: “The government should focus on renewables, even if this means we may need to invest more in infrastructure to make the system more reliable.”  Only 17% thought the government should focus on coal and gas. The polling also revealed climate change was considered a “critical threat” by the majority of Australians – 57% – with only “international terrorism” worrying more people. “Even in the midst of heated debate and government rhetoric about the need for energy security following recent energy blackouts, Australians emphatically choose renewables over coal and gas,” said Alex Oliver, director of the Lowy Institute’s polling program. The high level of concern about the threat climate change poses appeared to represent a return to levels close to that seen a decade ago. In 2008, 66% of people said climate change was a “critical threat”, but that number dropped to just 46% in 2014. In 2016, the Lowy Institute found 88% of respondents thought fossil fuels were in decline around the world, and that “Australia should invest more in alternative energy sources or risk being left behind”. The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is due to hand his review of the National Electricity Market to Coag on Friday, which will make a number of recommendations for how to lower the greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. The Coalition government has been pushing a “technology-neutral” approach to emissions reductions, by which they mean one that allows coal and gas to be part of the energy mix. The Coalition has ruled out accepting a recommendation for an emissions intensity scheme, despite it gaining widespread support from industry and environment groups. Finkel is expected to make another recommendation for a low emissions target, which could technically allow new coal power stations to generate tradable certificates, although whether one would ever make commercial sense remains in doubt."
"The United States has abdicated responsibility from the Paris Climate Agreement – going where only Syria and Nicaragua have gone before, in refusing to play by globally agreed rules. While this is a blow for the fight against climate change, recent history suggests that a new “G3” – the EU, China and India – can fill the vacuum in leadership, plus the private sector in the US is already committed to renewable energy. There are three reasons to be hopeful: The US is a leading source of renewable energy technology and finance, and is at the forefront of research around emerging frontiers such as energy storage. It has pledged the largest amount to the Green Climate Fund ($3bn) of which $1bn has already been disbursed. The rest of the contribution is now threatened, which could be an impediment to technology transfer to the developing world. However the American private sector is likely to step up in its quest to reach global markets and push towards price competitiveness as well. Signals from industry support this – General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt recently tweeted: “Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” On the financing side, the increasing value of renewables may mitigate the effect of any reductions to the Green Climate Fund. For example, 2016 saw deals in many countries where the cost of solar energy was well below the cost of power from coal. There have been worries that the US exit from the Paris Agreement will trigger others to do the same. This is unlikely as narratives have shifted away from this being a zero-sum game, towards being a goal that is worth acting upon in national interest. A move away from fossil fuels used to imply losing global competitiveness, but now the prices of renewable energy now suggest otherwise. Europe and the global south, including rising powers India and China remain vocally committed to the Paris Agreement, fighting climate change and adopting renewable energy. The boom in renewable energy investments in India, China, Japan, US and EU countries have led renewable prices to plummet; this is unlikely to abate. We believe that all is not lost – the stars are aligning towards a new triumvirate, consisting of India, China and the EU, that can lead the fight against climate change. Each will bring a unique but complementary set of leadership qualities. The EU is showing strong leadership on climate change. Several European countries have developed renewable-friendly policies; almost 90% of new capacity in Europe in 2016 came from renewables. A strong private sector has been expanding globally as well. Statements made by the leadership – such as the EU/China joint statement, and Italy, France and Germany’s refusal to renegotiate Paris – are positive signs.  The combined EU pledge to the Green Climate Fund, at $4.8bn, is significant; however, financing flows towards the global south will have to increase, through the development finance or private investment. We don’t know whether that will happen, although the EU is showing signs of a more assertive foreign policy (in response to Brexit, a withdrawing America, and a more assertive Russia) and the architects of a new EU consensus on development are promising to step into the leadership gap left by the US. China has articulated its desire to lead, and has backed it up with domestic actions. While meeting domestic targets will support the Paris Agreement’s agenda, it could step into more of a global leadership role by extending its expertise and financial support for infrastructure in developing countries. This can be done by including it as a core component to its various bilateral project development initiatives (such as in Africa), as well as by leveraging multilateral institutions such as the New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. For India, a knowledge-rich and resource-lite approach may be the most feasible due to financial constraints. It has been aggressively building renewable capacity, and could well exceed Paris targets – the draft National Electricity Plan projects that 57% of electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027, compared to the Paris target of 40% by 2030. This plan projects that no new coal-based power will be required; the recent cancellation of coal-based power projects back this up. India has also pushed for a commercially sound policy framework, exemplified by its auction system. Though not without flaws, India’s experiences are invaluable and can be shared with other developing countries through research and development, capacity building, technical assistance and project development via experienced Indian firms. One promising route is through the International Solar Alliance (hosted by India), which will seek to promote innovative policies, demonstration projects, and capacity building measures, as well as leverage financial instruments to mobilise over $1tn investments by 2030. While the American exit has been a setback for the global fight against climate change, India, China and EU should view this as an opportunity to lead. This will not, by itself, close the gap to achieve the two degrees Celsius goal, but it could flip the narrative and propel a virtuous cycle of action by others. Supported by a sound commercial argument, now is the time for the new G3 to demonstrate climate leadership. Kabir Nanda is a senior consultant and Varad Pande is a partner at Dalberg.

"The environment has been shut out of this election. Economic growth has provided the world with abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials. However, unmanaged it is destroying the ecosystem, wiping out fauna, flora, forests and seas. An ecological meltdown will cause economic ruin and political turmoil, and threaten the very existence of human civilisation. Air pollution causes 40,000 premature deaths in the UK each year. With greenhouse gases and habitat depletion, together, they are having a catastrophic effect on our environment, contributing to global climate change, wildlife, crop and forest damage, rising sea levels, floods and haze. Whole countries could drown under water or starve under drought, driving migration and climate wars. The path to a sustainable future requires the creative power of our best scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, backed by the courage of politicians to think long term. Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris accord is an act of environmental vandalism on a global scale. And by refusing to condemn him, Theresa May is aiding and abetting him. Only the Lib Dems combine the ambition to bring forward climate change targets and support for the Paris agreement with an entrepreneurial approach to investing in cutting-edge clean technologies, and commitment to international institutions to enable Britain to be a world leader in protecting the global environment.

"The vast majority of Australians want to see the country dramatically increase the use of renewable energy, a new survey has found, despite attempts by the federal government to characterise renewables as unreliable and expensive. The Climate Institute’s national Climate of the Nation survey, published on Tuesday, pointed to frustration with the government’s inaction and lack of leadership on clean energy.  Of 2,660 respondents from across Australia, 71% agreed that climate change was occurring, continuing a trend established in the survey through 2014 and 2015. Two-thirds said they were highly concerned by its impacts, while 57% accepted that human activity was the main cause.  Ninety-six percent of respondents said they wanted the country’s primary energy source to be renewable, with support from either storage technologies (58%) or fossil fuels (38%). The phaseout of coal and replacement with clean energy received support from 59%, with 72% of those in favour calling on the government to drive the transition. Olivia Kember, the acting chief executive of the Climate Institute, said support for renewable energy had been steadfast across 11 years of the survey and was widely seen as “economically smart” and future-focused. This remained true, she said, “even as the public discussion of energy mix has got a lot more complicated”, with the federal government  labelling renewables unreliable and costly. “It’s really striking that people have come out the other side of that discussion with really strong support for renewable energy and a strong sense that we need to go towards a cleaner energy system,” Kember said.  The finding that one-third of respondents believed the seriousness of climate change to have been exaggerated – and that 13% did not believe it to be happening at all – aligned very strongly with political affiliation, in particular One Nation and Coalition voters. But enthusiasm for a greater dependency on renewable energy seemed nonpartisan, said Kember, with support for solar in particular consistent across just about every demographic breakdown. People linked high electricity prices to the privatisation of electricity generation and supply (55%) and poor policy-making (44%), echoing the findings of Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his recent review of the sector. Kember said the market was not seen to be functioning effectively: “What they see are higher prices, worse service and companies that seem to be profiteering.” More than 40% of respondents said the federal government was “doing a fairly poor to terrible job” on climate change and energy, up from 33% last year. Only 18% said their efforts were “fairly good to excellent”. The discussions of eight focus groups, convened in Adelaide, Brisbane, Parramatta and Townsville, highlighted that the Australian public felt “fatigued, discouraged and disempowered” by the politically motivated arguments around climate change. This was coupled with what researchers characterised as a “wilful disregard” for scientists, notably the government agency CSIRO. One respondent, in a focus group in Parramatta, said climate change had been used as a “political football”.  “For a long time now – because we’ve been having this fight for such a long time – they get that climate change is a problem that needs to be solved, and they see that there’s a lot Australia can do about it,” said Kember. “Then they look at what the government is delivering and they’re beyond unimpressed. They’re really frustrated and annoyed at the way it keeps being treated as an opportunity for partisanship, political attacks and bickering.  “While the pollies are fighting about it, they’re not getting on with solving it.” This was despite widespread support (63%) for Australia to be an international leader on action against climate change, particularly in pioneering the development and implementation of renewable energies. Nearly three-quarters of respondents were motivated by the opportunities for the economy through jobs and investment (73%) and by protecting the environment (70%).  Relatedly, the report found that people were generally in favour of the Paris agreement to curb global warming to 1.5-2C, and could not understand why the Australian government was not making stronger attempts to deliver on it. Nine out of 10 people opposed walking away from the Paris deal as the US did on 1 June, while almost two-thirds (61%) said Australia should “work harder” to ensure it met its overall goals. "

"Wholly unintentionally, Donald Trump may have sparked unprecedented determination within the US to confront the danger of climate change. Following Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, the president was assailed by businesses ranging from Facebook to Goldman Sachs for risking America’s economic and environmental standing. The White House was choked by phone calls from irate voters.  Perhaps most significantly, a coalition of lawmakers, companies and universities swung into action in an attempt to reassure the world that the US wasn’t completely abandoning the field. Within this group committing itself to the Paris targets are 17 governors – two of them Republicans – and 125 cities, including New York City, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, which was cited, somewhat mistakenly, by Trump as somewhere that would benefit from exiting the Paris agreement. With the federal government casting off the task of emissions reduction, the onus is now on cities and states to make up the shortfall. We look at what four major US cities – New York City, Houston, Miami and San Francisco – are doing to stave off the threat of climate change.  Outrage over the president’s move to pull the US out of the Paris accord went far and wide, but Bill de Blasio, New York City’s mayor, seemed to take particular offense that one of the city’s own had done such a thing.  “This is a dagger aimed straight at the heart of New York City,” De Blasio said, raising the specter of rising seas and storms bearing down on Manhattan and Brooklyn. “We have to understand that if climate change is not addressed, one of the greatest coastal cities on the earth will be increasingly threatened. It’s very painful to reflect the fact that Donald Trump is from New York City. He should know better.” To add to De Blasio’s distress, the mayor then had to field questions over what sort of example he was setting by being driven almost every day from Gracie Mansion, on the upper east side of Manhattan, to a gym 12 miles away in Brooklyn. De Blasio said his own environmental efforts were focused on recycling and composting, adding he wouldn’t be drawn into the “cheap symbolism” of using public transport.  But no matter the mayor’s personal habits, New York City has positioned itself, along with California, as the main bulwark against Trump’s demolition of climate change action at home and abroad. Having already promised to cut emissions 80% by 2050, De Blasio signed an order committing the city to the goals of the Paris agreement, including its most ambitious target – a warming limit of 1.5C (2.7F) beyond the pre-industrial era.  New York City has already earmarked billions of dollars to retrofit 1m buildings to make them more energy efficient, electrify its municipal vehicle fleet, plant thousands of trees and coat rooftops in solar panels.   The city is coming off a promising base: half of New York City residents don’t own a car and while energy use still results in nearly 50m tons of greenhouse gases, average household electricity consumption is well below the national average. There’s palpable concern about climate change too – in surveys, three-quarters of residents say they are worried about climate change, with more than 80% wanting carbon dioxide to be regulated.  New York’s clout has been touted by Michael Bloomberg, its former mayor, who has helped corral a national coalition of cities and states to fill the void left by the federal government’s exit from climate policy and concern. Bloomberg, who recently stumped up millions of dollars for the UN climate secretariat, has said: “We are already halfway there – and we can accelerate our progress further, even without any support from Washington.”  Still, even if California and New York state halve their emissions, the US would not make Barack Obama’s Paris goal of reducing emissions by at least 26% by 2025. In this light, New York City’s adoption of the 1.5C goal – considered a long shot at the time of the agreement in 2015 and now entering the realm of impossibility – appears to be a defiant flourish rather than sober expectation.  “1.5C was the stretch target at Paris. It’s a very aggressive goal, which is perhaps the most charitable way to put it,” said Daniel Zarrilli, senior director of New York City’s climate policy. “But we are already at risk and it’s important to set high targets to head off the worst consequences of climate change. Others need to see what New York City is doing and make the same accelerations. We need to do more and we need to do it faster.”  According to Zarrilli, heat exposure is already the biggest killer of New York City residents in terms of natural hazards – and then there’s the looming issue of rising seas, which are on course to increase around the city by up to 2ft by 2050 and 6ft by 2100.  Without a sharp reversal in emissions, parts of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn face being consumed by the sea, with the city’s two low-lying airports, La Guardia and JFK, expected to have water sloshing around the runways by the end of the century.  More than $20bn has been set aside for defenses to this threat, but some critics argue that as much effort and money should be spent on overhauling the city’s existing creaking infrastructure. The subway system is under strain, with delayed signal work causing huge delays and much angst (the New York Times recently compared it unfavorably to the London Underground).   The state is responsible for New York City’s transport system, and Governor Andrew Cuomo, while praised by environmentalists for his own efforts to expand renewable energy, has been accused of favoring flashy new projects rather than fixing the nuts and bolts of public transit.  “Our carbon footprint is a lot smaller than it could be because we move around millions of people on public transport rather than car, but mass transit is often overlooked,” said Lara Skinner, associate director of the Worker Institute at Cornell University.  “A lot of attention is given to technological fixes rather than what is right in front of us. A massive improvement and expansion of public transport would be one of the best ways to reduce emissions in transport, especially as lack of affordable housing is pushing people further out.”  Skinner is the co-author of a new report that advocates New York go much further by retrofitting all public schools for energy efficiency, establishing a new rapid bus transit system and installing an additional 1GW of solar projects statewide. “We have started on a good path but we need to majorly scale it up,” she said. “We have 1,000 public schools in New York City and just a fraction have solar.  “Given the emergency of the climate crisis we should be a lot more ambitious with the targets we are setting. I would say California is quite far ahead of New York at this point in time.” Oliver Milman If Donald Trump advocated on behalf of water, San Francisco, the self-styled capital of “the resistance”, would likely advocate not bathing. The president received just 9% of the vote in a city in which the final elected Republican was vanquished in 2014.  And, surely enough, after the president made his Paris announcement, San Francisco’s board of supervisors on 6 June introduced a resolution stating that this city would stay the course. “I think it’s important San Francisco goes on record as a city that it is committed to this agreement, regardless,” said the city supervisor London Breed, the board’s president. “We’re not going to stop doing what we do best.” Since 2008, each of the city’s scores of departments has been required to submit climate action plans; ecological regulations across the city’s myriad layers of government have been centralized in the 26 chapters of San Francisco’s environment code. Matters addressed by San Francisco on a municipal level range from how to best deal with arsenic-treated wood and construction debris to strict building requirements.  San Francisco’s path to a greener tomorrow comes via the “0-50-100-Roots” plan, a phrase that rolls off the tongue of the environmental department spokesman Guillermo Rodriguez, if no one else. This proposal is composed of reaching “zero waste” by 2020 (a goal perhaps more aspirational than realistic ); 50% of all trips in the city being undertaken on “sustainable transportation” (the perhaps 45,000 Uber, Lyft, and other app-hailed drivers now clogging city streets count under the city’s metric, interestingly); use of 100% renewable energy (a goal that syncs overall with the state of California’s wishes by 2045); and a bevy of plans to protect and augment the city’s tree canopy.  The city’s chosen environmental path has, however, been circuitous. Early versions of San Francisco’s plastic bag ban, for which the city received worldwide praise, may actually have harmed the environment more than they helped. The city’s much-hyped green energy plan, a competitor to Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered through a tortured, decades-long gestation and was burdened by its own overly rosy economic and ecological pledges. The city has taken strides to ensure its municipal vehicles and buses are electric, hybrids or run on biodiesel – but for many years some of these ostensibly “green” vehicles failed transit passengers at an alarming clip.  But San Francisco is nevertheless making progress. In 2015, the city measured its greenhouse gas emissions at 28% below 1990 levels – despite the city’s population growing nearly 20%, and a robust bump in its gross domestic product of 78%. That mark handily beat the city’s stated goal of 25% in 2017 in both reduction totals and timeframe; the plan is now to drop emissions 40% by 2025 and 80% by 2050. San Francisco’s reduction goals, says the Business Council on Climate Change’s executive director, Michael Parks, are fairly standard among large American cities. But in achieving and surpassing those goals rapidly, the city “is a national leader”. Parks’ San Francisco-based organization works with many area corporations to promote ecological measures; he matter-of-factly predicts plenty will now, post-Paris pullout, work even harder to be sustainable “because businesses are used to working on climate-change plans without help from the federal government”. Just as city politicians can do well by doing good in opposing Trump, so can city corporations: “Sustainability is a good business decision,” Parks says. Companies can save money and earn prestige. Employees feel “energized” to work for a place that espouses their own values. Among the Bay Area standouts, Salesforce hit its zero carbon emission goals for 2050 this year; Google has reached 100% renewable energy in 2017; Whole Foods has moved to install solar panels at 100 stores; and BlackRock has begun wheedling the companies in which it invests to address climate risk. Joe Eskenazi Miami Beach likes to bill itself as a poster child for the effects of climate change. Flooding from each successive year’s King Tides reaches farther inland and affects more homes, businesses and livelihoods, and the waters lap ever higher toward environmentalists’ dire predictions of a 5ft rise in sea levels in south Florida by 2100. So to Philip Levine, the outspoken mayor of the low-lying coastal city, Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the Paris agreement was nothing short of “a colossal mistake”. “It’s a punch in the gut for all of us who on the ground are experiencing this threat first-hand,” said Levine, who has overseen his city’s investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to raise roads and sea defences and install modern and powerful pumping equipment. “It’s like being on a boat and the next thing you know the entire current has gone against you, but you know you still need to go in the right direction. For all of us who are experiencing climate change and sea level rise, we have no choice but to continue forward.” Levine was a signatory to the defiant open letter to Trump signed by more than 1,200 mayors, governors and education and business leaders pledging to abide by the terms of the Paris accord, and has promised to press ahead with Miami Beach’s ambitious works programme. With partners including four south Florida counties who in 2012 formalised their own regional action plan to combat the effects of climate change on their collective population of 6 million, the city’s own efforts pre-date the Trump administration by several years – and will long outlast it, Levine insists. “Our priorities are the low-lying areas of our city, the western part of the island,” he said. “We’re building up those areas, putting in the pumps, and we have seen significant, incredible success. Now we’re going to other parts of our city, other places that are also low lying and we need to raise.” Under a resiliency strategy entitled Rising Above, the city – barely seven miles wide by one mile across – is elevating more than 100 miles of roads, installing 80 new pump stations, upgrading stormwater drainage utilities and raising sea walls in the most vulnerable areas by up to 5ft. The works, which began in the fall of 2014, are costly and already at $500m, Levine said, although they are partially offset by grants from the state of Florida and a $7 hike per household in stormwater rates (which the mayor justified by asking residents if they would rather live in Miami Beach or Atlantis). Other efforts to reduce the city’s carbon footprint include the promotion of water taxis and trolley buses, to get cars off the streets, and incentives for green construction. While Levine acknowledges the project might secure only a half-century’s respite, he hopes the investment will buy enough time to find a political solution to the ravages of environmental change, albeit after the current president leaves office. As for Trump himself, Levine wonders what goes through the president’s mind when he looks out from his waterfront Mar-a-Lago mansion just up the coast in Palm Beach and “sees how narrow the beach is compared to just 20, 30 years ago”. “Maybe he has plans to turn Mar-a-Lago into an incredible water park,” Levine said. Richard Luscombe An oil and gas hub might seem an unlikely place for officials to affirm their commitment to green energy, but Houston is by far the country’s biggest municipal user of green power. It annually uses almost 1.1bn kWh of solar and wind power, representing 89% of its total electricity use, according to the latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That puts it seventh nationally in the EPA’s list of green partners, ahead of Starbucks and Walmart and just behind Cisco Systems and Apple. Among local governments, another Texas city with a strong oil and gas bent, Dallas, is second. Despite Texas’s well-earned reputation as a bastion of highly conservative Republican politics, six Texas entities are in the top 30, compared with four from liberal California. The current mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, has built on the work of his predecessor, Annise Parker – also a Democrat – by burnishing the city’s green credentials while trying to avoid alienating traditional industries that helped grow the city and still drive much of its economy. Parker co-founded the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda, while Turner is one of 246 mayors who have committed to uphold the Paris agreement’s aims in the wake of Trump’s announcement. This local emphasis comes despite a statewide political approach that stresses limited regulation and is notoriously friendly toward oil and gas companies even as pollution in cities such as Houston remains a serious problem. Still, almost 100% of the Houston city government’s power use now hails from renewable sources: in April, it announced a 50MW solar plant based 600 miles away in the remote west Texas town of Alpine was online and able to provide up to 10.5% of the city of Houston’s needs. The plant has 203,840 solar panels spreading over 360 acres and reflects Texas’s growing interest in solar power. It still lags behind other sun-kissed states in solar, though has long been a leader in wind. Houston is also cutting its emissions. Lara Cottingham, deputy assistant director in the city’s administration and regulatory affairs department, said that since 2007 the city has seen a 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from municipal operations. That has been achieved by measures such as replacing light bulbs, demanding that new buildings be made as energy-efficient as possible, retrofitting fire stations, police stations and libraries, and not only acquiring greener vehicles but also improving logistics so they are used more intelligently. A corner on the first floor of a city permitting office on the edge of downtown is given over to a green building resource centre, with eclectic exhibits designed to educate visitors on the benefits of going green – from recycling to high-efficiency toilets to bioswale that removes pollutants from stormwater run-off. A screen displays usage data from the solar panels on the roof. The view from outside hints at large structural challenges, however: a barely used Amtrak train station and a tangle of huge freeways that take lone commuters on long journeys. Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas, an advocacy group, said that while the city had made notable strides, “Houston’s also quite sprawling; to really be a leader on climate they’re going to need to get a handle on that and start densifying the city and provide more transportation alternatives to give people an option besides single occupancy vehicle travel all the time”.

"As the Senate launches an inquiry into the national security ramifications of climate change, a new report has warned global warming will cause increasingly regular and severe humanitarian crises across the Asia-Pacific. Disaster Alley, written by the Breakthrough Centre for Climate Restoration, forecasts climate change could potentially displace tens of millions from swamped cities, drive fragile states to failure, cause intractable political instability, and spark military conflict.  Report co-author Ian Dunlop argues Australia’s political and corporate leaders, by refusing to accept the need for urgent climate action now, are “putting the Australian community in extreme danger”. “Global warming will drive increasingly severe humanitarian crises, forced migration, political instability and conflict. The Asia Pacific region, including Australia, is considered to be ‘disaster alley’ where some of the worst impacts will be experienced,” the report, released this morning, says. “Australia’s political, bureaucratic and corporate leaders are abrogating their fiduciary responsibilities to safeguard the people and their future wellbeing. They are ill-prepared for the real risks of climate change at home and abroad.” On Friday, the Senate passed a motion for an inquiry into the threats and long-term risks posed by climate change to national and international security, and Australia’s readiness to mitigate and respond to climate-related crises in our region. Dunlop, a former chairman of the Australian Coal Association and chief executive of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, told the Guardian the security impacts of climate change were not far-distant future concerns, but happening now. The ongoing Syrian civil war – which has killed 450,000 and forced an estimated 5.5 million people to flee the country over six years of conflict – is attributed, in significant part, to an extended drought, exacerbated by climate change, that left millions without food or livelihoods. “Once these effects start, then they unfold right the way through the system as an accelerant,” Dunlop said. “Natural disasters lead to social pressures, to increasing conflicts, competing claims for scarce resources. These fuel extremist positions, which could be religious, tribal, or political, which can lead to mass migrations. We are going to see a lot of people start moving, in our region especially, and to think we stop that by finessing things like ‘stop the boats’, is frankly naive.” Dunlop said the global nature of the climate change challenge should force countries to cooperate. “Climate change has to become seen as a reason for far greater levels of global cooperation than we’ve seen before. If we don’t see it that way, then we’re going to be in big trouble. This problem is bigger than any of us, it’s bigger than any nation state, any political party. “We’re going to be steamrolled by this stuff unless we take serious action now.” The security implications of climate change have been identified by thinktanks, governments, and militaries across the world. A decade ago, Alan Dupont and Graeme Pearman wrote for the Lowy Institute that the security threat posed by climate change had been largely ignored and seriously underestimated. In 2013 the commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Locklear, said the greatest long-term threat in the Asia-Pacific was not military ambitions of another state, or the threat of nuclear weapons, but climate change.  In 2015, the US Department of Defense commissioned a report, examining the security implications of disrupted climate, and current secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, has said climate change is a clear and current threat to US troops.  Australia’s 2016 defence white paper said climate change would contribute to state fragility, which it identified as one of the six key drivers that will “shape the development of Australia’s security environment to 2035”. “Climate change will be a major challenge for countries in Australia’s immediate region. Climate change will see higher temperatures, increased sea-level rise and will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These effects will exacerbate the challenges of population growth and environmental degradation, and will contribute to food shortages and undermine economic development.” “Instability in our immediate region could have strategic consequences for Australia should it lead to increasing influence by actors from outside the region with interests inimical to ours. It is crucial that Australia help support the development of national resilience in the region to reduce the likelihood of instability.” The Senate inquiry into the national security threats of climate change will report in December. But the issue remains politically charged. Greens senator Scott Ludlam, in putting the motion before the Senate said the government had failed to apprehend the global security risk posed by climate change. “As one of the highest per-capita emitters on the planet, Australia must play a constructive role as our region responds to climate change. The government won’t listen to the scientists, and it won’t listen to the renewable energy sector. Maybe it will listen to defence and security experts and the personnel on the frontline.” But assistant minister to the prime minister, Senator James McGrath, said the inquiry was unnecessary. He told the Senate a defence climate security adviser had been established within the office of the vice chief of the defence force group. As well, an environmental planning and advisory cell has been established within headquarters joint operations command, and defence is represented at the government’s disaster and climate resilience reference group."
"It might seem a million miles from the climate policy debate of today but Australia’s decade-long climate wars arguably began with perfect being the enemy of good. On at least three occasions, the chance for Australia to have relatively strong emissions policies were squandered, leaving many people in politics, industry and the environmental movement today wishing that something weaker – but therefore more politically feasible – had been instituted when it was possible.  That legacy has meant a culture of extreme pragmatism has taken over the climate policy debate in Australia. Second-best policies have become the preferred option, until they’ve been ruled out, and suddenly third-best policies are considered the only feasible option.  This pragmatic turn has infected not only the political parties and some NGOs but also official, independent government offices, and left Australia with virtually no genuinely independent advice in the climate policy space.  Last year we saw the once fiercely independent Climate Change Authority water down its advice to make it appear palatable to a Coalition party room containing MPs who don’t believe climate change is really happening. And this month, Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, released a report recommending emissions cuts that are not in line with what the science demands.  But with Australia’s existing policies destined to push power prices up, decrease the reliability of the electricity system and increase emissions for decades to come, any emissions reduction policy is surely better than nothing. So there is perhaps much to be said for scientific advice that compromises on its principles of independence and evidence, in order to get something done. But has this turn greased the surface of a slope, leading to government having no honest advice? Has Australia’s acceptance that the perfect is no longer possible meant we have lost sight of what really needs to be done?  Ahead of releasing his landmark report into the security and reliability of the National Electricity Market, Finkel appeared before Senate estimates.  Traditionally, the chief scientist has been relied upon for independent scientific advice, both to government and the general public. It’s a position that has remained independent of politics – a trusted source of information, not swayed by the gritty political realities of the day.  Finkel’s testimony before the Senate suggested his advice was not going to tell the government what the absolute best thing for them to do was but, rather, what they could do, given their political inclinations. Reading between the lines, it seemed he was saying it would be tailored so that it was palatable to the government of the day. “We will be making recommendations around policies that all of the states and territories and the government would ideally agree to around changes to the operation of the system,” Finkel said. And the nearly universal thread in commentary around the Finkel review – both from those who have applauded it and those who have attacked it – has been to see it as a political document, attempting to find a policy that will do something to lower emissions but will also be palatable to the Coalition. Finkel, for his part, has denied his report was written “cognisant of the political realities”. According to Frank Jotzo, a climate economist at the Australian National University, there are three aspects of the report that demonstrate its political nature.  “Firstly, presenting the emission reduction challenge as very much an adjunct to reliability and affordability, which is directly in line with the way government approaches that question,” Jotzo said. Secondly, and perhaps most obviously, Finkel’s report recommended a clean energy target, rather than an emissions trading scheme or an emissions intensity scheme.  “All analysis aside, that is exactly what you’d do if you were looking for something that is politically acceptable to the government, where the government has ruled out an emissions trading scheme and an emissions intensity scheme – you go looking fsor the next best thing, which might be acceptable to the government.” Thirdly, Jotzo said the very weak emissions reduction modelled – and essentially recommended – by Finkel, appeared to be something you’d do if you were tailoring it to a hesitant government. “It could be interpreted as a an attempt to help smooth the way to make this acceptable to government,” Jotzo said.  That last point – the weak ambition of the emissions reductions – has raised the temperature of a lot of commentators.  Signing the Paris agreement, Australia committed to an emissions reduction target of 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. As many have pointed out, Australia’s target is not consistent with the aim of the Paris agreement, which is to limit warming to “well below” 2C.  But, regardless, a lot of work has been done examining how Australia could meet its weak 2030 targets. And, according to that analysis, the electricity sector has to play a huge role. The electricity sector accounts for more than a third of Australia’s emissions and it is the cheapest place to make cuts – with zero emissions being entirely achievable. That’s in contrast with other industries, like agriculture, where emissions cuts are incredibly difficult, or manufacturing and transport, which will be able to reduce emissions only after the electricity industry is decarbonised – by relying more on electricity, rather burning their own fossil fuels. Several bodies have recently estimated how much the electricity sector would need to cut its emissions by for Australia’s entire economy to meet its current Paris targets.  But, instead of relying on any of that work, Finkel modelled a cut in the electricity sector, which is numerically the same as the cuts needed across the whole economy – 28% by 2030.  Bill Hare from Climate Analytics, a climate scientist who has done this sort of modelling for many economies around the world, placed several comparable models of what Australia’s electricity sector needs to cut on a single chart. The result is stark, with the cuts modelled by Finkel sticking out like a burning coal stack.  “From a scientific perspective this is quite shocking because the almost universal consensus from the modelling exercises for how to achieve the Paris agreement has the power sector doing a lot more than the rest of the economy everywhere in the world,” Hare told the Guardian. Jotzo said it looks like it must have been done to make it palatable to the Coalition. “Why possibly would you make the assumption that there is a uniform emissions reduction across all sectors? That’s really only if you want to softly softly get something going.”  Finkel has denied that the modelled cuts amount to a recommendation. But not only did he model emissions cuts that were inconsistent with the Paris agreement but he said any deeper cuts would cause problems for the energy system. And he recommended that, if more ambitious cuts were to be considered by government, the work done in his report would need to be redone, to examine their implications.  “The adoption of a more ambitious target would have larger consequences for energy security as such a target would likely see a higher level of [variable renewable energy] incentivised,” his report said. “The panel recommends that if a higher national target is to be considered, cost security and reliability implications should be re-examined.”  The level of cuts don’t appear in his list of recommendations but, as the quote above makes clear, they emerge as a clear recommendation from the text of the report itself.  Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne, said that statement made the chance of Australia meeting its Paris agreement targets much more unlikely.  “In my view that has basically just put up a massive and unnecessary barrier for being more ambitious and won’t really help end the so-called ‘climate wars’,” he said. “It basically will require anyone, like Labor, to do more work to argue that they can be more ambitious, without lights going out or costs going up. That doesn’t sound particularly amenable to ‘ending the war’, unless Labor thinks 28% is acceptable.” Some commentators were surprised that Finkel didn’t simply model a range of scenarios and leave it up to the government to choose an appropriate level of ambition. “What surprised me was there was a recommendation on the extent of emissions reduction to be targeted at all,” Jotzo said. “Those decisions could have been left to government.” But despite all evidence showing such cuts were inconsistent with Australia’s international obligations, in an interview with the Guardian immediately following the review’s release, Finkel was asked whether the cuts would be enough to meet the Paris agreement. Finkel said: “I genuinely don’t know.” That claim of ignorance came even though one of the key reports that considered the question being produced by the Climate Change Authority, of which Finkel is a member. It suggested cuts of at least twice that modelled by Finkel were needed in the electricity sector.  That particular report by the Climate Change Authority caused a major spat, which closely mirrors the controversy around Finkel’s new report, and highlights the dangerous position Australia could be heading towards.  In September last year, the Climate Change Authority released a review, recommending how Australia can meet its Paris targets. It’s worth noting that the Climate Change Authority was once a body that stuck to the science and wasn’t influenced by the attitude of the current government. Under chair Bernie Fraser, it didn’t hold back from telling the government uncomfortable truths.  For example, in 2015, when the government proposed its emissions targets that were later agreed to in Paris, Fraser released a statement, making several confronting “observations” about the government’s targets. Among those observations, he noted they were too weak, said they would place “Australia at or near the bottom of the group of countries we generally compare ourselves with” and criticised the government’s claim that “Australia outperformed its Kyoto protocol first commitment”, noting those targets allowed Australia’s emissions to keep rising.  By that time, it was government policy to axe the Climate Change Authority, something the Coalition has not managed to pass through the parliament. But they have successfully ignored them and since stacked the board of the “independent” body with former conservative politicians and lobbyists. Under a new leadership, and with many new members, the authority’s September 2016 report had clearly been designed to present recommendations that, rather than being informed by the science and risked making the government uncomfortable, were designed to be palatable to the Coalition. Rather than proposing good policy, the report tried to find policy that might be acceptable to a government that didn’t want to take action on climate change. As a result, it suggested the Direct Action policy should be strengthened and an emissions intensity scheme should be introduced to the electricity sector. Moreover, rather than analysing what policies could help meet a “two-degree pathway” – one that would help limit global warming to 2C – it analysed policy that might help Australia meet its existing emissions targets. But, of course, all the science available demonstrated those targets were completely inadequate to meet the 2C goal.  Two members of the authority – climate scientist David Karoly and economist Clive Hamilton – were so outraged by the move that they essentially split from the other members and released what they called a “minority report”. In their report, they said the authority’s recommendations were “framed to suit a particular assessment of the political circumstances prevailing in the current parliament”, instead of recommending policy based on science and economics, and were “seemingly based on a reading from a political crystal ball”.  “Attempts to craft ‘politically realistic’ policies risk being seen as partisan and damage the authority’s reputation for independence,” Karoly and Hamilton said. Jotzo, who is not associated with the authority, was also highly critical of the main report. “The intent clearly is to help policy progress in the medium term,” he said. “But it risks locking in a policy suite that will not deliver much, or may cost too much.”  Since then Hamilton and two other members of the authority have resigned over the government’s attitude to climate change and to the authority. But there was debate about the virtue of the Climate Change Authority’s compromised move. Some of those who had watched the climate wars continue for nine years thought it presented a thread that the Coalition could grab – a last-ditch effort to allow a bipartisan approach to climate policy. Finkel was, and remains, a member of the authority and defended the controversial 2016 report against Hamilton and Karoly’s criticisms as not only “evidence based” but also “clever”. He claimed criticism of the report was based on “clickbait headlines” and commentators who had not bothered to read the report.  In the end the Climate Change Authority’s gamble was lost. The government rejected its recommendations out of hand. The compromised advice was for nothing and, if anything, just shifted the policy debate further down that compromised path.  The political calculation made by that Climate Change Authority report, and the Finkel review, is identical. The idea is that there is no point making recommendations that will be ignored by government, so why not present something that they might listen to? “Really when an independent review is done, then it can take two approaches,” Jotzo said. “One is to point out the principles and do the analysis on the basis of those principles and come out with deeply principled recommendations. “Or alternatively it can seek to provide a way to achieve political compromise.” The motivation for coming out with a report that is not entirely principled cannot be understood without understanding the history of Australia’s so-called “climate wars”, which has been fueled by relatively ambitious proposals failing due to political realities.  This year represents, by some accounting, the 10th anniversary of the war. In 2007, both major parties, led by John Howard and Kevin Rudd, went to the election promising an emissions trading scheme. Rudd won the election but, by the time he tried to get the emissions trading scheme through the parliament, the Coalition had shifted to oppose it. They managed to block the passage of the scheme, with the help of the Greens, who opposed it because the targets were too weak, and there was no mechanism by which to ratchet them up. From there, it seemed to be a matter of history repeating itself. In November 2011, the Labor party, led by Julia Gillard, passed another emissions trading scheme through the parliament. Labelled a “carbon tax” by the Coalition, it was axed after Tony Abbott campaigned and won the 2013 federal election with a central policy of “axing the tax”. Then, of course, Malcolm Turnbull lost the leadership of the Coalition in 2009 over his support for an emissions trading scheme, only getting it back with the apparent promise to not adopt it again.  Similarly, just when it looked like the Coalition could be coaxed to support an emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector, Turnbull was forced to rule it out. “That’s the root of all of this,” Jotzo said. “The repeated experience that the political forces against meaningful climate policy in Australia are very strong. “There have been a number of these kinds of experiences in succession where policy approaches that, in retrospect, seem relatively ambitious were tried and ultimately failed for one reason or another. That’s what’s behind the scaling back of the advice that is provided by these bodies and organisations.”  The closest Australia has come to meaningful climate policy was when it had some meaningful climate policy: the “carbon tax”. Jotzo said the lessons from that appeared to be that a fundamentally worse policy – but one that was politically more feasible – would have been better, all things considered. “If you look back at that and say, ‘Hang on, what else could have been done to help make it last”’, then immediately people would say it could have started with less ambition - a lower price [on carbon],” Jotzo said.  “And something could have been done on electricity prices to neutralise electricity prices as an issue. And doing that would have compromised the efficiency of the scheme but in retrospect you would now say it would have given it a chance of survival.” But whether that sort of calculation ought to be made by the chief scientist – and if so, whether he’s made it correctly – has split commentators and analysts. David Karoly, the member of the Climate Change Authority who co-authored the “minority report” in 2016 is highly critical of Finkel’s review, for the same reason he was critical of the politically motivated authority report. “One of the reasons Alan Finkel was appointed as chair of this electricity review was because he was appointed chief scientist by the current government,” Karoly said, arguing that this government wants to control what advice they receive. “That is not providing independent advice – that is giving advice that is considered to be acceptable by the paymasters.”  When pushed, Karoly accepted that it could be worth compromising the principle of independent advice, if that compromised advice could really help get meaningful climate policy accepted by government. But he thinks Finkel’s recommendations don’t do that.  “I’m opposed to a part-way solution,” he said. “It’s a bit like getting from Melbourne to Tasmania – building a bridge that gets you a third of the way doesn’t get you there at all. “The whole way there is zero emissions ... I know that the Liberal party doesn’t want to know about that but that is what we have to do.”  Jotzo is more positive about the progress made by Finkel’s political intervention. “So, the initial reaction is really very positive in that there was really very vocal support from many parts of industry – the energy industry in particular,” he said. “We also clearly had cabinet clearly supporting the Finkel recommendations and we had Labor in opposition with some tentative support for the recommendations. “And that in itself is a better situation than we’ve had for a very long time in Australian climate policy. “It’s a good thing that the Finkel review had a crack at it.” But he said there was a risk in having “independent reviews” going down this more political path, and recommending policy options that aren’t the best ones, given the evidence at hand. “If it all falls in a heap, then certainly that gamble was lost and for sure there’s a problem. As we move from first best solution to second best and so forth, there’s a risk that we lose sight of what first-best would actually look like – and therefore what we should be aiming next time around.”"
"The fight against global warming is one of humanity’s great moral movements, alongside the abolition of slavery, the defeat of apartheid, votes for women and gay rights, according to the former US vice-president and climate campaigner, Al Gore. The battle to halt climate change can be won, he said, because the green revolution delivering clean energy is both bigger than the industrial revolution and happening faster than the digital revolution. Gore has played a major global role in raising awareness of the dangers of climate change since his 2007 film An Inconvenient Truth and made his comments, among his most outspoken to date, in a recent speech in London. “The climate movement should be seen in the context of the great moral causes that have transformed and improved the outlook for humanity,” he told the Ashden green energy awards ceremony. “It was wrong to allow slavery to continue, it was wrong to deny women the right to vote, it was wrong to discriminate on the basis of skin colour or who you fell in love with. “When the central issue was thus framed in stark relief because of who we are as human beings, the outcome became foreordained,” Gore said. “We chose what was right, and now in this case it is clearly wrong to destroy the prospects of living prosperously and sustainably on a clean earth when we bequeath it to our children. It is wrong to use the sky as an open sewer, it is wrong to condemn future generations to a lifetime haunted by continual declines in their standard of living, and give them a world of political disruption and all the chaos that the scientists have warned us about.” Gore acknowledged there was opposition to strong action on climate change, but cited the US civil rights movement as an inspiration: “During some of the bleakest days of the civil rights movement, Dr Martin Luther King Junior was asked by one of his fellow advocates how long is this going to take and he famously answered, not long because no lie can live for ever.” Gore, whose new film An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is released this summer, said while the moral argument meant humanity would confront climate change, the rapid growth of the low-carbon economy meant it could be successful. “There is now in our world a sustainability revolution and it’s best understood, in my view, by placing it in the context of other great global transformations – the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, the digital revolution,” he said. “This sustainability revolution has the breadth and magnitude of the industrial revolution but it has the speed of the digital revolution. “Instead of beginning in a corner of the UK in a world of 1.5bn people, and then slowly spreading to western Europe and North America, this sustainability revolution is being jump started in rich and poor countries alike in every corner of this world of 7.4 billion people,” he said, likening it to the rapid spread of mobile phones around the world. Gore is not the first climate campaigner to make a moral argument for acting on global warming. In 2014, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, one of the most revered figures of South Africa’s anti-apartheid struggle, called for action against fossil fuel interests.  “During the anti-apartheid struggle, using boycotts, divestment and sanctions, we were not only able to apply economic pressure on the unjust state, but also serious moral pressure. People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,” he wrote in the Guardian. Gore told his London audience he was optimistic of success, despite the recent US withdrawal from the global Paris climate accord: “No one person can stop the climate movement or the sustainability revolution – we are going to win no matter what President Donald Trump tries to do.”"
"Carlsberg has unveiled plans to reduce its brewery carbon emissions to zero, singling out Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement as a motivating factor. The Danish brewer, whose beers also include Holsten Pils and San Miguel, said it would eliminate brewery emissions and halve its water usage by 2030 as part of a new sustainability drive.  This will include closing down small coal power stations at breweries in China, India and Poland, replacing them with renewable sources such as solar panels and biogas. Carlsberg’s resolve to go green had been hardened by Trump announcing plans for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, its chief executive Cees t‘Hart said. “People in Carlsberg are more energised after Trump said no to the Paris agreement,” he said. “We feel we can take responsibility in our own hands and don’t need to depend on politicians for this. You could argue it’s a drop in the ocean, but if everybody says that we won’t make any progress.”  T’Hart said Carlsberg’s plans, which include using only renewable energy to brew beer by 2022, were equivalent to taking 160,000 cars off the road. The company does not expect to incur extra costs because it will shift investment from elsewhere in the business and expects the sustainability plan to reduce costs, such as energy bills, over time. It will also hire PhD students to work in its laboratories on ways to reduce its carbon footprint and ask suppliers, such as firms that make packaging or grow barley, to implement their own environmental measures. As well as aiming for zero emissions, Carlsberg will also step up its alcohol-free offering to target irresponsible drinking. T’Hart said this was partly aimed at a “millennial generation” that drinks less than older people, as well as pregnant women and health-conscious consumers ditching sugary soft drinks."
"The fact that Naomi Klein predicted the forces that explain the rise to power of Donald Trump gives her no pleasure at all. It is 17 years since Klein, then aged 30, published her first book, No Logo – a seductive rage against the branding of public life by globalising corporations – and made herself, in the words of the New Yorker, “the most visible and influential figure on the American left” almost overnight. She ended the book with what sounded then like “this crazy idea that you could become your own personal global brand”. Speaking about that idea now, she can only laugh at her former innocence. No Logo was written before social media made personal branding second nature. Trump, she suggests in her new book, No Is Not Enough, exploited that phenomenon to become the first incarnation of president as a brand, doing to the US nation and to the planet what he had first practised on his big gold towers: plastering his name and everything it stands for all over them.  Klein has also charted the other force at work behind the victory of the 45th president. Her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine, argued that neoliberal capitalism, the ideological love affair with free markets espoused by disciples of the late economist Milton Friedman, was so destructive of social bonds, and so beneficial to the 1% at the expense of the 99%, that a population would only countenance it when in a state of shock, following a crisis – a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a war. Klein developed this theory first in 2004 when reporting from Baghdad and watching a brutally deregulated market state being imagined by agents of the Bush administration in the rubble of war and the fall of Saddam Hussein. She documented it too in the aftermath of the Boxing Day tsunami in Sri Lanka, when the inundated coastline of former fishing villages was parcelled up and sold off to global hotel chains in the name of regeneration. And she saw it most of all in the fallout of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, when, she argued, disaster was first ignored and exacerbated by government and then exploited for the gain of consultants and developers. Friedmanites understood that in extreme circumstances bewildered populations longed above all for a sense of control. They would willingly grant exceptional powers to anyone who promised certainty. They understood too that the combination of social media and 24-hour cable news allowed them to manufacture such scenarios almost at will. The libertarian right of the Republican party, in Klein’s words, became “a movement that prays for crisis the way drought-struck farmers pray for rain”. In 2008, the year after The Shock Doctrine was published, Klein believed that the financial crash would prove a reckoning for this cynical philosophy. That the ways in which the Wall Street elite had enriched itself through manipulation and deregulation would finally be exposed in plain sight. In retrospect, it seems, the monumental frailties of the system, its patent vulnerability, allied with concerns over terrorism and a global refugee crisis, only made populations more desperate and fearful. They appeared to crave anyone who could suggest simple solutions to apparently intractable problems. Anyone who said that they could turn back the clock to “make America great again” and who had the branded cap to prove it. For those of us who can’t help looking at those events without turning lines from WB Yeats’s The Second Coming over in our heads (“what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?”), Klein’s new book – which examines in detail both the phenomenon of Trump and how liberal and progressive forces might counter his reality – is a brilliant articulation of restless anxiety. Speaking at her home in Toronto last week, Klein suggested to me that Trump’s novelty was to take the shock doctrine and make it a personal superpower. “He keeps everyone all the time in a reactive state,” she said. “It is not like he is taking advantage of an external shock, he is the shock. And every 10 minutes he creates a new one. It is like he has these lasers coming out of his belt.” She wrote the book very fast, much faster than is her usual habit, because she feared that the further into a Trump administration America travels, the less scope there might be for resistance, for building an alternative. In this she believes that there are important precedents for people to understand. She points hopefully to the example of Spain in 2004, when after the Madrid train bombings the prime minister, José Maria Aznar, announced that a state of emergency and special state powers were necessary. The people, remembering Franco, took to the streets to reject that analysis and kicked the government out, voting in a party that would pull Spanish troops out of Iraq. She is fully aware, too, of the alternative in Turkish president Recip Tayyip Erdoğan’s successful plea for dictatorial powers following the chaos of the failed coup in 2016. Klein’s book sets out those examples in advance of any comparable shock in America, and makes the case for collective resistance in the event of crisis. “I hope none of it happens [in the States] and none of it is useful,” she says, “but just in case, I wanted to have it out there as soon as possible.” The daughter of American parents, Klein lives in Toronto with dual citizenship. When she thought about putting her book together, her original plan was for an anthology of articles threaded together with interviews, but once she started analysing the presidency she kept writing in a kind of frenzy. One of the benefits of having a deadline and an all-consuming project was that it meant she was forced to use the blocking app Freedom to protect her from the distraction of the internet. “I think if I hadn’t written this book I just would have stared at Twitter like many others for months on end, watching it unfold, and writing snippy things at people.” That tendency among Trump’s critics, she says, is a symptom of his banal influence. She devotes one section of her book to the notion that through Twitter Trump is making the political sphere in his own image and that “we all have to kill our inner Trump”. Among other things, she says, the president “is the embodiment of our splintered attention spans”. One essential ingredient of resistance, she suggests, is to retain a belief in telling and understanding complex stories, keeping faith with narrative. One of the questions that Klein’s book does not reach a conclusion about is how conscious Trump is of his shock doctrine tactics. Is he a demagogue in the scheming manner of Putin and Erdoğan, or just a useful idiot for the forces around him? “I think he is a showman and that he is aware of the way that shows can distract people,” she says. “That is the story of his business. He has always understood that he could distract his investors and bankers, his tenants, his clients from the underlying unsoundness of his business, just by putting on the Trump show. That is the core of Trump. He is undoubtedly an idiot, but do not underestimate how good he is at that.” Beyond that he has, presumably wittingly, “surrounded himself with some of the world’s most expert crisis profiteers”. Men who have made billions out of meltdown and financial crisis, such as Wilbur Ross, the “king of bankruptcy” who is now secretary of commerce, or the various crash-plutocrats recruited from Goldman Sachs and elsewhere. (“In any other moment,” Klein says with a laugh, “the very fact that the CEO of Exxon Mobil is now the secretary of state would be the central scandal. Here we have a situation where there is so much else to concern us it is barely a footnote.”) Klein’s book on Trump comes garlanded with quotes from just about every notable leftwing intellectual celebrity you can think of. Noam Chomsky calls it “urgent, timely, and necessary”. Yanis Varoufakis describes it as “a manual for emancipation by means of the only weapon we have against orchestrated misanthropy: constructive disobedience”. Michael Stipe, meanwhile, asks: “Who better than Naomi to make sense of this madness, and help us find a way out?” Does she recognise the danger that she is preaching only to the converted, and further entrenching our polarised politics? She obviously hopes that is not the case, pointing to the parts of the book in which she criticises Hillary Clinton and Obama and (even) Bernie Sanders for failing to connect effectively enough to the lives of the left-behind. Her overriding anxiety is that while the liberal left wrings its hands over the ways that the US election was lost, and gets embroiled in Russian conspiracy theories, not enough attention is being paid to the conspiracy happening in plain sight: the dangers of kleptocracy, and the broken promises to the working class. “I am not saying Russia is not important,” she says, “but Trump’s base is very well defended against that: ‘the liberal media is out to get him’, ‘it’s fake news’, and all the rest.” While we are all clicking and fixing our eyes on the never-ending Trump show – the handshake with Macron, the hand-holding with May – he is, she argues, enacting policies that are systematically moving wealth upwards, and crucial questions are not being asked loudly enough: Is your social security safe? Is your healthcare safe? Are your wages going to be driven down? “He benefits so much from that focus away from economics.” Klein has not been surprised how, at a time of economic downturn and mass migration, nationalism has once again proved such a potent force in successive elections in the west. She makes the argument that the only thing that can rival those forces of white nationalism and xenophobia is a justice-based economic populism on the left. What Hillary Clinton’s campaign proved, she suggests, is that when you run a centrist free-market candidate against “fake populism” it’s a recipe for disaster. Doesn’t the election of Macron in France prove that pragmatic centrism is still a viable force if the right candidate emerges to express it? Klein believes the jury is out on that question. “The fact is Le Pen did better in that election than she ever should have. I think the issue is what happens if Macron governs with the kind of austerity that has fuelled these forces, and his shine wears off? What happens the next time around?” The analogy that Le Pen equals Donald Trump is not exact, she says. “It is more Le Pen equals David Duke [former leader of the Ku Klux Klan]. If David Duke got the percentage of the vote that Le Pen got, we would be terrified, as well we should be.” Klein welcomes the emergence of unashamedly leftwing candidates, with an ability to inspire enthusiasm, particularly among the young. She points to the nostalgic socialism of Sanders, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Jeremy Corbyn as evidence of this. But don’t they look more like the past than the future? “I don’t think any of these guys figured it out,” she says. “But we should think about the fact that Mélenchon could get 70,000 people at a rally from nowhere, and look at the surge we have seen with Corbyn. Especially given the fact that he is kind of the exact opposite of a charismatic politician.” (Once the result was known, Klein emailed to say: “The UK election really showed the power of leading with substance and ideas, rather than slick packaging and fear. The more May tried to exploit people’s fear and shock – telling them they might need to give up their privacy and human rights to fight terror, that they should delegate their rights to her – the more [Corbyn’s] message of hope, that positive ‘yes’ looked like the better option to many people.”) In this sense, Klein places a lot of faith in the cyclical nature of cynicism and hope, believing that the generation now in its teens and 20s is much less phobic of electoral politics than her generation ever was. She experienced a version of that cycle in her own growing up. She was in many ways born to protest, the third Klein generation of principled resistance. It began with her paternal grandparents, Anne and Philip, who met as communists in Newark, New Jersey, in the 1930s. Philip was an animator for Walt Disney. He organised a strike at the studios during the making of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and was fired as a result. He went to work in a shipyard, before he and his wife became part of the nascent green movement, living at the Nature Friends retreat in Paterson, New Jersey, tending their vegetables, listening to Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie. Klein’s parents took that retreat from American life a stage further by moving to Canada, in part in protest over the Vietnam war. Her father worked as a paediatrician in public hospitals. Her mother, Bonnie, a film-maker, helped to create the feminist film collective Studio D and made documentaries about Greenham Common and a polemical film against pornography. Klein has recalled how she rebelled against her radical upbringing, insisting on makeup and pop culture; how she always resented being dragged along to peace marches and demonstrations, or what she later called “another poncho picnic”. She was for most of her teens dismissive of her mother’s feminism. She credits two particular catastrophic events in changing her mind. First, aged 46, her mother suffered a brain tumour and a series of strokes that left her quadriplegic. Klein helped to nurse her for six months and was inspired by the fortitude and spirit her mother showed in her partial rehabilitation, and the strength she discovered in herself. At around the same time, during her first year at the University of Toronto, a gunman killed 14 women at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, declaring: “I hate feminists.” The event motivated Klein into political activism and she has called herself a feminist ever since, though initially she was sceptical of conventional party politics. “Among my generation there was a purist position that any contact with electoral politics was an unforgiveable compromise,” she says. “I don’t see that nearly so much in this generation. Part of it is based in movement building but it also involves running people for office at every level.” She hesitates to suggest her book as a rallying cry for a political party – she is wary of making herself anything like a figurehead, hoping to be “one voice among many” – but suggests that there are ideas in it that people might gather around. She is doing a series of (inevitably sold-out) events across the US to support the book, though she says: “I have a five-year-old son so I won’t be permanently on the road.” The part she hopes will most resonate with her audiences is the “Leap” manifesto – “an integrated leap forward on climate action, racial justice, decent jobs”. She has created Leap with her husband, Avi Lewis, a documentary film-maker, in conjunction with various activist groups – “heads of labour federations and unions, directors of major green groups, iconic indigenous and feminist leaders, key organisers and theorists focused on migrant rights, open technology, food justice, housing, faith, and more…” from across Canada and beyond. The ideas are an extension of the theme of her last book, This Changes Everything, which argued that a new progressive politics had to be built around a radical and sustainable green tech revolution, and an outright rejection of fossil fuels. The proactive message is at least as important as her deconstruction of Trump, she hopes. “When I wrote The Shock Doctrine I really did think that just showing how crisis was exploited would be enough to repel it,” she says. “Then the crash happened and I watched these social movements fill squares in Portugal and Italy and Spain – I lived there for months – all chanting ‘We won’t pay for your crisis’. I ended This Changes Everything with an interview I had with Alexis Tsipras before he was elected in Greece, where he said to me ‘It is enough in this moment to say no.’” Klein profoundly disagreed, because “no is never enough”. Anger and rejection of the status quo will never sustain people on its own. “The triumph of neoliberalism is the idea that the alternative is always even worse. To overturn that there has to be a boldness and a recapturing of the utopian imagination. If we can’t do that, then I really don’t think we have a chance against these guys.” Klein ends her current book talking about these movements that have spontaneously expressed resistance – Black Lives Matter, various green and community groups – and argues for them to come together. “To resist this we have get out of the silos,” she says. “Environmentalists in one corner, feminists in one corner, racial justice in another. We don’t have enough spaces where we can get together.” In expressing this hope, Klein references the example of her mother’s stroke and the ways that devastating event shaped her understanding of coping with crisis. She takes it as an example that sudden adversity generates strength and hope as well fear. “In a shocked state, with our understanding of the world badly shaken, a great many of us can become childlike and passive, and overly trusting of people who are only too happy to abuse that trust. But I also know, from my own family’s navigation of a shocking event, that there can be the inverse response as well. We can evolve and grow up in a crisis, and set aside all kinds of bullshit – fast.” “My mother’s stroke was a really formative moment in my life,” she says. “And I think because of it I have been attuned to seeing other expressions of that. When I started to write about crisis in The Shock Doctrine, it was with a sense that these moments of trauma could bring out the best in people.” We talk a little about how the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London have again exemplified that fact. How, contrary to the efforts of forces that might have exaggerated the fear and exploited the crisis to divide us, they became occasions to reaffirm tremendous shared humanity and spirit. One aspect of that, I suggest, is that at heart, people aren’t made to be fearful all the time, life reasserts itself. “The thing about the shock doctrine is that if they try to use it too much it stops being shocking,” Klein says. “That is the importance of historical memory in these moments – and of course Britain has the blitz spirit in its DNA: we are people who do not crumble during crisis. One of the difficulties that America faces, she suggests, is that it doesn’t have that kind of collective memory. Historical struggles that the nation has overcome – Jim Crow and civil rights, the internment of Japanese Americans during the second world war – have not been shared narratives, and therefore have been harder to unite around. She hopes that a shared investment in the environment can provide some of that social glue; in this respect, Trump’s rejection of the Paris Accord can be a starting pistol for communities to take action into their own hands. The cities and provinces that have pledged to abide by the Paris principles prove the limits of central power. “The message is that neoliberals control a lot but they don’t control everything. They don’t decide how we get our energy or move ourselves. Part of breaking the spell of neoliberalism is having people live an alternative, and cities and communities are where that happens. The institutions that used to be the backbone of social movements are in disarray and so diminished, and so we need to fix it for ourselves.” In this sense she envisages her Leap idea as a piece of open source code: “If you make activism a brand, you are in competition with similar brands, doing similar work,” she says. “With Leap, if you want it, take it, do something cool with it, if you don’t want it, who cares?” How optimistic is she about that prospect? “I have good days and bad days,” she says. “Or good parts of days and bad parts of days. It is undeniably terrifying that at this moment of such intense gravity for the planet this figure of such extreme stupidity has risen to power. But that means that there is more urgency to find solutions.” She laughs. “Will that do as my message of hope?” she asks. I guess it will for now, I say.

"Sam Brody is not a real estate agent, but when his friends want to move home they get in touch to ask for advice. He is a flood impact expert in Houston – and he has plenty of work to keep him busy. The Texas metropolis has more casualties and property loss from floods than any other locality in the US, according to data stretching back to 1960 that Brody researched with colleagues. And, he said: “Where the built environment is a main force exacerbating the impacts of urban flooding, Houston is number one and it’s not even close.”  Near the Gulf coast, Houston is also at annual risk from hurricanes: it is now into the start of the 2017 season, which runs from June to November. Ike, the last hurricane to hit the Houston region, caused $34bn in damage and killed 112 people across several states in September 2008. There is little hope the situation is going to get better any time soon. Earlier this month, days after Donald Trump announced the US will withdraw from the Paris accord on climate change, a new report warned that rare US floods will become the norm if emissions are not cut. Brody, a professor in the department of marine sciences at Texas A&M University’s Galveston campus, said the requests for help in Houston from people moving homes inspired him to create a forthcoming web tool so that people can type in an address and get a risk score. “If you can see your crime statistics, shouldn’t you be able to see your flood risk also? And other risks as well, human-induced risks?” he said. The site will be named Buyers Be-Where. In May 2015, eight people, many of them motorists, died in Harris County when a storm dropped 11in of rain in parts of the city in 10 hours. Last year, another six lost their lives in an April storm that hurled 240bn gallons of water at the Houston area. An inch of rain fell over the county in only five minutes, with a peak of 16.7in in 12 hours. The events damaged thousands of homes, turning major freeways into canals and piling up vehicles as if they were in a junkyard. The 2016 flood cost an estimated $2.7bn in losses and prompted more than 1,800 high water rescues. Significant rains have always been a feature of life in south-east Texas. What bothers Brody and local environmentalists is the extent to which human activity is making things worse. “Houston is situated in a low-lying coastal area with poorly draining soils and is subject to heavy rainfall events and storm surge events, which makes it very prone to flooding. And the climate is changing. In Galveston Bay the sea level is rising. We know the area is experiencing more heavy downpours,” Brody said. “It pales in comparison with the other driving force, which is the built environment. If you’re going to put 4 million people in this flood-vulnerable area in a way which involves ubiquitous application of impervious surfaces, you’re going to get flooding.” In other words: there is a lot of concrete in Houston. In 2000, 4.7 million people lived in the Houston metropolitan area. Now the population is about 6.5 million. While efforts are under way to densify and improve public transport in the urban core, much of the growth has been suburban, where houses are big and cheap and commuters drive long distances on some of the world’s widest freeways. The city keeps loosening its belt: a third ring-road cuts through exurbs some 30 miles from downtown, spurring more expansion. To the west, idyllically named middle-class subdivisions sprout on former farmland, served by new retail complexes and multi-lane roads. Here, 3,500 sq ft homes can be bought for less than $400,000, helping to explain the region’s population explosion. But it may be coming at a price – one paid downstream. The Bayou City’s vein-like network of creeks and rivers are one of its defining features, but heavy rains turn them from subdued to seething. The Buffalo Bayou’s light brown waters meander 50 miles from west of the city through downtown to large bays in the east. The threat of catastrophic overflowing is mitigated by two dams built in the 1940s that the army corps of engineers has classified as having an “extremely high risk” of failing and is now repairing.  The danger is lessened, too, by the natural defence of the western plains – but here, water-retaining grasses are being replaced by non-absorbent surfaces, which encourage water to travel downstream. Brody calculates that each new square metre of pavement in Houston on average adds $4,000 worth of flood damage. Founded in 1992, the Katy Prairie Conservancy, a not-for-profit land trust, has a field office in bucolic land an hour’s drive from the skyscraping oil industry headquarters dotting central Houston. The Katy Prairie was once estimated at 500,000 to 750,000 acres, before Houston boomed. The Conservancy owns about 14,000 acres – an area roughly the size of Manhattan. It helps protect another 6,000, quietly working to shield fields from sprawl in a city and state better known for damaging the environment through oil and gas production than for preserving its natural resources. “We may not be able to stop flooding but we ought to be able to better manage it,” said Mary Anne Piacentini, the executive director. “Our grasses are great water-holding reservoirs. Initial studies that we were doing with the Harris County Flood Control District show that our prairie grasses can hold up to about 8in of water.” Her colleague, Wesley Newman, likens tall grass prairies to an upside-down rainforest: the grass can grow to 6ft to 8ft above ground and two or three times as much below. “We’ve come to realise that the grassland, the tall grass prairie, is maybe even more important than the wetlands,” Piacentini said. “The more that we can restore, the more likely it is that we will be able to increase the water-holding capacity of what we do, and that affects directly downstream Houston.” Inside Houston’s second ring road, 30 miles east, a photo album sat on a table in Dean Bixler’s living room. It was not filled with happy family portraits, but murky images of the flood-ravaged rooms of his house, with sofas elevated on chairs above coffee-coloured water. The 60-year-old bought it in 1996, not imagining that his renovation budget would ever need to take the cost of pumps into account. Bixler said his house, built in 1960, has flooded three times since 2009, submerging his long front lawn and invading his home. “You could not see any grass. That’s a lot of frickin’ water,” Bixler said. In 2015, the repairs took about five months. In 2016, his flood-proofing measures kept water infiltration to an inch and a half. Bixler is a member of Residents Against Flooding, a group that last year filed a lawsuit against the city and a local infrastructure authority alleging that poorly mitigated developments are causing hundreds of homes to flood. “The truth is that most of the flooding in Houston is manmade,” said Ed Browne, another member, pointing out that many people who get flooded, Bixler included, are not in the 100-year floodplain – an area calculated to have a 1% annual chance of flooding. But Bixler’s part of town has in the past decade been extensively redeveloped, with new shopping malls, office blocks, homes and apartment complexes, many designed, critics say, with flood-control strategies such as elevation that appear to prioritise self-protection with little overall plan as to what happens to the diverted water. It is a worrying vision of the future: stronger and more frequent storms with fewer natural barriers, while rapid and haphazard urban development with limited oversight creates new at-risk zones or worsens drainage in known problem areas.  The Harris County flood control district did not respond to requests for comment; its executive director, Russ Poppe, told the Houston Press last year that there are regulations to stop builders from increasing flood risks and that it is difficult to protect against exceptionally violent storms. While residents battle for local improvements, there are predictions worthy of a disaster movie for what could happen if a powerful hurricane barrels directly into Houston’s industrial east. “If we get 20ft plus of water up the Houston Ship Channel it will be apocalyptic. I think all of us that have studied hurricanes are absolutely petrified about a big storm flooding the Houston Ship Channel and basically causing a number of those storage tanks to become unmoored and releasing their contents,” said Jim Blackburn, an environmental attorney and co-director of the Severe Storm Prediction, Education, and Evacuation from Disasters (SSPEED) Center at Rice University. “There’s a lot of very dangerous materials that are generally handled, all things considered, fairly well, but they’re not designed against 20ft floods and if we have that it’s just going to be an incredibly bleak situation,” he said. The coastal area from Galveston to Houston is home to several hundred thousand people, Nasa’s Johnson Space Center, the US’s second-biggest seaport in terms of total tonnage, some of the nation’s largest refineries and its biggest petrochemical complex. It is not lost on environmental activists that those refineries, as part of the fossil fuels industry, may be imperiled by extreme weather linked to climate change.  As a ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigation pointed out last year, had Ike been a little stronger and not changed course at the last minute in 2008, Blackburn’s nightmare scenario might have become reality.  According to the SSPEED Center, a 24ft storm surge along the Ship Channel would cause about 90m gallons of crude oil and chemical substances to rush into neighbourhoods and Galveston Bay – an event that a 2015 report claims “could easily become the worst environmental disaster in US history”. To say nothing of the economic impact on the region and the nation – a lengthy shutdown of south-east Texas’s facilities would be felt all over the country as products such as gasoline and jet fuel would become scarcer and more expensive. A multibillion-dollar coastal barrier has long been on the wish list – but is far from being realised, since there is as of yet no consensus over the design, implementation and funding. “If you look historically at major hurricane enters Galveston Bay every 15-20 years, so it’s going to happen,” said Brody, the professor.  “It is something that keeps me awake at night every June that rolls around, hurricane season, because it’s not if, it’s just when – and every year we put more people and critical assets in harm’s way. We keep rolling the dice and the stakes become higher.”"
"Current and former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees have described how work on climate change is grinding to a halt at the agency, with programs being scrapped and fears that staff may be reassigned away from climate-related tasks. The Trump administration is tearing up key planks of Barack Obama’s emissions-lowering agenda, with the president withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement last week and tasking the EPA with rewriting the clean power plan, which aims to curb greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants.  Climate work at the EPA is being systematically targeted for elimination, according to Alyssa Hall, who was the climate change adaption coordinator for EPA’s region one, which encompasses New England, until last month. “I felt like we were being attacked on a daily basis from headquarters. A lot of my projects were being cancelled or postponed indefinitely, so I was left with nothing to do,” Hall told the Guardian. Hall worked on integrating climate change considerations into the EPA’s programs, better preparing the agency for a world with higher temperatures, rising seas and more intense storms. But the change in direction under the incoming Trump administration was like “whiplash”, she said, with staff afraid of even using the term “climate change” in emails. “If it was a project associated with climate change, people at headquarters would pick up the phone rather than email,” she said. “Staff were paranoid that their programs were going to get cut if they mentioned climate change. One day it was fine and then it was like you were being slapped in the face every day.” Hall, who now works in the private sector, said that “everyone knows” at the agency that climate change staff will be sent to other areas. The EPA has reportedly started moving climate adaption employees to new roles, although an agency spokesman said he would not comment on rumors of reassignments. The climate change division and the climate protection partnership division sits within the EPA’s office of air and radiation. Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, has launched what he calls a “back to basics” strategy at the agency where focus shifts from climate change to basic functions such as cleaning up toxic sites and addressing air and water pollution. Pruitt was a key proponent of abandoning the Paris deal and spoke after Trump’s confirmed the US’s exit at the White House last week to praise the president for his “unflinching commitment to put America first”. Pruitt later toured various TV interviews on Sunday to defend leaving the voluntary accord to lower emissions, a move that has been widely criticized by businesses such as Facebook and Goldman Sachs and environmentalists but praised by leading Republicans. “This is not a message to anyone in the world that America should be apologetic of its CO2 position,” Pruitt said. “We’re actually making tremendous advances. We’re just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country.” Pruitt repeatedly refused to say whether Trump – who has expressed climate scepticism numerous times – accepted the mainstream science of climate change. The EPA administrator has previously denied that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of warming temperatures, a stance contrary to established scientific evidence and, until a recent review of content took down the page, the EPA’s own website. An EPA air quality scientist, who did not want to be named, said the leadership of the agency “seems to have disdain for our work” and claimed that climate change tasks were being wound down. “All action at the agency on climate has effectively stopped; the only thing that hasn’t is the collection of emissions data,” the scientist told the Guardian. “Climate work has been de-emphasized and halted. There was a climate conference in Atlanta last month and EPA employees were told not to go, so even simple interactions are coming to an end.” The scientist said many of his colleagues “no longer respect our administrator”. “He’s made public statements that are counterfactual; he doesn’t seem to understand basic science,” the scientist said. “There are no lines of authority any more. Pruitt makes statements in public, but I don’t take my orders through the media. “There’s a sizeable group at the EPA worried about out jobs an the ability of the agency to perform its core role. I don’t think the administration is serious about protecting human health, but I am, and I’m going to keep at it.” The administration’s budget proposal calls for the EPA’s funding to be cut by a third, eliminating dozens of programs such as climate change, anti-pollution efforts at the Great Lakes and Gulf of Mexico and severely paring back money going to toxic cleanups, known as Superfund sites. Some former EPA employees have expressed concern that the agency’s basic civil and criminal enforcement actions would be undone by a budget that axes money used to help bring cases against errant polluters. Cynthia Giles, who was an EPA assistant administrator for the office of enforcement in the Obama administration, said the the budget would prevent major EPA cases such as the successful pursuit of BP over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill and Volkswagen over the emissions cheating scandal. “To bring cases you need money for monitoring equipment, engineering issues, management of millions of documents – all that would be zeroed out in this budget,” Giles told the Guardian. “Enforcement is focused on the biggest threats to public health, cases the states can’t and won’t do. The message this budget sends is that enforcement laws aren’t a priority for this administration, which is very concerning.” The EPA’s 2018 budget is very unlikely to exactly mirror the Trump administration’s request, however, with Congress set to craft its own version this year."

"Global warming is likely to wipe out half of the coffee growing area in Ethiopia, the birthplace of the bean, according to a groundbreaking new study. Rising temperatures have already damaged some special areas of origin, with these losses being likened to France losing one of its great wine regions. Ethiopia’s highlands also host a unique treasure trove of wild coffee varieties, meaning new flavour profiles and growing traits could be lost before having been discovered. However, the new research also reveals that if a massive programme of moving plantations up hillsides to cooler altitudes were feasible, coffee production could actually increase.  Coffee vies with tea as the world’s favourite beverage and employs 100 million people worldwide in farming the beans alone. But climate change is coffee’s greatest long-term threat, killing plantations or reducing bean quality and allowing the deadly coffee leaf rust fungus to thrive. Without major action both in the coffee industry and in slashing greenhouse gas emissions, coffee is predicted to become more expensive and worse-tasting. The research combined climate-change computer modelling with detailed measurements of current ground conditions, gathered in fieldwork that covered a total distance of 30,000km within Ethiopia. It found that 40-60% of today’s coffee growing areas in Ethiopia would be unsuitable by the end of the century under a range of likely warming scenarios. But the study, published in the journal Nature Plants, also shows that major relocation programmes could preserve or even expand the country’s coffee-growing areas. “There is a pathway to resilience, even under climate change,” said Aaron Davis, at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK, who conducted the work with Ethiopian scientists. “But it is a hugely daunting task. Millions of farmers would have to change.” However, by 2040, such moves uphill will have reached the top of Ethiopia’s mountains. “It literally reaches the ceiling, because you don’t have any higher place to go,” Davis said.  The impacts of global warming are already being seen as temperatures have been rising steadily in Ethiopia for decades. Farmers report a longer, more extreme dry season and more intense rain in the wet season, with good harvests much less frequent than in their parents and grandparents’ time.  One famous coffee location likely to be lost is Harar. “In one area, there are hundreds if not thousands of hectares of dead trees,” said Davis. “It is a world renowned name and has been grown in that area for many centuries. But under all [climate change] scenarios, it’s going to get worse. “Some of the origins, what you would call terroir in the wine industry, will disappear, unless serious intervention is undertaken,” he said. “It would be like losing the Burgundy wine region. Those areas are found nowhere else but Ethiopia, and because of the genetic diversity, the diversity of flavour profiles is globally unique.” Both arabica and robusta coffee originated in Ethiopia and wild arabica plants are virtually unknown outside the country. The wild arabica varieties may well harbour traits for disease and drought resistance that could prove vital for the future health of coffee crops.  Prof Sebsebe Demissew, from the University of Addis Ababa and one of the research team, said: “Coffee originates from the highland forests of Ethiopia, and it is our gift to the world. As Ethiopia is the main natural storehouse of arabica genetic diversity, what happens in Ethiopia could have long-term impacts for coffee farming globally.” The new research is a “brilliant piece of work”, according to Tim Schilling, chief executive of the World Coffee Research programme: “This is the only comprehensive, country-specific study I have seen that uses some of the best methods in climate modelling coupled to very rigorous ground-truthing – extremely useful for governments and industry and a model to be repeated.” Schilling led an expedition into South Sudan in 2013 to confirm wild arabica coffee was also present in the Boma forest: “What we found was major degradation caused by climate change on the forest and the wild coffee under its canopy. That is pretty much what I think we can expect if nothing is done to preserve the arabica genetic treasure chest in Ethiopia.” Schilling said new varieties and growing methods must be developed and that plantation “migration will have to be part of a plan B”. He added: “Plan C might be moving up in latitude and growing coffee in Southern France and Texas!” But he said funding all this is difficult when coffee producers are not making much money at present. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2014: “The overall predictions are for a reduction in area suitable for coffee production by 2050 in all countries studied. In many cases, the area suitable for production would decrease considerably with increases of temperature of only 2-2.5C.” It said that in Brazil, the world’s biggest coffee producer, a temperature rise of 3C would slash the area suitable for coffee by two-thirds in the principal growing states. In 2016, other researchers predicted climate change will halve the world’s coffee-growing area. “People should also be thinking about the millions of smallholder farmers who put their coffee on the table,” said Davis. “The coffee farmers of Ethiopia are really on the frontline [of climate change] – they are the people who will pay the price first. In the longer term, the only truly sustainable solution is to combat the root causes of climate change.”"
"I was debating this article. Should I write about the news that just occurred, or the news that will occur soon? I chose the past event – flooding in Missouri, USA. I will save a soon-to-collapse portion of the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica for my next article. It’s sad, but true, that there are mounting ironies around Trump’s scientific ignorance on climate change and his ditching of the Paris Accord to reduce global warming. Scientists know the Earth is warming and that humans are the cause. One consequence of the warming is that weather is becoming more extreme. This means we are getting more extreme storms, including rain and floods. As our nation and the world suffers from the extreme weather, we can reflect on how things could have been different had our politicians heeded the warnings.  While President Trump’s pulling from the Paris treaty was worldwide news, what was not covered as well was his declaration the very next day that the state of Missouri is a disaster area because of flooding.  Why is flooding a symptom of warming? As air warms, it holds more moisture - it’s more humid. As the Earth warms, it means that the atmosphere holds more moisture year round. That moisture falls during storms as rain. What’s interesting is that the result is more of the most severe rains. That is, when it rains, it’s raining harder. Consequently, more flooding occurs. And we are seeing that across our nation. If you look at the trends in the most severe downpours, they are increasing – everywhere. One example are the recent floods in Missouri, which occurred during the month of May. On or around May 24th, 2017, the Missouri governor requested disaster aid for 45 counties in the state. The president granted the aid on June 2nd. The federal aid will help the state recover from approximately $28 million in residential losses and $58 million in municipal damage. Images from the flood have been widely available online for people to witness the disaster.  This flood isn’t a single event. There has been much recent reporting on other floods in Missouri and elsewhere throughout 2015 and 2016. For instance, here describes flooding in August 2016 and the infamous December flood in 2015, which killed at least 13 people. The kinds of extreme weather we are seeing now will continue to get worse and cause far more damage in the future. This is but the tip of the iceberg. Fortunately, there is something we can do about it. The two most important steps are mitigation and adaptation. We should mitigate against future climate change by quickly reducing our carbon pollution. We can accomplish this by using our energy more wisely and by increasing our generation of power from clean, renewable, sources. Secondly, we should start to plan the infrastructure of the future to handle more extreme storms and weather. Flood control systems, sea walls, robust electrical grids, etc. These can go a long way reducing the damage when extreme weather occurs.  But, it isn’t clear we will have such foresight. Not only do we have a president who is on a warpath to destroy our mitigation and adaptation efforts, but he is aided by people within states like Missouri. For instance, Missouri Senator Roy Blunt is a well-known denier of human-caused climate change. He has stated: There isn’t any real science to say we are altering the climate path of the Earth.  Say what? Missouri Representative Jason Smith has claimed: The EPA uses the Air, Climate, and Energy program to advance research and regulations that are geared toward a climate change agenda. Huh? What is a climate change agenda? Missouri Representative Vicky Hartzler said: Enjoying another beautiful global warming day in Missouri. A remnant organization of the prior USA president, Organizing for Action, also lists some of the most well known deniers and climate impacts on their states. For Missouri, it isn’t just the most recent years of flooding; the disasters have piled up for a while. For instance, as reported: A large list of some of the most well-known deniers are provided here so readers can find out who to thank when weather – pumped up by human warming – comes to their neighborhood.  So, will people put 2 and 2 together as they pick up the pieces of their lives and homes? Will they think about the irony that the people they elected have helped blocked our efforts to reduce the very floods that destroyed their communities? I think they will.

"The Paris climate change agreement will survive Donald Trump’s decision to pull out. It was not a surprise, but it is a shock to the deal so painstakingly woven together after years of effort only 18 months ago. It is another indication of US readiness to abandon global leadership, and it is a gift to China, ambitious to be seen as a mature and reliable global player, and already a world leader in renewable energy technology. There will not be immediate consequences for the planet, but the time available for effective action is already perilously short; even the threat of a backward step by the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases could carry serious consequences. Yet it is now clear how soundly the Paris agreement has been built: nearly 150 of the 197 signatories have ratified the deal. Pulling out even as big a part of the edifice as the US will not destroy it. The reaction to President Trump’s decision suggests that just as Brexit has made the rest of the EU come together, so support for the Paris agreement will be reinvigorated. From the immediate public condemnation of the move by Germany, France, Italy and China, and India’s reaffirmation of its commitment, to the Vatican’s description of it as a slap in the face for the pope, it may be that this will galvanise the rest of the world. There is still a chance that the US will not, in the end, withdraw. The agreement’s built-in time delay means it cannot happen until the next presidential election year, 2020. There are echoes here of an earlier attempt by Republicans to stymie a climate deal. In 2005, George W Bush’s White House refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, and then insisted on a twin-track approach which allowed it to appear concerned while blocking every possible deal. Finally, in Bali in 2007, a Papua New Guinea delegate bellowed at a procrastinating American representative: “If you’re not willing to lead, get out of the way!” Over the next eight years, under pressure of the evidence, the tireless and creative efforts of UN negotiators like Christiana Figueres and the leadership of Barack Obama, who wanted it to be part of his legacy, a deal was devised. The Paris agreement is not perfect, but it is intended to ratchet up slowly to achieve the target of holding global warming to 2C. It establishes a fund to help the countries most affected by climate change and created the confidence that has rapidly accelerated the development of renewable energy sources. No investor would take seriously the risks of restarting US coalmines. The secretary of state and former Exxon boss Rex Tillerson, who barely a fortnight ago signed the Fairbank agreement stressing the threat of global warming to the Arctic, knows that. Ivanka Trump was said to be lobbying business to buy advertising space demanding that her father, the president, change his mind. There has been a furious response from Republicans as well as Democrats, and high-profile resignations by people like the Tesla car developer Elon Musk from presidential advisory councils. One World Trade Center, along with other iconic buildings around the world, has been lit up in green. Michael Bloomberg has said he will personally compensate the UN for the $15m it will lose.  All of that makes Theresa May’s response even more of a disgrace. In this election week, it is worth remembering that she put her relationship with Mr Trump ahead of solidarity with European leaders. That suggests there is a further lesson from the different responses to Mr Trump’s zero-sum view of global affairs. It comes as no surprise to find that the Trump White House is casual with the international organisations that have contributed so much to the west’s peace and prosperity. While no one doubts Mrs May’s commitment to Nato or her desire to stay in as many common European organisations as Brexit allows, she is showing some of the instincts of an isolationist. Like much of her sceptical party, she appears uninterested in climate change. The Tories’ hug-a-husky days are truly over."
"Tony Abbott has declared the new clean energy target proposed by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, sounds like a “magic pudding” and he says the Coalition must not adopt a new tax on coal. Ahead of a discussion of the Finkel recommendations by the Coalition party room on Tuesday, the former prime minister used his regular radio interview on 2GB to sound a warning about the reforms proposed by Finkel to the prime minister and the premiers last week. “My anxiety listening to reports of the [Finkel] report, and this statement [that] they are going to reward low-emissions fuels while not punishing high-emissions fuels, is [that] it is going to be a magic pudding,” Abbott said on Monday. “If you are rewarding one type of energy, inevitably, the money has got to come from somewhere – either consumers or taxpayers. “If it is from consumers, it’s effectively a tax on coal, and that is the last thing we want.” Abbott also said the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was favourite to win the next federal election. He said the Turnbull government needed to give “our people” something to fight for – and that should be “lower power prices”. Referring to last week’s UK election, Abbott said the Coalition in Australia could not afford to be complacent and Theresa May’s poor result underscored the fact that “big things turn on personal decisions”. The Abbott critique echoes scepticism from the Coalition’s conservative wing about proposed changes to climate and energy policy, which has been on public display since Donald Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate treaty. The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has been working assiduously over the past couple of weeks to convince his Coalition colleagues to support the proposed clean energy target on the basis that is it technology neutral and will provide lower power prices than if policy is left as it currently is. Frydenberg said on Sunday the new system was friendly to coal. “We don’t want to punish the existing coal generators because we want them to remain an important part of the energy mix going forward.” Business is pressing both the government and Labor to use the opportunity of the Finkel review to try to achieve a bipartisan position and end the decade-long climate wars. But Labor has signalled it cannot accept a clean energy target that includes coal. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, criticised the Finkel review on Monday, saying it would prevent Australia meeting its Paris targets. Di Natale dismissed suggestions he was setting the Greens up to make the same mistake they did in 2009, when their refusal to support Kevin Rudd’s original emissions trading scheme guaranteed its downfall. Speaking on ABC radio on Monday, Di Natale said no one was more frustrated with the climate debate than him but Finkel’s recommendations would not help Australia meet its 1.5C target set in Paris. “We’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us ... and this does not deal with that challenge in the time frame that’s required. If under this plan we follow it through to its logical conclusion, the reef’s gone,” he said. “The great tragedy here is if we lifted our level of ambition ... we would have a framework that allows us to drive the clean energy transition away from coal and gas.” Di Natale said he was not intent on making the perfect the enemy of the good. “No, what we’re doing is we’re saying we’ve got a climate crisis, we need to deal with dangerous climate change and we need a plan to deal with that. “There’s no point having certainty if we lose the Great Barrier Reef, if we end up in a warming world where we see more extreme weather, heatwaves, cyclones, bushfires.  “That is the future that lies ahead of us, so we need to make this transition and make it rapidly.” Ross Garnaut – the architect of the 2008 climate change report – told the ABC on Monday the clean energy target proposed by Finkel was not as economically efficient as straightforward carbon pricing, or an emissions intensity scheme, but it was more efficient as a market mechanism than the renewable energy target. “In current circumstances, it’s the only pricing mechanism that’s got any chance of getting through the current parliament,” he said. “We need something through the current parliament because we need something when the RET runs out in 2020 to take us through to 2030 and I think we should get behind this mechanism because it can do the job.” He said recommendations relating to energy security in the report were “very good, especially the requirement that new large-scale wind and solar in vulnerable regions should be required to provide grid stability services”. “The work on climate economics needs more work … [because] if you read the Finkel report, it doesn’t actually recommend targets, it leaves that open for discussion.”"
"As climate change pushes marine species towards cooler waters, and the fishing industry expands around the globe, the tropics are emptying out, a leading fisheries expert has warned. The federal government is expected to release its new management plan for marine reserves in coming weeks, after a 2016 review recommended winding back protections. However Dr Daniel Pauly has called for the creation of more, saying they are the only realistic form of mitigation to the current crisis.  Pauly, principal investigator at the Sea Around Us research organisation, said it was unknown whether the “explosion” of fishing industries or global warming was having the biggest impact on fish stocks, but both needed to be addressed. “The depth, the distance from the coast, all of these were factors which protected fish. Now we go everywhere … now nothing protects the fish,” he said during an observation tour of Darwin’s tropical harbour. “Climate change is something that is already being perceived by fish. It’s already happening and they’re already moving,” he said. Warmer waters were pushing marine species away from the equator at a rate of about 50km per decade as they followed the ideal temperatures for feeding and spawning. “In temperate areas you will have the fish coming from a warmer area, and another one leaving. You’ll have a lot of transformation but they will actually – at least in terms of fishery – adapt. In the tropics you don’t have the replacement, you have only fish leaving.” Research by Pauly and the Sea Around Us has repeatedly called for greater focus on fisheries data from a global perspective rather than local, to properly assess the impact of commercial competition and climate change. “Locally the work must be done also, but you can get insights if you look at the global issue,” he said. Sea Around Us research has found that while the lack of industrial-scale fishing meant the problem wasn’t as bad in Australia, there were signs of a decline. Pauly said there were only a few nations – of which Australia was one – that studied the species loss in the tropics.  “You can have entire fisheries collapsing without knowing because you cannot separate the global warming-induced migration from the reduction due to fishing, or even pollution. So we will never know for sure why this or that collapse has occurred, except in a few cases.” In 2012 the Gillard government established 42 marine reserves around Australia, but these were effectively suspended by the Tony Abbott-led Coalition government, which commissioned a review.  In 2016 the review reports recommended winding back protections – advice at odds with Pauly’s views – in order to balance competing environmental, commercial, and socioeconomic interests. A new management plan for marine reserves, based on the recommendations, is due to be delivered by the commonwealth Department of Environment in coming months. Pauly said creating more marine reserves was the only real option for governments to mitigate the damage in the meantime, and aiding population growth in particular areas would spill over into fishing zones. “The only thing you can do – and it’s only mitigation – is keep the population big in the sea,” he said. Populations bounce back quickly when fishing stops, Pauly said, and a higher variance of individual fish assisted a natural evolution of greater tolerance to warmer temperatures. “Marine protected areas, marine areas, are one mitigating factor, and it’s the only thing you can do.” Pauly said marine reserves needed to exist along side good management, which Australia already had with “outstanding policies” like maximum yields. Seasonal closures weren’t enough, added Prof Jessica Meeuwig, of the University of Western Australia’s marine futures lab. Large breeding fish were still taken during open seasons, drastically upsetting population balances, and partial protections in place were inadequate. “It’s like having a Ferrari with a lawnmower engine – there’s no grunt,” she said. “That’s one of the big things we need to start having a conversation about. When you say marine park, that it’s actually a marine park that’s protected. The Great Barrier Reef marine park, 67% of it is open to fishing, and Ningaloo has 66% open to fishing.” “It gives people a false sense of security because they think they’ve protected something when they haven’t.”"
"We welcome your excellent coverage of President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement (Anger at US as Trump rejects climate accord, 2 June). However, there are references to the US joining Syria and Nicaragua in rejecting the agreement. Presented out of context, this comparison is flawed. Syria didn’t sign because of the catastrophic civil war. Nicaragua refused to sign because it believes the agreement is too weak to address the enormity of the consequences of climate change, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. Paul Oquist, Nicaraguan representative to the Paris talks, pointed out that the Paris carbon reduction targets are non-binding and even if fully met would lead to a catastrophic three-degree temperature rise. Oquist also highlighted the lack of political will and ambition on the part of the largest polluters, their failure to accept historical responsibility for global warming, and the lack of financial resources for technological transfer, adaptation, and compensation for losses and damages. He went on to say: “The Paris Agreement will not solve global warming problems but merely postpone them.”  Meanwhile, Nicaragua, a country responsible for only 0.3% of global emissions, has a renewable energy target of 90% by 2020. This programme has been praised by the Inter-America Development Bank as “a model for the world on the shift to green energy”. It is misleading to report, out of context, that the US joins Syria and Nicaragua on climate change: on this and an increasingly long list of other issues the US stands alone.Helen YuillNicaragua Solidarity Campaign • I am a 73-year-old American citizen, a progressive independent unaffiliated with any major US political party.

"A yellow submarine dubbed Boaty McBoatface has obtained “unprecedented data” from its first voyage exploring one of the deepest and coldest ocean regions on Earth, scientists have said.  The robotic submersible was given the name originally chosen for a new polar research ship by irreverent contestants in a public competition. Embarrassed officials decided to ignore the popular vote and instead named the vessel the RRS Sir David Attenborough in honour of the veteran broadcaster. A storm of protest led to a compromise that allowed the name to live on. The submarine plunged to depths as far as 4,000 metres to obtain information about temperature, water flow speed and turbulence from Orkney Passage, a region of the Southern Ocean about 500 miles from the Antarctic Peninsula.  The data will help scientists to understand the complex ways that mixing ocean waters affect climate change.  Prof Alberto Naveira Garabato from the University of Southampton said: “The Orkney Passage is a key chokepoint to the flow of abyssal waters in which we expect the mechanism linking changing winds to abyssal water warming to operate.  “Our goal is to learn enough about these convoluted processes to represent them in the models that scientists use to predict how our climate will evolve over the 21st century and beyond.  “We have been able to collect massive amounts of data that we have never been able to capture before due to the way Boaty is able to move underwater. Up until now we have only been able to take measurements from a fixed point, but now we are able to obtain a much more detailed picture of what is happening in this very important underwater landscape.” The submersible was launched from the RRS James Clark Ross as part of the seven-week expedition. It is a new type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and can travel under ice and reach depths of 6,000 metres, transmitting the data it collects to researchers via a radio link. The universities and science minister, Jo Johnson, said: “Fresh from its maiden voyage, Boaty is already delivering new insight into some of the coldest ocean waters on Earth, giving scientists a greater understanding of changes in the Antarctic region and shaping a global effort to tackle climate change.” The name Boaty McBoatface was first put forward by the former BBC radio presenter James Hand in response to a public poll organised by the National Environment Research Council to name their new £200m Arctic research vessel.  The research council was mobbed with more than 7,000 ideas for names in the month-long competition period, among them RRS Onion Knight, RRS I Like Big Boats and I Cannot Lie, and RRS Capt’n Birdseye Get Off My Cod."

"Energy and climate is a complex policy area. But the amount of rubbish floating around both from the pro-coal dinosaurs in the Coalition backbench and from similarly inclined commentators is astounding. The Finkel review recommendation a clean energy target be implemented has been at the core of conservative objections and about 20 Coalition backbenchers spoke against the recommendations in a party room meeting. Many of their arguments have been aired publicly or leaked. Here are some of the silliest.  This is the line being run by Tony Abbott and, reportedly, by others including the Victorian Liberal moderate Russell Broadbent.  For a party traditionally geared towards helping businesses make more money, this line of argument reveals the ideological commitment to fossil fuels, which ignores the pleas of energy users everywhere.  The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Energy Users Association of Australia all agree the lack of policy that puts a price on carbon is pushing up prices by stifling new investment in new generators.  At some point greenhouse gas emissions will need to be eliminated from the electricity sector; investment decisions become much riskier until investors know what the policy is that will drive that.  Finkel noted this in the first few paragraphs of his report. “We quickly discovered that, beyond the cost of gas, uncertainty around emissions reduction policies was pushing up prices and undermining reliability. Our plan removes that uncertainty.” Submissions from the big “gentailers” – companies that own generators and retail assets – made this point explicitly. Origin, Energy Australia and AGL each made submissions that argued this. Modelling in Finkel’s report – which backs up earlier modelling – shows instituting any of the emissions-lowering policies he considered would drive down both wholesale and retail electricity prices, compared with doing nothing. Why commentators and politicians would continue to argue that emissions reductions policies will push up prices, contradicting what energy generators, energy retailers and energy users say – and what all the science and modelling work shows – is a bit mysterious. The Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, who is chair of the Coalition backbench committee on climate and energy, said on Radio National on Wednesday that it would be better to “backload” emission reductions closer to when they need to be achieved, because by that time technology will be better or cheaper. In other words, we should delay cutting emissions. He said: “That will give you the opportunity to actually use a lot of these technologies as they’re developing rather than jump in now and spend billions of dollars in capital investment in some renewable technologies that in three or four years could be redundant.” But this idea seems to just be completely made up. If the aim is to reach a certain target by 2030, it will be cheaper to get there slowly, rather than to try to do it quickly at the last minute. Sending clear long-term signals to the electricity industry, which invests in assets that last decades, will be less disruptive than doing something at the last minute. Indeed, that is the plea from industry: set the emissions reduction policies in place now, so that long-term decisions can be made. As it happens, the Climate Institute modelled the exact question of the relative costs of taking action now, or leaving it to the last minute. The two cases they compared were not those being considered by the Finkel review but they showed convincingly that last-minute action causes large disruptions and comes with large social and economic costs.  Despite Finkel’s recommendations making very little dent in coal generation above business as usual, the recommendations have provoked a revolt in support of coal.  Abbott has labelled Finkel’s recommended clean energy target as a “tax on coal” and, on Radio National, Kelly said coal power is still “our lowest cost of electricity generation”. That’s just not true. If you’re comparing the cost of new-build electricity, coal is the most expensive of all. And if you’re comparing the cost of existing power, that produced from wind or solar is by far the cheapest – often bidding into auctions at zero dollars, since the marginal cost of each watt-hour they produce is virtually nothing. As it happens, while it sounds perverse to let coal get clean energy certificates, this doesn’t seem like the worst idea being floated by the pro-coal commentariat. Under the proposed clean energy target, if the benchmark were set high enough to allow so-called new “high-efficiency, low-emissions” coal power plants to receive clean energy certificates, it wouldn’t incentivise one to be built. Such a plant is clearly not economical to build now and, if it just scraped into the proposed framework, it would receive so few certificates compared to cleaner energy that it wouldn’t change the economics. Indeed, even if it were set high enough to allow the cleaner existing coal power plants to receive clean energy certificates, all it would likely do is give a boost to gas and help encourage the dirtiest coal power plants to close earlier."

"Tony Abbott has warned his successor he does not intend to quit public life, declaring Australia needs “strong liberal conservative voices now, more than ever”. The former prime minister used a speech to the Institute of Public Affairs on Tuesday to dust off a conservative manifesto for government he first flagged in February, telling his audience: “I will do my best to be a standard bearer for the values and the policies that have made us strong.”  Abbott’s latest intervention comes in the middle of an internal fight sparked by Christopher Pyne’s comments at a Liberal party function over this past weekend, in which he signalled a win on marriage equality was imminent, and boasted about the influence of moderates within the government. Pyne’s weekend indiscretion has prompted Malcolm Turnbull to dig in behind the marriage equality plebiscite, and choke off a plan by moderate MPs to bring forward a private member’s bill. Turnbull attempted to play down the latest internal divisions on Tuesday, characterising his party room as “very harmonious, very united”. In Tuesday’s speech Abbott invoked a Trumpism in reviving his conservative manifesto, arguing “we need to make Australia work again”. In an effort to differentiate his policy inclinations from Turnbull’s, Abbott rounded on the recent Finkel review of the national electricity market, which recommended the government adopt a clean energy target. Abbott said the only way to take pressure off power prices was to have a moratorium on new wind farms, stop any further subsidised renewable power and freeze the renewable energy target at 15%. He said any government “serious about keeping the lights on” would need a new coal-fired power station, even if that meant building one itself. Abbott also repeated calls for “a big slowdown in immigration” to allow new housing starts and infrastructure “to catch up with population”. “Right now, a big slowdown in immigration would take the downward pressure off wages and the upward pressure off house prices,” Abbott said. Hitting the pause button on migration would give “harder-to-assimilate recent migrants more time to integrate with the wider Australian community before many more came in”. Abbott is clear that winding back the number of immigrants would trigger a political fight with Labor, which he considers a useful development, because it would “just emphasise who’s on Australians’ side and who’s not”. The former prime minister said the government needed to get the budget back under control, and the best way to do that was “to avoid all new spending”, except for national security or economic infrastructure. He conceded it was “probably necessary to guarantee that existing beneficiaries will keep their benefits”. Abbott said tough measures were required on national security. “We not only have a right but a duty to defend our values and our way of life against those who would destroy them. “This means banning organisations that make excuses for terrorists, removing terrorist propaganda from the internet, and ensuring that known jihadis aren’t free on our streets.” Abbott said the Coalition needed to reform the Senate to ensure governments were able to pass their programs, and to differentiate sharply from Labor. “The next election won’t be won by drawing closer to Labor,” he said. “Sure, Bill Shorten can be painted as a union stooge who will put power prices through the roof, enshrine political correctness on steroids, and run the worst Labor government in our history,” Abbott said. “But you don’t win elections by saying that the alternative would be worse; you win elections by being the best possible government. “The next election can only be won by drawing up new battlelines that give our people something to fight for, and the public something to hope for.” Abbott said Australia was “a global success story” after the Hawke and Howard governments, but things had since taken a turn for the worse. “Now, we can’t even look across the Tasman without a twinge of acute embarrassment,” Abbott said. “We have an abundance of energy – but the world’s highest power prices; an abundance of land – and property prices to rival Hong Kong’s; some of the world’s smartest people – yet with school rankings behind Kazakhstan. “We need to make Australia work again – because our country, plainly, is not working as it should.”"

"China and California have signed an agreement to work together on reducing emissions, as the state’s governor warned that “disaster still looms” without urgent action on climate change. The governor of California, Jerry Brown, spoke to reporters at an international clean energy conference in Beijing about Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, saying it would ultimately prove to be only a temporary setback.  For now, he said, China, European countries and individual US states would fill the gap left by the federal government’s decision to abdicate leadership on the issue. “Nobody can stay on the sidelines. We can’t afford any dropouts in the tremendous human challenge to make the transition to a sustainable future,” Brown said. “Disaster still looms and we’ve got to make the turn.” Brown later held a closed-door meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during which the two pledged to expand trade between California and China with an emphasis on so-called green technologies that could help address climate change, Brown said. Trump’s announcement last week that he wanted to pull out of the Paris accord did not come up, according to the governor. “Xi spoke in very positive terms,” Brown told reporters after the meeting. “I don’t think there’s any desire to get into verbal battles with President Trump.” Trump’s decision drew heavy criticism within the US and internationally, including in China, which swiftly recommitted itself to the agreement forged with the administration of the former US president Barack Obama. Trump argued that the Paris agreement favoured emerging economies such as China’s and India’s at the expense of US workers. Tuesday’s agreement between California and China’s Ministry of Science and Technology effectively sidestepped Trump’s move, bringing about alignment on an issue of rising global importance between the world’s second-largest economy — China — and California, whose economy is the largest of any U.S. state and the sixth largest in the world. Brown signed similar collaboration agreements over the past several days with leaders in two Chinese provinces, Jiangsu and Sichuan. Like the Paris accord, the deals are all non-binding. They call for investments in low-carbon energy sources, cooperation on climate research and the commercialisation of cleaner technologies. The agreements do not establish new emission reduction goals. The US has long been a major player in the clean energy arena, driving innovations in electric cars, renewable power and other sectors of the industry. California, with some of the strictest climate controls in the nation, has been at the forefront of the sector. China in recent years overtook the US as the world leader in renewable power development. But it has also struggled to integrate its sprawling wind and solar facilities into an electricity grid still dominated by coal-fuelled power plants. At the same time, Chinese leaders face growing public pressure at home to reduce the health-damaging smog that blankets many urban areas. China is by far the world’s largest user of coal, which accounts for almost two-thirds of its energy use and has made it the No 1 emitter of climate-changing greenhouse gases. Communist party leaders pledged that greenhouse gas emissions would peak no later than 2030 under the Paris pact, and start to fall after that. They have cancelled the planned construction of more than 100 new coal-fired power plants and plan to invest at least $360bn in green energy projects by the end of the decade.  The nation’s consumption of coal fell in 2016 for a third consecutive year, but rebounded slightly in 2017. It could meet its 2030 target a decade early."
"Long-term success for farmers depends on how they treat their soil, especially as climate change is making rainfall patterns more unreliable. The make-up of soils varies enormously, sometimes from one field to another. Clay, which holds four times as much water as coarse light sand, can be a big advantage, but with too much rain can become waterlogged, leading to drowned crops. Clay soils also compress under heavy farm machinery.  A good mixture of soil particles is preferable but whatever the composition farmers have to care for their greatest single asset; they need to boost the capacity of soil to hold water, especially for annual crops, particularly in the dry east of England. Even established plants reach “wilting point” when half the available water in the soil is used up. An important factor for water retention is the soil’s organic matter. Over-cultivated, chemically fed, impoverished soils on some English farms now just have 0.5% of organic matter. The ideal is 3% or more. Crops with more organic matter in the soil thrive far longer without irrigation. This is where organic farmers, who add manure and compost to the soil, clearly benefit while at the same time reducing flooding risk and capturing carbon. At the start of this year the drought forced many farmers of all types to irrigate to save their crops. But organic growers used far less water. Irrigation is expensive and conventional farmers who also rely on costly chemical fertilisers to boost yields face a double financial squeeze. Looking after the soil is vital for survival of the industry. "
"Some of the world’s top banks are continuing to lend tens of billions for extracting the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels, according to a report of top lenders. Finance provided for these fossil fuels – tar sands and other unconventional oil and gas, as well as coal and liquefied natural gas – amounted to $87bn for the top 37 banks in 2016. That represented a slump of more than a fifth compared with the $111bn raised the previous year, and was also down on 2014’s total of $92bn.   However, the analysis, carried out by a group of NGOs including the Rainforest Action Network and Sierra Club, showed that multinational banks around the globe, including many household names, were trumpeting their green credentials while continuing to pour money into the dirtiest fuels. The report, entitled Banking on Climate Change 2017, scored the institutions from A to F on their practices, including the banks’ policies, the nature of the investments, the size and type of transactions, and the impact on climate change.  The highest rating went to a handful of banks who scored a B for having scaled back their support for coal mining and coal-fired power generation, including France’s Credit Agricole and Germany’s Deutsche Bank, but none of those studied fared well across the board, and dozens of Fs were awarded for tar sands exploitation and ultra-deep water drilling for oil. Banks in Asia tended to fare badly, including China Construction Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China and Mizuho. The UK’s HSBC and Barclays scored above average for good practice on coal mining but slipped down to a D and below on unconventional oil and LNG exports. Big banks were among the most vocal supporters of the Paris climate agreement – which aims to keep warming to below 2C – and many set out supportive policies. For instance, in 2015, ahead of Paris, Citigroup and Bank of America pledged to reduce their financing of coal as a way of limiting their exposure to carbon-intensive fossil fuels. But the report’s publishers said the finance groups needed to show more commitment in their lending practices, and warned that last year’s sharp fall in financing for carbon-intensive fuels could turn out to be a blip if banks followed the lead of Donald Trump, the US president, who this month rejected the Paris agreement. Yann Louvel, climate and energy campaign coordinator at BankTrack, said: “There is simply not enough time left for excuse-making, fiddling at the policy edges and more egregious investments in extreme infrastructure projects, [such as] pipelines that transport tar sands oil. We hear of [banks’] revulsion to Trump’s stance on climate change and their support for clean investments, yet their actions of continued investments in extreme fossil fuels demonstrate that they actually side with the Trump approach.” Lena Moffitt, senior campaign director at the Sierra Club, predicted that individual bank customers would make decisions on where to put their money based on how they performed on climate change. “The people are watching where and what banks sink their funds into, and they will not back down until every last one commits to investing in a future that benefits their communities, their economies, and their health.” Separately, research from the OECD found that few countries were doing as well as they should on fostering greener economic growth. In a survey of industrialised nations’ performance from 1990 to 2015, only about half had managed to “decouple” their economic growth from carbon emissions, which economists believe is key to maintaining prosperity while tackling climate change. The OECD named Denmark, Estonia, the UK, Italy and the Slovak Republic as those making the most progress on green growth since 2000. Simon Upton, environment director at OECD, warned that countries must step up their policies to achieve economic growth sustainably. “While there are signs of greening growth, most countries show progress on just one or two fronts and little on others,” he said. “We need much greater efforts across the board, if we are to safeguard natural assets, reduce our collective environmental footprint, and sever the link between growth and environmental pressure.” For instance, environment-related taxation has fallen in the last 20 years, and the rate of development of new green technologies has slowed since 2011. Meanwhile, air pollution remains “dangerously high”, with fewer than one in three developed countries meeting World Health Organisation guidelines on fine particulates, and an area the size of the UK has been covered by buildings since 1990, adding to stress on food supplies and water. Several banks told the Guardian they were actively engaged in a transition away from high-carbon fossil fuels. Bank of America said its coal policy had been on a “trajectory we have had in place for several years, to continue to reduce our credit exposure to the companies focused on coal mining”, and that it would “continue to help energy clients find ways to diversify their portfolio to include cleaner fuel sources”.  Standard Chartered Bank, which is active in the developing world, came 31st in the list of 37 banks in terms of exposure to high-carbon fuel. A spokesman said: “The emerging markets we operate in need reliable and accessible energy to support economic growth. This needs to be balanced by mitigating the environmental impacts of power generation and consistent with the Paris agreement. We have tightened lending criteria to the energy sector.”  Banks also said the rankings and report failed to take account of their activities in boosting the green economy, such as investments in renewable energy and underwriting green bonds for socially and environmentally beneficial projects. Deutsche Bank said it had revised its approach in December 2016, which would not have been captured in the report’s data. As a result of the revision, Deutsche Bank no longer grants new finance for greenfield thermal coal mining or new coal-fired power plant construction, and is reducing its exposure to the sector. A spokesman for HSBC said: “Dangerous levels of climate change will only be avoided by society working together, and governments, businesses, communities and civil society share a common goal. The finance sector has an important role and HSBC will play its full part in the critical transition to a low-carbon economy.”"

"Josh Frydenberg says it is too soon to say if the Coalition party room will support a clean energy target after a three-hour extraordinary meeting in which a number of government colleagues raised concerns about the core recommendations of the Finkel review. Speaking on ABC on Tuesday night, the energy and environment minister said MPs were “concerned about the future of coal” and about rising electricity prices, and he stressed the proposed clean energy target did not prohibit the building of new coal-fired power stations. A number of conservative MPs spoke during the meeting, including the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, who had pre-empted Tuesday night’s discussion by declaring the clean energy target a new tax on coal, and the chairman of the Coalition’s environment and energy committee, Craig Kelly. Abbott queried during Tuesday night’s meeting whether the government would be better off buying the Hazelwood power station than embarking on a wholesale rethink of energy policy, but was told the power plant was in the process of being dismantled. The prominent Victorian Liberal moderate, Russell Broadbent, also made a strong intervention during the meeting arguing against policy change that would push up power prices. Government sources say Broadbent argued the Coalition had spent months arguing that Labor’s renewable energy targets pushed up power prices, and now was arguing for a low emissions target that would push the share of renewables in the electricity market above 40%. One Liberal MP told Guardian Australia the bulk of the concern expressed related to the risk that the clean energy target would increase power prices. “We will wear that for the next decade – if prices go up,” the MP said. After giving a presentation to MPs early on Tuesday morning, Frydenberg took the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to brief the backbench energy committee ahead of the special party room discussion on Tuesday night, in an effort to head off significant dissent. Some government MPs went into Tuesday night’s meeting angry at what appeared to be an effort by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to limit discussion about the Finkel review during the regular Coalition party room meeting on Tuesday morning. The core recommendations of the Finkel review received support earlier on Tuesday from the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, who told Sky News that “even the National party, to a point” wanted to help the government “land” the policy that has wide support among industry. Turnbull lost the leadership of the Liberal party in 2009 over a bitter internal struggle over emissions trading. The Nationals position on the clean energy target is a critical factor in whether the policy flies or dies. National party MP and chair of parliament’s multiparty committee on energy and environment Andrew Broad spoke broadly in favour of the Finkel review during the party room meeting, and said the general consensus of the meeting was that status quo was not acceptable because it was stifling investment.“The general consensus was that the old days of opposing everything and a big tax on everything are gone,” he told Guardian Australia.  “Those views weren’t really reflected, the concerns were more about whether this policy is going to work or whether it is a Band-Aid over an electricity grid system with strcutural flaws.Broad said while he was hopeful of his party room landing some energy policy, he had yet to see an opposition go along with a policy in the national interest – including Coalition opposition. “Even if we do land on a sensible, sound position, I haven’t seen in any point of my career, where oppositions say for the sake of national interest, we will go along it – I just see how partisan it has become on both sides.” The special party room meeting comes as release of the modelling behind the Finkel report shows that an emissions intensity scheme – a form of carbon trading favoured by many industry stakeholders – would achieve lower cost greenhouse gas abatement and the CET would require “additional policy support” to reach emissions targets. At the conclusion of the party room meeting Frydenberg said the conversation had been “valuable and constructive” and had been intended to share information rather than formally decide whether to adopt a CET. Responding to reports that most MPs either rejected the policy or were skeptical of its benefits, Frydenberg denied there had been a “backbench revolt”. “There was an overwhelming feeling among those in the party room tonight that business as usual is not an option,” he said. “Many of my colleagues spoke of their personal experiences dealing with manufacturers, cafe owners, heavy industry, including the aluminium sector dealing with higher prices.” Frydenberg said Coalition members had welcomed Finkel’s recommendations to require renewable energy plants to provide more storage and for three years’ notice of closure of coal power plants. He said it was too early to say if they would support the CET, noting that they want to know more and their number one preoccupation is “rightly price”. Frydenberg acknowledged colleagues were concerned about coal because it is a “critical supply of base load power”, but noted under the Finkel plan it would still provide more than 50% of power by 2030. The environment minister said Abbott’s position to “drive down prices and ensure coal will continue” was well known but said the CET was “absolutely not” a tax on coal. “Dr Finkel has made it very clear – he’s not putting in place any prohibition on coal or other forms of generation capacity, what he’s doing is placing incentives for lower emission generation. “It’s not a price on carbon, it’s not a tax on coal.” Earlier on Tuesday, Joyce said that under the Finkel plan, coal “would not have the advantage that other forms [of electricity] would, but it wouldn’t have any sort of persecutory penalty placed against it”. Asked about Abbott’s view that a CET would be a tax on coal, he repeated that there was “no penalty placed on coal”. Joyce predicted that Labor would oppose the CET if the Coalition adopted it, and said by contrast the government was “moving to try and make sure we land this”.  “Even the National party to a point. We’re moving ... We’re all doing our bit. And the Labor party should do their bit.” The modelling, released on Tuesday evening, found that the lowest cost policy would be an emissions intensity scheme, which was already rejected by the government in November as the Finkel review was just starting.  The EIS was “followed closely” by the CET, with an EIS costing $7.50 tonne of carbon dioxide abatement, compared with $10.50 for the CET. Although the report found the CET would give lower retail electricity prices, it said it would be more expensive overall due to investment in new plant. “Although emissions are reduced under all scenarios, the 2030 target is not met without some additional policy support,” it said. Limiting the life of coal power plants to 50 years by itself would not meet targets by 2030, but the modelling found given the large number of retirements after 2030 would help meet targets after that date."

"For Australians, Donald Trump’s climate retreat is a case of “deja vu all over again”, a leader walking away from his responsibilities in a toxic cloud of self-serving populist fervour. Trump’s rebuff of global climate action is right out of the coal club’s playbook – dismiss the science, complain that other countries will get a better deal, build fear around jobs, prices and industry to resist change. We endured a similar set of rationalisations when we experienced our own populist moment when the Abbott government generated fear and loathing around the Gillard government’s market mechanism. Of course, the impact of the US isolationism is on a far grander scale. The Coalition, to its credit, has not walked away from the Paris agreement, but the justifications are eerily familiar because they were created by the same vested interests. The coal club may know the long-term game is up, but is in a desperate last-ditch battle to give itself another 30 years of profits by locking in new coal-fired generation around the globe. Its members stalk the halls of power to spread three conceits: the science is not conclusive; that supply cannot be secure without coal and that prices will rise at unacceptable levels if meaningful action is taken. The drum is still being banged in Australia, with the recent confected panic over South Australian renewables a textbook study in opportunism. But four years on from Tony Abbott’s climate retreat, wholesale power prices have doubled anyway, business is crying out for a coherent policy, the government is desperate to contrive a plausibly deniable market mechanism and the public mood has shifted. As we reported last week – acceptance of climate science is at its highest level in Australia since we started polling the issue nearly a decade ago.  And that’s not all of it: four times as many of us say Australia is not doing enough as opposed to doing too much to address climate change. This shift in public perception has been driven by a range of factors: the lived experience of extreme weather events; exciting advances in renewable technology, most notably batteries; and the global consensus that Trump is now challenging. But there are other factors since our populist moment that have changed up the game as well, most notably the campaign around the Great Barrier Reef (which Essential has been proud to work on). The Fight for the Reef campaign was designed in 2014 to highlight the effects of industrialisation on the reef, the coal ships that would take their loads over pristine waters and then threaten the reef all over again when its consumption contributed to raising water temperatures that would bleach the coral. One of the key strategies of this campaign was to build on a recurring insight – when people are asked to choose between the environment and the economy they split along predictable lines (left-right, blue collar-white collar); but when they are given propositions that align a healthy environment with a healthy economy they unite. The reef campaign has been all about giving the Queensland tourism industry – which employs upwards of 60,000 people – a voice in the climate debate. Unlike the coal club, these are small fragmented industries – dive schools, small hotels and B&Bs, a whole ecosystem of small businesses that drive regional and national economic growth. But even as US senator and maybe-Trump tamer John McCain was last week bemoaning the impending death of the reef as one of the “great tragedies of our time”, the Queensland government was under pressure to support the Adani coalmine with taxpayer dollars. Back to the old coal club playbook, the arguments are all around jobs, but responses to this week’s Essential Report shows how the reframing of the jobs issue has taken hold on the reef.  When the interests of tourism workers and the jobs of those in coal industry are lined up, far more would opt to prioritise tourism. This result would not have been possible four years ago. Sustained, strategic advocacy has shifted the debate from the knee-jerk to the nuanced. A similar dynamic is at play in Australia around power prices. Where cost was the reference point in the days of “axe the tax”, just 28% of respondents now see this as the main game. Our views are fragmented, but they indicate that the public has come to accept that energy transition will be about balance and priorities rather than false choices and slogans. Trump’s Paris withdrawal will be one of the defining decisions of a presidency that is already hurtling out of control. For Americans and for the rest of the world, the Australian experience might provide hope that such moments of populist madness can be transcended; that when the stakes are this high, such decisions will not go unchallenged. "
"You know things are bad when it takes Donald Trump pulling the US out of the Paris agreement for climate change to be discussed during the UK election. His climate denial is of the extreme and obvious variety: pages were removed from the Environmental Protection Agency website explaining its causes and consequences when he came into office. Equally if not more damaging, however, is the daily climate denial that passes mostly unremarked all around us. The Institute of Directors recently proposed not one, but two new airport runways for London in a report called Let’s push things forward. It made no mention of the effect on rising emissions and a better title might have been “Let’s push things over the edge”. The oil company BP’s irony free sponsorship of the British Museum’s Sunken Cities exhibition merely highlighted how removed climate now is from our everyday cultural imagination. Sometimes the denial is about failing to join the dots. Such as when Richard Branson rightly complained about how our “everyday actions are gravely hurting the planet”, but remained a fervent advocate of both space tourism and aviation expansion. Then there are the companies who know the problem only too well, but still plan their business without regard for internationally agreed climate targets. Pick up almost any magazine and you’ll see page after page of adverts for huge SUVs and luxury cars, all with emissions unashamedly far above what is comfortably technologically possible, and with no mention of climate. Even the travel sections of progressive newspapers see no issue in promoting a culture of guilt-free flying. How do you change a culture that is so embedded? The first step is making people aware that it’s even there. That can be done by calling it out whenever it’s spotted using the simple device of social media.  The idea was triggered by an invitation to address the Climate Psychology Alliance which explores issues of action and denial, and owes a debt to the campaign against everyday sexism and that to halt the phenomenon of all male panels at conferences through social shaming. From this weekend I’ll endeavour to collect and share examples, hashtagged #DailyClimateDenial, through the Twitter account @EverydayDenial and, for now, through my thinktank’s website. We can be spellbound by social norms into behaving in ways that can be damaging and self-destructive. Yet we’ve seen radical shifts in short periods of time in attitudes to smoking, drink driving, and intolerance toward different sexual identities.  In the age of social media ideas diffuse ever more rapidly, especially when they draw attention to an accumulating and ignored wrong. Sometimes all it can take to break the spell is for someone to start pointing things out. So, the next time you see a patio heater outside a pub warming thin air and not much else, or other such acts of egregious daily climate denial, snap it, hashtag it, and share it. If we call out denial and change attitudes, better policy and action will surely follow."

"Electricity prices paid by households are about to rapidly increase and the single person who is probably most responsible is Tony Abbott. It has been claimed that in a party room meeting Tuesday afternoon, Abbott was interjecting while Craig Laundy was speaking in favour of a clean energy target. Shouting slogans while someone talks policy is a fitting metaphor for Abbott’s contribution to the climate change debate. The Finkel report highlights what is currently wrong in Australia’s energy policy: there isn’t one. We haven’t had an effective energy policy since Abbott abolished the carbon price and replaced it with nothing. The result of this has been a lack of investment certainty. This shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone. It’s what experts were warning about for years. A failure to tackle climate change will have higher costs in the long run. But it seems that when it comes to energy policy, ignoring experts is what Australia does. Electricity prices have jumped almost 20% in some states, with many others soon to follow. Even before these increases, electricity prices are higher now than when the carbon price was in place. This is the unfortunate price that we pay when we listen to self-interested politicians and ignore experts. You might think that this all has to do with climate change. But while climate change is important, the increase in electricity prices would have happened even if we lived in the fantasy world where climate change doesn’t exist. Why? Because there is a technological transformation happening in energy, and much like the horse and cart, the VHS cassette and photo development labs, coal is about to be pushed out of the market by something better and cheaper. While you might be able to find those who cling to the past and try and convince people that coal still has a future, it is telling that none of them are investors in electricity generation. Those who have to come up with the money and take the risk are all uninterested in investing in coal. If you want to build a new coal plant you have to think about what is going to happen to electricity prices over the next 20 or 30 years, because that is the time frame that you have to sell over to make back the cost of building the plant. The reality is that renewables and storage is going to be much cheaper than coal in far less than 20 years, so anyone building a coal plant today is never going to make back their money. The problem Australia has is that right at the changeover point when energy production is shifting from fossil fuel to renewables and storage, we have a bunch of very large, very old coal fired plants coming to the end of their working lives. Anyone who has owned an old car knows that there comes a point when maintaining and repairing it just isn’t worth it anymore. So it is with our ageing coal fired power stations. After the abolition of the carbon price by Abbott and Hunt there was a drought in investment in new generation, including for renewables. Renewables had previously been pushing additional generation into the market. According to many studies, including Mr Abbott’s own review, renewables were putting downward pressure on electricity prices. Along with the withdrawal of ageing coal assets, the lack of investment in new generation slowly built pressure in the market. The final result was a rapid rise in wholesale electricity prices, a rise that is going to be increasingly felt by Australian consumers. These kinds of problems are very solvable, and all it needs is political leadership and a sensible energy policy. Instead Australia got political self interest in the form of Abbott and the abolition of astute policy. The market for electricity is not the only part of energy policy where we have ignored the experts. We have also had a massive fail when it comes to natural gas. Gas on the east coast of Australia until recently was relatively cheap. In order to increase the price the gas industry has built three large export facilities. This linked the east coast gas price with the world price. The effect was to massively increase the price paid by Australian consumers. Governments were warned well in advance that this increase in gas prices was coming. Yet nothing was done. There appears to have been no consideration by state and federal governments about the impact these higher gas prices would have on industry or electricity prices. Instead governments happily waved through approval of the export facilities. For the last four years energy policy in Australia has been a fact free zone of bad politics and no interest in understanding the issue. The biggest losers are electricity consumers. It is long past time for the government to reengage with experts and start ignoring self-interested politicians. This is not to say that we should blindly listen to experts. There are many good democratic reasons why it might be appropriate to ignore the experts. But if this is the case, people should be able to expect that politicians can clearly explain those reasons. Whyalla being wiped out and $100 roasts are not sufficient explanations. When you open your electricity bill and it’s gone up, think of Tony Abbott and the policy instability he helped create."

"It hit me like a smack in the face. This year’s RHS Chelsea flower show was quite blatant in showcasing the effects of climate change; you may not have noticed though. Most people visiting the show or tuning into the BBC coverage were homed in on the increasingly more naturalistic planting style, the reduced number of large show gardens and the amazing lupins.  However, the increasing temperatures that our planet is experiencing are catching up with us gardeners. While the changes may be subtle in our own gardens, when you see them distilled and condensed, as I did at the world’s greatest flower show, the dawning realisation that they are real comes as quite a shock.   The first thing I noticed on entering the show was just how hot it was. It was a pleasure to walk around the show gardens on such a lovely sunny day, but in the back of my mind I had the realisation that the heat was part of an extended period of drought that the southeast, and the UK more generally, had been suffering. On talking to the gardeners and designers I heard many an exclamation of “I can’t wait for it to rain”. After such a very warm, wet winter in 2016 and then this, the driest winter for 20 years, I wondered if these unpredictable weather events are what we should come to expect in future?  Almost the first show garden I clapped eyes on rammed the point home a little further. James Basson’s M&G garden was an absolute triumph in my eyes. It transported me directly to the lime stone quarries of the Mediterranean and fitted so beautifully with the sun’s heat. I wanted to clamber into it and botanise between the columns of limestone. I could see plants of one of my favourites from the region, white henbane (Hyoscyamus albus), winking at me with its black eye from among the rocks and prickly goldenfleece (Urospermum picroides) shining at me, reflecting the yellow sun above.  While revelling in such delicate and beautiful planting, I couldn’t help but feel that this was what the southeast of the UK may have to count as normal in future years. We may have to accept some of these Mediterranean species as the newcomers in place of the hedgerow plants and garden weeds that we feel so comfortable with.  The next port of call was with my friend Charlotte Harris on her Royal Bank of Canada garden; an exquisite recreation of the boreal forests of Canada. With little leeway on the accuracy of the species used in the garden there were, again, plants here that piqued my interest. Sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina) jumped out at me from the corner of the plot, and labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum) had a presence only felt once you knew it was there.   These two gardens felt like the antithesis of one another, yet the plants within them are so bound to this changing climate that they shared something deeper. The boreal forests of Canada, you see, are expected to warm at above the global average, and the species within them will be unable to keep up. The coniferous trees are burning more frequently than their ecology can handle and, if not burning, then being pushed north by drought stress and competition from the more rugged deciduous species that will take their place. Who knows how long comptonia has left on the planet it has called home for more than 60 million years? These two gardens took my mind to the effects on the earth’s natural landscape but the next, Manoj Malde’s Inland Homes garden, Beneath a Mexican Sky, made me think of the impact a changing climate is having on the UK’s gardens. When asked if I thought that plants such as agaves and aloes would be hardy in a British garden, my answer, after a momentary pause, was an emphatic “yes”. I had seen plants of Dracaena draco, the dragon tree, growing outside just the day before at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and just a month earlier I had visited a garden in Kent where the traditional rockery plants were being ousted by agaves and other succulents, alongside Mediterranean climate species from all around the world. For the first time, maybe also because of the sun, the vibrant colours of Malde’s garden looked right beneath a very British sky. A colour I fear may be heading for a fall in the gardens of our little island is the clear blue of Himalayan poppies (Meconopsis). Chris Beardshaw had planted them along-side similarly cool loving giant Himalayan lilies (Cardiocrinum giganteum) in his Morgan Stanley garden. They were on show in the Great Pavillion too, most notably on the display by that most wonderful of Scottish nurseries, Kevock. I am afraid that, as warmer, drier climes push north, Scotland, and maybe some of the cooler parts of the Lake District will become the last refuge for this much-loved member of our garden flora. For me, the South Africans dominated the great pavilion again. Tall grasses such as restios played foil to proteas, agapanthus, kniphofias and the brightly coloured southern heaths. Pelargoniums, another of South Africa’s inexhaustible contribution to our gardens, were on show in all their finery too; both the interesting species and a plethora of cultivars. I often see red pelargoniums, left in an unattended window box, doing well after a mild winter, and my own Pelargonium cordifolium v. rubrotinctum is left in a sheltered spot year-round. I wonder, in the future, will this be the standard rather than the exception to the rule? Certainly, South Africa will have more to offer British gardeners as time goes on.  The Chelsea flower show still leads when it comes to gardening fashion, but I think the trend we all need to be looking to for the future of Britain’s gardens will be lead by our changing climate. We need to be brave in our gardens, especially given the unpredictability of the issue in hand. It’s an envelope I feel needs to be pushed, and I intend to be there at the front of this charge.

"Earth’s last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. The warmer and more stable climate that followed allowed for the development of agriculture and the rise of human civilization. This important period encompassing the past 12,000 years is referred to as the Holocene geological epoch. It also created a “conundrum” for climate scientists, because global temperatures simulated by climate models didn’t match reconstructions from proxy data. To be specific, the overall temperature change during the Holocene matched pretty well in reconstructions and models, but the pattern didn’t. The best proxy reconstruction from a 2013 paper led by Shaun Marcott estimated more warming than models from 12,000 to 7,000 years ago. Then over the past 7,000 years, Marcott’s reconstruction estimated about 0.5°C cooling while model simulations showed the planet warming by about the same amount.   A new paper led by Jonathan Baker may help to resolve that discrepancy. The scientists examined stalagmites from a cave in the southern Ural Mountains of Russia. The ratio of oxygen isotopes in the stalagmites can be used to estimate past winter temperatures. The Marcott study had one known shortcoming – the proxy temperature data they used mostly represented the summer season. And as Baker explained, changes in the Earth’s orbital cycles have caused cooling in the northern hemisphere summer and winter warming during the Holocene: Because our orbit is elliptical, we’re not always the same distance from the sun. About 10,000 years ago, Earth was closest to the sun during summer and farthest during winter. Today it is the opposite. Based on this variable alone, we would expect winter warming and summer cooling in the northern hemisphere (and vice versa in the southern hemisphere) over the last 10,000 years. During the period from 15,000 to 7,000 years ago, temperatures were rising because large ice sheets were disappearing. That was especially true in the summer because back then, the Earth was closest to the sun during that season. So the Marcott temperature reconstruction, which was predominantly based on summer temperature proxies, estimated a lot of warming from 15,000 to 7,000 years ago (more than in model simulations), then a small cooling thereafter, while models simulate a slight warming over the past 7,000 years due to a slow rise in greenhouse gases. The stalagmite data in the Baker study show that winter temperatures behaved differently and can reconcile the discrepancies between the Marcott reconstruction and model simulations. This suggests that the climate models are right – Earth’s surface temperature warmed rapidly at the end of the last ice age, from about 17,000 to 7,000 years ago, then the rate of warming slowed as the climate stabilized. However, it didn’t reverse into a cooling trend, because atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were rising. Then of course came the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago, and carbon dioxide levels consequently shot up due to humans burning fossil fuels. As a result, temperatures have spiked as well. Over the past 130 years, global surface temperatures have risen about 20 times faster than when the Earth transitioned out of the last ice age. Over the past 40 years, the rate of global warming has been 3 times faster yet.  And that’s in comparison to Earth’s fastest natural climate change, when it’s transitioning from an ice age to a warm period. Over the past 7,000 years, when human civilization was able to develop and thrive, Earth’s temperatures and climate were quite stable. The temperature change during the past 7,000 years was about 0.5°C. Humans have caused that much warming in just the past 25 years. If we follow through with the Paris agreement and manage to limit global warming to 2°C over a 200-year period, in that best-case scenario the Earth would still warm 20 times faster than a natural ice age transition. If we fail to cut carbon pollution, that rate could speed to more than 50 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change. There are several important points we can take from the Baker study. First, climate models are able to simulate climate changes over the history of human civilization fairly accurately. Second, when there’s a discrepancy between data and models, people have a tendency to distrust the models, but sometimes the problem lies more in the data. Third, if not for the human influence, the climate would continue the stable conditions of the past 7,000 years, during which time human civilization developed and thrived. Fourth and most importantly, humans are in the process of destabilizing the climate, and we’re already causing global warming at a rate 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate change. That’s why climate scientists are so concerned, and why the Paris agreement is so important."
"California has one of the world’s most sophisticated and ambitious cap-and-trade programs, which are designed to provide financial incentives to big polluters, such as electricity providers and oil refineries, to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. The complex program, which began only in 2013, is a signature component of California’s plan to cut emissions in the midst of a controversial makeover by state policymakers, after they passed a landmark bill last year that created one of the world’s most aggressive climate change goals: to lower carbon emissions to 40% below the 1990 levels by 2030.  Fierce debates over how to achieve the new, ambitious goals began before President Trump’s decision earlier this month to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. That decision will likely put a greater spotlight on how California – considered a leader in fighting climate change – will redesign its cap-and-trade program, which many say needs better market mechanisms and metrics to measure its successes and failures. “It’s important to have the right architecture in place to make cap-and-trade succeed, and have it as a model for folks,” explains Senator Bob Wieckowski, a Democrat from Fremont and chair of the Senate environmental quality committee. Wieckowski, a bankruptcy attorney, is co-sponsoring a bill, SB 775, which seeks to set new parameters for the cap-and-trade program after 2020. California’s cap-and-trade program sets limits on the amount of emissions businesses can emit, and it doles out, or auctions, allowances that determine how many tons of emissions businesses can vent into the atmosphere each year. Over time, the state tightens the emissions cap, forcing polluters to either spend money to buy allowances, also called credits, or find ways to cut their emissions. Companies that emit less can sell their unused credits to those that exceed their allowances – or keep their credits to be used later on. The California program hasn’t been around that long, and it’s been difficult to demonstrate how it has directly pushed big industrial companies to lower their emissions. The state collects and releases basic emissions data for the businesses that operate under the cap and trade system (the latest verified data is from 2015), and the state’s Air Resources Board says that it expects cap-and-trade will deliver between 15% to 17% of the reductions needed to reach California’s 2020 goal. Using emissions data from the state, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), an advocacy group, calculated that the industries covered by the program saw their collective emissions fell by 4% between 2013 and 2015. But whether the cap-and-trade program was largely responsible for that drop remains unclear. The state has a myriad of environmental regulations and clean energy programs in place to help lower its carbon footprint, and greater economic trends, such as a recession, can also play a role. “It seems crazy, right?” says Parin Shah, a senior strategist at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, an environmental group, about the lack of analyses from the state and other researchers on the effectiveness of the cap-and-trade program. In response, lawmakers have proposed bills to require more data collection and studies. More detailed research would surely help a program that’s been pretty lucrative for the state. California has collected more than $4bn that is set aside for programs that reduce carbon pollution, and more than $5bn has gone to dividends to utility customers (as credits on utility bills), according to the EDF. Like any large and complicated program, California’s cap-and-trade system has had its detractors. The California chamber of commerce filed a lawsuit close to four years ago contending that the state is imposing an illegal tax through the program. Recently, a state appeals court upheld the program, but the chamber of commerce is appealing that decision. The tricky part about designing functioning cap-and-trade systems, also called emissions trading schemes, is the complexity of incorporating climate science, financial incentives and effective solutions to reduce emissions from many different types of industrial sources. Politics, naturally, is also a key ingredient. “I can draw you the perfect cap-and-trade system that would be meaningless for the world if it’s politically impossible,” says Gernot Wagner, a research associate at Harvard University and contributor to the World Bank’s manual on how to design an emissions trading scheme. More than a billion people live in countries and regions that have emissions trading programs, says Nat Keohane, vice-president of global climate at the EDF. The European Union launched one in 2005, followed by Quebec and Ontario. China is trialling its program in several regions. “People don’t appreciate the extent that trading programs are in place and working. They’re here for the long haul,” Keohane says. Some of the proposed changes to the California program are hot-button issues, such as eliminating the use of offsets by companies to meet the emission caps. Offsets are credits earned by putting money into projects, such as preserving forests or turning methane from livestock waste into electricity, that are intended to reduce greenhouse gases. The state currently allows offset projects to take place outside of the state. Some environmental justice groups have long opposed the use of offsets, which they say give companies a choice to pay to pollute rather than directly lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. Other environmental groups that support using offsets would like to require a certain portion of projects take place within the state. Creating this new rule, they say, will help improve the air quality and create economic benefits in some of California’s disadvantaged communities. Offsets are “a huge loophole for corporations to utilize,” Shah says. The Pacific Environmental Network supports the elimination of offsets as proposed by the SB 775 bill. A 2016 report from researchers at the University of Southern California found that companies that prefer to use offsets, not surprisingly, also tend to have larger quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. Oil and power companies such as Chevron, Calpine Energy Services, Tesoro and Southern California Edison account for 60% of the offsets used, the report finds. The Western States Petroleum Association, an oil industry trade group, supports keeping the current offset program, including out-of-state offsets. The existing offset rule helps to support “reasonable allowance prices and expands greenhouse gas reductions in sectors outside of our cap”, says Adam Smith, manager of air and climate at utility Southern California Edison. Brown has proposed a new annual budget that plans to use $2.2bn in revenue from the cap-and-trade program to fund carbon reduction programs. Brown has said he wants the legislature to agree on a bill to extend or modify the program on June 15, the deadline for passing the state budget, but that deadline passed without a deal in place. But decisions on a controversial policy like this might not be able to be crunched into such a short timeframe. At the end of the day, it’ll be politics, not an economist’s design, that determines what the state’s new cap-and-trade program ultimately looks like."

"It might be best known for its wildlife, but Tanzania is facing a growing number of environmental concerns and biodiversity in the country is under threat.  Rapid deforestation means more than 370,000 hectares of forest are cleared every year for charcoal, firewood and lumber without a clear plan for reforestation. Habitats are being lost and desertification has increased, with severe consequences not only for wildlife but also the health and livelihoods of farming communities living in rural parts of the country. More than three quarters of Tanzania’s population live at subsistence level, relying on crop growth and seasonal rainfall to survive. Agriculture accounts for a quarter of the Tanzanian economy, but it is these farmers who suffer the real, dangerous consequences of environmental degradation.   In late 2016,  a group of us decided to take on the issue with the #50MillionTrees campaign, which aimed to encourage local people to reverse the loss of their natural environment.  We realised that if every one of the 50 million people living in Tanzania could be inspired to take a single action, like planting just one tree, we would gain far more than just 50 million more trees. As well as raising awareness about environmental issues, we could promote sustainability and encourage the idea that everyone can make a difference when it comes to climate change. What #50MillionTrees is trying to show is how individual actions and small changes in behaviour can make a big difference, both in a single country and globally. The idea is to inspire, educate and mobilise the population of Tanzania.  We set up the 50MillionTrees hashtag to generate some interest online and the society now has more than 1,000 young members, all former volunteers of sustainable development charity Raleigh International. We are part of a wider environmental initiative, Youth for Green Growth, which supports youth-led social and environmental action and advocacy in Tanzania, and contributes to the achievement of the UN global goals for sustainable development. Social media played a big part in raising awareness and getting people involved. So far the group has reached around 150,000 people online. But we also knew that to make this work we needed to connect at the grassroots community level, so we have held more than 50 public awareness raising events across Tanzania, involving another 10,000 people. Of those 10,000, three quarters have been school children. Reaching out to other young Tanzanians was crucial if the campaign was to be successful in the long run. We must inspire people from a young age to take action and care for the environment – they need to know about everything we get from nature. Young people can then tell their parents and others what they have learnt and how to act.  As part of our initiative groups of schoolchildren in the north of the country decide to plant fruit trees. The idea is that the orchards serve many purposes, including as outdoor classrooms which will give children the opportunity to watch and learn about their environment in a practical, hands-on and exciting way. We have also held two youth conferences to raise awareness of the green growth agenda in Tanzania. These were attended by representatives from the Tanzanian government, including the ministry responsible for the environment, and gave young people the opportunity to engage with decision makers about green growth policy, deforestation and sustainable resource management. Following the first conference, the government announced a policy that will see every student in the country plant a tree while at school. We really did not expect to achieve so much so soon, but the group has since been invited to meet with the environment minister to discuss further how we can work with government. Young people are more important than ever in taking actions that inspire other citizens to contribute to the kind of future we all want to see. Our campaign has shown that young volunteers can make a difference if we work together to make our voices heard. If enough of us do that, people listen and change happens.

"As the Trump administration prepares to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, we believe the UK must use its trade policy to reaffirm and strengthen a globally coordinated response to climate change – one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced. As such, we call on the next UK government to: • Require ratification of the Paris agreement and a commitment to its goal of avoiding more than 1.5 degrees of warming as a precondition for entering into trade and investment agreements with the UK.   • Consider trade measures to tackle “environmental dumping”, where countries gain an unfair advantage by not taking action on climate change. • Guarantee a legally binding right to regulate to protect the environment in all future trade and investment agreements signed by the UK. Effectively, trade policy already is climate policy. Agreements can limit the regulatory freedom of governments to take action on protecting the climate, or empower polluting industries to sue governments in private tribunals over environmental policies and decisions. International trade can also lead to a “race to the bottom”’ on environmental standards as companies and investors seek out the most lax jurisdictions. With an estimated quarter of all emissions embedded in internationally traded goods, it will not be possible to tackle climate change, or harness the huge economic opportunities of the low carbon economy, without recognising that trade policy must begin to play a positive role.Paul Keenlyside Coordinator, Trade Justice Movement, Chris Baugh Assistant general secretary, Public and Commercial Services Union, Asad Rehman Executive director, War on Want, Nick Dearden Director, Global Justice Now, David Powell Environment lead, New Economics Foundation, Tim Aldred Head of policy and research, The Fairtrade Foundation, Sam Lowe Campaign lead, Friends of the Earth • The Conservatives and Ukip are determined that fracking for shale gas will go ahead. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party, oppose it. The government says that methane from fracking produces less carbon dioxide per therm when burnt than coal, and therefore impacts climate change less. However, when you take into account the methane that leaks into the atmosphere from fracking wells, increasingly so as they age, many experts think this is not the case. Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Our country should be investing in renewable energy and reducing energy demand, not in an industry that lines the pockets of a few while having a negative impact on communities and the environment where it takes place, including human and animal ill-health, air and water pollution and industrialisation of the countryside. The Conservatives say they carry out the will of the British people in leaving the EU. Not so with fracking. In Lancashire, the Conservative government ignored massive public opposition to fracking and overturned the council’s decision not to allow it there. Just as they will ignore the will of the majority of British people and allow the cruel sport of fox hunting again, the Conservatives, if re-elected, will roll out fracking across the country, wherever it is possible.Sylvia MilnerBridlington, East Yorkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has blasted the idea that the commonwealth could finance new coal-fired power stations, and is holding to Labor’s declaration that it will not support a clean energy target if coal is in the mix. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics live podcast, Butler has also articulated a significantly tougher line on the controversial Adani coalmine than the Labor leader, Bill Shorten – saying it would “not be a positive thing for Australia for the Adani mine to go ahead”. Butler says he can “understand why the Queensland government might be pressing [the Carmichael coal mine development] but from a national perspective, I just don’t think it stacks up.” The new podcast interview with Butler traverses the Finkel review and Labor’s likely response, and the party’s attitude to coal – both in supporting research into carbon capture and storage technology, and the Adani coalmine. Nearly two weeks ago Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, handed governments a road map for climate and energy policy, with the centrepiece recommendation for a new clean energy target (CET) for the national electricity market. The CET has been the subject of considerable pushback within Coalition ranks, and on Wednesday, the prime minister opened the way for an alternative to the central Finkel mechanism. Butler said he was “optimistic” the government had not killed the CET less than two weeks after the publication of the Finkel review, but: “I think some of the signals, particularly over the last 24 hours around government investment or support for new coal fired power stations sends, at the very least, very confusing signals.”  He said the Minerals Council of Australia had been lobbying MPs since the Finkel report’s release to support a power purchase agreement, funded through government, to replace the Hazelwood and the Liddell power stations with two new coal-fired coal generators. This had subsequently manifested itself in the form of Malcolm Turnbull floating reverse auctions to bring more dispatchable power into the national electricity market, Butler said. “It remains to be seen whether this is a pretty weird thought-bubble the prime minister has floated to placate the hard right of his party room through this week without having something more permanent done to the CET – or whether they are genuinely serious,” he said. “If they are genuinely serious, I think this is the most bizarre intervention in the electricity market we have seen for decades.” He said financial institutions had signalled there was no appetite to build new coal-fired power, and Butler said governments would have to indemnify new builds against the risk of a carbon price, and against regulatory risk, which would leave taxpayers on the hook for massive expense. The case for new coal-fired power stations was pushed again by the former prime minister Tony Abbott on Wednesday afternoon. Abbott told 2GB he wanted to see more coal plants built. Butler has reiterated Labor’s position that a clean energy target which allowed coal in the mix was not a clean energy target in anything other than name. He said Labor would take the view that a CET had to drive new investment in clean energy. He said even “ultra super critical coal, which sounds like something out of a Marvel comic, but even awesomely ultra super critical coal is still, by any stretch of the imagination, high polluting electricity”. The Finkel review modelled a CET threshold 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour, which would be too low to see “clean” coal given incentives. While saying Labor was yet to adopt a formal position on an appropriate threshold for the CET, Butler said a higher baseline of 0.7 or 0.75 is “unambiguously too high to be properly called a clean energy target”. Addressing the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Finkel said his CET recommendation was not dead, or on life support, but was “quite legitimately being further evaluated by the government”. The regular meeting of Coalition MPs this week gave in principle support to all of the other recommendations of the Finkel review, but not the CET, which was referred for further work. Turnbull on Tuesday cautioned reporters against a conclusion that the government would dump the CET. “I wouldn’t analyse it in that way if I was you,” he said. In the event the CET survives the current internal deliberations, the government will need Labor in order to legislate the measure. One Nation confirmed this week it would not support the CET under any circumstances, which cuts off a viable crossbench pathway for the government, unless it can reach a deal with the Greens, which seems unlikely.  Butler was also asked during the interview to explain how Labor was adopting a harder line on new coal-fired power generation, but was supporting the controversial Adani coalmine in Queensland in the event it met regulatory approvals and was not given any taxpayer support. Butler said he was an opponent of the project. “I have a very clear view that the economics of Adani don’t stack up, and it would not be a positive thing for Australia for the Adani mine to go ahead. “I think all it would do is take jobs from elsewhere in the coal industry. This is a zero sum game in a declining coal market.” Several Labor MPs have broken ranks on the Adani issue, saying the project should not proceed. Shorten has previously argued there is no point having a giant coalmine if you wreck the reef “but, on the other hand, if the deal does stack up, if the science safeguards are there, if the experts are satisfied, then all well and good and there’ll be jobs created”. Asked to account for the difference in his position to the hedged position articulated regularly by Shorten, Butler said: “I think people take different views about the economics of this. “I have said I don’t think it stacks up.” He said while there was an internal spectrum of views about the project on either environmental or economic grounds, all federal Labor MPs had the same negative position on taxpayer support, “which is the matter before us”. • Support Guardian Australia’s independent journalism and critical reporting on the environment by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"
"America’s top universities expend considerable efforts to lead in the rankings, but last week they fell short—missing a critical opportunity to show moral leadership on climate change. If top schools want to lead on climate action, they should join the “We Are Still In” coalition, a collection of states, cities, businesses, and universities promising to support the Paris Climate Agreement. President Trump’s decision to pull out of the international climate accord was swiftly rejected by local and state officials, as well as members of the business and academic community. Over 1,000 leaders have signed on to the “We Are Still In” pledge—including mayors and governors representing about 120 million people. More than 200 colleges and universities have joined. Leadership from these institutions sends a powerful message to President Trump and the globe: even if the federal government reneges on its international commitments, Americans are stepping up to fill the gap. Unfortunately, our 11 academic institutions—the “Ivy-Plus” group—were not on that list (Columbia was the lone member of the Ivy-Plus group to sign both coalition statements). Instead, our universities—Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Georgetown, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale—signed a separate statement of support. Even though we applaud this affirmation of commitment to climate change, this action misses the collective strength of participation in the “We Are Still In” coalition, and it lacks the leadership we expect from these institutions. Sometimes absence can even be more telling than presence. We therefore implore our University Presidents and Boards of Trustees to join the broader and more inclusive “We Are Still In” coalition. Our universities cannot effectively address climate change from the ivory tower; they must join the wider cross-sectoral climate change response if they hope to advance meaningful progress. Universities play crucial roles in the coalition as drivers of technological research, policy solutions, and educators of the next generation of leaders. Researchers at our academic institutions are documenting the growing impacts of climate change and the consequences of inaction. They are developing breakthrough innovations and policy solutions for all levels of government. Our university communities are further raising the call for engagement and action. For example, at Yale nearly 1,000 students, recent graduates and faculty have already signaled their enthusiasm for joining the broader coalition. Harvard and Princeton students have gathered hundreds of signatures from classmates and professors supporting the Paris Climate Agreement. Our university leaders can better build upon researchers’ accomplishments and respond to the growing support from students, faculty, and staff by advancing the “We Are Still In” coalition. If the Ivy-Plus group supports climate efforts as outlined in their own statement, then principled action requires joining the “We Are Still In” coalition to maximize the momentum and strength of broad climate action. Our University Presidents have already acknowledged the threat of climate change, as well as the critical role academic institutions play in supporting the transformation to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. When the federal government fails to respond to our generation’s most pressing challenges, we must all step in and lead to achieve progress. We have a national and international responsibility to meet our Paris Agreement commitments – because we are all still in.

"US coastal areas are set to be deluged by far more frequent and severe flooding events if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t slashed, with rare floods becoming the norm for places such as New York City, Seattle and San Diego, new research has found.  The study, undertaken by researchers from Princeton and Rutgers universities, found that along all of the US coastline, the average risk of a 100-year flood will increase 40-fold by 2050. Such floods are statistically expected to occur only once every 100 years because of their severity, although this doesn’t mean these sort of floods never happen in consecutive years. The annual chance of such a flood is around 1%. The research found that if emissions are not curbed, San Francisco and Seattle would both get a 100-year flood every year by 2050, while San Diego would expect 10 such events annually and Key West in Florida would be hit 11 times a year. Some of the worst affected areas would be in Hawaii, with Mokuoloe island, situated off Oahu, forecast to be deluged by 130 floods a year that are currently considered to be 100-year events. Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton climate scientist and co-author of the paper, added that New York City is set to get a 100-year flood every 20 years by 2050 but this frequency would leap to a large flood every other month by 2100. “Most coastal areas will experience relatively large increases in flooding events,” he said. “A 40-fold increase on average is gigantic – cities may not be able to defend themselves. They will have to spend a lot of money or there will be quite a lot of damage. “Many cities are already behind the eight-ball in terms of preparing for flooding. There will have to be a hard headed look at whether some areas can be defended or will have to be abandoned. Cities are only just starting to grapple with this.” The projections are based upon “business as usual” emissions where the world does little to constrain the release of heat-trapping gases from electricity generation, transportation and other activities. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted a 1-3ft rise in sea levels by the end of the century if emissions aren’t properly addressed, although more recent research on the melting and break up of parts of west Antarctica suggests that this increase could be doubled. Sea level rise of just a few centimeters is enough to significantly raise the risk of flooding, with the problem exacerbated by an increase in the severity of storms due to a warming, moisture-laden atmosphere.  Furthermore, parts of eastern states such as New Jersey, Virginia and Florida are gradually sinking, amplifying the extent of sea-level rise. It’s now common for places such as Atlantic City and Miami Beach to experience “sunny day” flooding, where high tides cause streets to be soaked. The Princeton and Rutgers research found stark flooding variations along the US coast. The eastern seaboard and Gulf of Mexico coast are forecast to suffer a larger amplification of moderate floods, such as those expected every year or every 10 years, rather than more severe floods. The Pacific coast, meanwhile, is set to experience more of the rarer events, such as 500-year floods. There has been a recent spike in 500-year floods, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), such as the disaster that befell Louisiana last summer. Storms of the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York in 2012, also bring floods expected once in every 500 years, or more. Lead author Maya Buchanan, from Princeton University, said coastal flooding is “responsible for loss of life and property, as well as long-term damage to local and regional economies and municipal services.” Buchanan added that working out the future frequency of flooding is “particularly important because coastal infrastructure management, federal flood insurance, and flood risk communications are typically tied to estimates of flood return periods.” In January, Noaa, along with several other federal agencies and universities, predicted that the oceans could rise by an average of more than 8ft by 2100 under the worst-case climate scenario. This is around 20 inches more than a previous federal estimate published in 2012. The best case scenario is now an average of about a foot in sea level rise. Rising sea levels could displace millions of Americans this century, with US coastal cities badly situated for the looming crisis. In 2013, the World Bank said that of the 10 cities around the globe most at risk of damage from sea-level rise, half are in the US – Miami, New York, New Orleans, Tampa and Boston.  The scale of the global challenge posed by sea level rise was outlined in a study from the University of Illinois at Chicago last month, with researchers predicting there will be doubling in the frequency of severe coastal flooding.  The research found that cities in Brazil and western Africa were particularly vulnerable, as well as small Pacific islands. Climate change is causing the seas to rise by around 3.5mm a year, as the ice caps melt and oceans warm and expand."

"One of my most cherished possessions is a handmade cherrywood salad bowl that’s never held a leaf of lettuce. It is 25 years old and gets more beautiful every year. The bowl was a gift, carved by a widower who was left to raise his daughter alone when his wife died under my care as an oncologist. My patient, who I’ll call Erica, had the most challenging form of breast cancer and I didn’t have the tools to save her life. I’ve always felt undeserving of the gift, despite doing everything I could. Five years later, I participated in the development of a medicine for Erica’s type of cancer, Herceptin. While regretting that it had not come fast enough for Erica, I am deeply grateful for the scientific advances that mean better care for patients like her today.   Now, at the helm of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, I see how scientific breakthroughs, such as new vaccines and hardier crops, are helping to make the world safer, healthier and more equal. Life is better because of science, and in the next few decades more discoveries will further improve the human condition. But the scientific community is nervous. Science – and specifically the scientific method – is at risk in an era of fake news, anti-expert feeling, and science denialism. Healthy scepticism is at the heart of the scientific method and scientists believe in challenging today’s knowledge to best uncover truth. But denialism is different. Denialism is the refusal to accept established facts. The Oxford English Dictionary declared “post-truth” as the 2016 word of the year, defining it as “circumstances in which objective facts are less influential … than appeals to emotion and personal belief”. Today, there is fear among scientists that even the best innovations will have less resonance if policies and decision-making aren’t influenced by evidence, truth and facts. We need to argue against this in a post-fact, post-truth era. Scientists must participate effectively in the public dialogue around facts and truth. And there are three aspects of the debate that I believe are crucial for the scientific community to address so that we remain relevant: consequences, confidence and credibility. The best scientists and innovators are fully aware of the consequences of their achievements. Jennifer Doudna, one of the scientists behind the gene editing Crispr technology, speaks of a time when we might cure genetic diseases. Yet she is also a part of a scientific coalition that introduced a worldwide moratorium on gene edits that would be passed on to subsequent generations. When reliability for more than a billion users was at risk, Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook’s decade-old motto from “Move fast and break things” to the less catchy “Move fast with stable infrastructure”. We should learn from such people. It is seductive to be boastful, or exaggerate the novelty or importance of one’s work, especially given the funding challenges scientists encounter. Scientists would do better if they showed more humility. We’ll be better at assessing and solving problems – and, more importantly, understanding the impact of potential solutions – if we deepen our understanding and respect for others. Humility is also a big part of building greater confidence in scientists. Confidence is essential if we want to be spokespeople for the truth. We want policymakers to understand and value what we say and put forth. We want leaders to encourage and favour research and policies based on evidence that has been challenged and tested.  Open sharing of data, teamwork, more dialogue and visibility when a study is negative or not reproduced, will all give consumers of science more confidence. For our part, the Gates Foundation has introduced an open access policy that enables the unrestricted access and reuse of all our funded work, including any underlying data sets, so that others can benefit from this knowledge, and to encourage collaboration and debate. Ultimately, the relevance of scientific experts in this “post-truth” era depends on credibility in terms of trustworthiness and expertise. Conflicts of interest and publicity about scientific literature retractions, or fraud, have eroded public esteem for scientists. We’re not alone. Traditional authority figures have become diminished, with “identity” increasingly influencing people’s beliefs rather than established sources of knowledge. This “echo chamber” phenomenon is exaggerated by the algorithms of social media.  But behavioural scientists are improving our understanding of denial and the way people make decisions. This is beginning to yield fascinating insights into how it is possible to “inoculate” audiences against misinformation. It turns out that by exposing them to some of the techniques of denialism, such as cherry-picked statistics and spurious petitions, they become more resistant to believing such messages.  People also become more open to hearing the scientific or expert consensus. This is known as the cognitive psychology of debunking. It is a key tactic when a scientist confronts a conflict between science and myth. Investing in decision science and behavioural psychology, and using new insights to get the facts straight, are vital in catching up with a world where rumours spread like wildfire. Expertise in communication is one of today’s most important credibility challenges for the scientific community. Formal training in simple, clear, jargon-free communication is essential to broadening the appeal of science, and as an antidote to sensationalist reporting of scientific advances. Scientists speaking plainly about their findings will diminish the likelihood of loose interpretations. It is imperative we get out of our bubble. Scientists who are engaged and participating in community and family life as a part of civil society will be more aware of consequences, more confident and more credible. For the world to continue to experience progress, we must value the scientific method as the ultimate way to improve the human condition. As scientists, we owe it to ourselves to fight for the truth. More important, we owe it to people like Erica, and her family, who are counting on us.

"The restoration of the globe’s protective shield of ozone will be delayed by decades if fast-rising emissions of a chemical used in paint stripper are not curbed, new research has revealed. Atmospheric levels of the chemical have doubled in the last decade and its use is not restricted by the Montreal protocol that successfully outlawed the CFCs mainly responsible for the ozone hole. The ozone-destroying chemical is called dichloromethane and is also used as an industrial solvent, an aerosol spray propellant and a blowing agent for polyurethane foams. Little is known about where it is leaking from or why emissions have risen so rapidly.  The loss of ozone was discovered in the 1980s and is greatest over Antarctica. But Ryan Hossaini, at Lancaster University in the UK and who led the new work, said: “It is important to remember that ozone depletion is a global phenomenon, and that while the peak depletion occurred over a decade ago, it is a persistent environmental problem and the track to recovery is expected to be a long and bumpy one.” “Ozone shields us from harmful levels of UV radiation that would otherwise be detrimental to human, animal and plant health,” he said. The new research, published in the journal Nature Communications, analysed the level of dichloromethane in the atmosphere and found it rose by 8% a year between 2004 and 2014. The scientists then used sophisticated computer models to find that, if this continues, the recovery of the ozone layer would be delayed by 30 years, until about 2090.  The chemical was not included in the 1987 Montreal protocol because it breaks down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, usually within six months, and had not therefore been expected to build up. In contrast, CFCs persist for decades or even centuries. But the short lifespan of dichloromethane does mean that action to cut its emissions would have rapid benefits. “If policies were put in place to limit its production, then this gas could be flushed out of the atmosphere relatively quickly,” said Hossaini. If the dichloromethane in the atmosphere was held at today’s level, the recovery of the ozone level would only be delayed by five years, the scientists found. There was a surge in emissions in the period 2012-14 and if growth rate continues at that very high rate, the ozone recovery would be postponed indefinitely, but Hosseini said this extreme scenario is unlikely: “Our results still show the ozone hole will recover.” Grant Allen, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Manchester, said: “Whatever the source of this gas, we must act now to stop its release to the atmosphere in order to prevent undoing over 30 years of exemplary science and policy work which has undoubtedly saved many lives.” Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) who discovered the ozone hole in 1985, said: “The Montreal protocol has proved very effective at reducing the emissions of substances that can harm the ozone layer. I am sure that the warning made in this paper will be heeded and that dichloromethane will be brought within the protocol in order to prevent further damage to the ozone layer.” There are other short-lived gases containing the chlorine that destroys ozone, but few measurements have been taken of their levels in the atmosphere. “Unfortunately there is no long-term record of these, only sporadic data, but these do indicate they are a potentially significant source of chlorine in the atmosphere,” said Hossaini, adding that further research on this was needed. Anna Jones, a scientist at BAS, said: “The new results underline the critical importance of long-term observations of ozone-depleting gases and expanding the Montreal protocol to mitigate new threats to the ozone layer.” Overall the Montreal protocol is seen as very successful in cutting ozone losses, with estimates indicating that without the protocol the Antarctic ozone hole would have been 40% larger by 2013. Scientists discovered four “rogue” CFCs in 2014 that were increasing in concentration in the atmosphere and contributing to ozone-destruction. "
"The most senior career diplomat at the US embassy in China has stepped down, amid reports that he opposes the Trump administration’s decision to quit the Paris agreement to fight climate change.   David Rank, a 27-year veteran state department officer, was appointed to serve as chargé d’affaires in Beijing in January last year.   A state department spokeswoman confirmed Rank’s departure but said she was unable to confirm reports that he resigned as he felt unable to deliver a formal notification to China of the US decision last week to quit the agreement.  “He has retired from the foreign service,” said Anna Richey-Allen, a spokeswoman for the department’s East Asia bureau. “Mr Rank has made a personal decision. We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the state department.”  Iowa governor Terry Branstad, Donald Trump’s pick as the next US ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. A tweet from the China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trump’s decision last week to withdraw from the Paris agreement. David Rank, no.2 @USEmbassyBJ, has resigned, sources say. He couldn't back Trump on climate. Rank had 27yr career including @USEmbassyKabul In another tweet, Pomfret said Rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the Chinese government of the US decision. A senior US official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after Rank announced his intention to retire on Monday in Beijing, he was told by the state department to leave his post immediately. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.  Rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in Beijing in January 2016, could not immediately be reached for comment.  Jonathan Fritz, the embassy’s economics councillor, would serve as chargé in his place, Richey-Allen said.  Trump’s announcement last Thursday that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, saying the agreement would undermine the US economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry."

"Tough western sanctions on Russia may be squeezing the economy – but that’s only half the story. The other half you can understand better by attending a public hearing into a project that will finance the Putin regime for another 50 years. The project is called Nord Stream 2. It involves piping gas directly from Russia to Germany through the Baltic sea, and it is unaffected by sanctions. Its progress means that Europe is excoriating the Putin regime diplomatically while at the same time promising to inflate the same regime with billions of gas dollars.  I recently participated in a public hearing on Nord Stream 2 at the Estonian environment ministry.Company officials gave a two-hour presentation full of touching photos of seals and fish, and we heard how beautiful and safe this project is. Five European companies are involved but for some mysterious reason, 100% of the shares belong to Gazprom.  But this is just the first of a litany of questions about this controversial project. Nord Stream 2 was concluded after the annexation of Crimea by Putin’s Russia, the war against Ukraine, and the shooting down over Ukraine of the MH17 passenger plane. European consumers will pay for the gas, and the money will go to the Putin regime, strengthening it. There is a high probability that, as usual, the Kremlin will spend the proceeds on propaganda, repression, new wars, and annexations – and Europe will be paying for it. A Nord Stream representative brushed off these concerns, saying it was all “political speculation … we have already been working with Gazprom for 19 years and are going to continue mutually beneficial cooperation”.  Secondly, the project is being implemented with the ink barely dry on the Paris climate deal, in which almost every country appeared to recognise the dangers of fossil fuels. But here is a project that plans to significantly increase the supply of a fuel that damages the climate. To this objection, Nord Stream claimed that the project is not dangerous for the climate because gas is not as bad as coal.How can you shout about the transition to renewable, environmentally safe energy and at the same time make plans to increase gas flows into Europe?  Thirdly, even before it has begun, the Nord Stream 2 project has already brought problems to Russia. Within Russian territory, it was decided to run the pipeline through Kurgalskii refuge. This decision is technically illegal as the area is designated a special nature zone with rare species including eagles, ringed seals, and many others protected by Russian law. Russian authorities have initiated the process of altering the boundaries of Kurgalskii refuge in order to drive the gas pipeline through it. Surveying work began illegally in the area without any permits, but ceased after ecologists protested. In contrast, if there is to be a pipeline through a natural area on German territory it is to be built in a tunnel. Then there is the matter of personalities. Matthias Warnig, a former Stasi member turned banker and a close friend of Putin, is CEO of Nord Stream and is also on the board of two huge Russian companies: Vneshtorgbank and the oil company Rosneft. The Nord Stream representatives at the hearing said that in the company it is not customary to look up biographies of senior staff and so they do not know who has worked where previously. But how do they hire employees at all, if they are not interested in their previous work? Nord Stream 2 is a sad tale of hypocrisy and double standards, of people with an excellent European education in expensive suits, with impeccable English, who know everything about ecology and human rights, but happily profit alongside the same regimes their governments deplore.  But there is hope of stopping this project. The stage of environmental expert evaluation is underway, and although it may be too late for the Kurgalskii refuge, I hope that ecological expertise in Europe – unlike in Russia – is real. There is one encouraging sign – the day after the public hearing in Estonia, the country’s environment ministry asked to include my report in the record of the hearing. This is how an environment ministry should work. "

"Perhaps Theresa May has a sense of mischief after all. Putting Michael Gove in charge of the Department of the Environment is much like putting a wolf in charge of the chicken coop. To say that the Gove pulse is unlikely to race too much faster over environmental concerns would, from my experience of working with him, be an understatement. He probably regards global warming as an excuse to reduce winter fuel payments.  May bringing in her old enemy demonstrates her crippling weakness. This desperate attempt to buy off those who might bring her down may help her own survival for another few months. Sadly, it will do nothing to help the survival of the planet. As an act of environmental vandalism, it sure beats the mischief of her youthful run through a wheat field. Gove’s appointment is a threat to the British fight against climate change. Uniquely for a cabinet minister, Gove turned the word “expert” into a snarling insult. Truly, Donald Trump would have been proud. The public outcry over the US president’s rejection of the Paris agreement shows us that people have little time for politicians refusing to listen to expert scientists on such a vital issue. When I was energy and climate change secretary I sat around a cabinet table with Gove, and he couldn’t help playing to the Tory climate-sceptic audience. As education secretary, he tried to ban climate change from the geography curriculum. After an angry exchange of letters with me, he eventually backed down. On another occasion, he stopped Amber Rudd – my then junior minister – from attending a critical climate change conference under the pretence of needing her for a vote in parliament. The Lima conference Rudd missed laid the groundwork for the Paris agreement, and I attended as secretary of state. However, given the significance of these annual UN talks, the minister for climate change had always attended in the past. For Gove, as chief whip, to hold her back prevented the UK reaching out to many more nations, and shocked everyone involved with the UK delegation. The move was as petty as it was cynical. Thankfully, Gove will not have primary responsibility for Britain’s climate change efforts, which fall mainly to the energy department. But he will take charge of our environmental and land management policies – including designing a British replacement for farming subsidies – and drawing these up without a genuine commitment to tackling climate change would be a huge mistake. After his promise for £350m a week extra for the NHS, we wait to see whether he seeks to keep EU farming subsidies. He could also be a danger on transposing EU environmental regulations into British law. We know he has a natural inclination to reduce regulation. This could endanger efforts to reduce air pollution or protect habitats if he fails to keep the protections on which we rely. Climate change remains the biggest threat to our civilisation, economy and security – even bigger than Brexit. While it’s Brexit that will be the main focus of all our parliamentary activity over the next few years, this must not come at the cost of our environment. If the government has any sense, it will see that economic prosperity and jobs flow from investing in the clean economy, and act accordingly. When Brexit bites (costing the Treasury £59bn), which it certainly will, the public will not be forgiving if an unholy Conservative-DUP alliance has not done everything to boost British jobs and stimulate growth at home. The appointment of a man who could teach Machiavelli, or even Mandelson, a few tricks reflects badly on May, who has sacrificed the green agenda for her own blue agenda. I call on Gove to release a clear statement acknowledging climate change is real; that he’ll do everything he can to tackle environmental problems, such as air pollution and flooding; and that, on this at least, he might humbly listen to experts."
"As the connected problems of climate change and air pollution from traffic make living in cities more hazardous, the health benefits of greening our streets become ever more apparent. On crowded city roads green barriers, in the form of dense hedges between traffic and people on the pavements, dramatically reduce the danger from fumes, but are difficult to squeeze in.  Green roofs and walls, which take up no ground space and were originally introduced sometimes for aesthetic reasons, are proving that they have great value. They insulate buildings and lead to energy savings, reduce temperatures outside by absorbing sunlight, and mitigate the urban heat island effect. They also contribute to storm water management by soaking up the rain, and reduce noise and increase urban biodiversity.  But the latest studies find green roofs and walls are also valuable for removing air pollution; they can reduce nitrogen dioxide by up to 35%, and make 50% cuts in the small particulates that damage lungs. However, in some street “canyons”, where trees are surrounded by tall buildings, pollution can be concentrated as foul air gets trapped below the canopy. Local weather conditions, especially humidity and wind, also make a big difference to the success rate of green barriers. Generally though the research shows that there are immediate benefits from having all sorts of plants growing in cities. Some evergreens with sticky or hairy leaves that capture pollutants, which can then wash off in the rain, are particularly effective all year.  But can they cope with the pollution? Finding the plants that can thrive in all of these stressful conditions could require special horticultural skills.  "
"The new French government has sought to further burnish its green credentials with the announcement it is to stop granting licences for new oil and gas exploration. In his first major intervention since Emmanuel Macron’s election victory, the ecological transition minister, Nicolas Hulot, told the broadcaster BFMTV there would be “no new exploration licences for hydrocarbons”.  Hulot said the government would extend Macron’s promised moratorium on fracking projects to cover all oil and gas exploration. He also hinted that the government would increase taxes on diesel and look to streamline decision-making on environmental issues so they could be made “faster”. Hulot faces a daunting in-tray to deliver on Macron’s wide-ranging environmental manifesto, which promised a sharp increase in renewables’ investment, a huge renovation programme to improve the efficiency of French homes, and an acceleration of the deployment of zero-emission vehicles. The comments came as Hulot and Macron met the former Californian governor and climate change campaigner Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss plans for a new global pact to give people a mechanism for securing environmental justice.  In a short video posted on Twitter, both Macron and Schwarzenegger aimed a swipe at President Trump as they vowed to work together to “make the planet great again”. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Emmanuel Macron shoot video selfie about their climate change talks https://t.co/874Wo2o4K9 pic.twitter.com/nzDK0VYiXc Macron said a new pact that builds on international human right legislation could help “move on to a new stage after the Paris accord”. The new pact could be presented to the UN as early as this September, Macron said. The proposals were backed by the former French foreign minister and the chair of the Paris summit, Laurent Fabius. “We already have two international [human rights] pacts ... The idea is to create a third, for a third generation of rights – environmental rights,” he said. Schwarzenegger said support for the proposals should cross political lines. “It is absolutely imperative that we not make it a political issue. This is not the right versus the left because there is no liberal air or conservative air. We all breathe the same air. There is no liberal water or conservative water, we all drink the same water.” The proposed covenants would build on the UN’s earlier human rights covenants covering, social, economic, and cultural rights, and civil and political rights.

"To save hundreds of lives and billions of dollars, Australia should rapidly phase out coal power stations and establish strong emissions reduction targets, according to a coalition of 30 major health and medical groups.  A world-first National Climate and Health Strategy framework launched after 12 months of consultation and development by the Public Health Association of Australia, the Royal Australian College of General Practice and the Australian College of Nursing, today launched their framework, which they say is needed to avert a health emergency which threatens to undermine 50 years of gains in development and health. Many of the policy recommendations made by the coalition are “win-win”, which both reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as reducing the social and economic costs of sickness. Fiona Armstrong, the executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, said the framework provides a comprehensive roadmap for achieving Australia’s obligation under the Paris Agreement to recognise its citizens’ “right to health”.  Peter Doherty, Nobel laureate for medicine and campaign ambassador for Our Climate Health said: “We are currently conducting a planetary-scale experiment with uncontrolled dumping of CO2 at a rate that is truly frightening. No university ethics committee would ever sanction such a study for mice, let alone humans. We have to stop.” He told Guardian Australia he thought awareness of the health impacts of climate change needed to be embedded into all other policy areas – from building design to transport infrastructure and health funding. There were already many health-related costs of climate change being seen in Australia, the framework document points out. For example, heatwaves in 2009 and 2014 contributed to hundreds of deaths in Victoria and projections suggest the figure will rise to several thousand additional deaths from heatwaves by 2050. It also points out the use of coal is contributing to 4,000 deaths each year, mostly by exacerbating existing chronic cardiac and respiratory illnesses. There is also already an economic burden, with extreme heat costing the Australian economy $8bn each year through reduced productivity, and the health effects of bushfires often costing billions.  The policy framework has seven key areas, and more than 50 recommendations, which require a coordinated national approach, involving the commonwealth government. Among those recommendations are 26 relating to emissions-reduction policies that would also improve the health of the community. Among those, the coalition calls for a “rapid” transition away from coal power and fossil fuels “with appropriate support for affected workers and communities to ensure a just transition.” It also calls for the removal of subsidies for fossil fuels and for investment in zero-emissions transport infrastructure such as trains and bicycle paths. Other policy areas the framework deals with include emergency and disaster-preparedness, building a climate-resilient healthcare sector and research and data. Efforts in other countries to address climate and health surpassed that made in Australia, the framework document notes.  In the US, the Centre for Disease Control outlines 11 different policy actions for climate change and promotes research into climate change and health, as well s preparedness. The EU has guidance for member states on protecting their communities from the impacts of climate change and the UK has mitigation and adaptation policies for the health sector.  Nick Watts, executive director at Lancet Countdown, a major international project that aims to measure and track countries’ progress on climate and health, said if adopted, the framework would make Australia a leader in the area. “The implementation of a national strategy on climate change and health could put Australia in a leadership position globally and go a long way to ensuring the protection of community health and well-being while reducing carbon emissions.”"

"Around 97% of climate scientists confirm the existence of manmade global warming, and public opinion is steadily catching up. In the UK, a recent poll suggested 84% of British people want Theresa May to “convince Trump not to quit” the Paris climate agreement. According to a survey spanning 40 nations, 78% of people support their country joining the global agreement.  Consensus on manmade global warming has never been stronger. Yet climate denial remains strong among a particular ideological group. Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement last week provides the strongest evidence yet that nationalists, gripped by an isolationist logic, are unable or unwilling to face the reality of global warming. Yet American nationalists are not the only ones to resist action on climate change. Ukip’s general election manifesto pledges to pull the UK out of the Paris accord. More concerning, however, is that Eurosceptic Conservatives include prominent climate sceptics such as Lord Lawson. Theresa May closed the Department for Energy and Climate Change within 24 hours of becoming prime minister. Having received £390,000 in donations from senior oil executives since she came to power, her manifesto now pledges to “build on the unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector”. An entire Conservative election campaign is premised on the brand of “strong and stable”, while May keeps quiet about climate change – described by the UN as a threat to global stability “unprecedented in scale”. Climate denial extends from the Brexit ringleaders to the voters who support them. A ComRes poll found that leave voters are twice as likely to deny manmade climate change as those who voted remain. The same poll found that Brexiters exhibit a general “distrust towards scientists”. In other words, they’ve had enough of experts. Across the world, nationalist programmes – the French Front National, the BNP, Donald Trump, the Danish People’s party – have tried to cripple credibility in climate science, which requires collective action between states and is thus, for them, what Al Gore and others have called an inconvenient truth. But there’s another explanation for climate denial among leave voters. Climate sceptics and hard-Brexiters share the common denominator of right-leaning free-market ideology. Over the past decade, various studies have found that conservatives and economic liberals are considerably more likely than other people to reject anthropogenic global warming, presumably because this is a problem that the market cannot solve. The true danger from nationalist framings of climate change, however, is not denial, but the weaponisation of the environment in the service of self-interest. Trump famously called global warming a Chinese “hoax”, but less well known is that climate denial in China also arises from a nationalist distrust, in this case towards the west. A study published in the journal Environmental Sociology found that climate scepticism resulted from a patriotic “conspiracy theory that sees climate change as a western plot to constrain China’s development”. Similarly in India, the nationalism of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, is tied to the continuation of dirty coal as well as the excuse that western countries aren’t pulling their weight. But Marine Le Pen is perhaps the politician to have taken environmental nationalism the furthest. In 2014, the Front National leader launched what she called the New Ecology movement, promising to ban wind farms and reduce France’s dependence on oil, but condemning the environmental movement as a “communist project”. This eco-nationalism, woven with contradiction, turns environmental discourse into a geopolitical blame game. Eventually, Brexiters must come to realise this dissonance, along with the unalterable reality that air – and the carbon dioxide in it – does not respect national borders."
"Whenever they hold one of their frequent hearings to reject and deny established climate science, congressional Republicans invariably trot out contrarian scientist John Christy, who disputes the accuracy of climate models. In doing so, Christy uses a cherry-picked, error riddled chart, but there’s a nugget of truth in his argument. Although the discrepancy isn’t nearly as large as Christy’s misleading chart suggests, atmospheric temperatures seem not to have warmed quite as fast since the turn of the century as climate model simulations anticipated they would.  How you react to this information is a good test of whether you’re a skeptic or a denier. A denier will declare “aha, the models are wrong, therefore we don’t need any climate policies!” A skeptic will ask what’s causing the difference between the observational estimates and model simulations. There are many possible explanations. Maybe the tricky and often-adjusted estimates of the atmospheric temperature made by instruments on orbiting satellites are biased. Maybe there’s something wrong with the models, or our understanding of Earth’s atmosphere. Maybe the inputs used in the model simulations are flawed. The answer is likely a combination of these possibilities, but in congressional testimony earlier this year, Christy tried to place the blame entirely on the models, with a denier-style framing: the average of the models is considered to be untruthful in representing the recent decades of climate variation and change, and thus would be inappropriate for use in predicting future changes in the climate or for related policy decisions. And in testimony to Congress in December 2015, Christy offered his unsupported speculation that the discrepancy was a result of climate models being too sensitive to rising greenhouse gases: Indeed, the theoretical (model) view as expressed in the IPCC AR5 in every case overestimated the bulk tropical atmospheric temperature response of extra greenhouse gases … indicating the theoretical understanding of the climate response is too sensitive to greenhouse gases. In a new study, a team climate scientists led by Ben Santer sought to answer this question. They effectively disproved Christy’s assertion that the discrepancy was due to models being too sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect. Instead, the main culprit seems to be incorrect inputs used in the climate model simulations. The issue is that climate model simulations are run using specific scenarios. These scenarios assume specific changes in factors that influence global temperature and climate changes (known as “forcings”), like rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases and changes in solar and volcanic activity. Climate models don’t make “predictions;” rather, they make “projections” of how temperatures and other climatological factors will change in response to those forcing input scenarios. There’s also a random component known as “internal variability” due to factors like unpredictable ocean cycles.  An infamous example of deniers exploiting this wonky technical point to mislead policymakers happened in 1998. Congressional Republicans invited fossil fuel-funded Pat Michaels to testify ahead of the Kyoto international climate negotiations. In a shameless distortion of reality, Michaels evaluated a 1988 global temperature projection by James Hansen at NASA, but deleted all except the scenario that was the least like the actual forcing changes that had occurred over the prior decade. By only looking at Hansen’s model projection under a scenario where greenhouse gases rose much faster than they had in reality, Michaels deceptively made it appear as though Hansen’s climate model had vastly over-predicted global warming. Santer’s team found a similar issue in comparing simulated and observed changes in atmospheric temperatures over the past few decades: There are known systematic errors in these forcings in model simulations performed in support of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. These errors arise in part because the simulations were performed before more reliable estimates of early 21st century forcing became available. The net effect of the forcing errors is that the simulations underestimate some of the cooling influences contributing to the observed “slowdown”. For example, were Christy right that models are too sensitive to rising greenhouse gases, they should be systematically wrong during the entire period for which we have observational data. On the contrary, aside from a small discrepancy in the late 20th century that can be explained by natural internal variability, Santer’s team showed that the difference between model simulations and observations only begins around 1998. A problem with model sensitivity would also show up in studies looking at global temperature changes in response to large volcanic eruptions, which create a big change in forcing and temperature. But those studies rule out the low climate sensitivities that Christy favors, and as Santer’s team notes: there are no large systematic model errors in tropospheric cooling following the eruptions of El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991. On the other hand, research has identified a number of real-world cooling influences in the early 21st century that weren’t accurately represented in the climate model simulation scenarios. The sun went into an unusually quiet cycle, there was a series of moderate volcanic eruptions, and the boom in Chinese coal power plants added sunlight-blocking pollution to the atmosphere. Using statistical tests, Santer’s team showed that those unexpected cooling effects combined with shifts in ocean cycles best explained the model-data discrepancy in atmospheric temperatures over the past 20 years. Unsurprisingly, in blogs and on Twitter, deniers tried to spin the results of this study in their favor. Some claimed that the paper admitted there was a “pause” or “hiatus” in global warming. In reality, the paper used neither term, but did use the phrase “slowdown” 15 times, including explicitly clarifying that it was a “temporary” slowdown. In other words, the study clearly rejected the myth that global warming “paused;” instead, the rise in atmospheric temperatures temporarily slowed due to the aforementioned decline in solar activity, increase in pollution from coal plants and volcanic eruptions, and shifts on ocean cycles. Other contrarians have exhibited their confirmation bias by claiming the paper is an admission that climate models are wrong. As statistician George Box said, “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” Declaring that climate models are wrong and tossing them in the waste bin is a brain-dead denial move. What any skeptical scientific mind should want to know is why they’re imperfect – what’s causing the difference between simulations and reality, and what can we learn from that? The answer in this case is that those forcings (solar activity, coal pollution, volcanic eruptions) and ocean cycles acted to temporarily slow the warming of atmospheric temperatures in a way that wasn’t included in the climate model simulation inputs. But that shouldn’t assuage our concerns about climate change – solar activity won’t offset long-term global warming; nor will volcanic eruptions, coal pollution, or ocean cycles. These are all short-term effects that all had a cooling effect over the past 20 years, during which time the planet nevertheless kept on warming due to the overpowering force of human carbon pollution. The climate models themselves are still quite accurate, and paint a frightening picture of where we’re headed if we follow the status quo scenario of burning lots of fossil fuels. But if we can reduce human carbon pollution, we’ll shift to a scenario with a long-term global warming slowdown."
"The world’s largest unbroken intertidal system of sand and mud flats could sink beneath the waves by the end of the century due to sea level rise and subsidence caused by gas drills funded by Barclays and other international banks.  The Unesco world heritage site at the Wadden Sea on the Dutch coast stretches over 10,000 sq km. Its saltmarshes, sandy shoals, dunes and mussel beds host millions of migratory birds every year, as well as thousands of basking seals.  But the storm-weathered Frisian coastline may be living on borrowed time. One report this month predicted that it would be submerged by 2100 if current global warming trends and planned gas extractions continue. “It is more likely that the area will drown than that it will survive,” said Rolf Schuttenhelm, the paper’s author. “The equation is quite simple. If sea level rise and subsidence combined are larger than the maximum speed of sedimentation – and they are – then with time, the drowning of the tidal system becomes inevitable.” Geese, oystercatchers, spoonbills, pelicans and flamingoes would lose their havens if the flats disappeared. The loss would also sound a death knell for communities which have lived for millennia behind the dykes that dot the Friesland coast. Natural subsidence and gas drills are depressing the Frisian territory, which is mostly below sea level. The North Sea is also rising by 1.8mm a year, a rate likely to accelerate as climate change takes hold. NAM, a Shell-Exxon partnership, plans to start a gas drilling operation next year and three other wells could soon follow. Local people from 14 villages have formed a movement to resist them. “It’s all about money,” said Willem Schoorstra, an award-winning Frisian novelist from the group. “We had one talk with NAM and they constantly repeated that they would help us make the clean energy transition. But it’s crap. We don’t buy it. They only want to invest in it when they are drilling. They hold on to their old ways and destroy everything for the sake of money.” Beneath such talk is an attachment to the low-lying, ancient ground on which Romans, Vikings and Franks have trodden.  “It’s the quietness, the view, the smell,” says Schoorstra, “the birds, the starry skies, the little whispers from the cockles, mudworms and mussels. You can go there twice and the whole landscape has changed. It is where the kids have their first love affairs.” The Wadden Sea tide ebbs and flows twice a day, bringing sand, silt and nutrients which blanket the mud flats in algae. This holds the sand banks together and provides food for the shellfish and smaller creatures that feed the birds and make the ecosystem’s life cycle turn.  Johan Rispens, a local shrimp fisher, asks: “What will happen to our dykes when they drill for gas under the Wadden Sea? Will they crack? Will there be earthquakes? Why is it even necessary to take the gas from under the sea?”  Campaigners say some local house prices have fallen by as much as €50,000 (£44,000) each in the last five years due to fears of subsidence and the drilling-related earthquakes that have damaged an estimated 100,000 homes in neighbouring Groningen province.  Michiel Schrier, the Socialist governor of Friesland’s provincial capital Leeuwarden, says: “After the earthquakes in Groningen, people woke up and now every time a contractor wants to take gas from the ground, the communities are revolting and coming together in protest. These movements are getting bigger.”  Gas has been drilled on Ameland island off the Wadden Sea coast since 2006, and Schrier has himself taken part in many of the anti-drill demonstrations.  NAM argues that it can contain subsidence by keeping “a hand on the tap” – to turn their operations off if geological monitoring shows cavities appearing which might not be filled by sedimentation.  But the geological processes at work can take years to become apparent, and NAM’s technical blueprint was dismissed by the government’s mines supervisory board last week for a second time. NAM now has until November to address their report’s shortcomings, after which it could face fines of €500,000 a week.  “We need a proper study and that’s what is not happening at the moment,” said Wouter Van der Zee, the manager of the mines supervision board. “The predicted amount of subsidence and the uncertainty band were just unrealistic.”  If Shell does not correct inadequacies in its methodology, “we may have to advise our minister to reassess the gas production [plans] under the Wadden Sea,” Van der Zee said. Jeroen Jansen, a senior ecologist for Shell and NAM stressed that boreholes would be drilled from just outside the world heritage site to extract gas from the 200 billion cubic metre field that is directly underneath the mudflats. The drill was needed “so we can secure a safe, reliable and affordable energy supply in the future,” he said. “We are aware that the Wadden Sea is of high ecological value. If there would be a risk [of collapse], we would not do it.”  Subsidence of 1mm a year under the flats and 3-4mm a year under the salt marshes had taken place since 2006, he said, as a result of the 25 wells drilled in the Wadden Sea area since 1985.  A spokesman for the Dutch government said: “In the transition period towards a fossil fuel-free society, natural gas still has an important role to play. Whether we will eventually extract gas from the Wadden Sea is a different matter. We are still in the midst of a review procedure.”  Gas is seen in the Netherlands as a bridging fuel to a low-carbon future, because it emits just over half as much CO2 as coal. This is still 18 times higher than concentrated solar power and 40 times higher than onshore wind.  In Friesland, the widespread suspicion is that their government listens most attentively when money talks. “The Netherlands is a small country but we are very far from the Hague,” Schrier said. “They have a contract to deliver gas to other countries and it’s a big income for them.”  The issue reached boardroom level earlier this year when Rabobank announced an embargo on new finance for gas exploitation under the Wadden Sea. The bank is a major mortgage provider in the area. ING and ABN Amro, two other major Dutch banks, quickly followed their lead.  However, campaigners say that Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada and the ABP and Delta Lloyd pension funds are still keeping their investment options open.  Candice Macdonald, a spokeswoman for Barclays, said that day-to-day interaction with one of the drilling firms, Tulip Oil, was now being undertaken by Global Natural Resources Investments (GNRI) after a management buy-out of the bank’s natural resources equity office.  “Barclays retains a minority [30%] stake in Tulip,” Macdonald said. “Tulip has ceased all development activities on the Wadden Sea project and has no intention to restart at the current time.”  GNRI did not respond to calls for clarification but the firm’s environmental policy says that they will not back projects that break local laws. In a report on the financing of the gas projects, Barclays did not rule out work on the project resuming, subject to a “clarification of the Dutch mining law”.  Back at the Wadden Sea, Renate de Backere, a world heritage site guide surveys the remote muddy wilderness and sighs when asked about the inevitability of subsidence. “It’s a naturally occurring process but now we humans have created a situation where it’s hardly in control anymore,” she said. “The Wadden Sea is in danger because if there are no mudflats anymore, there will be no places for the seals to rest, the birds will not be able to access food any more, and the ecosystem will become a sea.”"
"Americans are “under siege” from disinformation designed to confuse the public about the threat of climate change, Nasa’s former chief scientist has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Ellen Stofan, who left the US space agency in December, said that a constant barrage of half-truths had left many Americans oblivious to the potentially dire consequences of continued carbon emissions, despite the science being unequivocal.  “We are under siege by fake information that’s being put forward by people who have a profit motive,” she said, citing oil and coal companies as culprits. “Fake news is so harmful because once people take on a concept it’s very hard to dislodge it.” During the past six months, the US science community has woken up to this threat, according to Stofan, and responded by ratcheting up efforts to communicate with the public at the grassroots level as well as in the mainstream press. “The harder part is this active disinformation campaign,” she said before her appearance at Cheltenham Science Festival this week. “I’m always wondering if these people honestly believe the nonsense they put forward. When they say ‘It could be volcanoes’ or ‘the climate always changes’… to obfuscate and to confuse people, it frankly makes me angry.” Stofan added that while “fake news” is frequently characterised as a problem in the right-leaning media, she saw evidence of an “erosion of people’s ability to scrutinise information” across the political spectrum. “All of us have a responsibility,” she said. “There’s this attitude of ‘I read it on the internet therefore it must be true’.” Stofan resigned from her post at the top of Nasa in December, but said she had decided to do so before the US election results. “It wasn’t anything to do with it, but I’m glad I’m not there now,” she said. However, she welcomed the continued commitment to Nasa’s Mars program in the most recent budget and was relieved that cuts to the agency’s Earth observation program, which contributes to climate and environment monitoring, were relatively small, at $167m (the total Earth science budget is now $1.754bn). Throughout her career, Stofan has highlighted the role of planetary science in understanding the Earth’s environment and said it provided some of the most inarguable proof that atmospheric carbon dioxide leads to a warmer climate. She draws parallels between carbon emissions on Earth and the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, a planet which once had oceans but is now a toxic inferno with surface temperatures approaching 500C. The Earth is not destined for such an extreme scenario – even if all the CO2 were burned its oceans would not boil off completely – but Venus demonstrates the dramatic changes that can unfold when the fine balance of planet’s atmosphere is tipped. “We won’t go all the way to Venus, but the consequences of putting more and more CO2 into the atmosphere are really dire,” she said. “There are models that suggest if we burn off all our fossil fuels, the Earth would become uninhabitable for humans.” The quest to find “habitable zones” beyond the Earth has been a major motivation throughout Stofan’s scientific career and she said that the answer to the question of the existence of extraterrestrial life-forms suddenly seems within reach.  Missions to capture water coming from the plumes of Europa and Enceladus, could yield the first indications. The search is requiring scientists to be imaginative and open-minded about what alien life might look like – it might involve complex molecules, but be DNA-free, for instance.  The uncertainty over what hypothetical alien life would even look like means that any initial discovery could be ambiguous and a source of scientific dispute, Stofan predicts. “It would be great if when we found life it was easy and we image a droplet of liquid and something goes swimming across it, no one’s going to disagree with that,” she said.  A more realistic scenario is that it would take decades for confirmation, and this reasoning is why Stofan is a strong advocate of a manned Mars mission, arguing that a robotic rover would not be capable of reliably confirming the existence of life, past or present, that might be lurking beneath the surface. Human explorers could operate drills designed to extract soil samples from far deeper than the few inches achieved by Nasa’s Curiosity rover, or the two metres limit anticipated for Esa’s upcoming ExoMars mission, and could perform more sophisticated scientific analysis. She predicts humans could orbit the red planet within 20 years and reach the surface in 30. “I still feel that to settle the question and to have agreement it’s going to have a lot of samples and a lot of analysis and to me that means humans,” she said. However, she dismissed the idea, popularised by Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, that mankind should be preparing to colonise other planets to avoid self-annihilation. “I don’t see a mass transfer of humanity to Mars, ever,” she said, adding that she had been concerned recently when a teacher told her that her pupils thought the climate “doesn’t matter as we’ll all go and live on Mars”. “Job one is to keep this planet habitable. I’d hate us to lose focus on that,” she said. • This article was amended on 12 June 2017. An earlier version said Stofan resigned “in December, before the US election results”. To clarify: she resigned in December, but made the decision before the election results."
"Long after we each cease to exist, the physical outcomes of the choices we make today, and tomorrow, will linger. Shadows of our decisions on policy, energy and lifestyle will manifest as the consequence of our injection of greenhouse gases into the Earth’s atmosphere. The forecasted outcomes of unchecked climate change are serious and long-lasting. Climate science regularly emits dire warnings and precipitous graphics illustrating dangerous changes to the oceans and atmosphere in the coming decades. They also fail, profoundly, to inspire widespread preventative action, partly because the future is distant and dim. The fact that long-term warnings bounce off audiences is a zone of friction for science communication. There’s a lack of connection between the numbers drawn from climate science and the personal, immediate motivations required to drive active prioritisation of climate action. Recently, a tiny addition was made to a well-worn climate chart that stretched connective material between the empirical end of climate science and the raw, human, personal end: The blue lines were added by the Climate Council’s Lesley Hughes (ANU climate scientist Sophie Lewis had a similar idea a few months back). Hughes’ addition dislodges a distracted audience from the stickiness of information saturation. These looming decades don’t seem distant when we think about the simple fact that children we know today will still be alive, and they’ll need jobs, and food, and energy security and infrastructure. They’ll be balancing these priorities in a world badly damaged by the choices we make today around emissions reductions.  Per Espen Stoknes, a Norwegian psychologist, has examined why people continue to feel disconnected from climate warnings, despite the strength of the science. He says, “People think this is far off – it is not here and now, it’s also up there in the Arctic or Antarctica, it affects other people, not me, I’ll be old before this really happens, other people are responsible, not me. We distance ourselves from it in so many ways that the pure facts are not sufficient to generate a sustained sense of risk”.  What Per Espen Stoknes describes as the “climate paradox” – a seemingly inverse relationship between scientific information and climate concern – is born out in Australian polling data: The chart above shows the percentage of respondents who rate “addressing climate change” in their top three issues in deciding how to vote at a federal election. It also shows the percent of respondents who accept the scientifically-verified finding that humans are causing changes in the earth’s climate. Though acceptance of the science is at a record high, the number of people placing climate in their top three voting issues is trending downward. Seeing the span of our descendant’s lives laid out over the physical consequences of our choices slices through the noise. It might help to push climate action upwards as a priority for Australians. The climate paradox looms large in America, too. Climate science acceptance is at a record high. Environment was third-lowest in priorities for the 2016 US election. US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has highlighted a shift within global climate advocacy. Climate change was absent from US media for most of 2016, but has dominated the news since Trump’s announcement. A growing collection of American cities have signed up to the Paris climate accords, in defiance of the federal decision. The European Union have cut the US government out of their negotiations, and will deal directly with states and businesses. After years of climate boredom, a solid bolt of energy animates these affirmations, in stark contrast to weird, rambling stream of falsehoods in Trump’s announcement and the deeply hollow, awkward celebrations of climate change deniers. Trump’s symbolic act was designed to signal his disdain for progressive obsessions and his care for American jobs. Instead, it has catalysed global resolve, been met with near-universal condemnation, refocused media coverage and distanced climate deniers.  This is a unique moment of clarity for a field of scientific inquiry that has faced immense, unfathomable opposition over the past decade. Climate doubt is in retreat. Climate science acceptance follows an inverse pattern, rising to record high levels. Climate scientists are working hard to humanise their messages, linking them to personal experience and the lives of the people who’ll inherit the consequences of today’s decisions. With luck, Trump might go down in the history as the man who catalysed a new era of climate action.  So this is the perfect time to string a conductive connection between the high-resolution picture of the future that’s been painted by intensely reviewed and re-reviewed scientific inquiry, and our responsibility to future inhabitants of the atmospheric stew into which we’re injecting gigatonnes of greenhouse gases. Connecting numbers to feelings is the antidote to the curse of temporal distance feeding the climate communication paradox. This is a jarring reminder of the generational inequity we exploit and worsen when we choose to disavow responsibility for the machines and industries causing the problem."
"Ten years ago today Malcolm Turnbull was getting stuck in to a debate in Parliament House with Peter Garrett about climate change. Climate change, said Turnbull, was “an enormous challenge and probably the biggest one our country faces, the world faces, at the moment.”  At the time, Turnbull was the environment minister in John Howard’s final term. Now of course, Turnbull is prime minister. Garrett, halfway through his six-year stint as a Labor politician, was Kevin Rudd’s shadow environment minister. Tonight, Garrett will be on stage in Germany with Midnight Oil. “It is called global warming for a reason,” Turnbull told Garrett. “A tonne of CO2 that goes into the atmosphere has the same impact on the world’s temperature, regardless of where it comes from — whether it is emitted in Australia, Europe, China or the United States. So an effective global response is vital.” A few seconds earlier, Turnbull had ridiculed Garrett as an idealist who “tries to change his spots all the time” and had “abandoned almost all of the positions he has had in his life — or has purported to abandon them”. Knowing what came next, Turnbull’s characterisation of Garrett as an opportunist with no political backbone should be deeply embarrassing for the prime minister. We are now stuck on another chapter in the annals of the climate wars, with still more uncertainty over if, and how, the government might treat a third-choice policy proposal to bring emissions down in the power sector.  It has been a dizzying 10 years since Turnbull’s exchange with Garrett. Let’s try and get through them in one paragraph.  Howard lost to Kevin Rudd, who ran promising to ratify the UN’s Kyoto protocol on climate change. Turnbull became the party leader in opposition, but after backing a policy to price carbon, lost to Tony Abbott in a leadership spill. Rudd was knifed by Julia Gillard, with Rudd’s backsliding on climate policy helping to sharpen the blade. Gillard won an election, introduced a carbon price, but Rudd retook the leadership and then lost an election to Abbott. Abbott repealed the carbon price, but then lost the leadership to Turnbull, who then won an election [… and breath]. In among all that Turnbull had fashioned himself as a climate hawk — one of those rare creatures of the conservative side of politics willing to talk with conviction on climate change.  In a 2010 speech Turnbull said the country had to get to a situation “where all or almost all of our energy comes from zero or very near zero-emissions sources.”  “We as a human species have a deep and abiding obligation to this planet and to the generations that will come after us,” he said.  Earlier that year, Turnbull told parliament: “Climate change is a global problem. The planet is warming because of the growing level of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. If this trend continues then truly catastrophic consequences will ensue, from rising sea levels to reduced water availability to more heatwaves and fires.”  Turnbull was a clear advocate for a price on greenhouse gas emissions, saying: “Given that the cheapest fuels are generally the dirtiest, in the absence of a clear carbon price signal new (power generating) capacity is likely to be coal rather than gas or rather than renewables.” “Plainly stated, in the absence of a clear carbon price signal, either no new investments will be made or investments will be made in new carbon intensive infrastructure because they are more profitable in a world where there is no price on carbon emissions.” But then Turnbull nailed the real reason why Australia is, as the recently resigned Climate Change Authority member Prof John Quiggin told me, at the back of the international pack on climate policy.  There was a need, Turnbull said back in 2010, “for leadership and direction” on climate policy to get a price on greenhouse gas emissions. And this is exactly what we have not had. Leadership. That’s the reason Australia does not have a price on greenhouse gas emissions but has in its place a legacy of failed policy decisions, uncertainty and bitterness. Fossil fuel interests, climate science denialists and anti-green zealots have crushed any political will to genuinely tackle the issue. They made it toxic and too many “leaders” let them. Failing to stand up to those elements gets us to the point where electricity prices are going through the roof and the mirage of “clean coal” seems almost real. A prime minister who once understood the urgency of the problem now thinks it can be solved by supporting the country’s biggest ever coalmine.  You can hear the evidence for this lack of political will in some of the phrases Turnbull and his ministers have been keen to adopt in the climate and energy debate.  They will tell you that it is not the job of government to “pick winners” and energy policies should be “technology neutral”. Both positions are absurd and should be seen as code for “we don’t have the courage to take on our detractors”. They are phrases designed to pander to people who go out of their way to claim “coal is good for humanity.”  Let’s just ask ourselves, if it’s not the job of government to pick winners, then what’s the alternative? Picking losers? Going all-out for mediocrity? As Turnbull said in 2010, by 2050 “all or almost all” of our electricity would need to come from sources that had zero, or near zero, emissions. There is no “technology neutral” policy that will get you to that point. What you need are policies that clearly discriminate, yet nobody is brave enough to say it. If Australia really does want to find a way out of the climate wars, then it will need a leader who has not “abandoned almost all of the positions he has had in his life”."
