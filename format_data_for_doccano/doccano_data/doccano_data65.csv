The findings mean atmospheric scientists and policymakers will need to reassess positions on climate change and tropical storms.

Last year’s 2017 hurricane season was an active one and caused a great deal of damage along the US southeast coastline. Global warming alarmists moved quickly to blame it on man-made CO2, which they say causes the planet to warm up and thus makes tropical cyclones more frequent and ferocious.
Yet an objective analysis of the recorded data show this is not the case at all, and that the opposite is occurring.
Hurricane “landfall drought”
For example, new scientific results of an analysis authored by Ryan Truchelut and Erica Staeling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters tell us that the 11 years before 2017 were in reality “an extended period” of quiet continental United States tropical cyclone landfall activity that today is known as the “landfall drought”. During this period (from 2006 through 2016) no major (category 3 or higher) hurricanes made landfall – an unprecedented event since systematic observations began.
Activity over 40% below average
Moreover, the two authors used accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) data to investigate variability and trends in landfall activity. Their findings: The hurricane landfall drought years between 2006 and 2016 recorded an average value of total annual ACE [accumulated cyclone energy] over the U.S. that was less than 60% of the 1900–2017 average.
The data also revealed a “statistically significant downward” trend since 1950, with the percentage of total Atlantic ACE expended over the continental U.S. at a series minimum during the recent drought period.

US landfalling hurricanes downward trend since 1900
Another just released scientific study by Klotzbach et al., 2018 tells us that since 1900 neither continental United States landfalling hurricane frequency nor intensity show significant trends (including the devastating 2017 season).

Charts above show that continental US hurricane activity has been decreasing since 1900 (despite atmospheric CO2 and global temperature rising). Source: Klotzbach et al, 2018.
Alarmists contradicted: Warming leads to LESS storms!
A third scientific publication authored by Zhang et al., 2018, also appearing in the journal Geophysical Research letters found that the mean frequency of Western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones was about 18% lower over the 1997–2014 period compared to the previous 1980–1996 period.
The reason, the authors found, was in part connected to “enhanced sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the North Atlantic”!
“No significant correlation” between cyclones and temperature
Finally a fourth scientific publication by Zhao et al., 2018 looked at the relationship between increasing tropical cyclone activity and increasing sea surface temperatures. Three previous studies by Liu and Chan 2013, Lin and Chan 2015, and Zhao and Wang 2016 showed that there had been a significant decrease of tropical cyclone frequency over the Western North Pacific basin since 1998.
Western North Pacific cyclone frequency declining!
According to Zhao, citing Chan 2006 and Yeh et al. 2010, observational analyses pointed out that there is no significant correlation between tropical cyclone frequency and sea surface temperatures over the Western North Pacific basin.

Moreover, the chart above makes it clear that tropical cyclone frequency in the Western North Pacific basin has in fact been declining.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTropical storms in the Pacific are strongly influenced by solar activity fluctuations and ocean cycles
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt

(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Tropical storms have plagued humans since the start. Today we will shed some light on the activity pattern of the Pacific region. Toomey et al. 2016 examined tropical storm activity in the Ssouth Pacific for the past 3000 years.
Conclusion: During the period from 2600 to 1500 years before today storms were at their worst. What follows is an excerpt from the paper’s abstract:

Our companion record of tropical cyclone activity from Tahaa suggests major storm activity was higher between 2600-1500 years B.P., when decadal scale SPCZ variability may also have been stronger. A transition to lower storm frequency and a shift or expansion of the SPCZ [South Pacific Convergence Zone] toward French Polynesia around 1000 years B.P. may have prompted Polynesian migration into the central Pacific.”
In the Western North Pacific it was discovered that cyclonic storm activity was surprisingly strongly coupled to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). In February 2018 Zhang et al. reported:

Dominant Role of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in the Recent Decadal Changes in Western North Pacific Tropical Cyclone Activity
Over the 1997–2014 period, the mean frequency of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones (TCs) was markedly lower (~18%) than the period 1980–1996. Here we show that these changes were driven by an intensification of the vertical wind shear in the southeastern/eastern WNP tied to the changes in the Walker circulation, which arose primarily in response to the enhanced sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the North Atlantic, while the SST anomalies associated with the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the tropical Pacific and the anthropogenic forcing play only secondary roles. These results are based on observations and experiments using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Forecast-oriented Low-ocean Resolution Coupled Climate Model coupled climate model. The present study suggests a crucial role of the North Atlantic SST in causing decadal changes to WNP TC frequency.”
In September 2017 Takahashi et al. had assumed that here sulfate aerosol emissions may have played a role. The explanation of the AMO presented by Zhang et al. probably makes more sense because ocean cycles are gaining greater importance as a climate factor in the attribution by observed natural climate variability.
Next we go on to Australia. Dowdy 2014 showed that the frequency of tropical storms had declined. Moreover it appears that El Nino is a variable. This is also confirmed by a chart of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology:

Graph showing the number of severe and non-severe tropical cyclones from 1970-2017 which have occurred in the Australian region. Severe tropical cyclones are shown here as those with a minimum central pressure less than 970 hPa. Source: Bureau of Meteorology
Haig & Nott 2016 investigated the development of Australian tropical storms over the past 1500 years and here found an impact by solar activity fluctuations:
Solar forcing over the last 1500 years and Australian tropical cyclone activity
Accurate seasonal and decadal predictions of tropical cyclone activity are essential for the development of mitigation strategies for the 2.7 billion residents living within cyclone prone regions. The traditional indices (Southern Oscillation Index and various sea surface temperature indices) have fallen short in recent years as seasonal predictors within the Australian region. The short length of these records (i.e., <50 years) has meant that our current knowledge of larger-scale drivers at interdecadal, centennial, and millennial scales is limited. The development of a new tropical cyclone activity index spanning the last 1500 years has enabled the examination of tropical cyclone climatology at higher temporal resolution than was previously possible. Here we show that in addition to other well-known climate indices, solar forcing largely drives decadal, interdecadal, and centennial cycles within the tropical cyclone record.”

"The Whitehall officials responsible for tackling the climate crisis dramatically increased their domestic flights last year despite the huge carbon footprint associated with aviation. Officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) took more than 4,500 domestic business flights in the last financial year, according to its annual report. The number of flights taken the year before was fewer than 2,700.  The department racked up the extra air miles in the same year that it asked the Committee on Climate Change to map a road towards a net zero carbon economy by 2050. The official climate watchdog warned that there could be only a limited increase in the number of flights taken in the coming decades if the UK is to end its contribution to global heating. Alan Whitehead, the shadow climate change minister, said the department should be “setting the gold standard of net zero compatible behaviour, not flying domestically 4,500 times a year”. “Ministers and officials shirking public transport and lower-carbon travel is how we’ve ended up with an overly expensive railway system,” he added. The figures emerged in the same week the climate activist Greta Thunberg embarked on an ambitious voyage from Plymouth to the US on a zero-carbon, solar-powered yacht to avoid the damaging greenhouse gases emitted during a long-haul flight. Environmental experts have urged the public to fly less, spend longer at their destination and choose lower-emission travel options whenever possible. Doug Parr, the chief climate scientist of Greenpeace, said: “Every part of the economy needs to be making carbon reductions, and within government one would expect BEIS to take the lead. “The department has been cutting their flights over the last decade, but last year’s sharp and disappointing uptick in domestic flights is concerning. Flying is an unavoidably high-carbon activity and shouldn’t happen without a real need. “Can this number of domestic flights within a small, developed nation with relatively good surface transport really be necessary?” A government spokeswoman said BEIS was “making good progress” towards achieving its goal to cut emissions by two-thirds from their 2010 levels by the end of next year. The department’s total greenhouse gas emissions, including flights, fell below 22,700 tonnes of carbon in the last financial year, down from more than 30,300 tonnes the year before. The emissions reduction is due to a steep fall in the amount of gas used to heat the department after undertaking energy efficiency upgrades to its offices at 10 Victoria Street. BEIS said last year that it would fit double-glazing and a new boiler system to the offices after an investigation by the BBC last summer revealed that its building had the lowest possible energy efficiency ratings. Under a freedom of information request the broadcaster found that four of the 11 offices leased by BEIS received the lowest G rating, while the headquarters in Victoria Street had an E rating."

2017: 150 Graphs, 122 Scientific Papers
In the last 12 months, 150 graphs from 122 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published that undermine the popularized conception of a slowly cooling Earth temperature history followed by a dramatic hockey-stick-shaped uptick, or an especially unusual global-scale warming during modern times.
Yes, some regions of the Earth have been warming in recent decades or at some point in the last 100 years.
Some regions have been cooling for decades at a time.
And many regions have shown no significant net changes or trends in either direction relative to the last few hundred to thousands of years.
Succinctly, then, scientists publishing in peer-reviewed journals have increasingly affirmed that there is nothing historically unprecedented or remarkable about today’s climate when viewed in the context of long-term natural variability.

"On white-crested swells under leaden skies, the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has set sail from Plymouth on arguably her most daunting challenge yet. A two-week crossing of the Atlantic during hurricane season in a zero-carbon yacht – harnessing wind, sun, and hydro power – is the first obstacle. But it is unlikely to be the toughest in an odyssey through the Americas over many months. This will be both the ultimate gap year and a journey into the heart of climate darkness: first to the United States of president Donald Trump, who has promised to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, and then down to South America, possibly including Brazil where president Jair Bolsonaro is overseeing a surge of Amazon deforestation. In between, the 16-year-old Swede will add her increasingly influential voice to appeals for deeper emissions cuts at two crucial global gatherings: the Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September and the the UN climate conference in Santiago in early December. The reception awaiting her on the other side is likely to be mixed, with the climate issue a polarising point in US politics. In a taste of the hostility that is likely to come from supporters of the fossil fuel industry, Steve Milloy, a Fox News contributor and former member of the Trump transition team, described Thunberg on Twitter earlier this week as “the ignorant teenage climate puppet”. The young founder of the school climate strike movement appeared unfazed in a quayside press conference before she boarded the vessel. “There’ll always be people who don’t understand or accept the science. I’ll ignore them,” she said. “Climate delayers want to shift the focus from the climate crisis to something else. I won’t worry about that. I’ll do what I need.” Speaking to a throng of several dozen reporters from around the world, she said her primary goal was to raise awareness among the public about the climate emergency. “People (need to) come together and put pressure on people in power so they have to do something,” she said. Asked if she will meet Donald Trump, the teenager said it would be a waste of time because the US president hasn’t been persuaded by the experts he has already spoken to. “I’m not that special. I can’t convince everyone,” she said. The voyage is a demonstration of her declared values, which revolve around reducing emissions. A flight to New York would have been much quicker, but it would pump close to 1,000kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Conventional cruise ships often have an even bigger footprint. Instead, Thunberg – along with her father, a cameraman and a two-man crew – are taking a zero carbon option. The Malizia II is an 18 metre (60ft) racing yacht that was built for round-the-world challenges and has just completed the Fastnet race, which runs every two years. While the wind propels it, the vessel generates the power for lighting and communication through solar panels and underwater turbines. The racing team have removed sponsorship logos from the hull and emblazoned Greta’s slogan “Unite Behind the Science” on the mainsail. The yacht is designed for speed rather than luxury so conditions will range from basic to difficult. There is no toilet or shower on the boat, only blue plastic buckets. Inside the cabins the lights are dim so Thunberg will need a headlamp or torch to read and keep her journal. Internet access is also likely to be patchy, so her 883,000 Twitter followers may have to wait longer than usual for updates via satellite phone. Her diet will be freeze-dried vegan meals – she has given up meat, which is a major source of emissions. The young Swede is braced for sea sickness. Although the waves were small as she left Mayflower Marina in Plymouth, she will be fortunate if they remain that way. August is part of the hurricane season in the Atlantic. Even in moderate swells, the vessel is noisy and bumpy. The experienced German captain, Boris Hermann, said the 3,500 nautical mile journey would demonstrate that it is possible to cope without fossil fuels and get closer to nature. “I want to show that this can be positive and exciting,” he said. “And that solidarity with Greta is not limited to eco-activists.” Thunberg accepts that solar yachts are not for everyone but says she is taking the opportunity to demonstrate there are alternatives. “I don’t tell people what to do. People can do what they want.” The journey marks a new stage in the remarkable rise of the young Swede, who was unknown outside of her family and school until she started a climate strike last August. She has been diagnosed with Aspergers and has at various times experienced depression, anxiety and selective mutism. Today, however, she has become the spokesperson for the global climate movement and its most recognisable face. Her Fridays for Future campaign has now mobilised more than a million students across the globe. She has been invited to UN summits, feted at the World Economic Forum in Davos, nominated for the Nobel peace prize, collaborated on a song with the band the 1975, appeared on the cover of countless magazines and been credited with injecting new life into the climate movement. Last month, the head of the trillion-dollar Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) described the campaign by Greta and others as the greatest threat to the fossil fuel industry. “Some things are actually changing, like the mindsets of people. It’s not fast enough, but it’s something,” she said. The scale of the movement will be tested on 20 September, when Thunberg and others have called for a global general strike for the climate. By that time Thunberg should be in the US, where she plans to meet the UN secretary general, António Guterres, as well as US politicians. She has been promised a warm welcome from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom she has already discussed strategies to raise climate ambitions and mobilise campaigners. Supporters hope Thunberg’s 12 months off school will be a world-changing gap year. After the US, Thunberg will head south to the UN climate summit in Santiago. Asked if she would also visit Brazil, Thunberg was vague. “I’ll travel around the whole continent,” she said. “I’m taking it step by step … I’ll travel for I don’t know how long. I want it to be loose. Not a tight schedule so that it can change as time goes by.” That includes the return voyage. “I don’t know yet how I will get home.” As she walked towards the yacht in her black waterproofs, there were cheers, applause and cries of “Safe journey.” By the time the vessel pulled into the harbour, the skies cleared, and better weather is forecast this evening and next week On Tuesday, Thunberg will pass the first-year anniversary of her campaign in the middle of the Atlantic. “I will see how I will celebrate. I don’t know yet. I will think about it,” she said. “I think it will be quite an adventure.” • This article was amended on 2 September 2019 to clarify references to the yacht being solar powered. The main power source is wind."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Dr. Ryan Maue pointed out here at Twitter that hurricane activity has not lived up to the climate model projections and that major hurricanes in the 1970s and 80s were “likely underestimated”

The hurricane expert tweeted:
Over the past 4-decades, number of global HURRICANE strength tropical cyclones (about 48/year) have actually DECREASED, while MAJOR hurricane strength tropical cyclones (about 25/year) have slightly (insignificant) trended upward.”
And:
Over the past 10-years (120-months) there have been 232 major hurricane strength tropical cyclones globally. In the 10-years prior, there were 252 majors. And the 10-years before that 258 majors. We likely underestimated majors in 1970s & early 1980s prior to Hi-Res satellites.”
No trend in flooding in Europe
And at the their Die kalte Sonne site here geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt report in Europe that floods and storms In Europe have not been more frequent, despite all the unending claims by the media.
Over the past week the German media hyped up some local, severe thunderstorms that had hit in parts of the country, causing heavy downpours and local flooding.
The media injected their usual Biblical tones in their reports.
Lüning and Vahrenholt first cite a recent study, which was even featured in detail by German DLF public radio, which tells us that the frequency and severity of heavy rain events and flooding have not increased in Europe over the past 150 years:
Severe weather in Europe: Flooding not more than in the past
When it comes to torrential rainfall and flooding, many people agree: Such things never happened in the past. But that is not true Dominik Paprotny of the University of Technology in Delft analyzed. Historical sources show that large floods are not more frequent today.”
Read more at Deutschlandfunk.de.
And DLF Nova reported:
Danger of flooding is the same as it was 150 years ago
High water and flooding in Europe has not become more frequent at all, a team of scientists in the Netherlands show. The scientists have put together a databank that looks at storms and floods back to 1870. Most international databanks go back to only to 1970.”

The study by Paprotny et al. 2018 appeared in Nature Communications and it can be downloaded free of charge as a pdf file. In the abstract:
Trends in flood losses in Europe over the past 150 years
[…] Here we utilize a gridded reconstruction of flood exposure in 37 European countries and a new database of damaging floods since 1870. Our results indicate that, after correcting for changes in flood exposure, there has been an increase in annually inundated area and number of persons affected since 1870, contrasted by a substantial decrease in flood fatalities. For more recent decades we also found a considerable decline in financial losses per year.”
Recent flare-up in honesty in media “remarkable”!
Lüning and Vahrenholt then go on to express their surprise that the DLF would present the scientific results so “honestly and without climate alarmist undertones.” and that “it is remarkable for today’s mainstream journalism”, which over the years tended to link every summer thunderstorm to Co2 emitted by man.
Flooding was worse during Little Ice Age
Next Lüning and Vahrenholt present studies showing that flooding in Central Europe and in the Alps region was even worse during the Little Ice Age than it is today, see here, here, here, and here.
Potsdam Institute contradicted
Lüning and Vahrenholt next dismiss earlier claims by the climate alarmist Potsdam Institute, which earlier claimed “robust trends” concerning “summertime dry periods and greater occurrence of flooding” in the German state of Saxony Anhalt (pdf here).
The two German skeptic scientists examined the official data from the German DWD national weather service for Saxony Anhalt, and found the following:

Summer precipitation in Sachsen Anhalt seit 1880. Data source: DWD.
Lüning and Vahrenholt summarize with four man points:

The linear trend for precipitation since 1881 is zero.
Summer weather in Central Europe is controlled by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), i.e. natural ocean cycles.
The weather is not getting more extreme. The year-to-year differences in summertime precipitation is in fact showing a slight downward trend.
In Saxony Anhalt, despite all the alarmist claims, there is no anthropogenic signal.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s 2017/18 winter (December-January-February) came in moderately above normal in terms of mean temperature (+0.7°C), according to DWD German national weather service data recorded from its 2000 measurement stations scattered across the country. But February was a completely different story.
Seb thinks Central Europe is warming
First, in a recent comment, warmist reader Seb claimed that Germany saw a “pretty ‘normal’ February”. Yet DWD here just reported that the mean temperature for the month was -1.7°C (preliminary), which is 2.7°C below the 1981 – 2010 mean.
That’s quite a bit colder than “pretty normal”. And we expect that number will be revised a tenth or so of a degree colder over the coming weeks.
Seb added in his comment:
What would be a surprise would your predictions of a cooling climate to become true. Let’s fast forward 5-10 years and see who will laugh at whom …”
Looking at the 30-year trend (the time period used to define climate) we see that the trend for February in Germany is clearly downward (I added the latest data point for February to the chart, which was provided by Josef Kowatsch last year):

In the chart above, using the data from the DWD German national weather service, we see that the trend for February over the past 31 years in Germany is clearly downward.
Since 1988, the mean February temperature has in fact fallen about 1°C. That’s quite a surprise when we consider that it’s supposed to be getting warmer. Moreover, the data has not even been adjusted to take the urban heat island (UHI) into effect, Kowatsch says.
Who’s laughing?

Well Seb, we’re already laughing. That’s a rather foolish statement you’ve made. You need to look at the data before expressing such strange things. We’ve already been waiting for the warming 31 years, and there’s no need to wait another 5 or 10 years. But do keep pushing it off if you like – eventually it will get warmer because of natural cycles.
Germany’s highest peak, Zugspitze, set a new all-time record low for late February, measuring -30.5°C.
Central European winters gradually cooling over past 30 years
But that’s just the month of February, and arguably one could claim cherry-picking here. The cold trend in February, however, indeed matters because it impacts when spring starts in Central Europe. Data on this as well show that spring has been arriving later over the past 25 years, and not earlier.
Now looking at the winter trend (D-J-F), here as well we see there’s been no warming over the past three decades:

German winters have been cooling. Chart: Josef Kowatsch
20th coldest February in Austria
In neighboring Austria, the mean for February was also 2.0°C below the mean, according to Austria’s ZAMG national weather service here.
The ZAMG adds that in the mountains it was the 20th coldest February month since measurements began. Indeed Austria’s and Switzerland’s high elevation temperatures have cooled by a brisk 1.4°C over the past 30 years.
No warming in sight.

"The boom in the US shale gas and oil may have ignited a significant global spike in methane emissions blamed for accelerating the pace of the climate crisis, according to research. Scientists at Cornell University have found the “chemical fingerprints” of the rising global methane levels point to shale oil and shale gas as the probable source.  Methane, levels of which have been increasing sharply since 2008, is a potent greenhouse gas that heats the atmosphere quicker than carbon dioxide. Researchers at Cornell said the carbon composition of atmospheric methane, or the “weight” of carbon within each methane molecule, was changing too. Robert Howarth, the author of the paper published in the journal Biogeosciences, said the proportion of methane with a “carbon signature” linked to traditional fossil fuels was falling relative to the rise of methane with a slightly different carbon make-up. Researchers had previously assumed the “non-traditional” methane was from biological sources such as cows and wetlands, but the latest research suggests unconventional oil and gas from fracking may be playing a significant part. The theory would support a correlation in the rise of methane in the atmosphere and the boom in fracking across the US over the last decade. “This recent increase in methane is massive,” Howarth said. “It’s globally significant. It’s contributed to some of the increase in global warming we’ve seen and shale gas is a major player.” However, UK academics have said the jury is still out because there remained “significant uncertainty” about the theory, which has not been conclusively proven.  The claim is “highly contentious in the academic community and further work is needed to constrain uncertainty before conclusions such as this can be robustly backed up”, said Prof Grant Allen, from the Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Manchester. “However, this paper makes a very important point,” he said. “Controlling emissions from fracking, and fossil fuels in general, represents a potential policy quick fix to stemming the rise of methane still further.” Howarth said his report showed that if humans stopped emitting large quantities of methane into the atmosphere, it would dissipate. “It goes away pretty quickly, compared to carbon dioxide. It’s the low-hanging fruit to slow global warming,” he said."
"Australia stands in opposition to other Pacific Islands nations after distancing itself from language calling for urgent action on climate change at a regional meeting in Tuvalu. Eighteen leaders including Australia’s Scott Morrison, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and Fiji’s Frank Bainimarama met for almost 12 hours at the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and its chair, Enele Sopoaga, the Tuvaluan prime minister, described the talks as “a very, very tough, difficult struggle”.  Some attending nations had hoped all 18 members would commit to policies to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but the leaders agreed to an opt-out from specific measures they opposed. A communique was passed with a qualification saying not all countries supported a strong statement issued by a group of small island Pacific states earlier in the week, which had called for an immediate global ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and coalmines and for all countries to rapidly phase out use of coal in the power sector. Asked after the session if the qualification had come from a country starting with the letter A, Sopoaga laughed and said: “Yeah, absolutely.” Australia is the only such nation in the 18. Morrison refused to be drawn about whether Australia was responsible for the qualification. “It’s not incumbent on any member state to endorse that statement, it’s a statement of the small Pacific states,” he said. All references to coal were removed from the communique and the climate change statement, though references to the “climate change crisis”, which Sopoaga had earlier told the Guardian were disputed and looked likely to be replaced with “climate change reality”, remained. Greenpeace said Australia’s plans to water down the communique could make it “the pariah of the Pacific”. Joseph Moeono-Kolio, the group’s head of Pacific, said: “How does Morrison reconcile calling the Pacific family while he persistently ignores our demands for Australia to reduce its emissions?”  The low-lying Pacific islands are on the frontline of the climate crisis, battling rising sea levels and related problems that have forced some residents to move to higher ground. Ardern warned Australia on Wednesday that it would have to answer to the Pacific for its climate change policy. Other Pacific leaders have repeatedly called for Australia to move away from coal. Bainimarama appealed to Canberra on Monday to “do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change”. He said coal posed an “existential threat” to Pacific islands. Morrison brought a lump of coal into the Australian parliament in 2017 when he was treasurer and taunted the opposition, saying to jeers from other members of his own party: “This is coal. Don’t be afraid, don’t be scared. It won’t hurt you, it’s coal.” Morrison’s Liberal party has voiced support for the Carmichael coalmine planned for the Galilee Basin in Queensland, which is forecast to create annual emissions similar to those from countries such as Malaysia and Austria and more than those of New York City. In Tuvalu, which could be uninhabitable within decades as a result of rising sea levels, Sopoaga expressed disappointment with the result of the communique, saying: “I think we should have done more work for our people.” He urged leaders to focus on “survival, not saving the economies of countries”."
"She looks both younger than her age and old enough to have the cares of the world on her shoulders. Face scrubbed clean, dressed in a severe black jacket, Greta Thunberg stares unsmiling from the cover of this month’s GQ magazine. It’s an arresting, even unsettling, image: her outstretched finger points accusingly at the reader, in the manner of a wartime recruitment poster. Your planet needs you, millennials. Back in the 1990s, posing for men’s magazines in your knickers was a rite of passage for young actors and pop stars not so much older than Greta, but that feels a very long time ago now. Here is a cover girl designed not to titillate male readers but to nudge their consciences, and very successfully, too. Successfully enough to make her some powerful enemies. The perennial rightwing agent provocateur Arron Banks this week tweeted, “Freak yachting accidents do happen in August”, over a picture of Greta sailing across the Atlantic in order to avoid the carbon emissions of flying. A joke, he insisted, but what’s funny about the idea of a teenage girl sinking to the bottom of the sea? Something about female eco-warriors seems to bring out the worst in a certain kind of man, whether it’s Nigel Farage accusing Meghan Markle of destroying Prince Harry’s popularity with her woke enthusiasms, or the Australian shock jock Alan Jones suggesting this week that the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, should have a “sock shoved down her throat” for daring to argue that Australia go further in reducing emissions. Choke her, drown her, whatever; just shut her up. Who do they think they are, these women telling us how to live? It’s not just men who bait climate crisis campaigners, of course; the TalkRadio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer tweeted this week, over a picture of Thunberg at sea, that she’d just booked flights for a winter sun holiday with “level of guilt being felt: zero”. Male environmentalists get their share of vitriol, too – even if it’s hard to recall, say, Zac Goldsmith being targeted in quite this way. It’s selfishness, rather than misogyny, that is surely the root cause of this rage at the very idea of being asked to give up any individual freedom – to fly, drive, eat a steak, carry on with our oblivious lives as if nothing was happening – for the greater good. But female climate campaigners are perhaps uniquely prone to press the buttons of what might be called toxic libertarians; people who combine a burning desire to do what the hell they like with fury at the very idea of being nagged, nannied or told what to do, especially by women. We are way beyond arguing about the science here, and fast moving beyond politics too, at least in the conventional sense of debating how far and how fast it’s reasonable to move in a democracy, or whether the moral absolutists of movements such as Extinction Rebellion have thought hard enough about the impact on other people’s livelihoods. There is still a perfectly legitimate political argument to be had about the need to secure democratic consent for sweeping changes in people’s lives. But those arguments are giving way to something altogether nastier: not climate crisis denial, so much as climate crisis nihilism. The nihilists don’t necessarily deny that the planet’s frying but, essentially, they refuse to feel bad about it; they want their sunshine holidays and their 4x4s, come hell or (possibly quite literally) high water, and screw anyone who gets in the way. If Brexit is any guide – and there is an interesting overlap with the sort of hard Brexiters who no longer argue for no deal on its merits, but solely on the grounds that it’s what they wanted and they’re damn well going to have it – they will increasingly use social media to bully their opponents out of the public sphere and embolden their supporters. We are watching a new front open up in the culture war, and its timing is probably no coincidence. Without the new lease of life it gives them, where exactly would the self-styled bad boys of Brexit be now? Banks, the money man of the movement, is currently under investigation by the National Crime Agency over the source of loans made to leave campaigners. The emergence of a hard-Brexit Tory leadership threatens to deprive Farage’s Brexit party of its entire raison d’être. He and his hangers-on need a new rallying cause and this one looks like a perfect fit, since his followers tend to be apoplectic about anything – smoking bans, speed cameras, sugar taxes, hate speech laws or simply woke millennial sensibilities – that threatens to restrict individual freedoms in the greater good. Any outrage generated by personal attacks on environmentalists just gives them the welcome oxygen of publicity, which is why it’s generally wiser to ignore it. But dragging a 16-year-old into this splenetic, self-serving bar brawl makes a dangerous new level of provocation that should not go unchallenged. Greta Thunberg’s unique strength when she first emerged as an activist was that, as a child, and one with Asperger’s to boot, she had almost unassailable moral authority. Her critics argued that if she was old enough to tell world leaders what to do then she should be old enough to take the heat for it, but most people recognise that hers is still an innately vulnerable age; not quite a child, not quite grown up, instinctively evoking protective feelings in anyone with an ounce of humanity. That doesn’t mean elected politicians are required to treat her every utterance as a tablet of stone, but initially even her detractors accepted that to argue back as robustly as one might with an adult would seem bullying and unkind. It is a twisted testament to her success that the gloves have now come off with a vengeance, but it’s frightening all the same. Even as someone who sympathises with Thunberg’s argument, admiring her courage and imagination, for a while I have felt a creeping unease about where this is all going. She is still so young, so vulnerable, for someone carrying such an impossible weight of expectation. How would she cope if the world leaders who have paid lip service to her demands don’t ultimately do what she wants? Will she one day regret having missed out on a more conventional adolescence? But the violence of the backlash adds a more worrying dimension. If she were my daughter I would be both immensely proud of her, and terrified for her; torn between not wanting her to be bullied into silence, and wanting to hide her away from it all. Yet however her parents choose to deal with this, the broader problem she highlighted remains. A society that cannot bear to be lectured by its children, even when they’ve got a point, while the adults are behaving like spoiled toddlers refusing to clean up their own mess, is one that can never progress. Perhaps our children can finally be children again, when the rest of us grow the hell up. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist • This article was amended on 19 August 2019 because an earlier version misnamed the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern as Jacinta Ardern.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany is a country that madly rushed in all earnest into green energies without any planning and thought some 10 years ago. Electric cars of course were envisioned as being a key part of the green energy transition, dubbed the Energiewende.
Fortunately, since then, some are beginning to wake up to the harsh reality of “green” energy.
10 years later, despite the now 56 gigawatts of installed wind capacity and 40 gigawatts of installed solar capacity, the country still relies on fossil fuels for more than half of its energy supply. That fact and all the batteries needed make e-cars a fake green dream.
“Eco-Swindle E-Auto”
This all means that over the long term electric cars in Germany are still more CO2 intensive than regular gasoline powered cars, according to a recent report titled “Eco-Swindle E-Auto” on DW German public television:

(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/de_DE/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.0';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));

According to moderator Thomas Spahn, e-cars in Germany are not living up at all to the promises of being environmentally friendly. Quite to the contrary. “It’s a pity that this climate friendly vision still fails the test of reality,” he says.
Worse than diesel automobiles
According to Spahn of DW, the Stockholm Environmental Research Institute (IVL) calculated that just the production of the batteries for a Tesla S car spews some 17 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere and that this is just as bad for the environment as a diesel or gasoline engine after being on the road 200,000 kilometers!
What’s worse, according to Spahn, is that in Germany the CO2 performance of e-cars is even worse because more than half the power that is needed to charge the e-vehicles is generated from coal or gas fuel, and thus he calls e-cars “rolling climate killers”.
“Illusion” and “self-delusion”
According to Spahn, e-cars won’t be clean until all electric power in Germany gets produced exclusively by green energies.
But that will take decades. Until then, climate-friendly e-cars unfortunately will remain an illusion. But let’s be honest, self-delusion is indeed the nicest when you can share it with many others.”

Raw material processing and the production of batteries in plants account for about 80% of the total environmental burden.”

"The environmentalist, white nationalist, and influential anti-immigration activist John Tanton died less than three weeks before the El Paso shooting. Tanton lived to see his movement shape much of modern US immigration policy, but not this latest violent turn. A hate-filled document allegedly linked to the man suspected of killing 22 people in El Paso on 3 August echoed the kind of rhetoric generally favored by the far right – and also had a decidedly environmentalist, Tanton-like bent. The document praised the Dr Seuss character the Lorax, who says he speaks for the trees, and complained about the unsustainable overuse of paper towels. It concluded that the best course of environmental action would be mass murder.  A week prior, on an Instagram account reportedly linked to the alleged Gilroy, California, garlic festival shooter, he complained about migrant-driven sprawl. Months before, the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter called himself an “eco-fascist”. Long before this violence, researchers warned of “the greening of hate”. From Tanton’s anti-immigration nonprofit network to some of today’s avowed environmentalists, across the political spectrum, overpopulation and immigration in particular has been blamed for environmental collapse for over 50 years. Anti-immigrant ideology has been part and parcel of the whole of American conservationism since the first national park was founded, in part to protect wild yet white-owned nature from Mexicans and Native Americans. National purity and natural purity were inextricably linked. The current rise of eco-minded white supremacy follows a direct line from the powerful attorney, conservationist and eugenicist Madison Grant – a friend of trees, Teddy Roosevelt, and the colonial superiority of white land stewardship. Grant, along with the influential naturalist John Muir and other early Anglo-Saxon conservationists, was critical in preserving the country’s wildlands for white enjoyment. Muir, who founded the Sierra Club environmental group in 1892, was disturbed by the “uncleanliness” of the Native Americans, whom he wanted removed from Yosemite. Grant successfully lobbied, in equal measure, for the creation of protected national parks and the restriction of immigration by non-whites. “Environmentalists were hardcore eugenicists. They were as committed to racial thinking as they were to protecting the great redwoods in California,” said Heidi Beirich, intelligence project director at the Southern Poverty Law Center. That eco-xenophobia resurfaced in the 1970s as overpopulation and resource depletion was deemed the pre-eminent challenge facing the planet at the dawn of the anthropocene. Published in 1968, The Population Bomb, by the Stanford University biology professor Paul Ehrlich, predicted that overpopulation would fuel worldwide famine and global upheaval. Much of what Ehrlich predicted did not come to pass, but the book proved hugely influential in the nascent environmental movement. Global population growth was soon conflated with US immigration growth, and both were blamed for the coming collapse of Spaceship Earth. This argument inspired generations of eco-nativists, and the most influential anti-immigration advocacy network currently operating in the US. In 1979, Tanton, a local Sierra Club official, founded the “centrist/liberal” Federation for American Immigration Reform (Fair) to further advance the overpopulation-as-environmental-degradation cause. He went on to co-found the Center for Immigration Studies. Tanton, who warned of a “Latin onslaught” that would degrade America’s culture and lands, is widely regarded as the founder of the modern immigration reform movement. While Tanton was establishing his right-leaning network of anti-immigration organizations, new ecologists on the left were coming to the same conclusions he did about the answer to growing environmental crisis. “Deep ecologists” in the 1980s and 1990s argued that humans were just one of many species, and often an invasive and destructive one. Activist David Orton argued that limiting immigration “from a maintenance of biodiversity perspective … has nothing to do with fascists”. The deep ecologist Dave Foreman was a co-founder of the radical wilderness collective Earth First! before the group forced him and his increasingly anti-immigration ideology out. By the late 90s, the anti-immigration issue reached a fever pitch within the US environmental movement. The Sierra Club had grown exponentially in the preceding decades, and “population control” had been part of its core platform. A nearly decade-long power struggle ensued for control over America’s pre-eminent conservation group, as new members attempted to move away from the overpopulation argument, while longtime Sierrans and those in Tanton’s circle pushed the group to maintain immigration control as a core tenet. They ultimately lost the Sierra Club in the mid-2000s, but anti-immigration groups associated with Tanton didn’t give up on attempting to influence eco-minded progressives. They ran ads linking overpopulation and climate crisis in mainstream newspapers and progressive magazines, from the New York Times to the Nation.  “The takeover attempts of the Sierra Club really woke people up to what was going on, but it still continues,” said Betsy Hartmann, Hampshire College professor emerita of development studies and author of The America Syndrome: Apocalypse, War and Our Call to Greatness. “The fact that it’s picked up – that’s the new twist.” “We’re seeing the far right really take up ecological arguments again,” said John Hultgren, a Bennington College environmental politics professor and author of Border Walls Gone Green: Nature and Anti-immigrant Politics in America. “The rise of eco-fascism, I think, is very real.” The right’s perspective on the climate crisis has generally been one of denial, and reliance on a fringe in the scientific community that maintains climate change is a natural process. According to available research, immigration control as climate control is a similar pseudoscience. By stopping immigration from countries with low per capita emissions to wealthier nations with high per capita emissions, this thinking goes, total environmental impact will be limited, as will further damage to US wildlands and biodiversity: fewer people means less sprawl and less resource use. There is little actual science to bolster immigration control for ecological purposes. While there is evidence that population and economic growth in total increases global emissions, recent studies show no correlation between US immigrant communities and pollution. Whether eco-nativists are using these arguments to greenwash racism, or they truly believe limiting immigration is the best way to pull the planet back from the brink, the results are the same. “You can be a genuine environmentalist and a genuine xenophobe – the two often do converge,” said Hultgren. The El Paso manifesto echoed this logic, lamenting that it’s proven too difficult to change American consumers’ habits. “So population reduction is almost the low-hanging fruit, the simple solution to the crisis of climate change. That’s the argument that a lot of anti-immigrant environmentalists have made,” said Hultgren – but taken to a violent end. Limiting immigration has certainly proven more politically palatable than regulating fossil fuel companies and corporate polluters under the current administration. Tanton network groups have reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with the Trump administration and a great deal of influence over immigration policy. Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller and former attorney general Jeff Sessions have both been linked to Tanton groups. Former Fair officials and lobbyists have found a new home in the Trump administration. They include the former executive director of Fair, who is now the Department of Homeland Security’s citizenship and immigration services ombudsman. The eco-xenophobic rhetoric that Tanton and his supporters have traded in has proliferated across the right, straddling both arguments about population growth and outright racist beliefs that Latino immigrants, in particular, destroy nature. Long before he became the father of the Proud Boys, the Vice magazine co-founder Gavin McInnes espoused the ecological virtues of population and immigration control. In a 2003 Vice Guide to Happiness, McInnes offered some cause for optimism under President George W Bush: “Immigration is getting handled, which is helping the environmental problems overpopulation has caused.” In 2010, he grumbled about how the Sierra Club had turned away from the anti-immigration cause. Richard Spencer’s “meta-political manifesto for the Alt-Right” advocated for a kind of conservationism in the white nationalist tradition. The rightwing pundit Ann Coulter claimed Americans will have to choose between a “greening or browning” of America. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson opined on air about the ecological impact of immigrants: “I actually hate litter, which is one of the reasons I’m so against illegal immigration.” Online, an eco-fascist rhetorical revival has been wrapped in traditional white nationalist imagery and language, along with love for large guns. Using the hashtag #pinetreegang, supporters espouse the benefits of immigration control and share Lorax memes: just like Madison Grant and John Tanton before them, they purport to speak for the trees. “What’s on the rise is white supremacy in general, but this is a pretty staple part of that ideology,” said Beirich. “When people hear [the Nazi nationalist slogan] ‘blood and soil’, they think of the blood, but the soil part mattered.” One of the favored Pine Tree Gang phrases: “Bees, not refugees.” The Sierra Club has backed far away from its xenophobic history, as have other environmental groups, which have since taken a more global perspective on climate crisis and environmental justice. “It’s only now that the environmental movement is less racist than it’s ever been,” said Beirich. “Environmental justice activists forced American environmentalists, most of whom were white and middle and upper class, to really confront this logic,” said Hultgren. “There’s been an ideological shift among mainstream and progressive environmental organizations to really reflect on the relationship between social inequality and environmental degradation.” In 2013, the Sierra Club and the environmental activist group 350.org threw their support behind immigration. Earth First! has gone a step further, calling national borders “scar[s] on the earth”. “The entire earth is a closed system, and the idea that people crossing borders is going to have a major impact on any individual environment is absurd,” said Veery Marten, an Earth First! Journal collective member. “The culprits of this white supremacist violence citing alleged environmental interests are almost always middle class white men who are not lowering their own carbon footprint. It’s not really about consumption, it’s about who’s allowed to consume and gate-keeping these resources.” Environmental activism is still far from fully making amends for its history, though, and indigenous groups and people of color still feel sidelined in the movement. “The environmental movement is increasingly reconciling with what it means to try to protect land on this continent when this land is stolen,” said Marten. Mainstream environmentalists and the broader left may no longer espouse the benefits of limiting immigration, but many do warn of an impending global refugee crisis worsened by climate change that will in turn pressure societies unable or unwilling to grapple with an influx of new residents. In 2018, a World Bank report predicted more than 140 million climate migrants from Latin America, sub-saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be displaced by 2050. Concern for these migrants is often couched in calls for more open borders. But Hartmann warns that proclamations of looming dystopia in the form of a mass climate-caused global refugee crisis put well-intentioned environmentalists on some shared ground with fear-mongering nativists, even as they’re attempting to convey a useful urgency about the future of the planet and the disproportionate impacts of climate crisis on the developing world. “Not to say there won’t be climate-related migration, but I think that portrayal of migrants as climate change refugees, especially these mass movements of people, feeds into the anti-immigrant environmental worldview,” said Hartmann. “Alarmist hyperbole and stereotypes around climate conflict and even climate mass refugee dislocation is based on kind of old, racially and colonially charged stereotypes of poor people of color being more prone to violence in times of scarcity.” A worsening climate crisis could easily become a cudgel for anti-immigration activists looking to use ecological preservation as an excuse to close borders, a means of gesturing toward doing something about climate crisis that aligns with the right’s other political goals. “As it becomes more difficult for Republicans to deny that climate change is a thing, this is a really likely next move for the right in climate politics,” said Hultgren."

"Australia isn’t transitioning away from extracting fossil fuels, it is doubling down on them. That’s right – even though Australia is already the third largest fossil fuel exporter in the world, the federal government still wants to double our coal exports, drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight and open more farmland to fracking. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal. In fact, our share of the world’s traded coal market is bigger than Saudi Arabia’s share of the world oil market. If Australia opened the Adani mine, and all the other mines proposed in Australia, we would indeed double our coal exports. But we would also drive down the world price of coal, drive down production in existing coalmines, and drive up global emissions. It’s not complicated. But while Australia shows no sign of transitioning away from fossil fuels, we have well and truly transitioned away from economics and common sense when it comes to coal.  And in the rush to mine more coal, Australia is transitioning away from its stated foreign policy. Since the second world war, Australia has sought to play a leadership role among the Pacific Island nations. This positioning has provided both a physical buffer to our north and a significant diplomatic platform. But that could all be coming to an end. In 2015 Pacific Island nations issued the Suva Declaration calling on Australia to stop building new coalmines. This request was repeated last month in the Nadi Bay declaration. Yet last week, the Australian prime minister seemed either surprised or enraged that such a request would be included in the Pacific Island Forum declaration in Tuvalu. Adding insult to injury, the deputy prime minister  said he was “annoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector”, even though “many of their workers come here to pick our fruit”. There’s a reason why National party MPs don’t get the trade portfolio any more. To be clear, Pacific leaders have never called on Australia to shut down our coalmines. What they have asked, repeatedly, is for us to please stop building new coalmines at a time when Australia’s emissions, the world’s emissions, and the Pacific Ocean are all rising steadily. But despite years of polite requests the Australian government, and large sections of the Australian media, can’t even be bothered to listen properly to what our neighbours are actually asking for. While our deputy PM skilfully managed to interpret the Pacific’s request to stop opening new coalminers as a demand to shut down our entire resources industry, he was not alone in his wilful deafness. Several journalists confused a call to stop building new coalmines with a demand we shut them all down tomorrow. The Sydney Morning Herald’s editorial informed us: “No doubt Australia will not be able to meet all the islanders’ demands, which include a ban on new coalmines. We cannot close down the thermal coalmining industry overnight.” No doubt at all. After years of ignoring Pacific leaders’ calls to stop expanding our coal production, the Australian political class has now switched from pretending they can’t hear the Pacific to pretending they don’t understand them. No wonder Pacific Island leaders are getting frustrated. While rising coal production and rising sea levels are working against the Pacific Island nations, a seismic shift in global geopolitics are starting to tilt the tables their way. The strategic rivalry between the US and China in the Asia-Pacific region has rattled the defence and foreign policy establishment of Canberra, who now fear an expansionist China. The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper warned of the need to strengthen our relationships with our Pacific neighbours and in 2018 Scott Morrison reversed Tony Abbott’s strategy of aid cuts to the Pacific in announcing his so-called “Pacific Step Up”. Announcing a policy and implementing one are quite different things. As last week’s disastrous trip to Tuvalu shows: when given the choice between promoting the expansion of the coal industry or opposing the expansion of China in the Pacific, the Morrison government will choose coal any day. Iceland is hosting a memorial for one of its lost glaciers, Greenland lost 11bn tonnes of ice in a day and the Arctic Circle hit a new record high of 34.8C. But the Australian government is not only on the wrong side of science, it is now on the wrong side of global diplomacy. Next month, world leaders will gather in New York to discuss the progress or, more precisely, the lack of progress on reducing global emissions. Word on the street is that Scott Morrison will be a no-show, despite being in the United States. Apparently – with Australia’s domestic emissions rising, our determination to use dodgy carbon credits to meet our Paris commitments, and now the open revolt by the Pacific over our plans to build new coalmines – the reception for Australia might be a little too icy for our prime minister. Australia isn’t just the world’s largest coal exporter. We are the world’s largest exporter of LNG, the third largest exporter of fossil fuels and the 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world. We emit more than 40 countries with bigger populations than ours, and our exported emissions add double that again. While Morrison argues that what happens to our coal and gas after we sell it isn’t our problem, that’s not the way the rest of the world sees it. It’s not the way the world sees those countries that export landmines, nuclear weapons technology or endangered species either. Even Morrison knows that the obligations for a country’s actions extend well beyond their borders. That is why he is imposing restrictions on the export of Australian waste, and that’s why he now keeps raising the issue of China funding coal-fired power stations in other countries. But what Morrison does or doesn’t believe is not what matters. What matters are Australia’s actions and how other countries respond. The Pacific Island nations have made clear that they want Australia to stop building new coalmines. They believe we all have a shared obligation to reduce fossil fuel production and consumption. But at the same time Morrison is rebuffing such requests from the Pacific, he is asking them to put their country’s survival aside and work with Australia to secure our own geopolitical and economic interests.

Below is a commentary addressing the YouTube response to the late October Breitbart headline that claimed the 400 papers (now 485) compiled here at NoTricksZone say that “Global Warming Is A Myth“.
While the headline at Breitbart was presumably assembled for the expressed purpose of attracting readership (mission accomplished, if so), it will be explicitly stated here that this compilation certainly does not assert that “Global Warming Is A Myth”.  It isn’t.  Large regions of the Earth have undergone a warming trend in the last century, rising out of the depths of the Little Ice Age.
It is also true that these papers are not claimed to literally “debunk” any positions currently held by those who advocate for the main “consensus” positions related to anthropogenic global warming.   Instead of using such ambitious and affirmative language, the nuanced words used to describe what this list is proposed to accomplish were carefully chosen so as not to assert it does more (or less) than actually claimed.
What the papers and graphs in this compilation actually do is support many of the main skeptical positions which question climate alarm.   Namely, they support the position(s):
N(1) natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined;
N(2) the warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability, as clearly shown in the first 150 graphs (from 2017) in this volume;
N(3) the computer climate models are not reliable or consistently accurate, and projections of future climate states are little more than speculation as the uncertainty and error ranges are enormous in a non-linear climate system; and
N(4) current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).
In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%;
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences;
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough“, which means that “the time for debate has ended“;
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
The 400+ papers compiled so far support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus” A(1)-A(4) positions.  The papers do not do more than that.   Unreasonable expectations that these papers should do more than support skeptical positions and undermine “consensus” positions to “count” are rooted in straw man argumentation.
Specifically, claiming that a scientific paper must assert that CO2 does not play a major role in climate to be characterized as a paper supporting a skeptical positions in N(1)-N(4) is disingenuous at best.   The opposite wouldn’t ever stand, of course.   Let’s say an author of a scientific paper did not explicitly state that she disagrees that natural factors play a significant role in modern climate change.  Would that mean that we could say the paper affirms that climate changes are significantly natural?  Of course not.  And yet this very same non-sequitur is employed here with regularity when disingenuously arguing that these papers do not do what they claim to do – especially since what they are claimed to do has not been accurately characterized.
As an aside, if we were to look at the papers that Cook et al. (2013) used to concoct the 97% “consensus” document we would find that Cook and his colleagues actually classified papers (and magazine articles) about cooking stoves in Brazil, phone surveys, asthma-related ER visits in Montreal, TV coverage . . . as scientific papers “endorsing” the position that all or nearly all of the global warming occurring since 1950 has been human-caused (the “consensus” statement).  Of course, none of the papers identified in the link below that were categorized as “endorsing” the clearly defined anthropogenic/post-1950 “consensus” statement actually used those specific words.   And yet they were curiously counted anyway.

“The Cook et al. (2013) 97% paper included a bunch of psychology studies, marketing papers, and surveys of the general public as scientific endorsement of anthropogenic climate change.”
With that lengthy (but necessary) introduction, I will now take the time to carefully construct a response to the YouTube video critique of the 400+ papers list as authored by potholer54, who I shall hereafter refer to as PH54 for lack of a better title.

1. After having thoroughly criticized James Delingpole’s analysis and style for the first few minutes, PH54 digs in and correctly suggests that the NoTricksZone headline and emboldened first paragraph is more “nuanced” than Breitbart‘s.   He attempts to summarize what the 400+ papers represent by claiming they are meant to cast doubt on the conclusion that CO2 is a major driver of climate change — and no more.  Of course, as described above, there is far more to it than that, but soundbites are to be expected in short videos like this.

2. PH54 then, for reasons that are not clear, returns to using the Breitbart interface instead of using the NoTricksZone article and paper reference lists — which have far more detail and may include graphs that correspond to the paper.   Perhaps the reasons why will become apparent.

3. PH54 spends some time providing visuals of electric heaters warming an indoor room.   CO2 and the Sun are assumed to be just like two equally powerful heaters.   The Sun drives climate when the CO2 is stable, which it was during much of the Holocene.   Low solar activity causes cooling and high solar activity causes warming.   And in modern times, PH54 asserts, the Sun has been “turned down” just as the CO2 heater has been turned up.   So, during the modern era, CO2 drives climate.  The Sun used to drive warming and climate changes, but it no longer does.

4. Li et al. 2017 is the first paper directly discussed.  PH54 identifies what he calls the key words in the paper: Late Holocene.  He writes that the paper only addresses the last 2200 years, and it does not address the impacts of solar activity on modern climate.  He notes that solar forcing is not even mentioned in the title.   (CO2 isn’t either.)
PH54 then starts in on his main theme (as introduced in 2. above).  Yes, the Sun drives climate in the Late Holocene, and not CO2.   How do we know this?   Because CO2 was stable during the last 10,000 years – coasting between 250 ppm and 280 ppm.   So PH54 agrees, apparently, that the cold temperatures occurring during centennial-scale solar minima (Maunder, Dalton) would allow us to conclude that the Sun was a main driver of climate during those periods.  Likewise, the Medieval Maximum, a period of high solar activity, led to warm temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period, or Medieval Climate Anomaly (as it is preferred).

But it’s at that point – the Late Holocene – where the Sun apparently stops driving temperatures.   Why?  Because the CO2 heating machine took over.

5. But let’s get back to the Li et al. (2017) paper.  Now, because PH54 used the Breitbart article for a reference instead of the more detailed NoTricksZone visuals, he apparently missed the graphs shown below that appeared in the paper.  The top graph (red trend line) is a solar activity reconstruction for the last millennium.   Notice the sharp uptick in solar activity during the modern era.  This is referred to as the Modern Grand Maximum, with the levels of solar activity exceeding those occurring the Medieval Warm Period.  Now notice the bottom graph (gold).   It’s a graph of Northern Hemisphere temperatures.   Interestingly, there appears to be a very close correlation between the solar activity and the hemispheric temperature, including during the 20th century, when CO2 is said to have been the temperature driver.

Vieira et al., 2011


6. Another aspect of this Li et al. (2017) paper that was ostensibly missed by PH54 (apparently because he chose to use Breitbart‘s one- or two-sentence summary rather than NoTricksZone’s much more detailed summary complete with graphics) is the commentary about the impact of CO2 forcing relative to solar forcing.  The authors conclude that CO2 may play a role in “partly affecting climate variability” in North China, but that the overall long-term control on temperature is “solar-dominated.”
“High volumes of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 during the recent warming periods, may also play a role in partly affecting the climatic variability in NC, superimposing on the overall solar-dominated long-term control (e.g., Wanner et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2011; Kobashi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015a,b).”

7. The Li et al. (2017) paper also contains a graph of North China that shows the modern temperatures (which have been flat since about 1950) are no warmer now than they were during Medieval times.  And, like the Northern Hemisphere in general, they appear to follow the general pattern of solar activity.  In other words, this paper supports both N(1) and N(2), and it does not support A(1) and A(2).   That’s why it was included on the list.

8.  Then, continuing the Holocene-only theme introduced in 2. and 4. above, PH54 addresses the second paper on the Breitbart list (again ignoring what is shown on NoTricksZone), Yndestad and Solheim (2017) .  He again claims these scientists were only talking about the Holocene in their paper, not the modern period.  He even includes a visual of the abstract with underlined red lines over the years 1000 AD and 1700 AD.  Had PH54 decided to read the rest of the paper – or even look at the NoTricksZone summary – he would have seen that the authors clearly referred to the modern period (multiple times), and they even referenced the coming solar minimum for the coming decades.  They especially made note of the millennial-scale uniqueness of the very high solar activity for the 1940 to 2000 period, referring to it as a rare event with levels exceeding all but the grand maximum events of 4,000 and 8,000 years ago.
“Deterministic models based on the stationary periods confirm the results through a close relation to known long solar minima since 1000 A.D. and suggest a modern maximum period from 1940 to 2015.  Studies that employ cosmogenic isotope data and sunspot data indicate that we are currently leaving a grand activity maximum, which began in approximately 1940 and is now declining (Usoskin et al., 2003; Solanki et al., 2004; Abreu et al., 2008). Because grand maxima  and minima occur on centennial or millennial timescales, they can only be investigated using proxy data, i.e., solar activity reconstructed from 10Be and 14C time-calibrated data. The conclusion is that the activity level of the Modern Maximum (1940–2000) is a relatively rare event, with the previous similarly high levels of solar activity observed 4 and 8 millennia ago (Usoskin et al., 2003).   Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods. Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.”

9.  Here is the solar activity reconstruction featured prominently in the Yndestad and Solheim paper (and in NoTricksZone):

Notice how well solar activity correlates with reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature (Stoffel et al., 2015):


Schneider et al., 2015 also show an oscillation (warming-cooling-warming) in Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the 20th century.

Using 126 tree ring records, Xing et al. (2016) reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperatures that follow trends in solar activity, as shown below.
The Extratropical Northern Hemisphere Temperature Reconstruction during the Last Millennium Based on a Novel Method (Xing et al., 2016)



10. Ignoring the Yndestad and Solheim TSI graph from the paper itself, which alternatively shows a net +3 W m-2 increase in solar forcing between 1900 and 2000, PH54 produced a graph showing declining sunspot numbers that did not appear in the Yndestad and Solheim paper.  Why not use the Yndestad and Solheim reconstruction?  Probably because it showed the opposite of what his graph of declining solar activity showed: That we have experienced a Modern Grand Maximum of solar activity, +3 W m-2 of forcing, since the beginning of the 20th century and continuing on through to about 2000.  It’s rather odd that the author of a video “exposing” that a paper doesn’t say what is claimed would proceed to refuse to actually read the paper itself (that references the modern period), or that he would avoid using the graph that was provided in the paper or by NoTricksZone.   Instead, PH54 chose to comment using a preferred graph of solar activity that supports his own viewpoints…and a summary provided by Breitbart.

11.  PH54 concludes: “[Yndestad and] Solheim doesn’t debunk the theory that CO2 is a major driver of climate.  It’s quite consistent with it.”
This is odd.  The authors don’t comment on CO2 as the “major driver of climate” in their paper.

12.  Then, after commenting on just those two papers (which were selected by James Delingpole), both of which suggest that solar activity has indeed contributed to modern climate in a significant way, PH54 states: “You get the point.  The highlighted papers just looking at past warming…when CO2 levels were stable.”
This is false.  While it’s true that many of the papers on the list do indeed only refer to past climates in asserting that solar activity drove centennial-scale temperature changes, there are also many that refer to the significant influence of solar activity on the modern climate, including the first two discussed by PH54.

13. PH54: “You can check the [Delingpole] list yourself.  It’s not that hard.  All you have to do is look at Delingpole’s summary.”
Delingpole only provided a handful of the examples from the papers.   The full list of 110 solar-influence papers, with more complete summaries and temperature graphs, are found on the NoTricksZone list.   It’s interesting that PH54 accuses Delingpole of not reading the papers himself, or relying on others to do the reading and summarizing for him…and then he goes ahead and relies on Delingpole for summaries of what the papers say.

14. PH54: Delingpole writes “Modern climate in phase with natural variability.  But the two papers he cites are talking about precipitation.”
Interestingly, PH54 has ostensibly decided that precipitation patterns are not sufficient to count as climate.  Apparently climate is about temperature, and temperature only.    Drought periodicity isn’t indicative of climate.   Decadal-scale flood events aren’t about climate.   Variability in the East Asian Monsoon and their connection to ENSO events don’t qualify as climate.   In ice cores, precipitation levels are often used as a proxy for temperature, with warmer/cooler temperatures corresponding to more/less precipitation.  How odd to take this stance.

15. PH54: “Neither paper [chosen by Delingpole] is talking about global temperature.”
Of course these two papers weren’t talking about global temperature.  The two papers selected from the compilation on natural variability were addressing regional rainfall patterns and their robust connections to solar activity.  Nor was it ever claimed that these two papers were talking about global temperature.   According to “consensus” science, though, drought and flood events and precipitation in general are expected to undergo significant shifts…due to changes in CO2 concentrations.
Miralles et al., 2014     “The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify in response to global warming. Yet, little unequivocal evidence of such an acceleration has been found on a global scale.”
These two papers, which do not support the A(2) “consensus” position, instead support the N(2) position that there is nothing unusual about the modern climate (precipitation) relative to past periods, when CO2 concentrations were much lower.

16. PH54: “During a period of La Nina, the Pacific ocean sucks in heat from the atmosphere, and during El Nino, it spits it back out.”
This is actually an incorrect way of putting it.  The heat for ENSO events isn’t sourced by atmospheric heat.  The heat source is from the ocean itself, and the ocean is heated by the Sun.  The atmosphere contains just 1% of the Earth system’s heat.  Therefore, the heat flux sequence is almost always from ocean to atmosphere, and not the other way around.  The heat redistribution during ENSO events are from the deeper waters to the ocean surface and vice versa.

17. PH54: “None of these papers [Delingpole selected] suggest CO2 is not a major driver of global temperature.”
This is the same non-sequitur referred to in the introduction.   Unless a paper expressly states that CO2 is not a major climate driver, it does not count as a paper supporting a skeptical position on climate alarm.  This does not follow.

18. PH54: “Further down the list, the papers get more bizarre.  Papers about bats being harmed by wind turbines and blade disposal.   I’m struggling to see how any of these papers are casting doubt on CO2’s role in global warming.”
The non-sequitur, repeated.   But this comment appears most disingenuous, as PH54 should probably understand that these particular papers addressing the harm to the environment and ineffectiveness of renewables-promoting policies were not selected from the literature to cast doubt on CO2’s role in climate change.   Instead – and one would assume that most readers would understand this – these papers were selected because they support the position that the “consensus”-endorsed response to the perspective that humans are the dominant cause dangerous global warming is to promote  wind and solar energies, and these may not be either effective or environmental friendly.
All PH54 needed to do was look at the introduction to the NoTricksZone article that addressed what these papers were designed to do, or to support.  These papers have nothing to do with CO2’s role in global warming.  They shouldn’t be expected to.
“Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often costly, ineffective, and perhaps even harmful to the environment.  On the other hand, elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).”

19. Addressing the Tejedor et al. (2017) paper, PH54 once again wrongly claims that the paper only addresses the past climate, and makes no reference to the current one.  Had he read the entire paper, or even the summary provided by NoTricksZone, he would (should) have noticed (since it is highlighted in bold red) that the paper does, in fact, mention the  high solar activity of the last few decades.  It also mentions that high solar activity is  associated with periods with high temperatures, such as the warming occurring during 1986-2012.
“Reconstructed long-term temperature variations match reasonably well with solar irradiance changes since warm and cold phases correspond with high and low solar activity, respectively. … The main driver of the large-scale character of the warm and cold episodes may be changes in the solar activity. The beginning of the reconstruction starts with the end of the Spörer minimum. The Maunder minimum, from 1645 to 1715 (Luterbacher et al., 2001) seems to be consistent with a cold period from 1645 to 1706. In addition, the Dalton minimum from 1796 to 1830 is detected for the period 1810 to 1838. However, a considerably cold period from 1778 to 1798 is not in agreement with a decrease in the solar activity. Four warm periods – 1626–1637, 1800–1809, 1845– 1859, and 1986–2012 – have been identified to correspond to increased solar activity.”
Then, after asserting the paper fails to address the modern era, PH54 highlights (using red underlining) the mention of “anthropogenic forces” in the paper.  Curiously, he claims that this particular sentence, as it reads, asserts that CO2 is a “major driver” of climate change.
“The study area [is] a potentially vulnerable region to anthropogenic climatic changes by anthropogenic forces, i.e,., increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.”
But if this one rather mild sentence from the paper supports the position that CO2 is a major driver of climatic changes (and perhaps it does), then surely one can agree that the statement asserting the “main driver” of “warm periods” may be increases in solar activity (and the 1986-2012 period is specifically referred to in the paper as a warm period that “corresponds to increased solar activity”) could also be interpreted as support for the position that the Sun has more than a negligible role in modern temperatures for the region.

20.  The NoTricksZone compilation contains two graphs from the Tejedor et al. (2017) paper, both of which would appear to support the N(1) position that the modern climate has been impacted by the high solar activity (notice how the warming and cooling events match up rather fittingly with solar activity)…

…and that there is nothing unusual or unprecedented about modern temperatures in the Iberian region to suggest that they have fallen outside the range of natural variability, an N(2) position.

21. Interestingly, the Rydval et al. (2017) paper contains several graphs from the Northern Hemisphere, all of which correspond quite well to the changes in solar activity, including the Medieval Maximum and Modern Grand Maximum.   They generally show no net warming since the middle of the 20th century due to a severe cooling period between the 1940s and 1960s (wiping out much of the early 20th century warming), which is consistent with the pattern of solar activity shown earlier.




22. The strongest part of the video response is the section citing 4 or 5 other papers that, in addition to concluding that the Sun plays a role in climate changes, also conclude that CO2 concentrations play an important role too.  Some of the identified papers even say that CO2 plays a larger role than natural factors do.   While this may appear to fully destroy the position that these papers “debunk” global warming as a myth — a claim which has not been made here — these statements still do not seem to assert that the only, 100% cause of climate changes since 1950 is anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  Indeed, even as they claim a significant role for CO2, they do not dismiss natural factors as having any role in climate changes.  This is, after all, the “consensus” position as espoused by the IPCC.   To support the consensus, then, there should be effectively no role for natural factors in climate change after 1950.  Papers that allow natural factors to at least contribute some to the climatic changes would therefore not be supporting the “consensus”.   That is why papers like these may still be included, despite the apparent inconsistency.

23. Williams et al. (2017) assert that temperatures warmed more and warmed faster (1.1°C, 0.008°C per year) from the 1660s to the 1800s — when CO2 did not change — than they did during the 1860 to 2007 period (0.8°C, 0.005°C per year).  This would not be consistent with the perspective that CO2 emissions are a more dominant climate forcing factor than the non-CO2 factors eliciting temperatures changes during the 17th to 19th centuries.   It undermines the A(2) position, and it would be consistent with N(2).  Also, while Williams et al. (2017) do state that global temperatures “are exceeding estimates of natural variability”, this is not remotely the same thing as concluding that natural factors do not play a role in climate changes after 1950.  Indeed, the opposite is said: natural factors are included as factors playing a role in climate changes “for the last 342 years.”
“Reconstructed SSTs significantly warmed 1.1 ± 0.30°C … from 1660s to 1800 (rate of change: 0.008 ± 0.002°C/year), followed by a significant cooling of 0.8 ± 0.04°C …  until 1840 (rate of change: 0.02 ± 0.001°C/year), then a significant warming of 0.8 ± 0.16°C from 1860 until the end of reconstruction in 2007 (rate of change: 0.005 ± 0.001°C/year).”
“[T]hese data suggest a complex combination of solar irradiance, volcanic activity, internal ocean dynamics and external anthropogenic forcing explain the variability in Aleutian SSTs for the past 342 years.”

24.  Zawiska et al. (2017) write that human emissions of CO2 are “considered” to be “the most important factor” in modern climate change.  They do not conclude that CO2 emissions are effectively the only factor.   Furthermore, they conclude that profound temperature changes for the region occurred far more abruptly between 1800 and 1875 than they have since, when the temperature changes have been slower and largely flat for the past 100 years (despite rising CO2 emissions).  The abrupt warming event — 4.3°C within 75 years — for the region was said to be forced by “increased solar activity“ and the NAO.  Again, this would appear to support the significant role of natural factors in climate changes, and less so the anthropogenic influence, thus supporting both N(1) and N(2).   In the graph, notice how closely temperatures correspond to increases and decreases in solar activity.
“The temperature reconstruction from Lake Atnsjøen indicates that recent and ongoing climate warming began already in 1800 CE following the LIA. Temperatures increased very fast, from 8.5 to 12.8 °C during the first 75 years [1800-1875], but in the 20th century the increase became less pronounced.”


25.  Abrantes et al. (2017), refer to the Modern Grand Maximum (1940-2000) of very high solar activity, and, like the other authors above, suggest solar activity is a driver of cooling and warming events.
“The coldest SSTs are detected between 1350 and 1850 CE, on Iberia during the well-known Little Ice Age (LIA) (Bradley and Jones, 1993), with the most intense cooling episodes related with other solar minima events, and major volcanic forcing and separated by intervals of relative warmth (e.g. (Crowley and Unterman, 2013; Solanki et al., 2004; Steinhilber et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2016; Usoskin et al., 2011). During the 20th century, the southern records show unusually large decadal scale SST oscillations in the context of the last 2 millennia, in particular after the mid 1970’s, within the Great Solar Maximum (1940 – 2000 (Usoskin et al., 2011))”
It would not appear that Abrantes et al. (2017) are dismissing solar activity as having any role at all in climate changes, which is what the “consensus” asserts.
Also, this paper provides multiple reconstructions from the region and for the entire Northern Hemisphere that would support N(2), and would not support A(2), as they show that modern temperatures do not fall outside the range of natural variability.   All three graphs below even show a cooling trend beginning in the late 20th century, which would appear to be inconsistent with the perspective that CO2 changes are driving climate synchronously on a global scale.   Most of the modern warming is shown to have occurred during the first half of the 20th century, when CO2 emissions were but a fraction of what they were after 1950.  Again, this would not be consistent with the perspective that CO2 is driving up post-1950 temperatures at an unprecedented rate.


 

26.  Wang et al. (2017) characterize the impact of GHGs on the regional signal for the last 1000 years as a “reasonable speculation”.   “Reasonable speculation” that the millennial-scale changes may have been affected by GHGs would not appear to be a ringing endorsement.  Furthermore, millennial-scale changes would appear to be distinct from the changes after 1950, as human emissions could not have been driving climate on that timescale.    The authors also agree that their findings are consistent with Dr. Scafetta’s work, a scientist who has taken the position that the Sun has played a major role in climate changes, including during the modern era.
“The driving forces of climate change were investigated and the results showed two independent degrees of freedom —a 3.36-year cycle and a 22.6-year cycle, which seem to be connected to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle and the Hale sunspot cycle, respectively. … Solar variability has been shown to be a major driver of climate in central Europe during the past two millennia using Δ14C records. Furthermore, this result is essentially in good agreement with the findings of Scafetta e.g. refs 17, 18, 19, who found that the climate system was mostly characterized by a specific set of oscillations and these oscillations (61, 115, 130 and 983 years) appeared to be synchronous with major astronomical oscillations (solar system, solar activity and long solar/lunar tidal cycles).”
27. Other than natural vs. anthropogenic attribution for warming temperatures, PH54 does not address any of the other positions detailed in the 400+ papers compilation…other than to poke fun at the bat extinction and turbine waste issues.  The papers asserting the inadequacies of the models go unaddressed, as do the papers on the cryosphere, cloud variations and surface solar radiation.  The much higher temperatures and sea levels of years past, when CO2 concentrations were in the “safe” range, would appear to be a topic with some cogency when discussing global-scale warming.   None of the ~140  papers on the 2nd list were even touched on.
Apparently it is believed that all that is needed to “debunk” a compilation such as this is to point out that only a handful of the papers (Smirnov, 2017, Hertzberg et al., 2017, Kramm et al., 2017, Nikolov and Zeller, 2017, Harde, 2017, Lightfoot and Mamer, 2017. Blaauw, 2017,  Allmendinger, 2017, Abbot and Marohasy, 2017 ) explicitly denounce anthropogenic CO2 as a main climate driver.
I disagree…for reasons that are nuanced.

04.11.17 Update 
A Response To potholer54’s Response

A commenter here has brought to my attention that potholer54 (for brevity, I will continue using PH54) has replied to my response to his rather underwhelming YouTube critique of our list of 400+ papers (which will likely reach 500 by year’s end).
Apparently PH54 still is under the impression that he has (a) correctly interpreted what the papers say about CO2 emissions as the main climate driver (even though many don’t even mention CO2 or anthropogenic influences), and (b) he doesn’t have to address what the bulk of the papers and graphs are supporting: that there is nothing unusual or remarkable about modern day climate changes (temperatures, glacier melt, sea level rise, weather events, precipitation patterns, etc.), and thus many of the modeled expectations that indicate there should be a clearly recognizable anthropogenic signal in the above parameters have been thoroughly undermined.   I’ll address both points here.
PH54 writes: “Richards shows quite neatly in his rebuttal that they [the papers] don’t even say what Richards himself claims they say.”
Obvioiusly I will need to again address PH54’s claim that he has correctly interpreted what the papers say.  We’ll start with his claim that Yndestad and Solheim (2017) have only referred to the Holocene in their paper.  (In the video, he underlines in red the years 1000 A.D. and 1700 A.D. found in the abstract so as to support this contention.)  PH54  claims these scientists do not refer to the current era.  To support his claim that Yndestad and Solheim were only referring to the Holocene, PH54 decided to omit or ignore the part of the abstract where it says:
Deterministic models based on the stationary periods confirm the results through a close relation to known long solar minima since 1000 A.D. and suggest a modern maximum period from 1940 to 2015. The model computes a new Dalton-type sunspot minimum from approximately 2025 to 2050 and a new Dalton-type period TSI minimum from approximately 2040 to
2065.
So the authors not only refer to the 20th and 21st century in the paper’s abstract, they forecast a solar minimum and cooler temperatures for the coming decades.   Nowhere in the paper are there references made to CO2 or anthropogenic influences on climate, as PH54 falsely contends.  Furthermore, one of the scientists’ main points is that the very high solar activity that we have enjoyed in recent decades is only now declining.   The Modern Grand Maximum did not begin to decline in the 1950s, as claimed, but only after the year 2000.  In fact, the year 2000 is characterized as the peak of the current grand maximum.
“[T]he activity level of the Modern Maximum (1940–2000) is a relatively rare event, with the previous similarly high levels of solar activity observed 4 and 8 millennia ago (Usoskin et al., 2003). … A cold period was also observed during the time of the Dalton minimum. The Maunder and the Dalton minima are associated with less solar activity and colder climate periods. …  Studies that employ cosmogenic isotope data and sunspot data indicate that we are currently leaving a grand activity maximum, which began in approximately 1940 and is now declining (Usoskin et al., 2003; Solanki et al., 2004; Abreu et al., 2008).  … A visual inspection of the TSI wavelet spectrum reveals the dominant periods in the TSI data series in the time window between 1700 and 2013. The long wavelet period has a maximum in 1760, 1840, 1930, and 2000, with a mean gap of approximately 80 years”
Not only this, but contrary to PH54’s claims that Yndestad and Solheim do not connect solar activity to modern-day temperatures, these scientists indicate that the Hoyt-Schatten/Scafetta-Wilson TSI reconstruction shows  a “strong correlation“ with Northern Hemisphere temperatures extending from 1880 to 2013, citing the work of Soon et al. (2015) in affirming a “a strong solar influence on the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere“.
“Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods. Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.  … The Hoyt-Schatten irradiance model has been calibrated and extended with the newest version of ACRIM TSI observations (e.g. Scafetta and Willson, 2014, Fig. 16); it is employed in this analysis. In the following section, this reconstruction is referred to as TSI HS. A mostly rural Northern Hemisphere composite temperature series 1880–2013 shows strong correlation with the TSI-HS reconstruction, which indicates a strong solar influence on the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere (Soon et al., 2015).”

It should be noted that Soon et al. (2015) found a very strong correlation between solar activity and Northern Hemisphere rural temperatures since 1880 – as the rural instrumental data are less affected by artificial or non-climatic warming.
“Finally, we compare our new composite to one of the solar variability datasets not considered by the CMIP5 climate models, i.e., Scafetta & Willson, 2014’s update to the Hoyt & Schatten, 1993 dataset. A strong correlation is found between these two datasets, implying that solar variability has been the dominant influence on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since at least 1881.”


PH54 writes:
“The first paper Richards cites in his rebuttal – a paper by Li et al. – is itself a good example of this.  Citing that paper, Richards concludes: “There appears to be a very close correlation between the solar activity and the hemispheric temperature, including during the 20th century, when CO2 is said to have been the temperature driver.  “There APPEARS to be” means this is what Richards thinks – it is not the conclusion of the paper.”

PH54 also once again claims that Li et al. (2017) support his claim that CO2 emissions from humans are what have driven temperature increases for the region since about 1950, and that solar activity has not driven the temperature increase.  But, as mentioned above, the authors cite a graph of temperatures for North China that, yet again, does not show any net warming since about 1940.   While this is somewhat problematic in supporting the contention that CO2 has driven the warming trend there, the authors also point out that the increase in greenhouse gases may “partly” play a role in the variability during “the recent warming periods”, but that partial role in influencing variability is only superimposed on the solar-dominated control.   Once again, this would not appear to support PH54’s claim that Li et al. (2017) endorse the position that CO2 increases are the main, close-to-100% control on temperature changes for the region during the “recent warming periods”.
“[H]igh volumes of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 during the recent warming periods, may also play a role in partly affecting the climatic variability in NC, superimposing on the overall solar-dominated long-term control (e.g., Wanner et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2011; Kobashi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015a,b).”
“[T]he 103, 50, and 22 year periods for TANN [annual temperatures] correlate well with the 100, 50, 23 and 22 year cycles for the solar activity observed in various solar parameters (e.g., Wilson et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996; Chowdhury et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014), therefore implying an in-phase relationship between the climatic oscillation in NC [North China] and solar activity.”

PH54: “The reason Richards got it wrong is that he was trying to discern solar fluctuations over the last 50 years in a graph that spans 1,000 years, so the curves over that narrow period are very small and indistinct. Perhaps Richards wasn’t wearing his glasses.”
As shown in the initial response above, several other reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature show strong consistencies with trends in solar activity.  The above criticism assessing an inability to discern solar fluctuations would not appear to be valid here.

Stoffel et al., 2015


Christiansen and Lungqvist (2012)


But these graphs, and the main problem with PH54’s analysis in general, is that he thinks that by directly referencing a grand total of 9 papers in his video, he has comprehensively assessed and correctly interpreted the entire volume of 400+ papers accurately, and that they all affirm his presuppositions that in about 1950 CO2 emissions became the dominant cause of climate change, and the natural factors that used to be the dominant causes of climate change figuratively took a backseat.  That’s why he curiously writes, without obviously having even read even close to “many” of these papers, that:
PH54: “Many of the 400 papers explicitly ENDORSE the conclusion that CO2 is a powerful greenhoue gas.”   
Of course, this claim is an assumption, not rooted in actual analysis of the 400+ papers.  It’s also an example of how the definition of what is necessary to affirm an endorsement of the “consensus” changes mercurially to fit the presupposition.  Now all that’s needed to affirm that these papers are invalid as evidence supporting a skeptical position on climate alarm is that an author need only write (explicitly) that CO2 is a “powerful greenhouse gas.”   PH54 claims that there are “many” such papers here…after having “analyzed” about 9 of them.  Of course, whether or not CO2 is a “powerful greenhouse gas” — interestingly, water vapor is also a “powerful greenhouse gas” — is not even the question being affirmed or questioned here.  It’s just moving the pea.

The question is this: To what extent, or how much, are trends in weather extremes, surface temperatures, ocean heat content, glacier melt, sea level rise, floods, droughts, etc., influenced by parts per million (0.000001) changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and human emissions vs. the extent to which identifiable trends vary naturally, or without anthropogenic influence?
The “consensus” position, as endorsed by the IPCC, is that close to 100% of the climate change that has occurred since 1950 is human caused.
If that’s the case, then human-caused climate change doesn’t look much different than the one produced by natural variations.  The changes in modern climate indices are so negligible, so trivial, that finding an anthropogenic signal amid the noise of natural variability is quite difficult.   That’s what most of these papers say.  And that’s exactly what PH54 writes nothing about in his “critique” of our list.
And yet PH54 apparently thinks that all he must do is claim that “many” of the papers support (actually, “explicitly ENDORSE”) the position that CO2 is a “powerful greenhouse gas”, and, just like that, the 400+ papers will . . . go away.
No, that’s just not how it works.
The following are just a tiny fraction of the papers from 2017 supporting a skeptical position on climate alarm . . . that PH54 never even bothered to read.

350 Non-Hockey Stick Graphs, With The First ~120 From 2017
• There has been no detectable long-term acceleration in sea level rise (Parker and Ollier, 2017), and sea levels may only be rising between 0.25 and 1.04 mm/year.
“[L]ocal sea-level forecasts should be based on proven local sea-level data. Their naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys showed ‘‘relative’’ trends of about + 1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). By only considering the 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording, the average trend was only + 0.25 mm/year [2.5 centimeters per century].”
“….does not support the notion of rapidly changing mass of ice in Greenland and Antarctica“
“loud divergence between sea level reality” and “the climate models [that] predict an accelerated sea-level rise driven by the anthropogenic CO2 emission.”

• The melting of the Greenland ice sheet that could possibly be attributed to humans is still “too small to be detected”. (Haine, 2016, Orsi et al., 2017)
“Notably, the three studies [Jackson et al., 2016;  Böning et al., 2016; Robson et al., 2016] report an absence of anthropogenic effects on the AMOC, at least so far: the directly observed AMOC weakening since 2004 is not consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosols have affected North Atlantic ocean temperatures. The midlatitude North Atlantic temperature changes since 2005 have greater magnitude and opposite sign (cooling) than those attributed to ocean uptake of anthropogenic heat. The anthropogenic melt from the Greenland ice sheet is still too small to be detected.
“The recent warming trend in North Greenland  … We find that δ 18O [temperature/climate proxy] has been increasing over the past 30 years, and that the decade 1996-2005 is the second highest decade in the 287-year record. The highest δ 18O [temperature/climate proxy] values were found in 1928, which is also an extreme year in GISP2 and NGRIP ice cores, and in a coastal South Greenland composite (Vinther et al., 2006; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2015), but the decadal average (1926-1935) is not statistically different from the decade (2002-2011). … The surface warming trend has been principally attributed to sea ice retreat and associated heat fluxes from theocean (Serreze et al., 2009; Screen and Simmonds, 2010a, b), to a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) since 1990, increasing warm air advection on the West Coast of Greenland and Eastern Canada (Hanna et al., 2012; Fettweis et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014), and to an increase in the Greenland Blocking Index [Hanna et al., 2013]. These latter mechanisms could be dominated by natural variability rather than forced response to the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases (Fettweis et al., 2013; Screen et al., 2014).”
• The Greenland ice sheet (GIS) has been melting so slowly and so negligibly in recent decades that the entire ice sheet’s total contribution to global sea level rise was a mere 0.39 of a centimeter (0.17 to 0.61 cm) between 1993 and 2010 (Leeson et al, 2017).
• The Western Antarctic Peninsula has been rapidly cooling since 1999 (-0.47°C per decade), reversing the previous warming trend and leading to “a shift to surface mass gains of the peripheral glacier” (Oliva et al., 2017).
• Since 1800, the Surface Mass Balance for the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet has increased.  (Thomas et al., 2017).
“Our study suggests an overall increase in SMB [surface mass balance] across the grounded Antarctic ice sheet of ~ 44 GT since 1800 AD, with the largest (area-weighted) contribution from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP).”
• There has been no continent-scale warming trend for Antarctica since CO2 emissions began rising. (Stenni et al., 2017)
“[N]o continent-scale warming of Antarctic temperature is evident in the last century.”

• According to Fettweis et al. (2017), the Greenland ice sheet contributed a grand total of 1.5 centimeters of sea level rise between the years 1900 and 2010, with most of that contribution coming prior to 1940 (since there was no contribution at all between 1940 and 2000). The ice sheet gained mass between 1961 and 1990, or during the same period of time that CO2 emissions were skyrocketing.
“The period 1961–1990 has been considered as a period when the total mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet was stable (Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006) and near zero. However, at the last century scale, all MAR reconstructions suggest that SMB [surface mass balance] was particularly positive during this period [1961-1990] (SMB was most positive from the 1970s to the middle of the 1990s), suggesting that mass gain may well have occurred during this period, in agreement with results from Colgan et al. (2015). … Finally, with respect to the 1961–1990 period, the integrated contribution of the GrIS SMB anomalies over 1900–2010 is a sea level rise of about 15 ± 5 mm [1.5 cm], with a null contribution from the 1940s to the 2000s”
• Greenland is currently about 3 degrees C colder than it was just a few thousand years ago (Kobashi et al., 2017).

“Greenland temperature reached the Holocene thermal maximum with the warmest decades occurring during the Holocene (2.9 ± 1.4 °C warmer than the recent decades [1988-2015]) at 7960 ± 30 years B.P.”
• The Greenland ice sheet has been cooling (slightly) since 2005 (Kobashi et al., 2017).

“For the most recent 10 years (2005 to 2015), apart from the anomalously warm year of 2010, mean annual temperatures at the Summit exhibit a slightly decreasing trend in accordance with northern North Atlantic-wide cooling.”
• The Southern Ocean has been cooling since 1979 (Turney et al., 2017, Kusahara et al., 2017).
“Occupying about 14% of the world’s surface, the Southern Ocean plays a fundamental role in ocean and atmosphere circulation, carbon cycling and Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics. … As a result of anomalies in the overlying wind, the surrounding waters are strongly influenced by variations in northward Ekman transport of cold fresh subantarctic surface water and anomalous fluxes of sensible and latent heat at the atmosphere–ocean interface. This has produced a cooling trend since 1979.”

“Concomitant with this positive trend in Antarctic sea ice, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the Southern Ocean south of approximately 45°S have cooled over this period [since 1979].”
• Sea ice for the entire Southern Hemisphere has been growing, defying climate models (Comiso et al., 2017).
“The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing contrary to expected trends due to global warming and results from coupled climate models.”

• Sea ice for the Northern Hemisphere has undergone an oscillation in the last 80 years, consistent with temperature trends for all of the Arctic (Connolly et al., 2017, Hanhijärvi et al., 2013).
“According to this new dataset, the recent period of Arctic sea ice retreat since the 1970s followed a period of sea ice growth after the mid 1940s, which in turn followed a period of sea ice retreat after the 1910s. Our reconstructions agree with previous studies that have noted a general decrease in Arctic sea ice extent (for all four seasons) since the start of the satellite era (1979). However, the timing of the start of the satellite era is unfortunate in that it coincided with the end of several decades during which Arctic sea ice extent was generally increasing. This late-1970s reversal in sea ice trends was not captured by the hindcasts of the recent CMIP5 climate models used for the latest IPCC reports, which suggests that current climate models are still quite poor at modelling past sea ice trends.”

•The North Atlantic has been rapidly cooling since 2005 (Piecuch et al., 2017)
“The subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) is subject to strong decadal variability, with implications for surface climate and its predictability. In 2004–2005, SPNA decadal upper ocean and sea-surface temperature trends reversed from warming during 1994–2004 to cooling over 2005–2015.”

"Boris Johnson’s partner Carrie Symonds said politicians had a “gigantic responsibility to make the right decisions” over the climate crisis, in her first solo public appearance since moving into Downing Street. Symonds also condemned “cruel” trophy hunters, but expressed optimism that the number of people who cared about the environment “far outnumber the people who don’t”.  She addressed an audience in a marquee at Birdfair, which is described as “birdwatching’s Glastonbury”, at Rutland Water nature reserve. “There are no simple answers to the environmental crisis this planet faces,” she said. “It is immensely complicated. There is no escaping the fact that politicians, business leaders and journalists have a gigantic responsibility to make the right decisions, to change the way they do business and report the truth about what is happening in the world. But so too do scientists, naturalists, campaigners, birdwatchers and all of us individuals. We all share this crowded little planet.” She said everyone had a role to play. “I’m far from perfect, but I try to remember to take a canvas bag to the supermarket, take my reusable bottle rather than buy plastic, and tonight I’m wearing a sustainable dress,” she said. “I can’t always do that, and I’m learning and I’m trying.” She described her delight at seeing a puffin at Bempton Cliffs in the East Riding of Yorkshire, then her horror at seeing photographs in a newspaper of puffins “slaughtered by so-called trophy hunters on trips to Iceland”. She said: “A trophy is meant to be a prize. Something you’re awarded if you’ve achieved something of merit that requires great skill and talent. Trophy hunting is the opposite of that. It is cruel, it is sick, it is cowardly.” After her speech, she took a seat in the front row for a question and answer session, which featured guests including BBC presenter Chris Packham and the entrepreneur Deborah Meaden, of BBC Two’s Dragons’ Den. Tim Appleton, the founder of the birdwatching conference, said before the event: “We’re absolutely over the moon that Carrie is supporting us and we hope she will continue supporting us and conservation for many years to come.” Symonds, 31, who resigned as director of communications for the Conservatives last year, is now a senior adviser at Oceana, a US-based environmental campaign group, working with its marketing operation in London. A profile on the charity’s site describes her as being “passionate about protecting the oceans and marine life”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the pressure mounts in Europe to ditch diesel-engine-powered cars and switch over to electric vehicles, a number of experts advise some sobriety before taking the great big green leap.
“Serious mistake”
According to the online German business weekly Wirthschaftswoche (WIWO) here, the CEO of Sixt car rental company, one of the largest in Europe, recently said he doesn’t believe in electric cars and that “it is a serious mistake politically.”
One main obstacle, Erich Sixt told in an telephone interview with with WIWO, is the supply of raw materials needed to manufacture car batteries, noting that the cobalt supply is mostly in the hands of China.
“Devour money”
CEO Sixt also mentioned other obstacles, among them the needed infrastructure to recharge the vehicles, which he says “would devour a lot of money”.
Scant demand
He also told WIWO that the range for electric cars was “a catastrophe”, adding that customers rarely ask for e-cars and that those who do, do so out of curiosity. Often things go awry for the those renting the cars:
Some call the rental outlet for help because they end up getting stuck on the autobahn after Garmisch-Partenkirchen.”

Thing of the rich
Sixt also says electric vehicles are a thing for the rich, who use them as a way to make themselves feel better. Sixt does, however, say there are some practical applications, such as renting them on small islands where range is not important.
He also told WIWO he would gladly take more into his fleet if demand warranted it.
ICE cars unbeatable in terms of reliability
WIWO summarizes Germany’s largest car rental CEO’s view of electric cars by reporting that overall he “doesn’t think much” of electric cars. The car and transportation expert obviously thinks that internal combustion engine (ICE) cars are still far superior.
When in the business of renting cars and making sure customers can reliably and safely get from point A to point B, or Z, the ICE cars are the way to go.
Germany in fact doing very little
Though German political leaders often talk big about electric mobility, so far very little has happened to make it a reality. All the talk about e-mobility has been lip service.
Electric vehicles are still more a green dream than they are reality. They’re great in the fantasy world, but in reality they are still a nightmare.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecent SRF German public broadcasting commentary on climate change has reached a new low in quality and new high in activism, two respected German scientists say. 
=============================================
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
“Climate-alarm propaganda day”
November 29, 2017, was once again a climate alarm propaganda day in the German public television and radio stations of SRF (Süddeutsche Rundfunk). But it was even more shocking to see the primitive level of argumentation used there to fan fear among the public. For example this video clip here, designed to refute climate skeptics, unfortunately in fact represents an intellectually subterannean SRF alarmism theater, which uses arguments as a “hammer against skeptics”.
1) Shrinking mountain glaciers
Bingo. Yet no one is challenging that it has been getting warmer since the end of the Little Ice Age beginning in 1850. But why was nothing said about how the melting glaciers of today are uncovering tree trunks from even warmer periods of the Holocene and that as a result the glaciers back then were at much higher elevations and smaller in size than they are today?
2) Climate change was not invented by the Chinese
OMG! – just recently – and was that meant for real?
3) There has been no climate change pause
However the diagram ends at the peak of the last El Nino of 2016. The decrease in temperature since then and the term El Nino are not mentioned at all in the explanation.
4) The polar bears are doing just fine
…but they are really not doing okay because of the supposedly melting ice. The chart shown interestingly looks only at a few areas where the numbers are expected to fall, and ignores the fact that the populations have developed normally or well over the recent years, despite the reduced ice coverage.
5) Skeptical scientists are only 12% environmental scientists
…who according to the SRF are the only ones who should speak up publicly on the matter, and only 0.1% are climate scientists. More than 90% however are convinced climate alarmists. Missing here is only the famous 97% from Cook et al. Here we suspect that the word got around even at SRF studios that the magical 97 percent figure is a merely senseless bogus number…
The manipulative character of the agitation is demonstrated by the fact that the most important arguments held by climate skeptics find no mention whatsoever, for example the fluctuating long-term solar activity in combination with the amplification mechansim as to Svensmark, the oscillating ocean currents on decadal scales , the obviously hyped CO2 climate sensitivity in the IPCC models, the refuted water vapor feedback and – last but not least – the inability by the CO2 alarmists to successfully model the strong natural variations of the Holocene climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Die Welt here reports that storm “Herwart” which swept across Germany late last month – with wind gusts of up to 140 kilometers per hour  – led to a wholesale electricity “price collapse” and thus “exposed the madness of the Energiewende“.
“Negative prices”
As storm Herwart waged, wind parks across Germany over-flooded electricity grids with power that was not needed, and thus forced electricity prices on the exchange to go deep into negative levels within just minutes. In a nutshell: grid operators were forced to pay to get rid of the surplus power. But that payment won’t go to consumers, as Die Welt writes:
The consumers get no benefit from this. For them it will even be more expensive.”
This is because as grid operators are forced to pay large buyers to accept the power that no one needs or wants, they will incur added costs, which of course will be passed on to the regular German consumers. Germans are already saddled with almost the highest rates in the world. This is despite the preposterous comments made by some media outlets suggesting that German consumers could even get paid for the disposal of waste power.
Market forces disabled
Die Welt presents a chart depicting wholesale power prices. It shows the price falling to -52.11 euros per megawatt hour. Moreover, the chart shows that these extreme negative prices have become more frequent over the past 18 months. Die Welt comments:
‘Herwart’ shows in a sobering manner the astounding design deficiency of the German Energiewende [transition to green energies]. “
Die Welt blames Germany’s Energiewende and the green energy feed-in act, which “systematically disable market forces”.

On another note, the Kiel, German-based Kieler Nachrichten (KN) reports “thousands of wind turbines will be supposedly dismantled over the coming decade because the state subsidies will run out“. “And according to the Berlin-based specialty company Energy Brainpool, these turbines will not be replaced if energy prices do not increase.
Subsidies running out
Economists of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research also expect a decommissioning of a considerable number of older turbines. The 2020s could be a decade where Germany may start to see the end of the wind energy madness. It all depends on the price of electricity in beginning in 2021. Wind turbines originally were guaranteed fixed feed-in rates for a period of 20 years. Now that these early systems are approaching that lifetime and the feed-in tariffs expire, it is questionable that they will continue to operate.
Too expensive to keep in operation

Many old turbines are likely to be put out of commission because they require greats amounts of costly maintenance and repairs, and so likely will not be profitable to operate. The KN writes:

The current wholesale electricity price of 3 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour will not be enough to keep the turbines in operation…”.

The KN cites the Bundesverband Windenergie (German Association for Wind Energy) which estimates that some 14,000 MW of installed capacity face being shut down by 2023. “That would be more than a quarter of the currently installed onshore wind energy capacity getting removed.”
A monument to an industrial folly
The question that remains is what will happen to these thousands of shut down turbines. Will they be abandoned and thus leave the country’s idyllic landscape a mass junkyard – a monument to one of the greatest industrial follies man has ever witnessed?

"One of the classic storylines of science fiction is the emergence of a mutant child, with powers far beyond those of adults and no understanding of their use. The theme is carried to its the extreme in Jerome Bixby’s story It’s a Good Life, where the omnipotent mutant is a toddler with no grasp of consequences. With Donald Trump in the White House, the whole world can get a taste of this capricious blundering. That he speculated about buying Greenland is not in itself remarkable: a very large and strategically important island with reserves of valuable minerals is the kind of place in which all great powers will take an interest. As far back as 1946, President Truman offered war-ravaged Denmark a sum in gold equivalent to a billion of today’s dollars for the island – and was promptly rebuffed. Truman did, however, secure an airbase at Thule, which is important to this day for the missile defence systems of the US. He did not, as Mr Trump has done, cancel a visit to Denmark in a fit of pique. That, as the Swedish former prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted, was “well beyond the absurd: Trump [has made] a state visit to a long standing ally dependent on that country being ready to give up parts of its territory.” Mr Truman, and all the presidents who followed him until 2016, understood that nations other than the US had their own pride and even their own sovereignty. Mr Trump combines a belief that everything ought to be for sale to him with an inability to understand what it might be worth to anyone else. That helps to explain his numerous bankruptcies and later failures as a diplomat. If the problem with his desire for Greenland were simply his childish greed and lack of self-restraint, that would be serious enough. The watching world has by now factored his personality into its assessments of US foreign policy. What is of lasting concern is the more widely spread attitude to the world’s problems that makes the purchase of Greenland look like a clever idea to anyone in the face of climate change. Greenland is important to the whole world, not just the superpowers, at the moment. This is because its ice sheet, miles thick in parts, is melting at historically unprecedented rates. That’s one of the central mechanisms of our climate crisis, and all that some Republicans can see is that this might expose still more reserves of fossil fuel to burn, and so to accelerate the catastrophe. Mike Pompeo, Mr Trump’s secretary of state, said earlier this year that “The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance ... it houses 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil, 30% of its undiscovered gas, an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped resources.” This is an attitude even more reckless and shortsighted than establishing nuclear bases around the world. Although a nuclear war would wipe out civilisation, there was a logic to nuclear deterrence, which could be argued to have made such a war less likely overall. There is no logic but a toddler’s greed to the unbridled consumption of the Earth’s resources. As the seriousness of the climate crisis becomes more and more obvious, so does the fact that it can only be solved by coordinated international action, while competing nationalisms can only exacerbate it and make the easily foreseeable end worse for all the competitors. A rules-based international order is the counsel of enlightened self-interest, not idealism. But today the most powerful nation on earth is in the hands of a man who can recognise neither his own nor anyone else’s legitimate self-interest."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGrowing sea ice
Despite all the alarmist claims of an Antarctic meltdown, it is well known that the trend for sea ice extent at the South Pole has been one of growing ice rather than shrinking ice over the past 4 decades.

Naturally many factors influence polar sea ice extent, such as weather patterns, winds, ocean currents and sea surface temperature cycles. One factor of course is also surface air temperature, which according to global warming theorists is rising globally.
Cooling at Showa station
Yet data show the warmer surface temperatures are refusing to happen in Antarctica! As you will read below, it was far warmer 100 years ago.
First we begin with the example of Showa Station, Antarctica, where it is cooling slightly even as CO2 levels have risen rapidly, Japanese climate blogger Kirye tweeted here, citing the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA):

Showa Antarctic station has seen slight cooling over the 30 years. Data source: JMA
No trend at Davis Antarctic station
In reply to Kirye, AndyOz tweeted that there also has been no warming at Australia’s Davis station over the past 50 years:

Chart: Bureau of Meteorology, Commonwealth of Australia.

Showa and Davis, however, are just two stations at the edge of a vast continent. We certainly don’t want to be cherry-picking.
Climate Trends site here looked at 13 stations across Antarctica that go back some 50 years or more: The site concludes: “that apart from at the three stations located on the Antarctic Peninsula, none of the records at the other ten stations show any consistent trend to either increase or decrease significantly over the past 50 years”.
Climate Trends notes that three stations located on the Antarctic Peninsula have increasing temperatures over the past 60-70 years and that it’s possible they are affected by changing wind patterns, ocean currents or volcanic activity.
South Pole contradicting global warming
The question remains: What’s happening to the temperature of the entire south pole, other than sea ice trending upwards? Last year Kenneth Richard posted here on this, presenting recent literature by Stenni et al which shows that the South Pole is indeed cooling:

Antarctica was much warmer 100 years ago
Kenneth also uncovered a recent publication (Fogt et al 2017), which wrote that measured Antarctic temperatures during exploratory expeditions in 1911 and 1912 were “much warmer” than they have been at any time since 1957. Kenneth added:
In fact, there have ‘never’ been temperatures exceeding the early 20th century warmth of the recorded South Pole daily mean temperatures in the last 60 years.”
Kenneth also noted that the 1911/12 temperature anomalies reached “greater than 10°C”.
Imagine the media hysteria if such warmth happened today. The many climate neurotics out there would be shrieking, demanding a state of emergency.

"Scott Morrison has said the radio presenter Alan Jones was “way out of line” for saying the Australian prime minister should “shove a sock down the throat” of his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern. Speaking after a 12-hour meeting with other leaders of Pacific countries in Tuvalu on Thursday, Morrison said: “The comment has been relayed to me; on what’s been reported to me, I find that very disappointing and of course that’s way out of line. “I have two daughters, so you can expect that’s how I would feel personally about it. I’ll leave others to explain what they’ve said and how they’ve said it,” said Morrison. The radio host – who previously said Julia Gillard should be put in a “chaff bag” and thrown in the sea – said Ardern was “a complete clown” and “a joke” and too outspoken about the climate crisis. Jones later sought to back away from the comments, saying critics had “wilfully misinterpreted” him and he actually meant Ardern should shove her own sock down her own throat. Morrison and Ardern are among the leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu, where nations have urged Australia to commit to reducing emissions. Ardern said on Wednesday that Australia “has to answer to the Pacific” and said New Zealand would “do our bit”. Morrison thanked Ardern for her work in discussions with Pacific leaders and said that while people don’t always have to agree, “we’ve got to learn to disagree better and show respect to one another”. “Here she is preaching on global warming and saying that we’ve got to do something about climate change,” Jones said on radio station 2GB. “I just wonder whether Scott Morrison is going to be fully briefed to shove a sock down her throat.” Both Australia’s former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who is in Tuvalu for the forum and a leading global figure on climate change, condemned Jones’s comments. Easy to tell someone to shove a sock down a throat when you’re sitting in the comfort of a studio. The people of the Pacific, forced to abandon their homes due to climate change, don’t have that luxury. Try saying it to a Tuvaluan child pleading for help. https://t.co/opU9mb50Qi “Easy to tell someone to shove a sock down a throat when you’re sitting in the comfort of a studio,” he tweeted, adding: “The people of the Pacific, forced to abandon their homes due to climate change, don’t have that luxury.” Turnbull joined Bainimarama, calling for Jones to apologise to Ardern “for his latest misogynistic rant”. “When I announced Australia’s Pacific Step Up in 2016 climate action was a key priority. It may be political to some, but it’s existential in the Pacific,” he said. The CEO of anti-domestic violence body Our Watch, Patty Kinnersly, said the “verbal threat of violence” was very concerning. “Research shows disrespect for women, including sexist comments, is one of the drivers of violence against them. “Journalists and commentators are very influential: their words have impact and we encourage responsible reporting. Ultimately, we want everyone to understand the power of words and that disrespect or threats create an environment where violence against women is seen as acceptable or can be justified.” “You can disagree with someone without wanting to silence them,” Kinnersly said. Speaking to the New Daily on Thursday evening, Jones accused his detractors of “wilful misinterpretation”. “Of course what I meant to say was that Scott Morrison should tell Ms Ardern to ‘put a sock in it’,” Jones said. “There are many people who would relish the opportunity to misinterpret things that I have said as we have seen online this afternoon. Of course I would not wish any harm to Jacinda Ardern.” He did not apologise. In his morning original comments, Jones claimed that New Zealand’s per capita carbon dioxide emissions had grown more than Australia’s – but also told listeners there was “nothing wrong with” carbon dioxide. “If you want to talk about carbon dioxide, which I don’t – nothing wrong with it – the fact is New Zealand’s carbon dioxide has grown by 10.8% per capita since 1990. Ours has grown by 1.8%.” Well said Frank. Jones should also apologise to @jacindaardern for his latest misogynistic rant. When I announced Australia’s Pacific Step Up in 2016 climate action was a key priority. It may be political to some, but it’s existential in the Pacific. https://t.co/f3OGxvp01N In his later attempt to excuse his comments, Jones maintained his stance. “This wilful misinterpretation distracts from my point that she was wrong about climate change and wrong about Australia’s contribution to carbon dioxide levels,” he said. Nearly all the data Jones had cited is incorrect or misleading. New Zealand generated 82% of its electricity from renewable sources, mainly geothermal and hydro, in 2017. Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of global emissions, New Zealand 0.17%. According to data lodged with the United Nations, Australia’s annual emissions fell 9.3% between 1990 and 2015 if land-clearing is counted, reflecting that 1990 was a big year for land-clearing in Queensland. If land use is excluded, Australia’s emissions rose 27.3% over that time. I’m guessing Alan Jones will think it’s ‘just a joke’, but this language normalises violence against women.A woman was killed *two* days ago. https://t.co/q1WWWaGkI1 New Zealand’s emissions rose 63.6% over that timeframe if land use is included, in part because it has increased harvesting of forest plantations. Take out land use and its emissions are up 24.1%. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said New Zealand’s emissions had levelled off in recent years and Ardern had introduced legislation setting a target of net zero emissions by 2050. Australia’s emissions have increased for five years straight and it has no long-term emissions goal. Baxter said Jones’s claims were “very misguided”. On Thursday afternoon, the broadcasting regulator Acma said it had not yet received any complaints about Jones’s comments. In 2012, the broadcaster was roundly criticised for saying that then-prime minister Julia Gillard should be “shoved in a chaff bag”. “The woman’s off her tree and quite frankly they should shove her and Bob Brown in a chaff bag and take them as far out to sea as they can and tell them to swim home,” he said at the time. He later apologised, saying it was “better left unsaid” and “too clever by half”. In the same year he said Gillard’s father had died “of shame” because she “told lies every time she stood for parliament”. Acma found then that Jones had not breached guidelines, and had not incited violence or hatred based on gender. Jones has also said the same of other politicians such as the Sydney mayor Clover Moore, Kevin Rudd, Wayne Swan and Barack Obama. In 2018 Acma found Jones had breached “generally accepted standards of decency” for using a racist term in relation to the government minister Mathias Cormann. And in 2007, the watchdog found he encouraged violence and vilified people of Lebanese and Middle Eastern backgrounds in comments made before the Cronulla riots in 2005."
"On a sweltering summer day in Washington, DC, Judy Williams pulls up to a homeless day center to fill her van with bottled water. The homeless outreach coordinatoris headed to the spots where she knows she’ll find people who are living outside. “I’ll make sure they’re not lying down on the ground, and tap their feet for a response,” Williams said. Inside the center, a few dozen people hide from the heat in a windowless room with cafeteria-style tables and loud televisions. Two nearby men’s shelters are also open around-the-clock instead of just at night because of a city-wide heat alert. There’s free lunch, as well as computers for job searching, laundry machines and showers – but managers say people also visit just to get out of the sun. The center is in the middle of warehouses and near a highway, and all the concrete radiates heat. Matthew King, a 44-year-old who works in a tire shop but is between homes, said he visits regularly, “especially when it’s hot.” Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. This year saw the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time.  This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities.  Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US “This is the hottest I’ve ever seen in July,” said King at the center, which is just a few miles from the White House rose garden where President Trump said in 2017 that the US will leave the Paris climate change accord. Residents of the US capital are regularly baked in heatwaves and endure stiflingly thick humidit. But much like many cities around the world, Washington DC is being slowly cooked by the human-driven climate crisis to the extent its entire character will be transformed. By 2080, researchers recently found, Washington DC’s climate will resemble what northern Mississippi or Dallas is like currently. Unless drastic action is taken to slash greenhouse gases, global heating will transform the climates of almost every community in the US by the time today’s children are entering retirement. Outdoors in Philadelphia will feel more like Memphis; New York City is set to morph into northeastern Arkansas; Houston and Miami have no US comparison, leaping instead deep into climates currently found in Mexico. “Every city gets warmer, none get cooler,” said Matt Fitzpatrick, a University of Maryland academic who formulated the climate projections for US cities, based on a range of heat and rainfall scenarios. In the lifetime of children today, a lot of these cities are going to be dramatically transformed Its research shows how 540 North American urban areas will by 2080 become, on average, “most like the contemporary climate of locations about 500 miles (805kms) away and mainly to the south.” The average temperature in US cities will rise by a blistering 9F (5C) by the end of the century, compared to the period of 1960-1990, if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t curbed. Some cities will be outliers – Fairbanks, Alaska, for example, is in danger of heating up by a sweltering 11.8F (6.6C). “Cities have built infrastructure for a climate that will no longer be there,” Fitzpatrick said. “They will have to live with more heat and, if they are on the coast, flooding too. In the lifetime of children today, a lot of these places are going to be dramatically transformed.” This new reality of searing heat is an existential one for those most vulnerable – the sick, the elderly and, in particular, the homeless. Washington officials estimate 6,521 people were experiencing homelessness this year, down 6% from 2018. In the broader metropolitan area, about 9,794 people are without homes. Laura Zeilinger, director of the Department of Human Services, said as the city heats up, her goal stays the same – to get people into homes. Zeilinger said she isn’t aware of any heat-related deaths in the city, although she does review any hypothermia-related deaths at the end of each winter. “It’s when people don’t have housing that the elements become life threatening,” Zeilinger said. It doesn’t take much of a temperature increase to permanently shift the expected climate of a city. Fitzpatrick found that a 9.8F (5.5C) average temperature increase during Washington DC’s winter would plunge it into what the deep south is like today. This scenario, possible if emissions aren’t curbed, would also make DC around 70% wetter. “When people hear about a few degrees in temperature rise they can think ‘that doesn’t sound too bad.’ This shows it can really have a big impact,” said Fitzpatrick, who has started to ponder the altered state of Cumberland, Maryland – the town he lives in. “It’s going to look more like southern Kentucky, more of a subtropical climate,” he said. “We get a fair amount of snow now but that’s all going to change. It’s going to be very different.” Washington DC has been given a recent glimpse into its future – a 92F (33C) burst of heat last May saw the city break a 105-year-old record for high temperatures. Sitting on the banks of two tidal rivers – the Potomac and the Anacostia – Washington DC is also essentially a delta city at growing risk of flooding as bursts of rainfall become more intense. It won’t just be uncomfortable, it will be a life or death challenge for many people City leaders have attempted to identify the threat and counter it. A climate resilience plan, released in April, states that DC’s temperature has already risen by 2F (1.1C) over the past 50 years, with a further 4.5F (2.5C) increase to come within 30 years. The number of “heat emergency days” in DC, where the heat index tops 95F (35C), is expected to occur on more than 50 days a year as the century draws to a close. “That means that, in 2080, our summer will be one long heat emergency,” the DC resilience document warns. This scorching new climate is set to heavily burden DC’s growing population, many of them low-income and struggling with housing affordability. Vulnerable people will likely suffer dehydration or heatstroke, with increasing use of air conditioning placing a strain on the electrical grid. Power outages will probably start to spike. “It will affect how people live, work and get around in the city,” said Jessica Grannis, adaptation program manager at the Georgetown Climate Center. “It won’t just be uncomfortable, it will be a life or death challenge for many people. Once it starts getting very hot at night, people without air conditioning are going to be at serious risk if they can’t cool down properly.” Kevin Bush, DC’s chief resilience officer, has pledged to “make the city’s immune system stronger” to cope with this threat, comparing it to how cities in California prepare for the ructions of an earthquake. Under the resilience plan, all DC buildings must be retrofitted to cope with rising heat and flooding threats by 2050, with all new buildings adhering to stricter codes within 13 years. The most at-risk buildings may even be removed. There’s a plan to add more greenery to DC by planting more trees, which will provide shade, and other vegetation that will help soak up stormwater from heavy downpours. The curbsides of several major streets are already getting a makeover, with new plants being bedded in to help cool down the city. “If walk along the streets in DC at the moment you’ll see a lot of pavements being taken out in favour of plantings,” Grannis said. DC is, she added, “one of the most climate prepared cities in the US. Unfortunately it’s not quite the same everywhere.” Dallas, which has a climate that Washington DC is moving towards, is currently trying to muster its own response to the rising heat. By 2080, according to the University of Maryland research, Dallas is set to become more like New Orleans – nearly 9F (5C) hotter and nearly three times as wet. “We had a storm event a few weeks ago where 350,000 people lost power, trees were knocked over. People started to think we maybe aren’t as resilient as we thought, even when it’s not a Hurricane Harvey sort of event,” said James McGuire, director of environmental quality at the City of Dallas. Dallas’ situation is exacerbated by the vast sprawl of concrete at its heart. A third of its surface is made up of rooftops, parking lots, highways and other impervious surfaces that soak up heat. This gives Dallas one of the highest “urban heat island” effects in the US, with the city up to 15F warmer than nearby rural areas. Some areas of the city average peak temperatures of 101F for five months of the year. Of all US cities, only Phoenix is heating up quicker than Dallas, found a 2017 report from the Texas Trees Foundation, which recommended the city plant 250,000 trees to alleviate the sweltering conditions. We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before McGuire said the city hasn’t decided whether to adopt this goal but admitted Dallas needs “a lot more trees.” A recent giveaway of saplings to residents proved popular but more robust action will need to be undertaken without much state or federal support. McGuire said that officials in Dallas talk to their counterparts in Houston and San Antonio about heat but they may have to wait for a time when “impacts are so severe everyone will have to do something.” Dallas’s summer is set to double in length by the end of the century if radical climate action isn’t taken, according to a major US government assessment released last year. The city will also be prone to the whiplash of prolonged droughts interspersed by the drumbeat of heavier rainfall. Property on the banks of Trinity river, that runs through Dallas, has long received billions of dollars of flooding protection but there is less preparation for fresher challenges, such as protecting people working outdoors who risk keeling over in the heat. In January, Dallas City Council kickstarted an attempt to address this manifold problem by passing its first climate resolution. Most of its adaption plans, however, have yet to be formed or funded. “It’s the worst of all potential worlds, really,” McGuire said. “We are getting more asthma problems. We are getting more drought. We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before. We just hope the most dire projections won’t happen.” On another hot day in Washington, Tariq Daniels – who is currently between homes – ate lunch and charged his phone at a local grocery store. Daniels said the city has plenty of services, including the day centers, as well as free recreation centers and libraries. Daniels splits his time between the public spaces, his mosque and the grocery store, where he savors the quiet as a contrast to the noise of the shelter in which he currently sleeps. “You’ve got everything that you need,” Daniels said. “A lot of people have just given up. They’re doing drugs to the point where they’re numb to the outside temperature.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
"Last week at the close of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu I described the leaders’ discussions as frank and fierce. It is now well-known that the leaders debated the text of the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now for many hours. I do not want to comment on the tone of the debate, as many others have done that already. Instead, as incoming Pacific Islands Forum chair, Vanuatu has a message for Australia: we ask that Australia prepares well ahead of the next forum meeting in 2020 and comes to the table ready to make real, tangible commitments on climate change.  The Australian prime minister has had the opportunity to hear directly from Pacific Island leaders – he knows what we want. The Pacific wants real commitments on climate change not because Tuvalu was a “humbug festival” but because the Pacific faces a climate emergency, with real existential threats to the future of atoll nations. In my own country of Vanuatu where the population is overwhelmingly engaged in subsistence farming, we are experiencing increases in annual temperatures and dramatic changes to climate variability that impact both the availability of food and water. Climate change projections also forecast an increase in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones, like Cyclone Pam which hit Vanuatu in 2015, causing damage equivalent to over 64% of our GDP. It is for this reason that Pacific Island leaders issued the Boe Declaration after the Pacific Islands Forum last year that stated that climate change was the single greatest threat to our livelihoods, security and wellbeing. In the context of the pressing climate threat that faces the Pacific, Australia must understand that relationships in the region are not just about the funding of projects. You cannot maintain one message domestically and another in the region. All countries are sovereign and are subject to their own domestic policy. But the Pacific is asking for leadership on real action on climate change. As incoming forum chair, Vanuatu asks respectfully that Australia considers its position carefully on some of these issues so that we avoid a repeat of this year in Port Vila. Pacific Island Forum decisions are based on consensus. This can be both a strength and a weakness. Vanuatu tries to engage constructively in these processes: our approach is that sometimes the negotiations can be difficult, but we can build consensus and move forward on these issues. The baseline for action has been set. The final text of the Kanaiki II Declaration recognises the important work of the IPCC and the findings of the special report on global warming of 1.5C. Paragraph 19 of the declaration includes some important commitments, and retains a greater strength of language than all previous climate change declarations issued by the forum. The declaration asks that all parties to the Paris agreement meet or exceed their nationally determined contributions; that all countries formulate mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies by 2020; that members of the G7 and G20 phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and that the United Nations secretary general urgently appoint a special rapporteur on climate change and security. We ask that Australia carefully considers these commitments, and moves forward into the United Nations climate summit and COP25 with renewed ambition to tackle the climate change threat that undermines our collective future. Pacific leaders expect Australia to prepare to come to the forum next year ready to make further, tangible commitments on climate change. I have already written to my counterpart Marise Payne offering my support to make this happen. Without those commitments we have to ask, what is the Pacific Island Forum for? Does Australia want a seat at the table or not? The declaration contains the words “to lead is to act”. We call on prime minister Morrison to lead on climate change. The Pacific wants action, and we want it now. Ralph Regenvanu is Vanuatu’s minister for foreign affairs"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlthough Japan’s national daily ‘The Asahi Shimbun’ concedes green energies face “a broad array of tough challenges” such as high costs and a lack of storage, it irrationally calls for their acceleration!

Proponents of (unworkable) green energies are kamikaze-style calling for an accelerated implementation. Image: Hayakawa (public domain).
If the green energy revolution proves anything, it is that it is far easier said than done. Too often we’ve heard from green energy proponents: We can do it, and it won’t even cost much!
Yet today some proponents are starting to back off from that rosy view. For example an op-ed piece appearing last month in the English-language Asahi Shimbun tells us that it’s becoming clear that the transition over to a green energy economy is nowhere near as easy nor as cheap as proponents used to tell us.
Japanese media waking up to green folly?
Though the op-ed piece whole-heartedly promotes green energies and calls for a “specific plan to accelerate” them, the Asahi Shimbun is forced to concede that green energies aren’t working out very well at all.
About half way down comes the passage of particular interest:
Promoting green energy, however, requires dealing with a broad array of tough challenges, such as lowering costs that are higher than in many other countries, enhancing the power grid and developing more efficient storage batteries. The government needs to act swiftly to devise a specific plan to accelerate the use of renewable energy sources.”
There are 5 points to take away from this surprising admission.
Firstly, the centre-left Asahi Shimbun finally acknowledges that green energy is indeed expensive and fraught with “a broad array of tough challenges”. That’s a good start. But green energy critics have been pointing this out for years.
Green energies without the green grid
Secondly the Asahi Shimbun also appears to recognize that the power grid infrastructure is indeed woefully lacking, is in need of “enhancing”, and that plastering the landscape with wind turbines and solar panels before getting the grid up to par was probably a pretty horrible idea.

Here Japan is not alone, as many countries worldwide put the cart before the horse when they decided to go green. Instead of first setting up a proper grid, governments simply forced power companies – by law – to buy up all the volatile green power that got produced and to ram it into the grid (whether it was needed or not). Policymakers hoped the grid would somehow cope.
Storage still nowhere in sight
Thirdly, the op-ed piece acknowledges that energy storage systems just aren’t available on the scales anywhere near what is needed. Just as is the case with the power grid, here as well the problem of storage should have been addressed long before putting up all the weather-dependent wind parks and solar systems.  Moreover, there are still are no indications the storage problem will be solved anytime soon.
Green power folly: execute, and then plan!
Fourthly, and what should be stunning to everyone, is the admission that Japan really does not have a “specific plan” for implementing (let alone accelerating) green energies. Like many countries, it never had. Most just barreled blindly into the green project with barely an iota of planning. If a plan really existed, then why would the Asahi Shimbun be demanding swift action to “devise” one?
The truth is that energy infrastructure planning should have been done some 20 years ago – before setting up all the wind parks and solar panels without a proper grid or storage capability. Is it any wonder that so many other countries globally find their energy policies and infrastructures in shambles?
Political grandstanding – no planning
It’s a reality that the installation of green energies so far has been done slipshod, chaotically and without any professional planning. Green energies have in fact been primarily driven by activism and political-environmental grandstanding, and it had little to do with systematic project infrastructure engineering, i.e. analyze, plan, engineer, test, improve and then implement.
Many countries unwittingly let themselves get swept up by the irrational green energy exuberance and today they don’t know how to get out of the mess.
Kamikaze solution?
Finally one would think that with the Asahi Shimbun op-ed piece conceding the huge obstacles, it would at least advocate a whole new approach to avoid the “broad array of tough challenges” green energies harbor. Unfortunately that is not the case.
Quite to the contrary, the op-ed instead amazingly calls for the continuation down that faulty path, and “to accelerate” kamikaze style. That defies all logic. Maybe doing something wrong faster will somehow make it magically work?
The green energy proponents have become desperate, so much so that they are now resorting to kamikaze strategies in a last ditch effort to salvage their pet project.
The best thing here would be for the kamikaze green pilots to turn their suicide planes around, return to base, and realize it’s over.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the Wall Street Journal, Steven F. Hayward penned a great summary on the current state of the climate movement, telling us the CO2 climate change issue is quickly running out of oxygen.
Comparing the movement to earlier environmental movements, Hayward tells us that such movements can be broken down into 5 phases:

Bring attention to the problem
Euphoric enthusiasm to solve it
Realization of the huge, painful costs
Thus a decline of interest follows
Issue moves to limbo…kept on life support

When it comes to climate change issue, today we find itself at stage 4, at least in Europe. In the USA it’s at about stage 5.
So it’s little wonder that climate scientists are frustrated, and openly lashing out in bursts of rhetorical aggression of the sort we discussed here when they get criticized.
Climate scientists losing relevance
Leading climate scientists, who once fancied themselves as the architects of a new society and as policy masterminds, are now realizing they are becoming irrelevant. A very bitter pill to swallow indeed.
Yesterday German scientists Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt commented (below) on NASA’s Gavin Schmidt’s and PIK’s Stefan Rahmstorf’s harsh reactions to the public criticism from sociologist and and think-tank director Oliver Geden:
Stefan Rahmstorf loses his nerves at Twitter
Geden believes the job of policymaking needs to be left to policymakers, and not nerdy climate scientists in lab coats. Geden accused the activist climate scientists of “overconfidence bias”.
=====================================
Lüning and Vahrenholt comment at Die kalte Sonne on the reaction that ensued:
“Naturally that did not please the climate alarmists at all. Foremost they want to rescue the world and turn it inside out. God forbid the notion of having to return to their dark labs and having to carry out the tedious and dull work involving climate science.

The desire for power is strong, and people generally do not give it up so easily. Gavin Schmidt takes the stage. You know him: he’s the director of the NASA-GISS Institute and climate activist just like his predecessor. He tweeted that climate scientists indeed could be politically active because, after all, they are constantly being asked for their opinions by decision-makers. Smart climatologists have long understood this (Schmidt’s tweet).
That was a cue for one of Schmidt’s best friend, namely Stefan Rahmstorf. He immediately took out the big stick to retaliate against the criticism aimed at his alarmist colleagues by Geden. He accused Geden of having much less contact with policymakers than he and his associates.
Rahmstorf has “discredited himself”
Moreover, he accused Geden of lacking academic credentials. Rahmstorf advised Geden to finally leave his climate colleagues alone and that they did not need his advice Tweet here. That’s the Rahmstorf we love: unreceptive to criticism and who hits below the belt. No wonder that he is no longer allowed to write on the IPCC report. With his very unbearable manner, he has completely discredited himself.
Geden coolly responded to Rahmstorf’s emotional outburst:
You want to make this personal, even if you haven’t been involved in the conversation? And my academic achievements aren’t good enough to criticize questionable factual claims? These are usually good enough to review articles on climate targets in Nature research journals…
plus: what exactly do you know about my direct contacts w/ policymakers? It’s my daily job since my institution (@SWPBerlin) is funded by the Chancellery to advise (whole) government and parliament (not only enviro & research), I even worked at the top level of two ministries,
therefore: I know not only what policymakers and politicians say when meeting ‘leading climate scientists’, but also what they say before and after those meetings, and what role (new) scientific knowledge plays in actual policymaking.’
Climate scientists “gone astray”
The above Twitter communication is a nice document confirming how the representatives of climate alarmism have gone astray. Obviously there is no interest in a balanced professional discussion. Research from inconvenient subjects should be stopped, policymakers should only listen to the alarmists.
The climate alarm bubble is gradually coming apart and we are seeing it live.”

Germany’s more than 40 gigawatts of installed solar capacity barely produced anything in December 2017. Curved line shows German demand. Chart source: Agora.
Now that you’ve fallen on the floor with laughter and managed to get back on your chair, you can understand what is going on in green la-la-land.
This is the story of Germany’s Energiewende: install as much capacity of each type renewable energy as possible, and hope that one of them works when the others don’t. Currently Germany has well over 40 gigawatts of installed PV capacity, enough to power half of the country at lunchtime on a sunny day. But it all does nothing at night, or in the wintertime when the sun stays blotted out by Germany’s notoriously cloudy climate and short daylight hours.
This past December in Hanover the the sun shined a mere 10 hours over the entire month. In Lüdenscheid the sun was seen less than one hour!
Michael Kruger writes at Science Skeptical:
“Photovoltaic: 10 hours of sun in December 2017



Image: NDR German Public Television – “Hallo Niedersachsen”
Weathergirl Claudia Kleinert of NDR television above showed on ‘Hallo Niedersachsen’ [Hello Lower Saxony] the number of sunshine hours in December 2017. Hanover reached a whole 10 hours for December. The average value for December in Hanover is 39 hours, thus this past December reached only a quarter of the sun’s usual output.
The operators of photovoltaic systems have not seen any real output at all. Imagine if the coal power plants had operated only 10 hours for the whole month of December, and only a bit over the daytime. They’d be mothballed immediately because of lack of economy.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe peer-reviewed scientific literature is teeming with new evidence supporting the skeptical viewpoint that modern climate changes are neither unprecedented or unusual — nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability.  For example, (1) the Arctic’s Bering Sea surface was several degrees warmer and sea-ice-free all year round earlier in the Holocene. (2) Coral bleaching events are naturally occurring and led to mass coral deaths in much warmer seas earlier in the Holocene.  And (3) 76% of the world’s beach shorelines have been stable or growing since the 1980s.  Activists just ignore this newly published scientific evidence and instead continue peddling alarmism.  

1. What Activists Write About The Bering Sea Ice Melt

Image Source: Grist.org

Image Source: Washington Post
1. What Newly Published Science Says…
The Bering Sea’s surface temperatures ranged between 6°C to 9°C during the Early Holocene (~11,800 to 9,500 years ago).   Slightly further south, in the subarctic North Pacific, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were as high as 10°C to 12°C between ~9,000 and 5,000 years ago.   CO2 concentrations hovered around 260 ppm during this period (versus ~410 ppm today), and yet these Early Holocene SSTs were warm enough that year-round open waters — no sea ice — prevailed in the Arctic’s Bering Sea and the subarctic North Pacific.
Comparatively, saltwater freezes to form a layer of sea ice at temperatures of -1.7°C (NOAA).  And in modern times, the Bering Sea maintains a layer of sea ice from about November to May every year, meaning that today’s SSTs are sub-zero for much of the year in this region.


Méheust et al., 2018
“In this study, the last glacial–deglacial–Holocene variability in SST [sea surface temperature] and sea-ice cover are reconstructed using alkenone-based SST [sea surface temperature] and sea-ice IP25 and PIP25 proxies in sediment cores from the Bering Sea [Arctic Ocean] and the subarctic Pacific. At all sites and during warm as well as cold climatic intervals SST values are well above 0 °C, suggesting ice-free summer conditions throughout.”
“When IP25 [proxy for sea ice] is absent, lack or very low abundance of phytoplankton biomarkers reflects permanent sea-ice coverage, whereas elevated abundance of phytoplankton markers reflects ice-free conditions.  Another useful approach that help to distinguish between the two “IP25=0” extremes, i.e., ice-free versus thick closed ice coverage, is the determination of the sea-surface temperature (SST). SST values significantly above 0 °C give important information about surface water characteristics per se, but also clearly point to ice-free conditions if IP25=0 (cf. [Knies et al., 2014, Stein et al., 2016]).”

“The early Holocene is marked by distinctly increased TOC contents, reaching maximum values (>1 wt%) between ~400 and ~170 cm (~11.5–10 ka ~11,500 to 10,000 years ago]). Likewise, continuously increasing SST [sea surface temperature], reaching maximum values of ~ 9°C at ~ 180 cm (~ 10 ka [10,000 years ago]), strongly coincides with the absence of IP25 [proxy for sea ice] in the sediment. … [For the] lower half of the studied section of Core SO202-27-6 [North eastern Pacific], the Holocene is characterized by maximum SST [sea surface temperature] values of 12°C. Relatively low TOC and phytoplankton markers prevailing during this period, coeval with the absence of IP25 [sea ice]. … [For the] North western Pacific (Core SO202 07 6), the Holocene is marked by the absence of IP25 [sea ice], coinciding with low values of TOC, dinosterol and long chain n-alkanes (avg. ~0.5 wt%, ~ 4 µg/g TOC and 78 µg/g TOC, respectively). SST [sea surface temperature] values increase to about 10°C during the early Holocene.”
“At all sites and during warm as well as cold climatic intervals SST values are well above 0°C (i.e., ranging between about 5 and 12°C), suggesting that the SST data represent more the summer situation with ice-free conditions.”

“In the Bering Sea, the transition between the YD [Younger Dryas]-like cold event and the Early Holocene is marked by the rapid disappearance of IP25 [sea ice] around 11.5 ka [11,500 years ago] in both cores from the Bering Sea.   The absence of IP25 [sea ice proxy] and minimum PIP25 [sea ice proxy] index values is also registered in the subarctic Pacific during this period. These observations demonstrate that year-round open-water conditions prevailed in these areas during the Early Holocene.”

“A prominent decrease of IP25 [sea ice proxy] and minimum values of PIP25 index, reflecting ice-free conditions in the subarctic Pacific and the Bering Sea during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, is in line with the SST [sea surface temperature] warming. This is likely due to the maximum orbitally forced summer insolation, enhancing the melting of ice sheets and thus a sea-level rise. The resultant opening of Bering Strait (~11 ka) and the Aleutian passages allowed the inflow of Pacific Water into the Bering Sea. This warm-water inflow further enhanced the sea-ice melting, leading to ice-free conditions in the Bering Sea during this period. During the late-Early/Mid Holocene, an increase in IP25 and PIP25 in sediments from the north-eastern Bering Sea reveals a shift to marginal sea-ice conditions that is in line with the recovery of extended sea ice observed in other Arctic marginal seas. The extension of Arctic sea ice during the Mid Holocene was likely triggered by the lower Northern Hemisphere insolation and a general widespread surface water-cooling.”

2. What Activists Write About ‘Unprecedented’ Coral Bleaching

2. What Newly Published Science Says…
As recently as a few thousand years ago, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the South China Sea were at least 2°C warmer than they are today, and mass coral death events routinely occurred due to severe bleaching.  Obviously, corals were able to survive past bleaching events, which are a naturally-occurring ecological phenomenon.  Nothing that is occurring today is “unprecedented” or falls outside the range of natural variability.


Xu et al., 2018
“This study provides evidence that thermal coral bleaching events have occurred in the warmer mid-Holocene (where maximum monthly summer SST was 2 °C higher than at present) in Hainan island.  … We carried out this pilot study to explore the responses of corals to abnormally warm conditions in prehistoric periods. Four massive Porites coral fossils that died 3800 – 4200 years ago were collected from the Wenchang fringing reef, Hainan Island, NSCS. The reconstructed SST just prior to the mortality surfaces and growth discontinuities were higher than the [modern] maximum summer SSTs in the NSCS [Northern South China Sea]. This indicated that the corals’ deaths and interruptions in growth – which were observed to be in summer – were accompanied by an anomalously high SST [sea surface temperature]. Enhanced Δδ18O suggested increased evaporation and high-SSS conditions, attributable to warm sea surface temperatures.”
“A significant negative shift in δ13C just prior to mortality surfaces and growth discontinuities indicated a reduced photosynthetic intensity of symbiotic zooxanthellae. Together, this evidence for increased SST and SSS and decreased photosynthetic intensity strongly suggest that the growth hiatuses and coral deaths observed were the results of severe coral bleaching. This in turn indicates that coral bleaching events under high SST conditions have already occurred in the mid-Holocene and are by no means a new ecological phenomenon of current global warming.”

3. What Activists Write About Beach Shorelines Disappearing

3. What Newly Published Science Says…
Two years ago, a paper was published in the journal Nature indicating that shorelines have been growing overall across the world since the mid-1980s (Donchyts et al., 2016).  In other words, despite rising sea levels, there is more land area above sea level today than there was 30 years ago because “coasts are growing all over the world“.  This conclusion has again been confirmed by another new Nature paper that indicates only 24% of the world’s beach shorelines are eroding, whereas 76% of the world’s beach shorelines are either growing (28%) or stable (48%).

Luijendijk et al., 2018
“The application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines thus identified resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984–2016. Analysis of the satellite derived shoreline data indicates that 24% of the world’s sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, while 28% are accreting and 48% are stable.”
“Erosion rates exceed 5 m/yr along 4% of the sandy shoreline and are greater than 10 m/yr for 2% of the global sandy shoreline. On the other hand, about 8% of the world’s sandy beaches experience significant accretion (>3 m/yr), while 6% (3%) are accreting more than 5 m/yr (10 m/yr). … Taking a continental perspective, Australia and Africa are the only continents for which net erosion (−0.20 m/yr and −0.07 m/yr respectively) is found, with all other continents showing net accretion.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Narrative That Says Man-Made CO2
Drives Glacier Melt Continues To Implode
“[T]he retreat of the glaciers after about 1925 became rapid.  It was almost entirely during the [pre-1950] twentieth century warming that the Alpine glaciers disappeared from the valley floors up into the mountains.  Similarly great retreats occurred in Scandinavia, Iceland, Greenland, in the Americas, and on high mountains near the equator.”  — H.H. Lamb  Climate, History, and the Modern World (1982), pg. 248

From the middle of the 20th century and through the 1970s, it was common for scientists to report a rapid warming of “nearly 1° C“ between about 1890 and 1940 (Agee, 1980), a warming accompanied by “catastrophic” and “violent” glacier retreat.
In 1959, eminent Princeton geologist Dr. Erling Dorf reported that annual mean U.S. temperatures rose by 3.5°F (+1.9°C) between 1920 and the 1950s (Visher, 1954).
In Antarctica, temperatures rose by 5°F (+2.8°C) from about 1900s to the 1950s (Wexler, 1958).
In the Arctic, temperatures rose by 14°F (+7.8°C) between 1910 and the 1940s (Willett, 1950).
“CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT”

Dr. Hans Ahlmann (1953) provided a graphical representation of a pronounced Northern Hemisphere-wide glacier retreat that largely commenced in the 1850s and was ongoing as of 1950.
“Glacier Variations and Climatic Fluctuations“

Changing The Temperatures To Fit The Models
The geologically-affirmed existence of an explosive 19th to early 20th century warming accompanied by a “violent” and “catastrophic” wide-scale glacier retreat is not convenient to the computer model-based narrative that says the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions is predominantly what causes dangerous warming and glacier retreat.
So the overseers of the global temperature data sets decided the explosive late 19th to mid-20th century warming and “violent” and “catastrophic” glacier retreat needed to be removed from the scientific record.
Even as late as 1987, global data sets depicted a 0.5°C warming between 1880 and 1950.  By 2014, all of the 1880 to 1950 warming (0.5°C) had been removed from NOAA’s representation of global temperatures.

Images: Schneider, S. H. 1989 and  NOAA (2014)
Scientists Continue To Uncover Inconvenient Glacier Retreat Data
The scientific literature is teeming with geological evidence affirming the explosive warming and glacier retreat during the 1850 to 1950 period.  In other words, scientists are not providing support or confirmation for the narrative that says the post-1940s anthropogenic CO2 emissions increase has coincided with unusual, unprecedented, or alarming glacier retreat.

(1) Rates of glacier recession the second half of the 19th century similar to recent decades.
Oliva et al., 2018
“[T]he Maunder Minimum coincided with a cold period from 1645 to 1706, and the Dalton Minimum (1796–1830) is correlated with a cold stage spanning the years from 1810 to 1838. Four warm periods (1626–1637, 1800–1809, 1845–1859, and 1986–2012) coincided with periods of increased solar activity.”
“The gradual increase in temperature during the second half of the 19th century resulted in significant glacier retreat, with rates of receding [in the second half of the 19th century] similar to those recorded during the last decades of the 20th century and in the early 21st century (Chueca et al., 2008). … The colder climate of the LIA was accompanied by severe droughts, floods, and cold/heat waves that showed significant spatio-temporal variation across the Iberian mountains. … The 20th century did not show unprecedented warmth over the last 800 years.”
(2) Alpine glaciers receded more during the 1860s-1880s and 1920s-1950s than in recent decades, and the Alps are over 3°C colder now than a few thousand years ago.
Sigl et al., 2018
“No role for industrial black carbon in forcing 19th century glacier retreat in the Alps … Starting around 1860 AD, many glaciers in the European Alps began to retreat from their maximum mid-19th century terminus positions, thereby visualizing the end of the Little Ice Age in Europe. Radiative forcing by increasing deposition of industrial black carbon to snow has been suggested as the main driver of the abrupt glacier retreats in the Alps. … Our study reveals that in 1875 AD, the time when European rBC [industrial black carbon] emission rates started to significantly increase, the majority of Alpine glaciers had already experienced more than 80% of their total 19th century length reduction. Industrial BC emissions can, therefore, not been considered as the primary forcing for the rapid deglaciation at the end of the Little Ice Age in the Alps.”
 
Badino et al., 2018     
“Between ca. 8.4-4 ka cal BP [8,400 to 4,000 years before present], our site [Italian Alps] experienced a mean TJuly of ca. 12.4 °C, i.e. 3.1 °C warmer than today [9.3 °C]. … Between 7400 and 3600 yrs cal BP, an higher-than-today forest line position persisted under favorable growing conditions (i.e. TJuly at ca. 12 °C).”


(3) Iceland’s glaciers retreated (more than) 3 times faster from 1860s-1946 than from 1947-2005
Fernández-Fernández et al., 2017
“The abrupt climatic transition of the early 20th century and the 25-year warm period 1925–1950 triggered the main retreat and volume loss of these glaciers since the end of the ‘Little Ice Age’. Meanwhile, cooling during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s altered the trend, with advances of the glacier snouts. Stötter et al. (1999) indicate that the coldest period after the LIA was from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, when temperatures fell to levels equivalent to the warmest recorded in the 19th century. This cooling is the reason given by Caseldine (1983, 1985a, 1985b, 1988) to explain the advance of the Gljúfurárjökull between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s  … Studies of aerial photographs and satellite images show that the glacier snouts have retreated by more than 1300 m on average since the LIA maximum (considered to be AD 1898 in Gljúfurárjökull and AD 1868 in both Western and Eastern Tungnahryggsjökull), with an altitudinal rise of more than 100 m. The retreat accelerated rapidly (15.3 m yr−1) during the first half of the 20th century.  In the second half of the 20th century, the retreat decelerated considerably [4.7 m yr-1], reflected in the lowest values around 1985 (5.2 m yr−1) and a trend shift in 1994, with an advance observed in Gljúfurárjökull. … The trend in Western Tungnahryggsjökull during the first half of the 20th century was a more rapid retreat, showing the highest average rates of the whole period (19.5 m yr−1). … By 1946, this glacier had retreated almost 90% of the total recorded between the LIA maximum (1868) and 2005.”

(4) Norway’s glaciers are currently more advanced than nearly all of the last 10,000 years, with pronounced recession occurring during the 1800s.
Gjerde et al., 2016
 
(5) On a global scale, glacier recession rates have dramatically decelerated since the 1920s to 1950s period.
Leclercq et al., 2014
“A data set of worldwide glacier length fluctuations … The data set contains the glacier length records for 471 [global] glaciers and it covers the period 1535–2011. There are glacier length records from all continents and at almost all latitudes.   For the observed glaciers, the 20th century retreat was strongest in the first half of the 20th century.”
“[T]he retreat is strongest in the period 1921–1960 rather than in the last period 1961–2000, with a median retreat rate of 12.5 m yr in 1921–1960 and 7.4 m yr in the period 1961–2000.”
A Human-Driven Glacier Retreat Is Not Supported By Evidence 
Advocates of the position that humans exert a profound and dangerous influence on the Earth’s temperatures and glacier melt point to the rapid increase in human CO2 emissions (purple trend line) as the condemnable culprit.

The trend in anthropogenic CO2 emissions was essentially flat and very low (averaging just 1 gigaton of carbon [GtC] per year) from about 1900 to 1945, when a significant portion of the modern glacier recession occurred.   Emissions rates were negligible during the high-melt-volume 19th century too.
Explosive growth in human emissions occurred after 1945, when a significant deceleration in glacier melt (and even decades of advancing glaciers) occurred.
This historical evidence would not appear to support the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions drive both warming and glacier melt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Environmental Progress site here, Michael Shellenberger writes that Stanford University Professor Mark Z. Jacobson is suing a “prestigious team of scientists for Debunking 100% renewables.
This reminds us of the 17 or so attorneys general who sought to use the US Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in order to go after and silence climate science skeptics, accusing them of perpetuating fraud by daring to question the flakey science underpinning the manmade global warming theory.
Shellenberger wrote that professor Mark Z. Jacobson had “filed a lawsuit, demanding $10 million in damages, against the peer-reviewed scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and a group of eminent scientists (Clack et al.) for their study showing that Jacobson made improper assumptions in order to claim that he had demonstrated U.S. energy could be provided exclusively by renewable energy, primarily wind, water, and solar.”

“Speechless”…climate-energy debate needs to get “a direction of sanity”
Climatologist Prof. Judith Curry at her Climate Etc site wrote that she was “speechless”, adding:
In many ways, this is much worse than any of Michael Mann’s lawsuits alleging defamation of character [link] — Jacobson’s lawsuit seeks to settle a genuine scientific disagreement in the courts.”

However, Prof. Curry does not see “a good ending” for Jacobson: “There will undoubtedly be a countersuit and he stands to lose a lot of money (not just his lawsuit)”.
Many observers feel this is just the latest attempt to shut down free speech within the realm of science — a highly worrisome development that reminds us of brutal totalitarian regimes.
Curry notes: “Possibly, there will be sufficient backlash against this that will steer the overall climate-energy debate back towards a direction of sanity.”
This can only be hoped for.
Blogger Shellenberger calls the move by Jacobson “unprecedented”, adding:
Scientific disagreements must be decided not in court but rather through the scientific process. We urge Stanford University, Stanford Alumni, and everyone who loves science and free speech to denounce this lawsuit.”
This of course would be expected from almost any higher education institution in any other free-speech-abiding, democratic state. But with flakey, culturally neurotic California, nothing can be ruled out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy now, after some 30 years of dire warnings, you’d think that the warming of the globe and ice mass reduction would be much further along than it actually is. Yet there are a number of major signs that show the opposite (cooling and freezing) are happening:
1. Arctic ice has stabilized over the past decade
Tony Heller at realclimatescience.com here reports that Arctic sea ice volume is in fact up 15%, from 13,000 km³ to 15,000 km³ and that there has been a huge expansion of thick ice into the East Siberian Sea. The following is Heller’s comparator showing the difference between today and 10 years ago:

2007     2017
Obviously over the past 10 years Arctic sea ice was supposed to do the opposite, i.e. shrink 15%. Climate scientists, who warned the melting of the 2000s would accelerate, are now left baffled and speechless.
2. Equatorial Pacific La Nina will usher in cooling 
The EL Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a measure of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures, is at its coldest level in years, boding that more global cooling lies ahead for the planet in the months ahead. Just months ago, experts were predicting another warming El Nino. They were wrong. Moreover, the latest forecast sees La Nina conditions extending into next spring:

3. Rapid Pacific surface cool down:
Surface temperatures at the equatorial Pacific (where it really counts) have plummeted by 1-2°C since June of this year, hurricane expert Phillip Klotbach tweeted recently:
And because there is a lag of about 6 months between the ocean surface temperature and satellite global lower troposphere temperatures, the La Nina will ensure that 2018 will be a cooler year at the surface globally.
4. Siberia sees unusual November cold
Moving to Siberia, we see that an unexpected cold gripped the region, with temperatures in many parts of Siberia recently plummeting 20°F below normal. The Weather Channel reports here: “Parts of Siberia are Colder Than Minus 60 Degrees Fahrenheit, and It’s Only November“.
Forecasters are now warning that this cold could soon shift over to North America and Europe.
5. Greenland’s ice mass budget continues to surprise
Greenland, often claimed by climate alarmists to be the “canary in the coal mine”, has seen its ice sheet gain 250 billion metric tonnes since September 1, 2017. This is 40 billion tonnes above the 1981-2010 average.

Warming is not supposed to create 40 billion tonnes of ice. That’s almost 6 tonnes for each person on the planet.

6. Northern Hemisphere fall snow and ice cover rising
Northern Hemisphere snow and ice cover for the month of October finished 20% above the mean. In fact the mean of the past 5 years for October has been the highest for any 5-year period since measurements began 50 years ago.

The same is true for the month of November: it too has seen a robust upward trend in snow and ice cover over the past 30 years.
7. Solar activity near 200-year low
In the current solar cycle 24 sunspot activity is now at the lowest level in almost 200 years. In the early 1800s the Earth found itself in the grips of the Dalton Minimum, a cold period with similarly low solar activity:
The accumulated sunspot anomaly from the mean of the previous 23 cycles – 107 months into the cycle.
The current solar cycle 24 is the third weakest since the systematic observation of solar cycle activity began in 1755. Only solar cycles nos. 5 and 6 (1798…1823 during the Dalton Minimum) were weaker. A number of distinguished scientists and dozens of scientific publications warn that the planet may in fact be entering a period of global cooling. The upcoming solar cycle 25 also is expected to be a weak one.
Major eruption of Agung?
In summary, there are other signs showing cooling taking place or coming up; above is just a sampling. Let’s not forget the possible eruption of Agung in Indonesia. A major eruption would send global temps into the fridge for a couple of years.
The bottom line: Don’t let all the hype about runaway warming make you think the planet is roasting. There’s plenty of unexpected cold around – cold that was never supposed to be. And the only thing you’re going to hear from the alarmists to explain this are a lot of excuses.

"Martin Rees is a cosmologist and astrophysicist who has been the astronomer royal since 1995. He is also a co-founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Cambridge. His most recent book, On the Future: Prospects for Humanity, is published by Princeton. After Boris Johnson’s recent announcement of an increase in the number of special visas for scientists, Sir Andre Geim accused him of taking scientists “for fools”. Did you feel patronised by the announcement? I wouldn’t put it that way. Anything that makes it easier to get visas is welcome but won’t remove the serious downsides of Brexit.  So you agree with Sir Andre that the turmoil will last for many years and that issuing a few more visas isn’t really the answer? The main point is that science is truly global, straddles all boundaries of nationality and faith. So anything that makes the UK less welcoming to scientists around the world is going to have a negative impact.  Why should the passenger on the Clapham omnibus care about the situation of science post-Brexit?Because science is not just a venture for academics – most of our life depends on how it’s applied. The UK is specially strong in scientific expertise and in its universities – it would be deeply damaging to jeopardise this strength.  A Brexiter would say you are part of an elite protecting vested interests. Well, it’s very odd of people such as Jacob Rees-Mogg to refer to their opponents as an elite. As a university teacher, I think the whole country ought to care about the quality of our hi-tech industry and our education. And most young voters are anti-Brexit. Would you say the only group of scientists who are more relaxed about Brexit are working on GM foods?That is true – many of us feel that the EU regulations on GM are over-stringent. But even from that perspective it’s not clear you’re better off out than in. We want to sell our stuff in the EU, so we’d be better placed to do that if we were inside and could influence the regulations rather than having those regulations imposed on us and inhibiting our trade. Technology played a disputed role in the outcome of the referendum. At the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, you study some of the potential impacts for humanity of speedy technological change… One consequence of modern technology is that the world is more interconnected. It’s possible for small groups or even individuals to produce an effect that cascades very widely, even globally.  But doesn’t that interconnectedness mean we’re able to monitor what’s going on around the world? The International Atomic Energy Agency can monitor compliance with nuclear regulation. But we have minimal success in enforcing drug or tax laws globally. Regulations of cyber and biotech will likewise be harder to enforce because, unlike the nuclear case, they don’t require conspicuous special-purpose facilities. We may have a bumpy ride because we can’t eliminate these threats completely. The climate crisis is another area where international agreements have had limited impact. There is a strong grassroots movement led by Greta Thunberg and others, yet we have populist presidents in the US and Brazil who are climate-change deniers and reneging on agreements… Politicians don’t prioritise things when the benefits are diffuse and in the far future. They will only take action if the voters are behind them. That’s why it’s very important to sustain these campaigns.  We want to make sure that these issues of climate stay on the agenda. For instance, the 2015 papal encyclical on climate change. The pope has a billion followers from Latin America, Africa, East Asia and this helped towards consensus at the Paris conference. To take a more parochial example, we have to give some credit to Michael Gove, who introduced legislation against non-reusable plastics. However, he wouldn’t have done that had it not been for the influence of our secular pope David Attenborough, who introduced us to Blue Planet footage of albatrosses coughing up plastic and so on. Is climate change the threat that you’re most concerned about? The most worrying thing on a 10- or 20-year timescale is the misuse of cyber- and biotechnology. Are the dangers from rogue individuals or rogue states? I think both, and error as well as terror. We are so dependent on the electricity grid that the lights going out are the least of the problems. A 2012 report from the US Department of Defense says a cyber-attack from another state that downs the grid in the eastern US would merit a nuclear response. Society is getting more fragile and vulnerable. To take another example, if there is a pandemic, hospitals would be overwhelmed before the number of cases reached 1% of the population, leading to a breakdown in social order. Were you heartened by the amount of interest in the 50th anniversary of the moon landing? That was an extraordinary feat. But once the US had achieved their mission of beating the Russians to the moon there was no motive to continue with that level of government expenditure. The need for sending people into space has evaporated. If you were building the Hubble telescope now, you wouldn’t send people to refurbish it, you would send robots. I hope human space flight will continue, but as a high-risk adventure bankrolled by private companies. If I were American, I wouldn’t support taxpayers’ money going on Nasa’s manned programme. But I would cheer on Messrs Musk and Bezos with their companies SpaceX and Blue Origin. And perhaps by the end of the century a few adventurers will be living on Mars. Musk has said he wants to “die on Mars, but just not on impact” and that’s not a crazy aspiration. But it is a delusion to think we can solve Earth’s problems by relocating to Mars. I completely disagree with Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking on that, because dealing with climate change on Earth is a doddle compared with terraforming Mars.  Do you think we should be concerned about artificial intelligence?I don’t worry yet about a general intelligence that invades the internet of things and takes over the world – that still seems to be science fiction.  But AI and robotics are affecting the labour market and lots of jobs will be replaced or supplemented by AI. These will include work in call centres and warehouses. But that would be good news if the people displaced could find work where the human element is crucial, such as caring for the old, the young and the vulnerable. There are too few such jobs now and they’re insecure and poorly paid. Those who employ robots need to be taxed and that funding should be used to set up huge numbers of dignified and secure jobs of the kind a humane society needs.

"In 1971, the Liberal Billy McMahon – routinely judged the worst Australian prime minister ever, an achievement not to be underestimated in a nation where the worst routinely rule – created a new portfolio: Environment, Arts and Aboriginal Affairs. Nobody wanted the job: given it, Peter Howson observed that he was responsible for “trees, boongs and poofters.” What’s changed with our conservative rulers over the last half century? On the evidence of the shame the prime minister, Scott Morrison, visited on all Australians last week at the Pacific Islands Forum, not very much. There he tried to pressure Pacific leaders to remove from the final forum communique and climate change statement all references to coal, to limiting warming to less than 1.5C, and to setting out a plan for net zero emissions by 2050. Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, was too diplomatic when he told Scott Morrison: “You are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.” Because it isn’t Australia’s economic security that is at stake, but the security of the profits of coalmining corporations and their owners – the likes of Gautam Adani and Gina Rinehart – along with the security of the seats of influential Queensland MPs for whom Clive Palmer’s $60m-plus election campaign was so important. And for them, and his own electoral security, Scott Morrison was willing to sacrifice any sense of national security. Not content at a time of growing global tensions to have deeply damaged our standing with our close neighbours, the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, observed that Pacific islanders would “continue to survive because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit”, thereby managing in a single sentence to dismiss Pacific islanders’ concerns for their future and simultaneously invoke Australia’s horrific blackbirding past that saw 19th century Pacific islanders kidnapped and coerced into semi-slavery working on Australian sugar cane plantations. And when next it is our homes that vanish in an unprecedented mega-fire, or flood, or cyclone, or under a rising sea, what patronising cant might our Marie Antoinettish leaders offer up for our future? Help in the kitchen of a coal company executive? Work in the garden of a National party grandee? Like so many Australians, I have felt powerless watching the climate crisis unfold in our country. Last week’s events brought home to me how the most powerful in our country seemed to be those that would ensure the very worst future eventuates in their craven service to the fossil fuel industry and its propagandists, thereby ensuring we exacerbate the climate emergency rather than seek to limit its damage. The question of the age is how. In the face of a human-induced change that threatens the future of our species how to act? How to live? How to be? Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In seeking the answer we find ourselves alone in the universe without illusions. There are no leaders, no parties, no nation, no gods that will save us. We discover at this terrible moment a shocking truth: we only have ourselves. And each of us finds within ourselves only failure, cowardice, timidity, in short, a despair at our general weakness. This sense of futility haunts us all. And yet within that failure is hope. Having only ourselves we finally discover bedrock: ourselves. Everywhere – in every party, organisation, workplace, club, gym, street, café and pub – are to be found those who do not agree with where power is taking our country. And at the moment, we can still keep climate change within the 1.5C change. It is difficult. But it remains possible. And science tells us that at 1.5C we can still exercise control over our future. But if we choose not to act now within a decade we will be looking at between 2C and 6C of warming by 2100. And at that point science tells us that we can no longer control anything. It won’t matter whether we fight or not, because the fight will be lost. The changes will not be able to be contained and we will be living on a planet increasingly hostile to human existence. And so the situation is not yet terminal. It remains in our control if we wish to take control. There is hope if we dare hope. There is a better future if we are willing to express it and demand it. And it is clear that the concerns that so many of us have dwarf the differences of groups and parties. I thought on the things that we could unite around as Australians, that we could use to go forward, that would make our country, as it has been in the past, a global leader, and a proud country once more. Words only have the power others grant to them. If we do nothing we are endorsing Michael McCormack’s words and Scott Morrison’s actions in Tuvalu. Or we can use other words. And so I sought to distill into as few words as possible what could be done by us as a people. What was feasible, what was achievable. None are new ideas, all are founded in science, and all are being fought for in various ways. But everywhere we see them dismissed and attacked as impossible, ludicrous and unworkable. Yet when reduced to their essence how reasonable they are. When conceived as a mutual and national endeavour how possible they become. And writing them I felt my despair lift. I realised that there can be a positive vision for our future, a future that brings us together rather than divides us, that makes us a better, stronger country. And in six sentences I saw hope is possible. We believe Australia can be an affirming light in a time of despair, a global leader in transitioning to a carbon-free and socially just society, and that is why we wish our government to – Work with Australian land managers to stop land clearing, protect existing forests and grow new forests to absorb existing carbon pollution. Work with Australian farmers and graziers to make farming carbon neutral. Work with Australian miners to ensure a transition into 21st century minerals (nickel, rare earth) and end thermal coalmining and gas fracking in Australia. Work with Australian regulators to make all Australian ground transport powered by renewable energy by 2030. Work with Australian industry to make Australia a renewable energy giant and carbon-neutral economy by 2050, funded by progressive pollution tariffs on global heaters. That neither the government nor Labor party would at present even contemplate such things is beside the point. That we must compel them is. At the end of the Pacific Islands Forum, Enele Sopoaga asked the world to not forget his people: “We ask, please, understand this: our people are dying.” I don’t doubt that there are far better words than my six sentences to be had and which will and should appear. But we need to act now for if we don’t the fate of the Tuvalese may soon be ours also. It’s time to take our future back. It’s time to stand and fight. And though these final words seem strange as I write them, I feel them to be true: we will discover the language of hope in the quality of our courage."

Takes A Hit In 2017

During 2017,  485 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate’s fundamental control knob…or that otherwise question the efficacy of climate models or the related “consensus” positions commonly endorsed by policymakers and mainstream media.
These 485 new papers affirm the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, emphasizing that climate science is not settled.
More specifically, the papers in this compilation support these four main skeptical positions — categorized here as N(1) – N(4) — which question climate alarm.
N(1) Natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined.
N(2) The warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability, as clearly shown in the first 150 graphs (from 2017) on this list.
N(3) The computer climate models are not reliable or consistently accurate, and projections of future climate states are little more than speculation as the uncertainty and error ranges are enormous in a non-linear climate system.

N(4) Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).
In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%.
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences.
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough“, which means that “the time for debate has ended“.
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
To reiterate, the 485 papers compiled in 2017 support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus” A(1)-A(4) positions.  The papers do not do more than that.   Expectations that these papers should do more than support skeptical positions and undermine “consensus” positions to “count” are deemed unreasonable in this context.

Beer’s healing power
Last April on my birthday I got a book called “Das Heilkraft des Bieres” (The Healing Power of Beer). I was fascinated by the fact that beer in moderation (1 or 2 per day) has the same or even more health benefits as red wine does.

Die Heilkraft des Bieres, Kopp Verlag.
Beer fires up the digestive system, and it delivers a number of nutrients and anti-oxidants which protect your body against a number of diseases. A number of studies were cited to show this. Also it showed that people who drank moderately and regularly performed better cognitively.
Beer’s health benefits have been underestimated and the sudsy beverage has been unfairly associated with the “beer belly”.
24 fun facts about beer
I was also fascinated by the huge variety of beers available out there which I neglected to explore all these years. For years I made the mistake of sticking to the same brand of pilsner, and using it as the benchmark to evaluate others.
152 beers from 18 countries
So as an experiment I endeavored to taste one different beer almost every day. Since then I’ve sampled over 150 different ones.Below you’ll find the full (alphabetical) list.
Eight months later, I don’t have a beer belly nor have I gained weight. I found out I have taken a real liking to red and pale ales, and that I no longer find the standard, run-of-the-mill pilsner beers that interesting any more. I’ve discovered that they are rather boring by comparison, but go down easily and hence are pushed by the beer industry to generate volume.

Stoutest of the stouts
Also Guinness, considered by many as the stout beer, is actually quite mild compared to the Baltic Stout by Inselbrauerei (No. 75 on list). Now that is stout!
The best beers generally are produced by private-run craft breweries, and unfiltered. Positively surprising to me were the beers from the Mashsee brewery of Hanover.
Other points observed are that Russian beers are rather plain and the Chinese, Korean and Japanese beers seemed to be beers for very beginners – pretty delicate stuff.
God-awful
I found Corona to be unnatural and not very tasty, and so it’s not a surprise many people like to take it with a wedge of lime. The Mexican brew comes in a clear bottle and its ingredients include additives, stabilizers and preservatives. Hard to believe I used to drink the stuff when I lived in Arizona.
Most of the beers listed below are pleasurable to drink, but a couple I found god-awful, such as Moosehead Light (Canada) and Baltika KYπEP of Russia. I had to discard the stuff. Also Raschhofer Witbier brewed in part with oatmeal did not go down so well – not my taste at all.
Maybe readers have their own recommendations.
Today I’m going to sample Insel Herb brewed by Inselbrauerei on the Baltic Sea island of Rugen. Let me know your favorite, if you have one.
Happy New Year everyone!

  Vineyards In Russia, Norway, N England (55°N)

Canada’s stable-to-increasing polar bear population extends its range slightly further south of the 55th parallel (York et al., 2016).

Image Source: York et al., 2016
According to published geological evidence from the 1950s, remnants of wine grape vineyards have been unearthed in regions as far north as the polar-bear-inhabiting 55th parallel during the Medieval Warm Period (~800s to 1300s AD).

OUR CHANGING CLIMATE, PAST AND PRESENT
Lamb, 1959
“There was a secondary optimum of climate between 400 and 1200 A.D., the peak probably being 800-1000 A.D. This was on the whole a dry, warm period and apparently remarkably stormfree in the Atlantic and in the North Sea. It was the time of lowland settlement in the Saxon lands and of considerable flowering of Celtic and Northumbrian cultures. Missions from the Celtic Church in Ireland were sent as far as Africa and Iceland. It was also the time of great Viking voyages and the settlement of Iceland and Greenland. The early Norse burials in Greenland were deep in ground which is now permanently frozen. There were several visits to America (probably many timbergetting voyages between Greenland and Labrador) and there is evidence which suggests that at least one Viking ship got through the North-West Passage and ultimately reached the Gulf of California (cf. Ives 1953).”
“In Domesday Book (1085) 38 vineyards were recorded in England besides those of the king. The wine was considered almost equal with the French wine both in quantity and quality as far north as Gloucestershire and the Ledbury area of Herefordshire where the soil is said to resemble that of the Rhine and Moselle wine districts. The London basin, the Medway valley and the Isle of Ely were also favoured districts. 
The northernmost vineyards were near York [northern England] but the most favoured country was from Northants and the Fenland southwards. This implies summer temperatures perhaps 1 to 2°C higher than today, general freedom from May frosts (particularly suggested by the exposure to the north of several low-lying vineyard sites, e.g. at Tewkesbury, in the Fens and at Teynham, Kent) and mostly good Septembers.”

Wine Produced In East Prussia, Lithuania, South Norway
“At one time (1128-1437) wine had been produced in East Prussia.”
“Grapes grew even at Tilsit (55°N) in Lithuania [Russia]…”
“…and in south Norway…”
Wine Produced At 220 Meters Higher Elevation Than 1959…And Today
“…[Grapes grew] as high as 780 m above sea level in the Black Forest [Germany].”
“The highest vineyards in Germany today [1959] are about 560 m near the Boden Sea in Baden.”

The highest vineyard in Germany today, located at Lake Constance, is still 560 m above sea level, the same maximum height as it was in the late 1950s.  The modern elevation is therefore 220 meters lower elevation for German wine-making than during the Medieval Warm Period.
Grape Harvesting 500 Kilometers North Of Present From 1100 – 1300 A.D.
Easterbrook, 2011
“The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was a time of warm climate from about 900 A.D. to 1300 A.D. when global temperatures were apparently somewhat warmer than at present. Its effects were evident in Europe where grain crops flourished, alpine tree lines rose, many new cities arose, and the population more than doubled. The Vikings took advantage of the climatic amelioration to colonize Greenland, and wine grapes were grown as far north as England where growing grapes is now not feasible and about 500 km north of present vineyards in France and Germany. Grapes are presently grown in Germany up to elevations of about 560 m, but from about 1100 A.D. to 1300 A.D., vineyards extended up to 780 m, implying temperatures warmer by about 1.0-1.4°C (Oliver, 1973). Wheat and oats were grown around Trondheim, Norway, suggesting climates about 1°C warmer than present (Fagan, 2000).”
Grape Harvest Date Histories Reveal Little To No Change Since The 1600s–1800s

"Arron Banks has been criticised after he appeared to wish harm upon Greta Thunberg as the 16-year-old activist set sail across the Atlantic on a two-week voyage in a zero-carbon yacht. The controversial Brexit backer warned the teenager that “freak yachting accidents do happen in August” as he responded to a tweet by Green party MP Caroline Lucas who said Thunberg was carrying “the vital message to the UN that time is running out to address the climate emergency”. His comments sparked outrage among MPs, celebrities and academics, but he defended the remark in a series of late-night tweets on Wednesday in which he accused “lefties” of having no sense of humour. Freak yachting accidents do happen in August ... https://t.co/6CPePHYLtu Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi was among the first to rebuke the former Ukip donor and pay tribute to the work Thunberg has done to raise awareness around the impending ecological crisis. “I think it is absolutely disgraceful that a man like Banks can take to Twitter to slag off a 16-year-old girl,” she told the Guardian. “The great work that Greta has done to put climate change at the top of the political world’s agenda, mobilising and inspiring young people and our future generations is priceless. “This is a man who funded Brexit lies, lives a life of excess and chooses to wish an accident on Greta Thunberg. It’s an absolute disgrace, his tweet should be reported as a hate crime.” She said Banks should have “opened his wallet and offered to pay for the journey for Greta. The sewer he chooses to swim in is not one which we should have to expose our children to.” Prof Tanja Bueltmann, founder of campaign group EU Citizens’ Champion, said Banks had “invoked the drowning of a child” for his own amusement. “Verbal attacks on Greta Thunberg have been coming from many different people for quite some time. Their common characteristic? Most of them are white middle-aged men from the right of the political spectrum. “As if the tweet itself wasn’t horrendous enough already, Banks’s explanation for it is that he invoked the drowning of a child for fun because he enjoys watching outrage. I cannot think of anything lower than that.” Actor Amanda Abbington tweeted: “You’re wishing a potentially fatal accident onto a sixteen year old girl, why..?” Earlier, she wrote: “If you are a grown up, fully-fledged adult and you are mocking this young girl for trying to save the planet then I genuinely feel sorry for you. I also think you are incredibly cruel, vicious and ignorant.” In response to a tweet which drew his attention to the fact she is a child, Banks replied: “Quite and one being used. Obviously I don’t hope she encounters a freak yachting accident! I just enjoy watching the ludicrous tweeter mob following the next outrage.” Later, replying to a tweet which said he had “finally showed his true colours”, he said: “It was a joke .. you lefties have no sense of humour.” • This article was amended on 13 September 2019 to correct wording of a link to a related story stating that the yacht was solar-powered. The yacht was mainly powered by wind."
"Could climate change-resistant homes help solve the housing crisis? The Met Office’s conclusion was unequivocal. There is “no doubt” climate change played a role in the record-breaking temperatures that fried the UK and northern Europe last month. But there was an irony in this year’s latest heatwave too. The scorching heat that sparked fears of buckled train tracks and made many of us yearn for rain was a symptom of a gradual shift that isn’t just raising temperatures but is making flooding more likely too. The UK Climate Projections 2018 warn that coming decades would see a triple whammy of rising summer temperatures, rising sea levels and more extreme weather such as flash floods. In time, these patterns will fundamentally change where we live and the homes we live in. Many of us already face an uncomfortably high risk of flooding. More than one in 10 of the new homes built in England in 2016-17 are in areas the Environment Agency deems at risk of flooding (it estimates they face at least a 1% chance of flooding every year). Over time, those aren’t great odds. Yet the agency recently warned that “we can’t win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences”. Instead it is calling for housebuilders to construct homes that are more flood-resistant, for example by adding watertight flood doors and thicker, more waterproof membranes in the walls. This sort of technology is getting better. Much of it comes from the Netherlands, where they know a thing or two about flood defences. There are also things that can be done to make homes more resilient in the event that the worst happens, and flood waters do get in. As anyone who has endured the horror of a flooded home will tell you, one of the biggest expenses in the aftermath is replacing waterlogged wooden flooring and joists and sodden electrics. Housebuilders can mitigate these risks fairly easily, by installing concrete floors and routing power cables as high as possible. In the long term, such building techniques will become increasingly mainstream. By the 2080s up to 1.5m homes in England will be in areas at significant risk of flooding, according to the Committee on Climate Change. But a more radical change to the way we build homes could deliver a more immediate benefit – by helping tackle the housing crisis. Building homes that aren’t just resistant but immune to flooding could allow developers to build safely on land currently dismissed as unviable because it has a high flood risk. Opening up swaths of extra land for development, especially in the most densely populated parts of the country, might even give developers a fighting chance of meeting the government’s target of building 300,000 new homes a year. The most tried and tested way to build in flood-risk areas is to lift the house off the ground. Humans have been building homes on stilts for millennia, and this technique is still popular in south-east Asia, Central America and Brazil. More modern techniques include building on a raised platform like a beach house – a familiar sight in my wife’s native Australia – or simply on banks of earth or concrete. Of course this approach requires an element of second guessing: you need to build the accommodation above the level any floodwater will reach. But the latest technology solves this problem: houses that float and rise with the floodwaters. Ingenious Dutch architects – where else? – have designed houses that have a buoyant, air-filled concrete base instead of conventional foundations anchoring them to the ground. Some are intended to float full-time and are bound together to form floating communities that sit atop the water of a lake. Others are amphibious, designed to sit on terra ferma most of the time but able to float safely in the event of flooding, albeit with copious moorings to prevent any relocation. Such technology comes at a price. Amphibious houses cost about 20% more to build than a conventional design. With prices falling in some parts of the country and builders seeing their margins squeezed, persuading them to build more expensive homes won’t be easy. The clincher could be the land question. A combination of strict planning rules and “landbanking” – developers’ habit of buying but not building on land – is driving up prices in many parts of the UK. By contrast, floodplain land is cheap. So technology that enables homes to be built safely in areas that were previously off limits could make business sense for private developers and spur the construction of thousands of affordable, unfloodable homes. Other parts of the property industry would need to get, ahem, on board. Insurers will want to be sure of the houses’ immunity to flooding, as will mortgage lenders. But both serve conventional homes in flood-risk areas, so there’s no reason for them to eschew homes that cannot flood, no matter how high the water rises. This won’t magically solve the housing crisis or eliminate all flooding risk. As climate change steadily puts more conventional homes at flood risk – whether from tidal surges, or rivers and drains overflowing – the UK needs to continue investing in flood defences. But if we’re willing to embrace the new technology of floating and amphibious houses, we can unlock tracts of cheap floodplain land that could be used for some of the new homes Britain needs so desperately. As the Environment Agency says, we can’t out-build the flood risks of climate change. But if we’re canny, we might just turn some of the threat into an opportunity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest forecast shows snow and cold moving across much Germany this weekend, again. Despite Germany ‘s ruddy CO2 emissions, winter keeps coming.
German public broadcasting, here for example, reports today that despite all the green, climate-preaching, Germany will miss its 2020 CO2 reductions by a mile. More embarrassingly, the country has not reduced its CO2 equivalent emissions in 9 years when 2017 is counted in the statistics.

2017 Co2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions are are projected to be at about 906 million tonnes this year (2017). Data taken from German Ministry of Environment. 
The online site of German NTV public televisions reports that the results of a study by the Prognos Institute tell us that not only is the country going to miss its 40% CO2 reduction target compared to 1990, but that also “energy efficiency is significantly below the expected development requirements of the energy concept“. In fact energy efficiency has worsened over 2016, NTV writes.
Although Germany is a country that likes to preach to countries about their obligations and responsibility to boost green energies and cut back on “dirty” fossil fuels, it itself has failed miserably to make any progress of its own.
NTV adds:

The German government has fell way short of all its major targets when it comes to the Energiewende.” 
High costs with no results
The NTV later continues:
Regardless of subsidies in the triple digit billions for the expansion of renewable energies, the emissions of climate-damaging carbon dioxide have not decreased as planned, but rather have stagnated since 2014.
Actually CO2 equivalent emissions in Germany have been stagnant for 9 years now, as mentioned above.
“Fundamentally a disaster”
Germany’s EEG feed-in surcharges are currently costing more than 24 billion euros annually, according to the German Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft (Water and Energy Management).
In terms of what the citizens are getting for their money, the Union of Bavarian Economy President Alfred Gaffal has called it “fundamentally a disaster“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media are bellowing about how April in Germany was the “all-time warmest ever recorded”, and so it has to be a clear sign of global warming (suddenly the colder than normal March and February have been forgotten).

Europe enjoyed a balmy April this year. Chart: NCEP.
What does the unusually warm Central European April mean for the rest of the summer, if anything?
It turns out that it very well might mean something. Schneefan (snow fan) at wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here reports that statistically the chances of a cool summer following for the continent are much higher than average.
He wrote that when one compares the seven warmest Aprils in Germany since 1961 to the respective summers that followed, one sees that the summers were awfully cool.
Schneefan looked at the hot Aprils of the years 1961, 1993, 2000, 2007, 2009 , 2011 and 2014 and their respective summers that followed. He calculated the average June-August temperature for the seven summers and compared the figure to the WMO 1981-2010 mean summer temperature. Here’s the result, according to NOAA data:

The NOAA-Reanalysis shows the average 2m temperature deviation for the seven June-August summers that followed warm Aprils in Europe since 1961. Source: NOAA reanalysis.
Clearly when Aprils in Central Europe are warm, summers that follow very much tend to be cooler than normal across Europe (except Scandinavia).
By comparison Schneefan’s statistical outlook into the future from April 11, 2018, using different years follows:

Source: NCEP
Here an NOAA reanalysis shows the average temperature deviation of the summers (June-August) of the years in Europe he chose (1984, 1985, 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2013) with respect to the WMO 1981-2010 mean for the summer months. While far northern Europe showed above average temperatures, the large bulk of part of Europe was cooler than normal.
Here we see the stunning similarity in Europe between both analyses using entirely different selection criteria.
We can only hope that the statistical trend does not get reaffirmed, especially during the time of the World Cup. The cool global conditions also remain unchanged as the La Niña: is expected to persist.

Expert software engineer and climate science blogger/critic Tony Heller just posted a video commenting on the just newly released National Climate Assessment (NCA) report:

“Utter garbage”
Heller starts by pointing out that “there’s a huge number of problems” with the report and that the content contradicts itself, even on the same page.
Heller says that the claim that the number of record hot days is on the rise “is simply not true” and he wonders how peer review “allows this sort of utter garbage to get through“.  Heller makes it clear that this report belongs in the garbage can of science.
Wildly fraudulent
Heller methodically explains how the NCA report used faulty computational methods to make it appear as if more record hot days have been occurring, when in fact the trend has been the opposite.
The National Climate Assessment graph is wildly fraudulent. Not only have record maximum temperatures plummeted in the US, but record minimum temperatures have plummeted too. The US climate is getting milder, not more extreme.”

 Record minimum daily temperatures (blue) and record daily maximum temperatures (red) have been falling “tremendously”, thus contradicting NCA report claims. Chart: Tony Heller here.
The computational methodology used by the NCA report authors is so dubious that Heller even goes on to wonder how “this sort of scientific garbage” ever got through peer-review. 
Consistent poor quality
Heller then singles out one of the authors of the report, known Texas Tech University climate activist/alarmist Katharine Hayhoe, reminding viewers that he has examined her work many times in the past and that the NCA report’s poor quality is consistent with that he has seen from Hayhoe in the past.
Heller’s makes his frustration with government funded climate science clear: “Government funded climate science is the biggest fraud in history.”
That statement by Heller could be disputed, however, as the history of government science fraud is long, tragic and has cost tens of millions of lives just in the last century alone. Other examples of government science fraud include eugenics, science of race, Lysenkoism, and the carbohydrate-promoting nutritional guidelines of the late 20th century, to name a few.
History indeed tells us to be very careful and skeptical about government-funded science.
One for the dustbin
President Trump should send this report to a thorough review by a panel of independent critical scientists.

"Australia’s role as a leader in the global fossil fuel trade is underscored by a report that finds it is the world’s third biggest exporter and fifth biggest miner of fossil-related emissions. While political debate sometimes emphasises that Australia is responsible for 1.2% of global emissions at home, the analysis by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute says it trails only Russia and Saudi Arabia in exporting fossil fuels. When exports and what is burned at home are combined, Australia ranks fifth behind China, the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia in responsibility for carbon dioxide from extractive fossil industries. The premise of the report – that Australia plays a greater role in the climate crisis than global greenhouse accounting rules suggest – is not new, but it goes further than some previous analyses in comparing exports emissions from different countries. Its release follows the prime minister, Scott Morrison, facing criticism at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu over Australia’s limited response to the climate crisis and refusal to commit to a rapid transition away from coal. The government and opposition both stress the importance of the coal export industry to the economy and employment. The institute’s report, by the senior researcher Tom Swann, challenges this, finding Australia’s economy is more diverse and less reliant on fossil fuels than that of most carbon exporters. It says Australia ranks 24th for carbon intensity across all exports, reflecting the broad range of goods it trades in. Australia is responsible for 7% of global fossil fuel exports based on their carbon dioxide potential. Its coal exports doubled between 2000 and 2015 and now make up 29% of the global coal trade. Liquefied natural gas exports tripled over the same timeframe to 6% of trade, and continue to increase. The report says exports are often downplayed in climate change policy as treaties focus on demand for carbon-intensive products rather than supply. This ignores that increasing supply and supply infrastructure can “lock in” emissions increases. “The scale of exports from countries like Australia bring into stark relief why efforts to reduce emissions must limit both demand and supply,” it says. In terms of domestic emissions, the report says Australia is the 14th biggest emitter despite having just 0.3% of the global population. It emits more greenhouse gas than 40 countries with bigger populations. While the government promises to cut carbon dioxide, national emissions have increased year-on-year since the abolition of a carbon price scheme in 2014. As a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia last week backed a call for countries to develop and release long-term low emissions development strategies by next year. The forum communique said this may include commitments and strategies to reach net zero emissions by 2050."
"Los Angeles can sometimes feel like a sprawling hellscape of heat: in the northern valleys and the southern city, metal playground equipment, car steering wheels, even the ground itself effectively become weaponized. The more than 300 days of sunshine a year that for generations have made LA such an attractive place to live and visit are becoming a grave liability due to the climate crisis. The city gets so murderously hot all year-round, its residents routinely suffer heat-related death even in winter. Last summer, city residents in endured some of its highest temperatures ever recorded. Worse is likely to come. LA’s hot inland areas are projected to experience twice as many extreme heat days by mid-century; University of Maryland researchers project, on current emissions, that by 2080 the climate will be as hot as Baja California, Mexico, is now. That heat is not equitably distributed across the city’s geography, or its income brackets: inland suburbs regularly reach over 100F (38C) while the beach is 78F (25.5C) and breezy; wealthier neighborhoods enjoy shade-dappled walkways and abundant air conditioning, while poorer ones are largely exposed to the heat, both outside and inside. “There can be a 25F (14C) difference in just four to five miles as the crow flies, and a very different temperature future,” said Jonathan Parfrey, executive director of nonprofit advocacy and coalition-building group Climate Resolve. “There has to be a variety of different strategies to help people cool down.” Los Angeles is embracing those strategies, in the vanguard of cities innovating to mitigate the damage of rising temperatures. But the challenges are substantial. Mayor Eric Garcetti has pledged to reduce the city’s temperature by 3F (1.6C) by 2050, as part of his updated climate adaptation plan. That will mean wrenching LA off its current heated trajectory, with temperatures in the region on pace to rise 3-5F (1.6-2.7C) by then. For Los Angeles, the changing climate means droughts will last longer and become more extreme, helping to fuel longer and more devastating wildfire seasons. Climate crisis will further diminish the already-taxed water stores upon which LA relies. At the same time, researchers expect more extreme “atmospheric rivers” – storms so massive they’re essentially waterways in the sky – that will infrequently, but decidedly, douse and overwhelm the city. Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. This year saw the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time.  This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities.  Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US Los Angeles must reconsider and reconstruct its infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends a multi-pronged, green infrastructure approach to combat the “urban heat island” effect, in which cities feel hotter than their greener, less populated surroundings. Some of that is now underway. The mayor’s climate adaptation plan includes a goal of increasing the total land area covered by cool surfaces by 10% by 2025, and 30% by 2045. Research from the Los Angeles Urban Cooling Collaborative found that infusing cooling measures in the built environment, from tree canopy to cool roofs to reflective streets, could reduce heat-related deaths in the city by 25%. “Health, transportation, buildings, social equity and justice – all manner of different expertise needs to be deployed to do this in the most effective way possible,” said Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance. “LA is one of the few cities that’s embraced the idea of being a test bed for all this stuff.” Few city projects have inspired as much apparent excitement as the pools of titanium dioxide-infused goo that Los Angeles has been spreading on its asphalt. “When we’re applying it, people come out and ask what we’re doing,” said Greg Spotts, assistant director of the Bureau of Street Services.  In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the LA Bureau of Street Services is hoping the reflective Cool Seal coating will reduce extreme heat in some of the city’s hottest neighborhoods. “Separate from the discussion about global warming, Angelenos’ experience is that their neighborhoods are getting hotter,” said Spotts. A one-quarter millimeter layer of Cool Seal costs about $0.60 per square foot, and can reduce surface street temperature by roughly 10F (5.5C). Spotts demonstrated the difference to the Guardian using a handheld infrared thermometer gun on a 98F (37C) day. We’ve noticed that even dogs and cats actually prefer to walk on the cool pavement coating “We’ve noticed that even dogs and cats actually prefer to walk on the cool pavement coating,” said Spotts. They’ll cross the street just to get to the cool stuff. In 2019, the agency expanded the experiment from single city blocks distributed across the region, to coating several blocks at a time in neighborhoods determined to be particularly vulnerable to urban heat based on local climate, lack of shade and economic disadvantages. “Originally, we thought this was about reducing air conditioning usage and the associated carbon emissions. But it’s really becoming more about public health,” said Spotts. Before cool streets, LA was the first city in the country to require cool roofs on new and renovated construction in order to reduce indoor temperatures without the use of air conditioning. The roofs worked so well, why not tackle the roads next? Streets make up about 15% of the city’s land, while parks comprise 13%. If heat-trapping, car-centric roads are one of LA’s biggest climate problems, they’re also a potential site of intervention. But the research on cool street cover leaves some open questions. According to a 2017 study, most cool pavement sealants were more resource-intensive than ordinary paving material. There’s also concern that staining on white roads could counteract their benefits. Alternatively, if they stay fresh and bright, some fear they could actually reflect the hot sun back at unsuspecting residents. Still, Spotts is undeterred. “The street is made of the same stuff it’s been made of since World War II,” said Spotts. “We think it’s time for cities and suppliers to experiment.” Permeable pavement is a far more subtle addition to LA’s climate resiliency schemes than cooling landcover. Unlike a gleaming white-coated street, the porous pavement and bioswales that catch and filter runoff don’t look like anything special. The dry wells that capture that water for reuse blend entirely into the urban landscape. On a tour of water-capturing green infrastructure, Kevin Ho, an LA city sanitation engineer, pointed to two metal covers set into the road, several feet in front of a massive storm drain. “When it rains, it’s like opening up a fire hydrant and pointing it down into the dry well – it just collects it all,” said Ho. “If possible, we would just put dry wells throughout the city.” In a partnership between the City Department of Water and Power, the Bureau of Sanitation and California State Coastal Conservancy, these experimental projects have been distributed across a handful of major thoroughfares and small residential side streets, with the goal of increasing local water security and reducing local heat. The mayor’s resilience plan calls for water infrastructure that “will ensure the city is prepared to handle both extreme wet and extreme dry years”. Right now, LA county gets 41% of its water from local underground aquifers and recycling – the goal is 50% by 2025. Permeable pavement, bioswales and dry wells can make the city better adapted to arid periods, and make flood-prone neighborhoods more resilient to superstorms. The distributed stormwater capture project in the San Fernando Valley stands to collect enough water to serve around 1,200 families per year. It’s a literal drop in the bucket, but the initiative is still in an early stage. “These projects are so spotty, and they’re at all different levels of green,” said Kara Kemmler, a coastal conservancy project manager. “I would love to see some more trees,” lamented Kemmler. “So you have that water capture, but create some shade, some carbon sequestration, some urban heat island mitigation while you have the opportunity. ” Creamy asphalt sealant lowers the surface temperature of a road roughly 10F. But the shade from a mature, leafy tree can provide more like 40-50F (22-28C) of cooling power, on top of sequestering carbon. “By and large the literature is kind of mixed on which one is ‘better’ – I’m a firm believer that we’ve got to do both,” said Edith de Guzman, executive director of the nonprofit Tree People. Trees seem to be the obvious adaptation fix to cool a city, recapture water runoff and increase local carbon capture. Earlier this month, the mayor’s office appointed LA’s first forest officer to oversee increasing the city’s canopy by at least 50% by 2028 in areas that currently have the least shade. “There’s all manner of state or other funding sources that will allow for tree planting to occur. But this is an asset that needs to be maintained,” said de Guzman. Instead of unilaterally taking on the project of greening LA, Tree People trains those who want to green their own neighborhoods, thus creating a network of tree-passionate planters and waterers. But compared to pouring reflective or permeable concrete, or installing a cool roof, planted greenery by its nature conflicts with the gray environment. Planting comes second to vehicle sightlines in the sprawling car-centric metropolis. And over time, the shallow roots on many of LA’s trees have torn up the pavement. The city recently settled a lawsuit that will require a $1.4bn investment in sidewalk, ramp and crosswalk repairs in order to make them disability-accessible. That settlement could provide an opportunity to green the city better by choosing more deep-rooted species. LA appears committed to a greener, shadier future – but the city has fallen short in past efforts to create cool cover. Trees have gone unplanted. Bus shelters have gone unbuilt. The city is losing transit riders to car travel, and climate crisis could only make it worse. A pilot at one large northwest valley transit station will create a variety of heat-beating infrastructure to make transit more attractive. “If you knew you’d be completely in the shade, that there was water waiting for you at the train station, wouldn’t that be an easier place for people to take transit?” said Parfrey. Just as LA’s critical warming is not evenly distributed, neither are its heat-relieving elements. You can see this green gap in aerial photos of the city: Wealthier neighborhoods are shielded by foliage, while poorer ones are exposed to the sun – sometimes by design, in order to provide clear sight lines for surveillance cameras. The gap in heat-beating infrastructure creates an inequitable distribution of health risk. While the city takes local wealth into account when determining where to install new heat-mitigating infrastructure, intracity inequality is not so easily paved over, from uninsulated buildings to higher proportional energy costs to longer waits at those unsheltered bus stops. “If you want to look at a single issue that separates the haves from the have-nots, it’s heat,” said Shickman. “Every negative effect of heat hits low income neighborhoods and people of color more.” Even for a city as apparently determined as Los Angeles, the investments and cultural change necessary to retrofit so much gray infrastructure are hard won. These projects are all still in a nascent stage. But every square inch of green infrastructure contributes to better adapting it to a hotter future. “We’re aware of the projections out there and the reality that we are in for a fairly scary trajectory for continued heating. We are expecting more mortality, more illness,” said de Guzman. “But while we adapt we also have a recognition that there’s an inherently optimistic way that we can go about the situation that we’ve been handed.” Climate advocates here see their role as two-fold: an urgency to green a gray LA and save lives, and to inspire greater climate action at the same time. “Of course, urban heat island isn’t the same thing as climate change. But there’s something we can do in the interim, and we hope cooling down the city is a gateway to more activism and awareness,” said Parfrey. “Because this is a marathon.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

Weather and climate analyst Schneefan (Snow Fan) here at wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de reports that the German DWD national weather service recently issued its 5th overheated press release in a row to report the preliminary monthly/seasonal mean temperatures.
In all five press releases the mean temperatures provided were wrong in the sense they had been overheated!
Five press releases with overheated “preliminary” results
For example on February 27, 2018, the DWD also released its preliminary temperature summary for both February 2018 and the 2017/18 winter (December-January-February). In each the mean temperatures had been overstated by 0.1°C and were later corrected (quietly) downward.
Also the preliminary temperature results for January, 2018, made public in the late January press release were overstated by 0.1°C, Schneefan writes.
The same was true for March, 2018, as well. In late March the DWD press release with the preliminary results stated that the mean temperature for the month was 2.5°C, or 1.9°C below the 1981-2010 mean. Later that temperature got corrected to 2.4°C, or 1.9°C below the 1981-2010 30-year mean.
Finally, just recently, the DWD issued it’s press release with the preliminary results for April, 2018. Here the press release stated that April in Germany was the hottest recorded since measurements began in 1881. According to the DWD, the mean temperature was 12.4°C for the month, some 4°C above the 1981-2010 mean. Now it turns out that the mean was actually 12.3°C and not 12.4°C.
Overheated results make better headlines
As to why the DWD preliminary temperature results always need to be corrected downwards later is a mystery. DWD press releases are issued as soon as the preliminary results are available, just before the month ends, and not when the real results are known. Almost every press release comes out with overheated temperature results, and so provide for hotter headlines.

Press releases to inform the public about the later corrected (cooler) results are never issued.
As warm 200 years ago
Even a tenth of a degree can make a difference. For example, one of the oldest datasets comes from the station at Hohenspeißenberg, near Offenbach, which goes back to 1791!

Chart: Josef Kowatsch (EIKE).
Even during the time of Goethe, in the year 1800, April at this station was as hot as it was this year. Overall, temperatures at Hohenspeißenberg have only been elevated over the past dozen or so years. Now should the 12.2°C reading of April, 2018, get corrected downward (as the DWD has a habit of doing), then it won’t be a new record.
Exaggerating by using outdated reference period
Also the DWD has the habit of comparing German mean temperatures to the much cooler 1961-1990 mean, a practice that no one uses globally. Schneefan comments:
We see that the management of the DWD has not observed the WMO guideline in that it uses the outdated (colder) 1961-1990 climate period instead of the (warmer) 1981-2010 climate period in order to generate more positive – and thus more false – deviations to show a warming in Germany that does not exist in reality.
Through this intentional alarmist false reporting, regional stagnations and even declines in temperature in Germany are getting obscured, and that at the cost of the taxpayer.”

"The prime minister of Tuvalu is considering pulling his country out of Australia’s seasonal worker program, after comments by Australia’s deputy prime minister that Pacific islanders threatened by climate change would survive because “many of their workers come here and pick our fruit”. “I thought the Australian labour scheme was determined on mutual respect, that Australia was also benefiting,” Enele Sopoaga told RNZ. “We are not crawling below that. If that’s the view of the government, then I would have no hesitation in pulling back the Tuvaluan people as from tomorrow.” Sopoaga’s comments came after the Guardian revealed that Michael McCormack, who was acting prime minister while Scott Morrison attended the forum in Tuvalu, said on Friday: “I also get a little bit annoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive. “They’ll continue to survive because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit.” The seasonal worker program employs people from a handful of Pacific countries, as well as Timor-Leste, in the agriculture and tourism sectors on visas of up to nine months at a time. There have been more than 25,000 placements of seasonal workers since the program started in July 2012, with nearly 8,500 visas issued in 2017-18. While Tuvalu, which has a population of around 11,000, represents a very small share of the seasonal worker program, with only around 30 visas issued to Tuvaluans since the scheme began, Sopoaga told RNZ he would summon Australia’s high commissioner to Tuvalu to explain McCormack’s comments, and if he was not satisfied with her explanation of what McCormack said, he would cancel the program and encourage other Pacific countries to do the same. Sopoaga added his voice to that of Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who told the Guardian on Friday night that he found McCormack’s comments “very insulting”. “That was insulting when he said the people of the Pacific will never die because they come and pick fruit in Australia, that’s very insulting,” he said. “It’s very insulting, but I get the impression that that’s the sentiment brought across by the prime minister. I could feel it yesterday.” Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said he had “definitely no comment” on McCormack’s statement. Vanuatu represents the second-largest bloc of people taking up visas through the seasonal worker program, with 2,150 visas issued to people from the country in 2016-2017."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming scientists continue struggling to find an explanation for the nearly 2 decades long global warming pause that has taken hold of the planet since the late 1990s.
The most recent temperature spike was due to the natural El Nino event at the equatorial Pacific, and that has disappeared over the last months. Alarmists claim that the global temperature is still 0.5°C above normal, yet it’s been so for the past 20 years!
Cooling signs abound
The search to explain the unexpected lack of warming is about to get a little tougher as 2018 is poised to see a further cooling across the globe. Signs of this cool-off are showing up in Greenland, the Arctic, Antarctica, Greenland and all across the northern hemisphere. A huge swath of North America has started 2018 with record cold.
La Nina to persist until spring
Another major reason cooler global surface temperatures are expected in 2018 is the now strengthening La Nina event taking place as equatorial Pacific surface temperatures have plummeted by 1-2°C since June of this year. This means that global cooling lies ahead for the planet in the months ahead. The latest forecast sees La Nina conditions extending into next spring:

There is a lag of about 6 months between the ocean surface temperature and satellite global lower troposphere temperatures. That means the la Nina low forecast for January, 2018, will start showing up in the temperatures by late spring (NH).
Cooling Pacific and Indian Ocean far more signficant
Alarmists also like hollering about the current unusual warmth at the poles. But veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi tweets here that the “warmth” at the poles is not what we need to be looking at, writing that “far more significant” is the cooler area from the Indian ocean through Africa, the Atlantic, South America and the Pacific.

Cooling where it’s warm and humid a bigger deal in future global temp considerations.”
In a nutshell, a cool square kilometer over the equatorial Pacific far outweighs a warm square kilometer over the North Pole. All that red coloring scientists like to use to make the poles look hot is mostly hype.
Solar activity near 200-year low
In the current solar cycle 24 sunspot activity is now at the lowest level in almost 200 years. In the early 1800s the Earth found itself in the grips of the Dalton Minimum, a cold period with similarly low solar activity:
The accumulated sunspot anomaly from the mean of the previous 23 cycles – 107 months into the cycle.
A number of distinguished scientists and dozens of scientific publications warn that the planet may in fact be entering a period of global cooling. There were 7 such papers in 2017 alone.
One of the great scientific blunders of modern times
The upcoming solar cycle 25 also is expected to be a weak one, which bodes ill for the planet for the next 10 to 15 years. The current solar cycle 24 is the third weakest since the systematic observation of solar cycle activity began in 1755. Only solar cycles no. 5 and 6 (1798 – 1823 during the Dalton Minimum) were weaker.
As the above chart shows, weak solar cycles are linked to cool periods and come in bunches, alternating with the warm solar cycle bunches. It’s little wonder that the last 100 years have seen a warming, as cycles 17-23 were all above normal. If the pattern holds, cycle 26, and possibly even cycle 27, will also be below normal, which points to a cooling 21st century.
Ironically policymakers, in typical inept fashion, may be erroneously preparing societies for the completely wrong scenario and thus be unwittingly committing one of the great scientific blunders of modern times.

==================================
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On July 4 in the journal Atmospheric and Climate Sciences an article by Maxim Ogurtsov, Markus Lindholm  and Risto Jalkanen appeared and addressed an important issue. The warming of the last 150 years after the Little Ice Age is often gladly viewed as having 100% anthropogenic causes. Of course this makes little sense because the Little Ice Age was the coldest period of the last 10,000 years and was caused by natural factors such as solar weak phases and volcanic eruptions.
“IPCC makes a large mistake”
And when the sun again strengthens and volcanic eruptions remain at low levels, the earth warms up again. That there is an anthropogenic warming component of course should not be disputed. The warming of the last 150 years is due to a mix of natural and anthropogenic causes. Here the IPCC makes a large mistake when it assumes that the warming has been 100% anthropogenic.
In the study, Ogurtsov and fellow scientists compare the modern warming to the temperature history of the last 10,000 years. Here they find that there had been only a few similar warming phases when looking at the warming of the past 135 years. If one however considers that only half of that warming was natural, then similar warming phases occur on average every few centuries. The authors conclude that the natural component in the models must be taken into account much more. And conversely the role anthropogenic factors must be reduced correspo0ndingly so that a more accurate picture is attained when compared to the real temperature development.
The Abstract:
On the Possible Contribution of Natural Climatic Fluctuations to the Global Warming of the Last 135 Years
A number of numerical experiments with artificial random signals (the second order autoregressive processes), which have important statistical pro- perties similar to that of the observed instrumental temperature (1850-2015), were carried out. The results show that in frame of the selected mathematical model the return period of climatic events, analogous to the current global warming (linear increase of temperature for 0.95˚C during the last 135 years) is 2849-5180 years (one event per 2849-5180 years). This means that global warming (GW) of the last 135 years can unlikely be fully explained by inherent oscillations of the climatic system. It was found however, that natural fluctuations of climate may appreciably contribute to the GW. The return period of climatic episodes with 0.5˚C warming during the 135 years (half of the observed GW) was less than 500 years. The result testifies that the role of external factors (emission of greenhouse gases, solar activity etc.) in the GW could be less than often presumed.”

The London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) recently announced Professor Ole Humlum of Norway was joining its Academic Advisory Council.
This brings another persuasive voice to the influential think tank.

Dr. Ole Humlum is a former Professor of Physical Geography at the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway, and Emeritus Professor of Physical Geography at the University of Oslo. He is a member of the Norwegian Scientific Academy for Polar Research. Photo: GWPF.
The GWPF appointment is a move that climate science critics say will deliver some much needed sobriety to a science that has too frequently found itself immersed in activism, hysterical projections and alarmism.
In the wake of his appointment, Prof. Humlum answered some questions on climate science posed by NTZ via social media.
Sea level rise projections overblown

Concerning global sea level rise, Prof. Humlum believes the planet will see only “8-15 cm rise by the year 2100”. And though most scientists agree man is warming the planet through CO2 emissions by burning fossil fuels, Prof. Humlum wrote that the figure for CO2 climate sensitivity is completely in dispute.
Natural factors at play, modest cooling ahead
On what has driven the climate change observed over the past 40 years, Prof. Humlum wrote that it goes far beyond just CO2 and that the sun, clouds and oceans have played huge roles. Over the coming decades he thinks the planet will cool, but that “it won’t be dramatic”.
Concerning whether the 20th century warming has led to more weather extremes today, he answered: “No, not according to statistics known by me.”
“Natural climatic variations dominate”
He summarized:
On the global scale natural climatic variations dominate over effects caused by man. Climate models often claim to incorporate natural variations, but this is not correct, as can be shown by statistical analyses. Thus, the argument that only by assuming a large effect of CO2 can climate models reproduce global climate change since 1950 is invalid.”
Bringing expertise to climate science
Prof. Humlum has authored or co-authored some 100 publications on climate related topics. Few scientists are able to claim having such a broad and valuable interdisciplinary knowledge that Professor Humlum possesses. His specialties include:

Glacial- and periglacial geomorphology
Landforms derived from bedrock weathering, with emphasis on rock glaciers
Reconstruction of Quaternary ice sheets, glaciers in the North Atlantic region
Historical and modern climatology of the Arctic and North Atlantic region
The impact of climate on societies the North Atlantic region

"Between record heat and rain, this summer’s weather patterns have indicated, once again, that the climate is changing. US cities, where more than 80% of the nation’s population lives, are disproportionately hit by these changes, not only because of their huge populations but because of their existing – often inadequate – infrastructure. Maybe in 50 or 60 years, living in some cities will be unbearable In urban areas, heatwaves are exacerbated by vehicles, industrial processes and the presence of heat-retaining concrete and asphalt. And it is in cities – especially in low-lying poorer areas – where record rainfall often accumulates. “People are coming into urban areas and they cannot be stopped,” says Chandana Mitra, an associate professor of geosciences at Auburn University, who studies the impact of heat on cities. Mitra has experienced the impact of climate change in her hometown of Kolkata, India, and is now observing it in Auburn, Alabama, and nearby Birmingham. “Everyone aspires to be in an urban area and there is chaos.” While the impacts of climate change are fundamentally local, experts say heat is one of the most concerning, especially in cities. “From a disaster perspective, [heat] is invisible,” says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance. Mitra likens the problem to having a finger in a pan of water while someone gradually turns up the heat. “Maybe in 50 or 60 years, living in some cities will be unbearable. There could be a tipping point of no return.” Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. This year saw the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time.  This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities.  Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US A study by the University of Maryland published this year predicts that by 2080, Denver will be as hot and wet as Borger, Texas, about 50 miles (80km) north of Amarillo; Philadelphia will feel warmer and drier – more like Memphis, Tennessee, and New York City will be up to 9F (5C) warmer, with a climate similar to Jonesboro, Arkansas. The study, which accompanies a tool that allows US users to find what their city will be like by 2080, shows that if emissions continue at the current pace residents in cities around the nation will: • Experience an average temperature increase of 8.2F (4.5C) • Live in climates similar to the current climates of cities 528 miles (850kms) south of their hometowns Increasing heat, either now or in the future, is an issue cities are beginning to understand better, says Shickman who started the Global Cool Cities Alliance in 2011. Since that time, there’s been a huge increase in awareness of heat and urban heat islands, he says. “The issue now is, ‘OK, this is a uniquely challenging problem, and how do we develop policy and implement solutions’.” With a string of subsequent record hot years and increasing flooding, cities are already dealing with the impacts of a changing climate: Deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 658 people die every year from heat-related causes. From 1999 to 2010, 8,081 heat-related deaths were reported in the United States and occurred more commonly among older, younger and poorer populations. Urban heat islands retain heat overnight, preventing people from sleeping well and leading to even more health problems, says Lucy Hutyra, an associate professor of earth and environment at Boston University. Air pollution is often worst on hot days, and when people leave windows open for air flow, the quality of the air can cause respiratory problems. Warmer, moister conditions also mean that heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding is on the rise; so far this year 78 people have died as a result, according to the National Weather Service. Power outages. As experienced by New Yorkers this year, excessive heat in conjunction with excess demand for electricity for air conditioning can cause the grid – or portions of it – to fail. “Energy demand is going to go up,” says Shickman. “It’s a substantial and nonlinear reaction. Our grid is going to be taxed in ways I don’t think we are prepared for.” Shickman says that going from an 80F day to a 90F day would require an additional 20-25% power. Going to 95F requires almost 40% more power. Excess heat can also evaporate water needed to cool power plants, forcing some out of commission. Infrastructure failures. In addition to electricity grid problems, asphalt can melt in excess temperatures; rail tracks expand; and can even affect airports – currently some airplanes can’t take off from Phoenix airport, for example, when the temperature exceeds 118F because the air is too thin. Heat is a problem for all areas of city governance, said Shickman. “If you ask any sort of department head what is your biggest challenge, heat is probably not number one, but I guarantee you it’s somewhere between number two and number five.” But, he says, unfortunately there are no “heat czars” to manage the issue. Flooding, too, can wreak havoc on a city’s infrastructure, from blowing out bridges and roads to inundating water treatment plants. Economic Impact. According to a 2018 study by Texas A&M University: “The growing number of extreme rainfall events that produce intense precipitation are resulting in –and will continue to result in – increased urban flooding unless steps are taken to mitigate their impacts.” The 2017 National Climate Assessment concluded: “Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades …[and that] … increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.” Between 2007 and 2011 alone, urban flooding in Cook County, Illinois, resulted in over 176,000 claims or flood losses at a cost of $660m (£545m). Becoming aware of the threat of heat and other climate changes is one thing. But doing something about it is difficult with limited budgets and multiple priorities, and “there is no one solution,” says Shickman. With that in mind, here are some of the ways cities are addressing heat and extreme precipitation. Communication. In New York City, home health aides are being trained to recognize the signs of heat stress with their clients. In Auburn and Birmingham, Mitra talks to churches, service groups and individuals about urban heat islands, individual carbon footprints and solutions. One of her students is developing an app around the issue, while another group is working on an Alabama specific YouTube channel to communicate about climate breakdown-related problems and solutions. “Many people in Alabama have yet to realize the rate at which things have been changing,” Mitra says. The Texas A&M study recommends better communication and coordination between federal, state and local agencies to address the problem of urban flooding. Trees, plants and green infrastructure. Trees not only offer shade, but they cool the air by evaporating water. Adding more plants and trees, like New York City has done with its million tree program, can reduce the temperature of a city as well as soak up excess stormwater. Hutyra says such an approach won’t work everywhere – Los Angeles had numerous problems with its one million tree program in part, because of the city’s water scarcity. But areas of the northeast with plenty of water can fill empty tree wells and better develop parks and greenways to mitigate the heat. One of Mitra’s favorite solutions is urban gardens. She points to Atlanta, which is working to develop a seven acre food forest that will also help reduce carbon footprint. Restoring or widening waterways, as is being done with Houston’s Brays Bayou, can provide cooler greenspaces, as well as capacity for excess stormwater. Cool roofs and pavement. “At a minimum all roofs should be white with the exception of solar and green roofs,” says Shickman, whose Global Cool Cities Alliance has launched the One Million Cool Roofs Challenge. White or light colored roofs reflect heat and can lower the overall temperature in a city as well as making individual buildings and homes cooler. According to one study, significant lightening of roofs and pavements could reduce temperatures in Chicago by 2.7F (1.5C). After Louisville, Kentucky, was identified as one of the fastest heating cities, local government began offering rebates for cool roofs in low income communities. San Antonio offers help for low-income residents to replace older roofs with lighter colored shingles and a thermal barrier, providing up to $1,000 per household a year in energy savings, Shickman says. He adds that in terms of infrastructure changes, Los Angeles is leading efforts on cool pavements, testing reflective coating on 17 blocks of the city and helping to refine pavement products. Air conditioning. While the least optimal solution, air conditioning is the most realistic one to beat the heat, says Hutyra. Air conditioning can raise the temperatures within cities through its waste heat and, when powered by fossil fuels, can contribute to the problem of climate change. But Hutyra says a more distributed electricity grid with energy from renewable sources could help alleviate some of those concerns. Cities in the future, Hutyra says, won’t be unliveable, “They just will be different. I think how we play and live and move in cities today isn’t how we did 20 years ago. I think in the face of these large changes in climate coming our way ... I think it will reshape what our cities look like and how we live in them.” Pam Radtke Russell is a senior editor at Engineering News-Record, in New Orleans and a specialist on climate adaptation Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"
"Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington and a 2020 Democratic hopeful, has dropped out of the presidential race. Inslee, who launched his campaign in March with a singular focus on fighting climate change, announced he was suspending his campaign during an appearance on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show on Wednesday.  Inslee, 68, had struggled to gain traction in the sprawling Democratic presidential field and was unlikely to qualify for the next month’s debate in Houston, Texas. Inslee told MSNBC it had “become clear” he would not be the Democratic party’s nominee and was thus withdrawing his candidacy, following in the footsteps of the California representative Eric Swalwell and the former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper. “It’s become clear that I’m not going to be carrying the ball,” Inslee said. “I’m not going to be the president, so I’m withdrawing tonight from the race.” Inslee said he would make an announcement on Thursday about “the future of his political career”, including whether he would seek re-election as the governor of Washington state. Inslee had dubbed climate change “the most urgent challenge of our time” and largely ran to elevate the issue to the center of the political discourse. Although he appeared in the first two Democratic primary debates, Inslee fell short of the requirements for the third debate in September, as well as a CNN town hall dedicated to climate change – despite it being his signature issue. “I’ve been fighting climate change for 25 years, and I’ve never been so confident of the ability of America now to reach critical mass to move the ball,” Inslee said Wednesday. “I believe we are going to have a candidate to fight this battle.”"
"As Greta Thunberg sets sail across the Atlantic to the United Nations in New York, the backlash against her has been as vicious as it is has been inevitable. According to the Australian conservative climate-change denier Andrew Bolt, she is “deeply disturbed”, “freakishly influential” and “strange”. In a nasty, brutish and short tweet, the former Ukip funder, Arron Banks, simply said, “Freak yachting accidents do happen in August …” Controversialist columnist Brendan O’Neill wrote that there was “something chilling” about Thunberg, who “increasingly looks and sounds like a cult member”. The attacks on Thunberg look like a kind of displacement activity rooted in fear that what she says might be true We live in such venomous times that these levels of vitriol are disturbingly common. But it is not at all normal to level such personal attacks at a 16-year-old with multiple mental health issues campaigning to make the world a better place. Banks’s protest that “you lefties have no sense of humour” is as shabby as Donald Trump’s “locker-room banter” defence of his flagrant misogyny. O’Neill says Thunberg is a “poor young woman” whose transformation by others into a “messiah” is “unforgivable”, as though that makes his descriptions of her “monotone voice” and “look of apocalyptic dread” nothing personal. The ferocity of the attacks demands an explanation, but it also raises questions for those who have built up her up and inadvertently helped make her a target. Shooting the messenger is, of course, a tried and tested way of dealing with bad news. The case that the anthropogenic climate crisis is real and urgent is now so strong that it’s pretty much the only tactic left for those who refuse to accept it. Thunberg is a particularly tempting target. Bolt made much of the fact that she is “someone with disorders which intensify fears”. This is deeply reassuring for people who think anyone who is afraid for the future of the planet is overreacting. “Eco-anxiety” can be dismissed as a pathology rather than as a rational response to a growing emergency. Thunberg has become exhibit A for those like O’Neill who want to rebrand the environmental cause as “climate-change alarmism”. They see in Thunberg someone who makes this dismissive charge seem plausible. Why try to criticise thousands of sober, grownup scientists when you can have a go at a pig-tailed Young Turk instead? You wonder about the psychological motivations of those who have set upon Thunberg so thuggishly. It looks like a kind of displacement activity rooted in fear that what she says might be true. Instead of engaging with the argument they wrestle with the arguer. Such speculation is tempting but it’s ultimately beside the point. Getting personal is a sure sign you’re losing the argument so we should not get personal back. Whatever their motives, their actions betray a moral and intellectual bankruptcy. However, the uncomfortable question for Thunberg’s supporters is whether their virtual canonisation of her has presented a gift to their opponents. Making a young and idealistic teenager the figurehead of a movement makes it too easy to dismiss the campaign as a whole as naive and idealistic. Indeed, the commentator Christopher Caldwell, who is supportive of the cause, worries that the rallying around Thunberg reflects a refusal to engage with complexity. “People have had enough of balance and perspective,” he wrote in the New York Times, “They want single-minded devotion to the task at hand.” That is exactly what Thunberg has come to represent. The French philosopher Raphaël Enthoven hinted at another problem in a Delphic tweet in which he called her “an anti-product product” that we use to buy virtue with our support and retweets without actually having to do anything ourselves. Many of those who ostentatiously bid her bon voyage across the Atlantic are hardly strangers to airports. “When you consume Greta, you do not help the planet,” wrote Enthoven. “You play the game of the system that destroys it.” Sanctification also makes reasonable disagreement from people on her side more difficult. Most notably Thunberg has frequently framed the issue as an intergenerational conflict. “Young people must hold older generations accountable for the mess they have created,” she tweeted last December. “We need to get angry, and transform that anger into action.” Many older people resent being blamed for the climate crisis. Even if you agree that we should take our share of responsibility, what matters most now is clearing up the mess, not squabbling over who caused it. Thunberg herself should not be blamed for the way in which she has been built up into something bigger than any person can be. On this, she and her fellow campaigners have been more clear-sighted than their adult fans. Before heading to the UN she said of leaders such as Trump that “instead of speaking to me and the school-striking children and teenagers they should be talking to actual scientists and experts in this area”. Mai Sheehan, a 16-year-old fellow activist from Ireland, told the FT that Thunberg “has always been very specific that she is not the leader” and that “all our decisions are made on a consensus basis”. Thunberg has been clearer than anyone that it is a mistake to place too much attention on her. “I think there is a lot of focus on me as an individual and not on the climate itself,” she told the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. “I think we should focus more on the climate issue because this is not about me.” Thunberg has done infinitely more in a few short years to improve humanity’s prospects than I have done or will do in a lifetime. Lionising her doesn’t help the cause. But the excessive zealotry of some of her supporters is a trifling fault compared to the egregious attacks by critics who would rather take her on than the inconvenient truths she brings. • Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher"
"The British government has privately appealed to senior Coalition ministers – including Angus Taylor and Marise Payne – to develop a more “ambitious” climate policy, amid growing concern Australia is not doing enough to cut emissions. As the government fends off criticism from Pacific island nations about its climate policies, Guardian Australia can reveal that the UK’s high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, has met with both ministers in recent months, and has conveyed Britain’s view that it wants all countries, including Australia, to increase their climate ambitions. The UK has prioritised climate action, and last month became the first G7 country to legislate a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Since 1990, the UK has reduced emissions by more than 40%, while the economy has grown by around 70%. It is understood the high commissioner’s meeting with Taylor, who is the government’s emissions reduction minister, took place in early July and discussed the future of Australia’s energy policy after the Coalition dumped its proposed national energy guarantee in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership. A bilateral meeting between Treadell and Payne, the foreign minister, also raised the need for more ambitious climate action, which has become a key concern of Pacific island nations, some of which face an existential threat from rising sea levels. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, last week fended off criticism about Australia’s climate position at the Pacific Islands Forum after refusing to endorse a statement that had called for a quicker transition to renewable energy and a pledge to end coal-fired power. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While Australia committed $500m in aid money to help respond to the climate emergency in the region, it has rebuffed calls for bolder emissions reduction targets and not to use carry-over credits to meet its 2030 Paris emissions reduction targets. Like Australia, the UK is also stepping up its diplomatic activities in the Pacific region, opening new posts in Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga through what it has termed a Pacific “uplift” program. A spokesman for the UK high commission in Canberra said the call for more ambitious action on the climate emergency did not just apply to Australia. “No countries’ targets have been ambitious enough and every country needs to do more, including both the UK and Australia,” the spokesman said. “The UK government believes we have a moral duty to leave this world in better condition than that which we inherited, which is why we have set ourselves a target of net zero emissions by 2050.” The intervention comes as the Morrison government faces further international pressure to do more on climate, with the UN hosting a climate summit in New York next month, followed by the annual COP (Conference of the Parties) meeting for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees global emissions targets. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has asked world leaders to demonstrate at the September summit that they have plans for achieving zero emissions by 2050. Next year, the annual COP will likely be held in London, where Australia can be expected to face further pressure from Britain and other signatories to bolster its climate targets."

Have Now Infected The PSMSL Tide Gauge Data


In a new paper published in Earth Systems and Environment this month, Australian scientists Dr. Albert Parker and Dr. Clifford Ollier uncover evidence that Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) overseers appear to have been engaging in the “highly questionable” and “suspicious” practice of adjusting historical tide gauge data to show recent accelerated sea level rise where no such acceleration (or rise) exists.
Extensive evidence from “tide gauges, coastal morphology, stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, archaeological remains, and historical documentation” all suggest that sea levels in the Indian Ocean have effectively been stable in recent decades.
The authors expose how PSMSL  data-adjusters make it appear that stable sea levels can be rendered to look like they are nonetheless rising at an accelerated pace.
The data-adjusters take misaligned and incomplete sea level data from tide gauges that show no sea level rise (or even a falling trend).  Then, they subjectively and arbitrarily cobble them together, or realign them.   In each case assessed, PSMSL data-adjusters lower the earlier misaligned rates and raise the more recent measurements.  By doing so, they concoct a new linearly-rising trend.

This adjustment of tide gauge data to yield a rising sea level trend where none exists is not occasional or episodic.  Instead, for every adjustment of raw data analyzed, “the adjustments are always in the direction to produce a large rise in sea level.”
The suspicious perpetuity of this pattern strongly suggests that there is an agenda driving these arbitrary and subjective realignments.
From all appearances, the data-adjusters at PSMSL are attempting to “correct” the sea level rise data that do not support the conceptualization of a rapidly-rising sea level trend in response to rising human CO2 emissions.
As Drs. Parker and Ollier conclude: “It is always highly questionable to shift data collected in the far past without any proven new supporting material.”
Apparently not even tide gauge measurements can be spared from those who tendentiously fiddle with raw data to satisfy an agenda.

Parker and Ollier, 2017
‘Multiple Lines Of Evidence’ Affirm Sea Levels Are Stable In The Indian Ocean
The tide gauge result of Aden is perfectly consistent not only with the tide gauge results for Karachi and Mumbai. It is also consistent with the multiple lines of evidence, tide gauges, coastal morphology, stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, archaeological remains, and historical documentation, for a stable sea level of about zero mm/year experienced over the last 50 years in all the key sites of the Indian Ocean (Mörner 2007, 2010, 2014, 2015a, b, 2016a, b).
Contrary to the adjusted data from tide gauges and the unreliable satellite altimeter data, properly examined data from tide gauges and other sources such as coastal morphology, stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, archaeological remains, and historical documentation indicate a lack of any alarming sea-level rise in recent decades for all the Indian Ocean.
The new alignment of the data 1878–1936 and 1937–1994 seems by far superior to the one proposed by PSMSL. The aligned metric data 1878–1994 show a trend of − 0.05 mm/year, i.e., nearly perfect stability.

Stable Sea Levels Are Transformed Into Positive Trends Via Arbitrary Adjustments To Past Data
What is proposed as a single record in databases such as the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) is often the composition of data collected by different instruments, sometimes in different locations or over different time windows, with significant gaps in between one measurement and the others.  … While adjustments are certainly necessary to produce a tide gauge record that may be analysed to infer a trend of the local relative sea level, the way that the alignment is performed may introduce rising or decreasing trends even where the true sea level is oscillating without any trend. How can we perform a proper alignment of data when there are gaps of years and the tide gauge has been moved, destroyed, or replaced?

This is the case of the Aden, Yemen tide gauge that is the only tidal location of the Arabian Peninsula spanning a time window long enough to infer a trend and acceleration of the relative sea level (assuming there was continuous measurement and no quality issue). In Aden, similar to Karachi and Mumbai and other tide gauges of the area, a single-tide gauge record is the result of multiple sets of data subjectively coupled together. While a new tide gauge is recording since about 2007, the alignment of the previous data is continuously changing.
The sea levels in India, including Mumbai, and in Karachi, Pakistan, have been recently analysed and discussed in Parker and Ollier (2015) and in Parker (2016). In both cases, it was shown that the latest positive trends in the PSMSL RLR [revised local reference, adjusted] data are only the result of arbitrary alignments, and alternative and more legitimate alignments reveal very stable sea-level conditions.
The metric (raw) data show misaligned results. The metric data are the data as originally provided, or suffering from historical adjustments. What are more dangerous are the corrections recently introduced to the past to magnify the sea-level trend or the acceleration. As shown in the prior section, the adjustments introduced by PSMSL to make the RLR [revised local reference, or adjusted data] are arbitrary in Aden, Karachi, and Mumbai.
It is always highly questionable to shift data collected in the far past without any proven new supporting material. In the case of Aden, we analyse the PSMSL alignments starting from the unaligned metric data, introducing possible break-points when there has been a change of tide gauge or there has been a suspicious alignment, and enforcing break-point alignment when connecting sets of data spanning sufficiently long-time windows.
While the metric data do not tell us, which is the correct trend, they tell us that the alignments made to produce the RLR [revised local reference, or adjusted data] are very likely wrong, because they are inconsistent with the individual measurements components, none of which showing any sign of increasing sea levels, and because the adjustments are always in the direction to produce a large rise in sea level.

Examples Of Stable/Negative Sea Level Trends Re-aligned To Create Positive Trends
Realignments of past data and addition of new data possibly misaligned have, therefore, increased the trend to + 3.02 mm/year from + 1.21 mm/year.
Differences with prior studies in the literature based on data sets not available any more are even more striking.  Pirazzoli (1986) noticed that the record for Mumbai between 1952 and 1962 reversed the entire rising trend for the previous 30 years.  Per Douglas (1991), the sea-level trend in Mumbai over the time window 1930–1980 was negative, − 0.3 mm/year.  In the latest PSMSL RLR, over the same time window, it is + 0.52 mm/year.
The RLR data for Aden, Yemen, show that the misaligned measurements have been composed to produce a high trend, high acceleration record. After the latest PSMSL corrections and addition to generate the RLR data, there is a trend of + 1.28 mm/year and a large acceleration of + 0.0164 mm/year2 in the 134 years long but 50% complete tide gauge record.
Within the short time window 1937–1969, the trend has been increased to + 2.60 mm/year from the + 1.89 mm/year of the previously misaligned data. One would have expected the data 1937–1956 to be shifted up vs. the data 1957–1969. The adjustment has done just the opposite, and the data are being shifted down. Similarly, the data before 1937 have all been shifted down. The data collected since 2007 have not been moved vs. the data collected 1957–1969.
Notice especially that the data 1878–1936 are closed by the December month, and the data 1937–1994 start with the January month, so there is virtually no time gap, yet there is a 677-mm sudden difference between the measurements collected before and after the so-called break-point. From the raw data, Mumbai exhibits a very small rate of rise since 2005. If we look at the metric raw data, we may notice that the trend 1878–1936 is a + 0.60 mm/year, while the trend 1937–1995 is largely negative, − 0.72 mm/year. Combining the two trends, one would expect over the longer time window 1878–1936 a small negative trend.
In the RLR data, the small negative trend 1878–1995 is transformed [into] a + 0.68 mm/year positive trend, that with the latest data 2005–2011 further increases to + 0.80 mm/year.
Karachi seems to suffer from the same issues as Aden, with four misaligned sets of data: 1916–1920; 1937–1948; 1957–1995; 2007–2014.  These data show individually very little rise, and a lowering in the longest continuous record. Then, the RLR has a large trend introduced by arbitrary alignment. The metric trend 1957–1995 is negative, − 2.67 mm/year. In the RLR, the trend 1916–2014 is now + 1.85 mm/year. This is the result of the measurements 1916–1920 having been shifted down, the data 1937–1948 shifted down vs. 1957–1995, and the data from the novel tide gauge relocated in another place claimed to be aligned with the old tide gauge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Energiewende threatens to follow a similar path as the Berlin-Brandenburg airport debacle, but on a far greater scale. When bureaucrats take over project engineering...
Berlin-Brandenburg BER airport: Construction began in 2006 with operation scheduled to begin in 2011. And now as 2017 nears the end, BER is not even close to opening. Currently it is well over 2000 days behind schedule. Massive technical deficiencies with the airport’s safety systems plague the entire project, and now it is questionable whether the airport will even open in 2021.
Bureaucrat run airport-project turns into national embarrassment
BER’s original estimated price tage was 2.5 billion euros, but since then the costs have ballooned to 6.6 billion euros today. Worse: billions more are expected, nobody knows when the project will be completed, and there’s even talk the project might be abandoned altogether! It is undoubtedly the country’s greatest construction and engineering debacle so far this century. The joke today: It would be cheaper to move the entire city of Berlin to another airport then to sort through the catastrophe that is the BER airport.
What happened? Ideological bureaucrats took over project engineering
At the early design and construction stages, the project was run by Berlin’s socialist-green bureaucrats – who thought they could handle it better than real builders. These bureaucrats unfortunately failed to adequately involve the necessary technical and engineering experts during the crucial early stages and the result was a plan that was so flawed that today it looks more like an animal begging to be put out of its misery.
Naturally their airport concept and plans sailed through the approval process and construction started in earnest. But before long it was discovered that the BER design was fraught with technical and safety deficiencies, and it’s opening has been pushed back every year since 2011. The truth is that no one knows how to resolve the huge flaws.
BER is a classic case of what can happen if the right people are not running the job and ideology takes over.
Energiewende: a potential folly 200 times greater than BER
As hard as it may be to believe, a similar German-made engineering catastrophe but of far greater dimensions looms: the revamping of the country’s electricity supply infrastructure so that it is “green” – the so-called “Energiewende“. Like BER, the Energiewende too was managed by bureaucrats, who in the wake of the Fukushima disaster ordered Germany’s top power generation experts at the country’s leading power companies to stand back and keep silent as the country fast-tracked from nuclear and fossil fuel power over to clean, green energies.
Merkel government decides to run the power industry
The rush decision was made by Angela Merkel and her CDU/CSU party. Power engineering experts were not invited on the board commissioned to launch it and thus they had no input or say on the matter. The politicians were warned of the risks of flooding the existing grid with unstable energy, but they obstinately brushed the warnings aside and went full throttle into the Energiewende. They believed they knew better.
Today, some 6 years later, the Energiewende is looking a lot like the BER debacle: an engineering embarrassment and looming catastrophe. The major grid infrastructure revamping is still decades off and the power grid already frequent teeters on the brink of collapse. While BER is the airport without adequate fire and safety systems, Germany’s Energiewende is the nation’s power supply without a proper grid. In both cases the costs are spiraling out of control and no one knows if it’s ever going to work at all. It is wild experimentation, and not engineering.
172,000 outages last year
To illustrate how far along the road to disaster Germany’s once impeccably stable grid has come, the online hessenschau.de here reports that for the second time in a just few days the central city of Wiesbaden has seen its power black out. It writes:

On Saturday evening in parts of Wiesbaden the power went out for 2 hours. […]. It is the second power outage within just a few days.”
Over the past years the German state of Hesse has been plagued by power outages, Hessen public television (HR) reported here, as it pondered why Hesse has become so prone to blackouts. HR cites the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Grid Agency), which says there are over 172,000 power outages annually, which is some 470 daily, and that last winter multiple power plants had to be switched simultaneously because “the German grid was on the brink of collapse.”
Volatile wind and sun
Prof. Peter Birkner blames the volatile supply of green energies: “The wind does not ask what we want, what we consume, and just blows as it wills” and that “the power grid is not designed for it“.
While the BER debacle has cost over 6 billion euros so far, the Energiewende has already committed close to 200 times that amount of money: over 1 trillion euros!
According to Frankfurt’s Fire Department spokesman Andreas Mohn, the city’s 27 mobile power generators would not be able to handle a power outage and citizens would have to “fend for themselves“:
That starts with a few candles, food, water and maybe a possibility of something for heating, a gas cooker or something.”
Government information pamphlet on what to do in the event of a blackout
Little wonder that in 2015 the BBK – Germany’s version of FEMA – released a pamphlet advising citizens on how to proceed in the event of power outages.
State media has “diesel generators” on stand-by
Even German HR public television has taken precautions against power outages and has “large diesel generators on hand in the event of a blackout” which would switch on within 14 seconds.
According to Hesse HR public broadcasting:

Short periods of time would be bridged over by thousands of batteries. Then diesel would take over. With over 40,000 liters in the tank, HR would be able to broadcast completely on its own for up to two weeks”.

It’s nice to hear that public funded German broadcasting would keep warm and running in a blackout. The citizens, on the other hand, would be left out in the cold. This is the utopia that green bureaucrats are bringing to Germany.
Other countries should think twice before heading down this path of folly.

"There have been few fashion statements over the years at G7 summits (dress code: world leader suit, sensible shoes). But this year, G7 leaders will be joined by more than 20 fashion retailers and brands, including the owner of Gucci, Kering, H&M and Zara’s parent company, Inditex, for a key fashion moment – a global pact to fight the climate crisis and protect biodiversity and the oceans. The deal to be concluded in Biarritz at the weekend comes as the global fashion industry faces an unprecedented backlash from young people concerned that it is contributing more to climate change than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined. Without action, the industry could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050. The issue is soaring up the agenda, with models on the catwalk at London fashion week next month set on a collision course with campaigners from Extinction Rebellion who want the event scrapped in the face of the climate emergency. Growing numbers of young people are turning away from fast fashion towards reuse and resale sites such as Depop in the UK, Thredup and The RealReal in the US and YCloset in China. The secondhand market is expected to overtake fast fashion in the next few years and be 50% bigger than it by 2028, according to a report by market analysts GlobalData for Thredup. The surge in environmental concern is forcing brands to accelerate sustainability plans and club together to bring about change not only in stores but with the factories and suppliers they share around the world. Last month Inditex, the world’s third-largest apparel company, announced that all of its collections would be made from 100% sustainable fabrics before 2025, the first international high street store to make such a commitment. It is switching to renewable energy and pledging to send zero waste to landfill by 2025. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee investigation into sustainable fashion has also prompted action, despite the government rejecting a recommendation of a 1p per garment tax to fund better textile recycling schemes. The committee’s report published in February named and shamed brands such as Boohoo, JD Sports, Sports Direct and TK Maxx, which had been slow to take action: failing to use sustainable cotton, collect used clothing or sign up to the government-backed sustainable clothing action plan (Scap). It's not an option, it’s now a duty of running a global company Scap, whose nine large retail signatories including Next, M&S, Primark and Asos have committed to reducing their water use, carbon footprint and waste sent to landfill by 15% by 2020, said it had seen a notable increase in inquiries about joining up. With the spotlight shining on the fashion industry, Primark, one of the flag-bearers for the kind of one-use fast fashion so heavily criticised by environmental activists, is experimenting with clothing recycling bins at its new store in Birmingham and has pledged to introduce a full scheme this year. It has also launched sustainable cotton jeans and eco-friendly glitter. Giorgina Waltier, sustainability manager for H&M in the UK and Ireland, said: “There has definitely been a significant change in people’s attitudes towards sustainability and fashion in the last 12 to 18 months, with a real sense of urgency around these issues and a definite demand from consumers for more action and greater transparency from brands.” H&M, the Swedish group that also owns the Cos, & Other Stories, Monki and Weekday brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030, up from 57% now. It is also testing out a free mending service. Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering (whose boss François-Henri Pinault, was asked by French president, Emmanuel Macron to help pull together the G7 fashion-industry deal) said the international fashion pact would enable global retailers to share best practice and ideas and combine their buying power to push for change right back to the agricultural practices involved in supplying raw materials.“Many companies have taken the initiative but if they do things on their own it has less impact on the ground than if they work together,” said Daveu. She said the group could combine efforts to find solutions to problems such as effective recycling of textiles and fibres for garments that can’t be worn again. “More and more customers and clients, generation Z and millennials, are expecting brands to act,” she said. “Listed companies also find more and more investors and financial analysts are taking factors like climate change into account on risk management. Chief executives and designers are also citizens of the world and very conscious that they have an important role to play in one of the most important issues of our century.” “It’s not an option, it’s now a duty of running a global company.” But there are fears that the G7 pact will only add complexity and confusion: there are already many groups involved in sustainability, including the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, Global Fashion Agenda and Common Objective, a private enterprise that recently took over the former Ethical Fashion Forum, which was run as a charity. Several retail and sustainable fashion experts told the Guardian they were concerned that the array of standards and global groups which brands and their suppliers were now expected to sign up to could divert resources from actual action. “It’s great what Macron is doing,” said one big retailer who has held back from signing up to the G7 pact, referring to the fact that it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who asked Kering’s boss, François-Henri Pinault, to help pull together the G7 fashion industry deal. “But our responsibility is not to just sign something and the job is done. It is fine to say stuff but actually doing stuff is what’s important. Resources can be consumed by meetings. Let’s keep the balance on delivering.” David Moon, of Scap,said global initiatives served to get big company bosses focused on environmental issues but he said “national action like Scap can really drive change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Global Environment and Marine Department of the Japanese Meteorological Agency recently corrected the long term trend in the annual mean sea ice extent in the Antarctic area: from 0.015 x 106 km2 per year to 0.019 x 106 km2 per year on 11 May 2018.
That’s more than a 25% adjustment (15,000 sq. km to 19,000 sq km). So while chunks the size of Manhattans may break off from time to time, about 300 Manhattans of new ice gets added annually.
The report notes that in the Antarctic Ocean: “the annual maximum and annual mean sea ice extents have shown a long-term trend of increase since 1979”.
The Japanese weather and climate site provided the following 2 charts showing sea ice extent for both the Arctic and Antarctic respectively since 1979. From them we see some interesting developments.
Arctic downward trend halted
Although the Arctic has seen a downward trend over the past 4 decades, we note that the mean Arctic sea ice cover has remained mostly steady over the past 11 years (since 2007). Moreover, Arctic and Greenland ice volume have piled up recently.

Sea ice extents are calculated from brightness temperature data provided by NASA and NSIDC (the National Snow and Ice Data Center). Image: JMA here.

Next we look at the Antarctic, which also reveals some interesting aspects.

Image: JMA here.
Long-term increase “virtually certain”
Though the Antarctic dipped markedly over the past 4 years, the overall trend has been upward. In its commentary, the JMA states “it is virtually certain that there has been a long-term trend of increase in the annual maximum and annual mean sea ice extents in the Antarctic Ocean since 1979.”
Little change since 1980
When looking at the annual linear mean trend of both the Arctic and Antarctic and combine them, then we have a total annual mean of about 24.2 million square kilometers back in 1980.
And when we look at 2017, we see a combined mean amount of about 22.7 million square kilometers, which is about 1.5 million sq km less than 1980 – or roughly 7% less. This is within the range of natural variability.
Both the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific Multidecadal Oscillation coincided in the late 20th and early 21st century to push global temperatures upwards, and thus contribute significantly to the decrease, yet only managing to reduce global mean sea ice area by some 7%.
All the talk of rapidly melting ice caps is more hysteria than reality.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt turns out that the country that got attacked the most for backing out of the Paris Accord happens to be the one that reduced CO2 emissions the most last year, writes Die Welt’s energy journalist, Daniel Wetzel, who wrote:
Now the results are in: No country in the world saved more CO2 in 2017 than the USA. And it is because of the eco-effect.”
Top CO2 saver among a record emissions year
Wetzel cited the latest results of the International Energy Agency IEA, which also stated that global CO2 emissions reached a new all-time record high after having stagnated the three previous years. In 2017, global CO2 emissions rose a robust 2.1 percent – “due to strong economic growth,” Wetzel writes.
On USA’s impressive reductions, Wetzel called it “bizarre”:
Foremost a development emerged that was quite bizarre: Of all countries, the USA under President Donald Trump was the world’s most successful climate protector.”
“Green champions” fail to deliver
According to the IEA, the USA reduced CO2 emissions by 23 million metric tonnes, emitting 4.81 billion tonnes.
Meanwhile some of the world’s most vocal proponents of CO2 emissions reductions and supporters of the Paris Accord failed to reduce CO2 emissions at all. The European Union, which fancies itself a champion of green energies and moral beacon, actually saw its emissions rise by 46 million tonnes!

Also eco-pompous Germany, whose car industry cheated the world, has not reduced emissions some 9 years running:

It was the third year in a row that the USA reduced CO2 emissions, a result that Wetzel called “surprising”.
The reduction, according to Die Welt’s Daniel Wetzel, was attributed to the USA’s 17% energy supplied by renewable sources and that 20% of the electric power was produced by nuclear plants.
Trump’s great solar project
The news of Trump being the 2017’s best climate-saver did not go down well among climate activists. Germany’s alarmist site Klimaretter insisted that Trump had little to do with the development. Klimaretter claimed the good result from the USA was “due to the strong expansion in renewable energies. This occurred not because of Trump, but rather despite the President’s politics.”
Currently Trump is proposing the installation of solar panels on the wall along the border to Mexico, which would make it one of the largest solar power facilities in the country.

"Australia’s diplomatic performance throughout the Pacific Islands Forum has evoked a colonial arrogance that many hoped was in the past. While Pacific Island states raised understandable concerns about the climate emergency and rising sea levels, Australia’s response was to insist on the removal of references to coal from the official communique. The deputy PM, Michael McCormack, who was left in charge of the government while Morrison was busy dismissing our neighbours’ concerns in Tuvalu, continued the insults at home. Attending a business function in Wagga Wagga on Friday, McCormack expressed his annoyance at “people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive”. “They will continue to survive,” he went on, because of “large aid assistance from Australia” and “because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit”. The comments are breathtaking. They are dismissive of the severity of the threat that climate change poses to people in the Pacific, but they are also wrong and offensive about Pacific Islanders’ involvement in seasonal horticultural labour. Referencing the Seasonal Worker Programme, which has since 2012 brought Pacific Islanders to Australia for periods of up to six months to work in the industry’s orchards, fields and packing sheds, the assumption in McCormack’s comments is that the Australian state, and Australian industry, are doing Pacific Islanders a favour. It’s an assumption that permeates discussion of the scheme, which is badged and promoted as a key plank of Australia’s development intervention in the region. But when we badge Pacific participation in the horticultural workforce as “development”, we obscure what it actually is – work. Since 2016 I have been conducting research into race and labour relations in the horticultural industry, focused particularly on the fruit-growing region in Shepparton, in north-central Victoria. There, as elsewhere in the country, Pacific seasonal workers form an increasingly large part of the horticultural seasonal workforce, alongside backpackers, refugees and asylum seekers, and workers from a host of other ethnic-minority communities, including settled Pacific Islanders who have lived in the region for over three decades. I’ve also spent a lot of time talking to farmers. McCormack was right, in part at least, when he alluded to the work and effort that farmers put in to the industry. Farmers do work hard. And many of them, especially small and medium-sized producers, are working hard in climates (pun intended) where corporatisation, drought and shifts in the global economy are making profit margins increasingly thin. But any farmer will also tell you that all that hard work means nothing if they cannot get enough workers to pick the fruit at the right time, and with the right degree of skill and care. The Pacific Islanders who come to Australia under the program are not here as an expression of our benevolence, they are here because they are vital to the productivity and profits of the industry. Under the seasonal workers program, though, and under the justificatory logic of “development”, many are working under conditions that would not pass muster under Australian industrial law. The requirements of the dedicated visa scheme that facilitates their temporary labour migrations are such that workers are effectively tied to a single employer. The program appears for all intents and purposes to be a new system of indenture, one that echoes the migrations (some coerced, and almost all exploitative) of Pacific Islanders “blackbirded” through the 19th century to work on the cane fields of Queensland and northern New South Wales. Parallels drawn between the contemporary seasonal workers program and the history of blackbirding are not hyperbolic, as some have suggested. They speak, rather, to the deep inequalities, rooted in colonial histories, that structure Australia’s relationship to the Pacific. Some seasonal workers do have positive experiences, and many seek to return. Others, though, encounter unscrupulous labour-hire agents or farmers, or find themselves in conditions where the crops they are tasked with harvesting are poor or small (meaning that the pay they receive, calculated on piece rates, is dramatically reduced). In these conditions, workers find themselves with little recourse. Where backpackers can, and do, up and leave in search of a better gig, Pacific seasonal workers cannot leave, and face powerful impediments to complaining or speaking out. Of the dozens of workers I have spoken to and spent time with over the last three years, the overwhelming majority have been intensely fearful of speaking publicly, and critically, about the circumstances of their work. Seasonal workers, hopeful of return in future seasons, fear (and with good reason), that the likely consequence of complaint will be that they are not able to. Of course, it is true that many Pacific Islanders strongly desire and enthusiastically pursue work through the program. And it is true that many (although certainly not all) can, and do, earn around four times as much picking fruit in Australia as they can working back home. That these things are true, though, should be a prompt for us to reflect upon the kinds of poverty and inequality that structure Australia’s relationship to the Pacific, and the colonial histories that underpin these. It should not be a cause for self-congratulation. • Victoria Stead is an anthropologist and senior research fellow at the Alfred Deakin Institute, Deakin University.

Please let’s leave the name-calling aside. It really does not make any positive contribution at all. We all feel the frustration in the debate as we have two sides entrenched with only a few people daring to take a position between all the flying arrows.
From now on Kenneth and I will be simply deleting any comment with name-calling and schoolyard accusations. Concerning “lies”, show the person it’s a lie and then just move on. If that person wishes to continue believing it, then let them. It’s really not your problem, but their own.

"It was always going to be a showdown on the climate crisis. As leaders from the Pacific gathered in Tuvalu for their annual Pacific Islands Forum, there was one subject destined to dwarf all others and which pitted Australia, with its increasing emissions and plans for new coalmines, against its small island neighbours.  And PIF 2019 turned out to be exactly that: a reckoning on the climate emergency confronting the Pacific. There were moving speeches from young Pasifika speaking of their fears for their future, tears in the leaders’ retreat, and accusations that Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, had shown such disrespect toward his counterparts during their marathon 12-hour meeting, that the Fijian prime minister said Pacific countries may be driven further into the arms of China. The choice of location for the forum was significant. Tuvalu, located about two hours on a plane north of Fiji, is one of the countries most at risk. The main island, where the capital, Funafuti, is located, is an ever-decreasing sliver of land, at its narrowest just 20m wide, and just 3m above sea level. It faces a host of problems including salinity of the water table, which makes growing crops extremely difficult, coastal erosion that is seeing islands crumble into the sea, storm surges and rising temperatures. The event was a huge undertaking for Tuvalu, which is designated as a “least developed country” and has a population of around 11,000 people. The convention centre, as well as about 75% of accommodation used for the event, was built specifically for the conference, and right up until people started arriving for the forum, Tuvaluans were laying electricity cables, painting, bringing in furniture – and working in shifts around the clock to get ready.  To feed delegates, different communities from Tuvalu’s outer islands took turns preparing and bringing in food, presenting lavish lunches and dinners of crab, lobster, fish, chicken, salads, taro and custard coconut cake. On several nights, large traditional dances or fateles were held, with the different islands taking it in turn to run the night’s entertainment. Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told the Guardian ahead of the conference that Tuvalu was seeing the event as an opportunity to showcase its culture – to show the world what would be lost, apart from land, if Tuvalu were to disappear. From the opening speech of the climate crisis summit, delivered by Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, held the day before the forum officially opened, it was clear that Pacific leaders had their eyes on one forum member country in particular when it came to climate action. “I appeal to Australia to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change,” he said, adding that coal posed an “existential threat” to Pacific countries. When Scott Morrison arrived on Wednesday afternoon, he was asked by Sopoaga, as all leaders were, to stop and consider the installation built at the entry to the airport – a model of an island in distress with a moat around it, in which young children sat. Groups of children sang a welcome song: “We have a problem, we need to solve it, we need to start right now.” Before singing a version of Sopoaga’s famous statement on climate change: “Save Tuvalu to save the world.” Morrison’s announcement of $500m in climate resilience and adaptation for the Pacific region on Monday night, while welcomed by Pacific leaders, did not buy Australia much of a reprieve. The next day, Sopoaga said: “No matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn’t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines.” The main event of the week, the leaders’ retreat, was held on Thursday, with leaders, in the customary matching shirts, sitting down to thrash out the language of a forum communique and climate change statement, that will be used as the basis of regional decision-making. At dawn on the morning of the retreat, as he stood watching an early-morning demonstration of traditional Tuvaluan fishing methods, Sopoaga said he was optimistic and thought negotiations would be wrapped up by lunchtime. Sopoaga said the fishing method was a good metaphor for what the leaders were trying to do that day: a group of people walk out into the water and advance in a line, slapping and waving palm branches underwater, to frighten the fish which are herded toward the reef and then eventually surrounded by the group who hold hands and advance, trapping them with their bodies before they are scooped up with nets.  “You go in unison, you go like a human net. It’s a community thing, it’s a collective. I think that’s the way to address climate change. We must base it on a community approach,” Sopoaga said. But that community was sorely tested throughout Thursday, in a meeting between the leaders that Vanuatu’s foreign minister described as “fierce at times” and almost broke down twice, due to Australia’s refusal to budge on certain red lines, including insisting on the removal of mentions of coal, limiting warming to under 1.5C and setting a plan for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Sopoaga said the next day he had told Morrison at one point during discussions: “You are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.” Emotions ran high, with Sopoaga revealing that at one point during discussions, the Tongan prime minister, Akilisi Pohiva, cried as he reflected on a presentation given by two young women at the climate change summit earlier in the week about their fears for the future. Pohiva cut a dignified but heartrending figure throughout the week. He attended the summit despite serious health concerns, which he told the Guardian meant this year’s PIF would likely be his last. His frailty was evident, but so too was his deep feeling for Tuvalu, with other leaders speaking of the enormous respect his presence, despite his illness, demonstrated for the region and its concerns. An exhausted Sopoaga eventually emerged from the retreat venue on Thursday night, after almost 12 hours of negotiations, and told the waiting press that an agreement had been reached on the forum communique and climate change statement. Australia had succeeded in watering down the language of the communique, and keeping out any mention of coal and its other “red lines”. But while Australia may have succeeded in softening the language, the means by which it achieved that victory seemed to undermine the government’s much-touted Pacific step-up, in which Canberra seeks to engage more concertedly with the region, particularly in light of China’s increasing interest in it. The Fijian prime minister expressed his anger with how events had unfolded in the leaders’ retreat, telling the Guardian that Morrison had been “very insulting and condescending” and that his behaviour could lead countries to reject Australia in favour of engagement with China. “After what we went through with Morrison, nothing can be worse than him,” Bainimarama said. As the accommodation was packed up and the Australian defence force Hercules planes took delegates away, the people of Tuvalu remained, facing the same threats and dangers they did before leaders came to debate what to do about them. On the final night of the forum, a clearly disappointed Sopoaga urged Tuvaluans who were unhappy with the “compromised” language coming out of the event not to lose hope, and he urged the rest of the world to remember the plight of his people: “We ask, please understand this, our people are dying.”"

CO2 Has A ‘Zero Net Effect’
Dr. Rex J. Fleming, a former  NOAA climate scientist who earned both his Master’s and Ph.D in meteorology, has published a new paper in the Environmental Earth Sciences journal that details the lack of an identifiable causal relationship between CO2 concentration changes and Earth’s temperature changes.  He suggests “there is no propensity for CO2 to store heat in a systematic way over time to produce a climate change effect”.

Image Source: American Meteorological Society
Dr. Fleming introduces an alternative “theory of climate change—due to the Sun’s magnetic field interacting with cosmic rays”.   He theorizes that the Earth’s temperature has warmed in the modern era as a consequence of the strong solar activity during the 20th century  (the Modern Maximum) shielding cosmic ray intensification and thus reducing decadal-scale cloud cover, which leads to warming via an increase in absorbed surface solar radiation (as illustrated here by Ogurtsov et al., 2012 and detailed by Avakyan, 2013, McLean, 2014, and others).
Dr. Fleming further proposes that the Earth may cool as it slides into a Solar Grand Minimum in the coming few decades (~2030) due to a predicted decline in the solar magnetic field and concomitant cloud cover increases seeded by cosmic ray intensification.
Key points from the paper are categorized below.

An Updated Review About Carbon 
Dioxide and Climate Change
Fleming, 2018
Summary
“The results of this review point to the extreme value of  CO2 to all life forms, but no role of  CO2 in any significant change of the Earth’s climate. … There is no correlation of CO2 with temperature in any historical data set that was reviewed. The climate-change cooling over the 1940–1975 time period of the Modern Warming period was shown to be influenced by a combination of solar factors. The cause of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age climate changes was the solar magnetic field and cosmic ray connection.  When the solar magnetic field is strong, it acts as a barrier to cosmic rays entering the Earth’s atmosphere, clouds decrease and the Earth warms. Conversely when the solar magnetic field is weak, there is no barrier to cosmic rays—they greatly increase large areas of low-level clouds, increasing the Earth’s albedo and the planet cools. The factors that affect these climate changes were reviewed in “Solar magnetic field/cosmic ray factors affecting climate change” section. The calculations of “H2O and CO2 in the radiation package” section revealed that there is no net impact of CO2 on the net heating of the atmosphere. The received heat is simply redistributed within the atmospheric column. This result is consistent and explains the lack of CO2 correlations with observations in the past. The current Modern Warming will continue until the solar magnetic field decreases in strength. If one adds the 350-year cycle from the McCracken result to the center of the Maunder Minimum which was centered in 1680, one would have a Grand Minimum centered in the year 2030.”
It’s Not CO2
CO2 Changes Lag Temperature Changes
“Ice cores with sufficient vertical resolution (time resolution) have provided 420,000 years of data from Antarctica indicating that the temperature changes preceded the corresponding CO2 changes. An American team found the time lag (due to ocean mixing) of CO2 behind temperature of several hundred years. The oceanic reservoir of CO2 is far greater than that of the atmosphere. When the oceans are warm, they outgas CO2, and when the oceans are cold atmospheric CO2 dissolves into the oceans (Fisher et al. 1999).”
“A subsequent study in 2003 by a French team indicating that deglaciation was not caused by CO2 which lagged the temperature by 200–800 years (Caillon et al. 2003). A third efort by Russian scientists arrived at the same conclusion, where the estimated delay was 500–600 years (Monin and Sonechkin 2005). This was claimed to be 420,000 years of data with indisputable evidence that CO2 concentrations of the atmosphere are the effect of global temperature changes and not their cause (Chilingar et al. 2008).”

Water Vapor Dominates
“The concentration of CO2 is considered to be uniform over the atmosphere at 400 ppmv. The concentration of water vapor varies from a maximum of 40,000 ppmv (Hong Kong) to the lowest measured value of 4 ppmv in the upper stratosphere. A value for water vapor at one km is estimated to be 11,000 ppmv, so the ratio of mass of H2O/CO2 at one km is approximately 11,000/400=27.5. Comparison of the absorption coefficients over the full range of 1.5–18 µm gave the result: CO2/H2O=~5.5. Thus, water vapor dominates by the ratio of 27.5/5.5=5. … The volume of H2O at the one km level alone is capable of absorbing all the available solar heat at the surface, and does absorb five times that of CO2. All the heat adsorbed at the surface was fully redistributed vertically by all the molecules with the help of all the coefficients.”
CO2 ‘No Impact’, ‘Zero Net Effect’ On Temperature
“One can summarize these calculations as follows: whatever the “climate-change regime,” whatever surface heat from the Sun on any given day within that regime, that heat is fully absorbed and fully vertically redistributed throughout the troposphere—there is no propensity for CO2 to store heat in a systematic way over time to produce a climate change effect (as defined in the introduction).”

“Why does the integrated effect of CO2 have so little effect on the total temperature profile? The reason is that the Planck function change with height (temperature) is very strong in reducing the intensity of those relatively few lines with large absorption coefficients. Another reason is that the longwave radiation is diffuse which depletes the intensity rapidly over distance. The diffuse nature of the radiation also leads to the fact that the net radiation for a given level (that sent upward at the bottom of a layer, minus that sent downward at the top of a layer) further reduces the adsorbed CO2 radiation intensity.”
“Other so-called “greenhouse gases” (some with larger absorption coefcients, but all with signifcantly less concentration)  have their intensity quickly transferred upward and depleted by the same strong Planck function intensity change that applies to CO2 and H2O.  From the historical record and from these calculations one sees that the CO2 concentration had no impact on temperature.  It contributes low-level heating and allows upper level cooling for a zero net effect.”
It’s Solar/Cosmic Ray/Cloud Cover Changes
Solar Minimum, Maximum Periods And Climate
“A significant improvement in determining which Grand Minima are important for climate change came with the work of Sharpe (2008) using Jet Propulsion Laboratory DE405 ephemeris data providing the results in Figs. 10 and 11. His C-14 data from Stuiver et al. (1998). The results confirm the reason for the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age (1300–1850) with its three separate Grand Minima (Spörer Maunder, and Dalton).”

“Since the Little Ice Age, a strong Sun is revealed by both Be-10 and C-14 decreases. The total magnetic flux leaving the Sun (dragged out by the solar wind) has risen by a factor of 2.3 since 1901 (Lockwood et al. 1999). The strong solar magnetic field has shielded the Earth from cosmic rays and is the cause of the Modern Warming that has occurred through to the current time.”
Planetary Positions Determine Solar Grand Minima
“The synodic period (TS—two successive conjunctions of the same bodies) of two planets 1 and 2 is given by 1/TS=1/T1−1/T2 (with T1<T2). The sidereal periods for Uranus and Neptune are 84.02 and 164.79 years, respectively.  This gives TUN =172 years. This is the main driver seen in the angular momentum of the Sun about the SSB.  The relationship of when a solar Grand Minima occurs always involves these four giant planets in their relationship with the Sun and as depicted in Fig. 11—Uranus, Neptune and Jupiter together and Saturn opposite the Sun.”

Solar Cycle Length And Temperature
“The sunspot cycle has an average period of 11.2 years, but the length varies from 8 to 14 years. The length of a sunspot cycle (LSC) is an indicator of the Sun’s eruptional activity.  The Gleissberg (1965) cycle resulted from his smoothing of the time series of the length of the sunspot cycles (LSC) and a secular cycle of 80–90 years emerged.”

“Figure  7 is from Landscheidt (2003) where Gleissberg’s smoothed data were displayed. The heavy line is the smoothed LSC line and the light line is the land air temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. The heavy line agrees very well with the temperature and also with the temperature record […] with the cooling from 1940 to 1975. It appears that the atmospheric temperature is oblivious to CO2 concentration.”
“The range of the Sun’s orbital angular momentum about the SSB varies from near zero to only 25% of the Sun’s differential angular momentum driving the solar dynamo (Landscheidt 2003). Thus, the strength of the solar dynamo can outweigh the effect of the Sun/planet positions. Nevertheless, these results over this long period strongly suggest that the solar magnetic feld/cosmic ray interaction is the primary cause of major climate-change events over the past 9400 years of the interglacial period. The 35-year cool period within the current Modern Warming was an example where the Gleissberg cycle imposed only a modest impact on the existing strength of the magnetic feld that was in place. The current Modern Warming will continue until the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field declines.”

0.59 Of An Inch To Sea Levels Since 1958

Graph Source: Grinsted et al., 2009

In a newly published paper, oceanographers estimate that global sea levels rose at a rate of ~1.42 mm per year−1 (1.32 to 1.52 mm/yr−1) between 1958 and 2014, a 56-year span that directly coincides with an unprecedented rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Frederiske et al.,2018
“For the first time, it is shown that for most basins the reconstructed sea level trend and acceleration can be explained by the sum of contributors, as well as a large part of the decadal variability. The global-mean sea level reconstruction shows a trend of 1.5 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 over 1958–2014 (1σ), compared to 1.3 ± 0.1 mm yr−1 for the sum of contributors.”


This rate (which scores between the estimated sum of sea level rise contributors and a reconstruction from tide gauge and satellite measurements) is similar to the reconstructed rate for 1954-2003 (1.45 mm/yr−1) estimated by Dr. Simon Holgate (2007).

Holgate, 2007    
“The rate of sea level change was found to be larger in the early part of last century (2.03 ± 0.35 mm/yr 1904–1953), in comparison with the latter part (1.45 ± 0.34 mm/yr 1954–2003).”

Extrapolating the annual rate of rise over the 56-year period (1958-2014), global sea levels rose 7.95 centimeters (cm) in total, or 3.13 inches during the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) era.

Negligible Polar Ice Sheet Melt Contribution To Sea Level Rise Since 1958
Of those 7.95 cm, just 1.17 cm (0.46 of an inch) of meltwater was contributed by Greenland Ice Sheet in 56 years, and the Antarctic ice sheet contributed just 0.37 of a cm (0.13 of an inch).


1958-2014 Sea Level Rise Neither Unusual Or Unprecedented
If 3.1 inches of sea level rise over a 56-year span does not appear to be either alarming or unprecedented, perhaps it’s because they are indeed neither — especially when one considers longer-term contexts.
As Holgate (2007) summarizes above, the ~50-year global rate of sea level rise was substantially higher (2.03 mm/yr−1) during the first half of the 20th century (1904-1953) compared to the post-1950s period (1.45 mm/yr−1 1954-2003).
In other words, since the 1950s, global sea level rise has decelerated.
The 1920 to 1950 period had rates of rise that were either higher or rivaled the rates of the more recent decades (using satellite altimetry modeling [3.4 mm/yr−1 ]). In fact, when the anomalous decadal variability is removed, the fastest rates of sea level rise occurred during the 1920 to 1950 period.

Jevrejeva et al., 2008
“The fastest sea level rise, estimated from the time variable trend with decadal variability removed, during the past 300 years was observed between 1920– 1950 with maximum of 2.5 mm/yr.”
“The fastest sea level rise during the 20th century was between 1920 – 50 and appears to be a combination of peaking of the 60– 65 years cycle with a period of low volcanic activity (Jevrejeva et al., 2006; Church and White, 2006).”

Glacier Melt Contribution To Sea Level Rise Much Greater Before 1950
A graphical reconstruction featured in a new paper (Treat and Jones, 2018) affirms that the glacier melt percentage (and contribution to sea level rise) in the Canadian Arctic was significantly greater during most of the last several thousand years compared to the modern era.

Treat and Jones, 2018
“Rates of permafrost aggradation in peatlands generally increased after 3000 BP and were greatest between 750 and 0 BP, corresponding with neoglacial cooling and the Little Ice Age (LIA), respectively.”


The ice sheet  record for the 20th century also reveals that the glacier melt contribution to sea level rise was significantly greater during the 1920 to 1950 period than it has been since the ice melt contribution began decelerating (after the 1950s).

Gregory et al., 2013


Fernández-Fernández et al., 2017
“The abrupt climatic transition of the early 20th century and the 25-year warm period 1925–1950 triggered the main retreat and volume loss of these glaciers since the end of the ‘Little Ice Age’. Meanwhile, cooling during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s altered the trend, with advances of the glacier snouts.”
“By 1946, this glacier had retreated almost 90% of the total recorded between the LIA maximum (1868) and 2005. … Just as in the glaciers described above, the retreat of the Eastern Tungnahryggsjökull from its LIA position was more intense during the first half of the 20th century, and in 1946 its snout was only 200 m from its current position.”

4 New Papers: Sea Levels Were Much Higher Than Now In Past Millennia
As the introductory global sea level graph above and several dozen sea level reconstructions published in scientific journals every year (2016 and 2017) demonstrate, global sea levels were about 1 to 3 meters higher than they are now during the Middle Holocene, or when CO2 concentrations were significantly lower (~270 parts per million).
These non-correlations between sea level rise and CO2 concentration would not appear to be consistent with the popular conceptualization that CO2 concentration variations are significant drivers of temperatures, glacier melt, and/or sea level rise.
After all, the 3.1 inches of sea level rise since 1958 does not even fall outside the range of natural variability.

He et al., 2018


Cooper et al., 2018
“With sea level stabilization a few metres above the present around 5.5 ka cal yr BP (Hein et al., 2016), the longshore drift system was reestablished and sediment accumulation in the littoral zone recommenced.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Telegraph here is calling it “the UK’s coldest spring day on record” with “life-threatening conditions“, adding
The Armed Forces have been forced to step in as police and hospitals struggle to cope with freezing weather sweeping across Britain. […] Nearly every part of the country was hit by snowfall and gales as the Met Office said Thursday was the UK’s coldest spring day on record.”
Armed Forces called out, gas running out
The online British daily also reports that 10 deaths have resulted in Britain so far as storm Emma took its toll with heavy snow as it collided with the massive blast of frigid Russian air which had swept across the continent earlier in the week.
The situation in Great Britain has gotten so bad that the British Armed Forces have been called out and there’s a risk of gas running out.
The mixture of low temperatures and high winds is proving to be lethal, also elsewhere across Europe as death toll mounts.
Monbiot’s 2005 climate hysteria looking senseless today
The brutal winter conditions witnessed this week are in stark contrast to George Monbiot’s 2005 claim:

The freezes this country suffered in 1982 and 1963 are, unless the Gulf Stream stops, unlikely to recur.”

In his February 14, 2005 article, after having sown “11 species of vegetable”, the Guardian journalist appeared to have lost control of his wits, and let the climate hysteria of the time get the best of him. Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski tweeted yesterday:

The current cold spell in Great Britain shows us once again just how out-of-place many climate comments are, here from the Guardian of 2005:”

Rising death toll from cold
German Spiegel reported of “already 45 deaths from the cold” in Europe – and that was two days ago. That figure is likely to rise considerably in the days ahead. The good news is that the bitter cold is forecast to loosen its grip by the weekend. But for some, that will be too late.
Spiegel wrote 2 days ago:
The number of deaths from cold since Friday [Feb. 23] has risen to more than 45 – alone in Poland there were 18 deaths. In the Czech Republic there have been 6 deaths, in Lithuania 5 deaths, in France and Slovakia four deaths each, Italy, Serbia and Romania have each reported 2 deaths.”


The English language The Local here writes that Germany death toll has since risen to four, as authorities struggled to provide adequate shelter. The figure of 45 dead does not appear to include the 10 cold fatalities in Britain.
Flu epidemic in Germany
Another misery helped along by the harsh winter conditions in Germany is the country’s acute flu season. MSN Nachrichten here reports:
The flu has gripped Germany. At the Dresden University Clinic the doctors hardly know where to put the acute cases. The number of new cases is as high as never before.”

"The rise of nationalism and governments that interfere in markets pose a threat to the global economic system, the boss of BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, has warned. Despite announcing a 124% rise in profits to $US8.31bn (£6.84bn), helped by booming iron ore sales to China, Andrew Mackenzie said on Tuesday that there were “a number of things abroad” that were causing concern for the Anglo-Australian behemoth.  The standoff between the US and China was a concern for the company, he said, and could threaten the company’s bottom line and the wider global economy trade. “The US-China relationship is a consideration for us,” Mackenzie told reporters on a media call in Melbourne. “We continue to enjoy strong sales to China. But no doubt this [trade standoff] will put a dampener on world economic growth. Ultimately it will impact demand for our products. “More generally there are number of things abroad … increased nationalism, increased assertion by governments to interfere in global supply chains and capitalism … that is a consideration.” The chief executive’s thinly veiled reference to Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports into the US reflects BHP’s delicate position straddling the world economy. BHP’s huge profits come from operations around the globe, and the company and its shareholders have benefited enormously as it has fuelled China’s expansion with raw materials such as iron ore, coking coal and copper. The final payout of $4bn to shareholders announced on Tuesday makes a record total of $17bn for the year, with final dividend of US78c per share. But as the US-China trade standoff develops into a broader clash over currencies and regulation, it appears to threaten the rules-based order that has paved the way for the rapid growth of emerging economies in the past 30 years. Mackenzie said that BHP enjoyed a healthy and balanced relationship with Beijing, but that he “completely gets” the need for countries such as Australia, whose biggest trading partner is China, to respect traditional alliances that had “underpinned and given rise to the liberal approach” enjoyed in the west. “It’s not an easy balance to manage,” he said, adding that he thought politicians in Australia, where BHP has its operational headquarters, were doing a “reasonable” job. Mackenzie also faces a conflict over the need to develop resources while taking what he called a “responsible approach to global warming”. In July he said the impact of climate change was “indisputable” and although the company is planning to wind down its thermal coal business – ie, coal used for power generation – he would not be drawn on a timetable. “We don’t intend to invest and grow the business,” he said, but the company would continue to review its portfolio of assets. Mackenzie’s remarks about China came as Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, called on Tuesday for a “new set of rules” to manage world trade. The Australian government faces the same delicate balancing act as BHP in its approach to China, especially as the mounting political crisis in Hong Kong brings the prospect of some form of intervention by Beijing to quell the protests. Having taken millions out of poverty, China needed to enter a new phase, Morrison said. “Having achieved that critical mass of economic performance, the rules that apply to all of us – the US – have got to apply in China as well,” he told Channel Seven . Morrison said both China and the US were “wrestling with this massive change”, arguing there is “no doubt that the economic rise of China has had a profound impact for processing and manufacturing in the US”. “The US has made some very legitimate points about the nature of trading relationship. And so we just engage in both.” Minutes released on Tuesday from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s board meeting earlier this month showed the the US-China dispute was a factor in the bank’s downgrade of Australia’s growth outlook. “Uncertainty about how these disputes would play out and how effective domestic policy measures would be in supporting Chinese demand continued to be an important consideration for the global growth outlook and, from an Australian perspective, the future demand for steel and bulk commodities,” they said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Die Welt/N24 here reports on how the German Post, Deutsche Post, put electric vehicles dubbed Streetscooters” into action last summer with the high hopes of making mail delivery greener.
Months later it is emerging that things are not working out as hoped, as a myriad of technical problems have emerged. With winter weather in full swing, postal workers are finding out that they have to choose between turning on the heater are becoming stranded in the middle of the route because the vehicle’s battery has lost its charge, Die Welt/N24 reports.
The electric delivery vehicles are manufactured by StreetScooter GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Port DHL Group since 2014. The company boasts at its website that it used “pioneering approaches” in development and production that allowed them to present our first electric vehicle at IAA 2011 “after just 18 months of development”.
Fear of not getting back
That fast track development appears to have come at a high cost, as Deutsche Post drivers complain that the vehicles normally does not get much further than 70 km, and no where hear the 100 km range that is pitched. “Again and again the driver is forced to decide when to turn around in order to make it back,” reports Die Welt/N24.

Currently the German postal giant has some 5000 Streetscooters on the road with another 25,000 scheduled to be added to the fleet soon.
Potential death trap?
The Street scooter is also very lightly built, and thus many drivers fear getting into an accident. “In many cases, the vehicle’s hood popped open while on route,” reports Die Welt/N24. Also drivers are reported to be more focused on getting back than they are on delivering the parcels.
DieWelt/N24 also reports that complaints by delivery drivers have been ignored and no improvements have been implemented, instead the problems are blamed on driver “operating faults”.
Moreover, according to Die Welt/N24: “Internal documents concerning suggestions for improvement are confidential. Anyone who makes public complaints, risks employment legal action and including an official warning.”
Green commercial utility vehicles, even on a tiny scale, obviously still have a long way to go, and so far appear suitable only for limited application – like on parks and golf courses.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA global-scale instrumental temperature record that has not been contaminated by (a) artificial urban heat (asphalt, machines, industrial waste heat, etc.), (b) ocean-air affected biases (detailed herein), or (c) artificial adjustments to past data that uniformly serve to cool the past and warm the present . . . is now available.

Composed of 450 instrumental records from temperature stations sheltered from ocean-air/urbanization/adjustment biases throughout the world, a new 20th/21st century global temperature record introduced previously here very closely aligns with paleoclimate evidence from tree rings, ice cores, fossil pollen and other temperature proxies.
The Alignment Of Paleoclimate Proxy Data & Instrumental Records
The paleoclimate proxy data for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) consistently show an oscillation rather than a linear warming trend between 1900 and 2010: (a) a substantial warming trend between 1900 and the early 1940s, (b) a substantial cooling trend between the 1940s and 1970s, and (c) a subsequent warming trend since the 1980s that matches or comes close to matching the warming peaks in the 1930s and early 1940s (rather than greatly exceeding it).
In 2016, Dr. Pei Xing and co-authors unveiled a new method (MVDM) for calibrating low-frequency NH tree-ring data (utilizing 126 tree-ring records) for the last 1,200 years in  The Extratropical Northern Hemisphere Temperature Reconstruction during the Last Millennium Based on a Novel Method.  The proxy evidence shows an oscillation — including substantial cooling between the 1940s and 1970s — and no net warming since the early 1940s.

Christiansen and Lungqvist (2012) utilize proxies from 91 locations across the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere to reveal no net warming since the 1940s.

Schneider et al., 2015 use proxy evidence from 15 IPCC-referenced locations in the Northern Hemisphere to document no net warming since the 1940s.

A New Instrumental Record Of The Northern Hemisphere
In a ground-breaking new paper (Lansner and Pepke Pedersen, 2018) published in the journal Energy and Environment, an analysis of land surface instrumental records from across the globe’s ocean air sheltered (OAS) regions reveals that, like the proxy evidence presented above, most of the modern era warming occurred prior to the 1940s, and the there has effectively been no net warming since then.

Lansner and Pepke Pedersen (2018) point out that, due to the divergent rates of warming and cooling for land vs. ocean water, there is a significant difference in the range of temperature for the regions of the world influenced by their close proximity to oceans and coastal wind currents (ocean air affected, or OAA) and the inland regions of the world that are unaffected by ocean air effects and coastal wind because they are sheltered by hills and mountains or located in valleys (ocean air sheltered, or OAS).
The two authors acknowledge that it is “difficult” to isolate the influence of the ocean’s effects on temperature changes and the influence of climate- or radiation-induced changes in driving temperature change.  So the two authors chose to “retrieve temperature data where impact of the ocean temperature trends has been reduced as much as possible.”
The results they obtained in analyzing “thousands” of instrumental temperatures from across the globe are especially noteworthy.  To summarize, Lansner and Pepke Pedersen (2018) found that the OAS regions of the world reached annual temperatures that were just as warm or warmer during the 1920s to 1940s as they have been in recent decades.  There has been no net warming — and, in fact, an overall slight cooling — since the 1940s for the OAS temperature stations.
Lansner and Pepke Pedersen, 2018
“We found that in any land area with variation in the topography, for the period 1900-2010 we can divide the meteorological stations into the more warm-trended ocean air-affected OAA-stations, and the more cold-trended ocean air-sheltered OAS-stations. The methods used in this work are meant to give a rough picture of the large differences in temperature trends between OAS and OAA stations. … When we isolated temperature trends 1900–2010 with as little ocean influence as possible – the OAS areas – we found a warm period 1920–1950 with temperatures similar to recent decades for all investigated areas worldwide. We have not found any area with numerous OAS/Valley stations available where the majority of temperature stations show a different result.”
“In contrast, the OAA locations like islands, coasts, hills facing dominating ocean winds, etc., did not reflect the warm period 1920–1950 well. … Therefore, the lack of warming in the OAS temperature trends after 1950 should be considered when evaluating the climatic effects of changes in the Earth’s atmospheric trace amounts of greenhouse gasses as well as variations in solar conditions.”
“In locations best sheltered and protected against ocean air influence, the vast majority of thermometers worldwide trends show temperatures in recent decades rather similar to the 1920–1950 period. This indicates that the present-day atmosphere and heat balance over the Earth cannot warm areas – typically valleys – worldwide in good shelter from ocean trends notably more than the atmosphere could in the 1920–1950 period.”
1. “[W]e show in Figure 3 the results for the Scandinavian area where we have used a total of 49 OAS stations and 18 OAA stations. The large number of stations available is due to the use of meteorological yearbooks as supplement to data sources such as ECA&D climate data and Nordklim database. … For the years 1920–1950, we thus find temperatures in the OAS area to be up to 1 K warmer than temperature in the OAA area.”


2. “Another example is from Central Siberia (Figure 4), where a total of 18 OAS stations and 17 OAA stations were used. All data were taken from GHCN v2, raw data. … Again we find that the temperature trends from the OAS area show more warming in the 1920-1950 period with about 0.5–1.5 K higher temperatures than the OAA areas.”


3. “In the Central Balkan area [Poland, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Rumania, Greece, and Turkey] (Figure 5), 41 OAS stations and 25 OAA stations were used … data from meteorological yearbooks and statistical yearbooks supplemented with GHCN v2 raw (NOAA) and BEST raw data. … The temperature trends from the OAS area from the 1925 to 1950 period are found in most years to be around 1 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


4. “For the USA (Figure 6), we defined the OAS area as consisting of eight boxes, each of size 5° X 5°. … A total of 236 temperature stations were used from this area. … All data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data. … Again the temperature trends from the OAS area as defined above show the 1920–1955 period in most years to be around 1 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


5. “For Central China (Figure 7), 14 OAS stations and 12 OAA stations were used. All data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data. …The temperature trends from the OAS area show the 1920–1950 period around 0.5–1.5 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”

6. “For the Pakistan/NW India area (Figure 8), 10 OAS stations and 8 OAA stations were used. All data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data. … The temperature trends from the OAS area show the 1930–1955 period to be around 1–1.5 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


7. “In the Sahel area (Figure 9), 34 OAS stations and 11 OAA stations were used. All data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data. The temperature trends from the OAS area show the 1930–1950 period to be around 0.2–1 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


8. “For Southern Africa (Figure 10), 13 OAS stations and 15 OAA stations were used. All data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data. The temperature trends from the OAS area as defined show the 1920–1945 period to be around 0.2–1.5 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


9. “For South East Australia (Figure 11), 18 OAS stations and 24 OAA stations were used and all data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data. … The temperature trends from the OAS areas show the 1925–1950 period to be around 0.3–0.5 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


10. “Finally, for Central South America (Figure 12), 17 OAS stations and 13 OAA stations were used. Data were taken from GHCN v2 raw data and also from the BEST raw data base. … The temperature trends from the OAS area as defined show the 1930–1965 period to be around 0.5–1 K warmer than temperature trends from the OAA areas.”


Global Temperatures In Non-Urban Areas Have Warmed By 0.375 K/Century Since 1900
Combining the OAS temperatures and OAA temperatures and using the century-scale trends for each identified in the paper (-0.03 K/century and +0.78 K/century, respectively), it may be concluded that instrumental temperature stations located in non-urban areas and not subjected to artificial urban heating bias produce an overall warming trend of just 0.375 K/century (0.038 K/decade) during 1900-2010.
“For the OAS areas, we find a linear temperature trend over the whole period from, 1900 to, 2010 of -0.03 K/century whereas we find 0.78 K/century for the OAA areas.  We recognize the remarkable temperature increase in temperature in the years after the 1918/1919 strong El Nino. After this warming, the OAS temperature data appear to have jumped by around 0.5 K to a new level, indicative of a shift to a new climatic regime. The OAA data fail to show this abrupt change.”

This much milder rate of warming over the 20th/21st centuries underscores just how influential urbanization might have been in driving up warming artificially, or non-climatically, during the modern era.
The phenomenon of artificially-driven warming rates has been documented in many other analyses.
Parker and Ollier, 2017 
“We should also consider the role of the Bureau of Meteorology. The climate trend maps compiled by Bureau of Meteorology in their climate change section are completely unreliable, as the alleged increasing temperature is obtained by lowering temperatures of the past by “adjustments“.
“The global reconstructions as GISS (Hansen et al. 2010, GISTEMP Team 2017) are artificially biased upwards to reproduce the carbon dioxide emission trend, but the strong natural oscillation signal prevails. The very likely overrated warming rate since 1880 is 0.00654°C/year or 0.654°C/century. This rate increases to 0.00851°C/year or 0.851°C/century by considering the data only since 1910. The warming rate cleared of the oscillations is about constant since the 1940s.”
“There are stations covering different time windows having very close patterns of temperatures. In this circle of 3,141,593 km2 (roughly 50% of Australia) that is mostly underdeveloped, none of the stations […] actually has a warming trend. … It is therefore only an artefact by BOM to produce the warming. Homogenization is supposed to be used to account for upwards biases such as Urban Heat Island, not to introduce upwards biases. … The longest of the Australian temperature records that were considered the most reliable by Bureau of Meteorology on February 2009 (BOM 2009) are still available as raw temperatures in the climate data online section and consistently show no warming and no increased extreme events within the limit of accuracy of measurements.”
de Freitas et al., 2015
“New Zealand’s national record for the period 1909 to 2009 is analysed and the data homogenized. Current New Zealand century-long climatology based on 1981 methods produces a trend of 0.91 °C per century. Our analysis, which uses updated measurement techniques and corrects for shelter-contaminated data, produces a trend of 0.28 °C per century.”
Hughs and Balling, 1996
“The long-term mean annual temperature record (1885 –1993) shows warming over the past century, with much of the warming occurring in the most recent three decades. However, our analyses show that half or more of this recent warming may be related to urban growth, and not to any widespread regional temperature increase.”
Liao et al., 2017  
“We examine the urban effect on surface warming in Eastern China, where a substantial portion of the land area has undergone rapid urbanization in the last few decades. Daily surface air temperature records during the period 1971–2010 at 277 meteorological stations are used to investigate temperature changes. Owing to urban expansion, some of the stations formerly located in rural areas are becoming increasingly influenced by urban environments. To estimate the effect of this urbanization on observed surface warming, the stations are dynamically classified into urban and rural types based on the land use data for four periods, i.e. 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. After eliminating the temperature trend bias induced by time-varying latitudinal distributions of urban and rural stations, the estimated urban-induced trends in the daily minimum and mean temperature are 0.167 and 0.085 °C decade−1, accounting for 33.6 and 22.4% of total surface warming, respectively. The temperature difference between urban and rural stations indicates that urban heat island intensity has dramatically increased owing to rapid urbanization, and is highly correlated with the difference in fractional coverage of artificial surfaces between these two types of stations. This study highlights the importance of dynamic station classification in estimating the contribution of urbanization to long-term surface warming over large areas.“
Oyler et al., 2015     
Artificial Amplification of Warming Trends …Western United States     “Observations from the main mountain climate station network in the western United States (US) suggest that higher elevations are warming faster than lower elevations. This has led to the assumption that elevation-dependent warming is prevalent throughout the region with impacts to water resources and ecosystem services. Here, we critically evaluate this network’s temperature observations and show that extreme warming observed at higher elevations is the result of systematic artifacts and not climatic conditions. With artifacts removed, the network’s 1991–2012 minimum temperature trend decreases from +1.16 °C decade−1 to +0.106 °C decade−1 and is statistically indistinguishable from lower elevation trends. Moreover, longer-term widely used gridded climate products propagate the spurious temperature trend, thereby amplifying 1981–2012 western US elevation-dependent warming by +217 to +562%. In the context of a warming climate, this artificial amplification of mountain climate trends has likely compromised our ability to accurately attribute climate change impacts across the mountainous western US.”
Ren et al., 2007    
“The annual urban warming at the city stations can account for about 65∼80% of the overall warming in 1961∼2000, and about 40∼61% of the overall warming in 1981∼2000.”
Founda et al., 2015     
“UHI [the Urban Heat Island effect] accounts for almost half of Athens’ warming. … The study explores the interdecadal and seasonal variability of the urban heat island (UHI) intensity in the city of Athens. Daily air temperature data from a set of urban and surrounding non urban stations over the period 1970–2004 were used. Nighttime and daytime heat island revealed different characteristics as regards the mean amplitude, seasonal variability and temporal variation and trends. The difference of the annual mean air temperature between urban and rural stations exhibited a progressive statistically significant increase over the studied period, with rates equal to +0.2 °C/decade.”
McKitrick and Michaels, 2007    
“[E]xtraneous (nonclimatic) signals contaminate gridded climate data. The patterns of contamination are detectable in both rich and poor countries and are relatively stronger in countries where real income is growing. We apply a battery of model specification tests to rule out spurious correlations and endogeneity bias. We conclude that the data contamination likely leads to an overstatement of actual trends over land. Using the regression model to filter the extraneous, nonclimatic effects reduces the estimated 1980–2002 global average temperature trend over land by about half.“

"Nearly 200 US cities have seen an increase in the number of days each year that soar beyond a heat index of 90F (32.2C) or higher, according to an analysis of the last four decades. “These extreme heat days are now comprising much of the summer for many cities in the south and south-west, while areas of the country that had relatively few summer days reach the 90F heat index in the past are now experiencing weeks of them,” said the report from the climate communications organization Climate Central. The higher temperatures are threatening public health and making outdoor activities and sports more dangerous. A July heatwave in the midwest and eastern US forced the cancellation of the New York City Triathlon, as well as other running and horse races. Climate Central used heat heat and humidity data for 239 cities and found 198 had an increase in the average number of days each year that felt 90F or hotter. They also found that 106 cities had an increase in “danger” days that felt 105F or hotter. Globally, temperatures are 1.5F higher than they were in the middle of the last century, as humans’ power plants, cars and ways of living contribute pollution that heats the planet. Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis. This year saw the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those  as far north as Alaska, where thermometers hit 90F (32C) for the first time.  This week Guardian Cities is examining the growing challenges for US cities and the best ideas for reducing the impact of the climate crisis on communities.  Mark Oliver, special projects editor, Guardian US In parts of the Pacific north-west, days that were 90F or hotter increased substantially. In Yakima, Washington, they more than doubled, from 13 to 29. Salt Lake City, Utah, is seeing two weeks of days that hot. Fresno, California, saw a jump from 78 days to 93. In the south, extreme heat isn’t just in the summer. Austin, Texas, had 126 days that felt like 90F or hotter on average for the last five years. Savannah, Georgia, had 114. And Miami had 161. Danger days, which feel 105F or hotter, are rare but deadly. The National Weather Service can issue an “excessive heat warning” when two days in a row are forecast to be that hot without a cool night in between. With those temperatures, NWS warns people who don’t take precautions can become seriously ill or die. People in McAllen, Texas, have seen the biggest increase in danger days, climbing from 16 each year to 38.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a shocking display of contempt and hubris, NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt and Potsdam Institute climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf lashed out in response to questioning… and insist “leading climate scientists” don’t need policing by “policy folk” and that the questioning is “tiresome” and “silly”.
Two days ago, German green-energy proponent Dr. Oliver Geden commented at Twitter on an editorial by Katherine Hayhoe, asking: “Why would climate scientists want to talk about ‘solution’ they obviously aren’t experts on?” Geden then added that it shows the “pitfalls of solutionism”.

Geden, a proponent of green energies and a warmist, is the Head of Research Division at the Berlin-based think tank German Institute For International Security Affairs.
At Twitter Geden publicly wondered about the wisdom of allowing climate scientists to be the leaders in the redesign of our complex civil infrastructure – you know, a job that traditionally and wisely was left to licensed architects, master builders and professional engineers – and not academics in lab coats.
Above the rules…We don’t need no “policing”
Reaction to Geden’s thinly veiled criticism came swiftly, especially from NASA GISS Director Gavin Schmidt, who pointed out that climate scientists don’t need no “policing”, thank you:

I’m blocked at Twitter by Gavin and his gang (even though I rarely even commented at their accounts), but an insider kindly provided their tweets.
According to Schmidt, getting policed by policy folk is “tiresome and silly” and he and his elitist academic high-flier colleagues shouldn’t have to put up with any of it.
Rahmstorf’s towering self-importance and superiority
Another real doozy of a reaction came from alarmist Potsdam Institute scientist, Stefan Rahmstorf. Most climate science skeptics are aware of how ugly Mr. Rahmstorf can get at times, and his most recent tweet totally lives up to that reputation:

Ouch.
Firstly it needs to be noted that Dr. Geden’s achievements are in fact quite impressive. What Rahmstorf needs to understand is that the people with the most “academic achievements” are not always the ones who get to make policy. That is the job of policymakers.
Secondly, we really have to wonder if it is wise for our policymakers to let themselves be advised by persons who harbor such contempt for other viewpoints and open debate.
Above questioning
Thirdly, Rahmstorf also reiterates Gavin’s position that “leading climate scientists” don’t need any “policing”. They seem to think they are above all that.
Geden is right: Gavin Schmidt and Stefan Rahmstorf are not really the only kind of people we may want formulating public policy and the ones we want our elected policymakers to be exclusively listening to. The heart of policymaking is open debate. Schmidt and Rahmstorf obviously despise it and so appear to not even understand even the most rudimentary element of democracy.
For them it’s: Shut up and let us run things because we’re the smartest.
People like Mr. Geden are also very smart, and they do need to be listened to.
“The art of climate communication”
How did Geden react to Rahmstorf’s nastiness and hubris? He called it “the art of winning a dispute on #climate science communication.”
Gavin Schmidt and Prof. Rahmstorf owe Dr. Geden an apology in the least, and owe the public a bit more.

"Iceland has marked its first-ever loss of a glacier to climate change as scientists warn that hundreds of other ice sheets on the subarctic island risk the same fate. As the world recently marked the warmest July ever on record, a bronze plaque was mounted on a bare rock in a ceremony on the barren terrain once covered by the Okjökull glacier in western Iceland.  Around 100 people walked up the mountain for the ceremony, including Iceland’s prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, the former UN human rights commissioner Mary Robinson, and local researchers and colleagues from the United States who pioneered the commemoration project. “I hope this ceremony will be an inspiration not only to us here in Iceland but also for the rest of the world, because what we are seeing here is just one face of the climate crisis,” Katrín said. The plaque bears the inscription “A letter to the future”, and is intended to raise awareness about the decline of glaciers and the effects of climate change. “In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it,” the plaque reads. It is also labelled “415 ppm CO2”, referring to the record level of carbon dioxide measured in the atmosphere last May. Julien Weiss, an aerodynamics professor at the University of Berlin who attended the ceremony with his wife and seven-year-old daughter, was one of those moved by the occasion. “Seeing a glacier disappear is something you can feel, you can understand it and it’s pretty visual,” he said. “You don’t feel climate change daily, it’s something that happens very slowly on a human scale, but very quickly on a geological scale.” The plaque is “the first monument to a glacier lost to climate change anywhere in the world”, according to Cymene Howe, associate professor of anthropology at Rice University in Texas. “By memorialising a fallen glacier, we want to emphasise what is being lost – or dying – the world over, and also draw attention to the fact that this is something that humans have ’accomplished’, although it is not something we should be proud of.” Iceland loses about 11bn tonnes of ice per year, and scientists fear all of the island’s 400-plus glaciers will be gone by 2200, according to Howe. Glaciers cover about 11% of the country’s surface. Glaciologists stripped Okjökull of its glacier status in 2014, a first for Iceland. In 1890, the glacier ice covered 16sq km (6.2 square miles) but by 2012 it measured just 0.7sq km, according to a report from the University of Iceland in 2017. In 2014, “we made the decision that this was no longer a living glacier, it was only dead ice, it was not moving”, Oddur Sigurðsson, a glaciologist with the Icelandic Meteorological Office, told AFP."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Boris M. Smirnov, a prominent atomic physicist, has authored 20 physics textbooks during the last two decades.  His latest scientific paper suggests that the traditional “absorption band” model for calculating the effect of atmospheric CO2 during the radiative transfer process is flawed.  New calculations reveal that the climate’s sensitivity to a doubling of the CO2 concentration is just 0.4 K, and the human contribution to that value is a negligible 0.02 K.


Smirnov, 2018
Collision and radiative processes in
emission of atmospheric carbon dioxide
“One can explain why the absorption band model is not suitable for the change of the radiative flux due to doubling of the concentration of CO2 molecules. This quantity is determined by spectral ranges where the atmospheric optical thickness is of the order of one. Because averaging over oscillations for the absorption band model removes such ranges from consideration, this model leads to a large error.”
“[I]t follows for the change of the global temperature as a result at doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2 molecules [is] ∆T = (0.4 ± 0.1) K, where the error accounts for the accuracy of used values, whereas the result depends on processes included in the above scheme. Indeed, we assume the atmospheric and Earth’s albedo, as well as another interaction of solar radiation with the atmosphere and Earth, to be unvaried in the course of the change of the concentration of CO2 molecules, and also the content of atmospheric water is conserved.”
“Because anthropogenic fluxes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulted from combustion of fossil fuels is about 5% [Kaufman, 2007], the contribution of the human activity to ECS (the temperature change as a result of doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide amount) is ∆T = 0.02 K, i.e. injections of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuels is not important for the greenhouse effect.”
Conclusion
“Above, we connect the emission of a gaseous layer located over a hot surface with the greenhouse phenomenon in the Earth’s atmosphere due to CO2 molecules. This analysis exhibits the importance of interaction of a radiating molecule with surrounding air molecules that is essential both in broadening of spectral lines and for absorption of CO2 molecules by other atmospheric components, as well as emission of these components. The evaluations fulfilled show that the contribution of emission of CO2 molecules to the total radiative flux directed toward the Earth is approximately 20%, as well as this contribution to its derivation over the atmospheric carbon dioxide amount. Comparison of methods of the absorption band which uses the absorption coefficient averaged over its frequency oscillations and the ‘line-by-line’ method without this averaging exhibits the accordance of these methods for determination of the radiative fluxes and a strong difference in evaluation of its derivative. This shows the importance of the ‘line-by-line’ method for the analysis of climatic problems.”
“Note that above we give a simple algorithm to determine the total emission of the Earth’s atmosphere due to CO2 molecules with using the spectroscopic parameters of these molecules on the basis of classical molecular spectroscopy. We note the principal steps which allow us to obtain this algorithm in a simple form. First, there is a local thermodynamic equilibrium for vibrationally excited molecules. Therefore, radiation is created by vibrationally excited molecules which are formed in collisions with air molecules, and their number density is determined by the Boltzmann formula. Second, the atmospheric optical thickness exceeds one, i.e. radiation toward the Earth and outside are separated, and the radiative flux at a given frequency is the blackbody flux, so that the radiative temperature for this frequency is the temperature of an effective layer. Third, interaction between carbon dioxide molecules and other optically active atmospheric components is of importance. This means that a change of the concentration of CO2 molecules leads simultaneously to a change of the radiative flux due to other components.”
“Based on the total absorption coefficient, which is a sum of those due to CO2 molecules and other atmospheric components, we take into account this effect. As a result, one can evaluate an additional radiative flux to the Earth’s surface due to a change of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and the corresponding analysis convinces us that contemporary injection of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuels is not important for the greenhouse effect.”

Veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann says 10 deaths caused by a “surprise snowstorm” had nothing to do with “climate change”, but more to do with poor human judgement and a misguided reliance on “terrible quality weather apps”.
Last weekend a group of 6 skiers were killed by a “sudden snowstorm” high in the Swiss and Italian Alps, while four other persons perished in the same storm. Read background here.
“Surprise snowstorm” claimed 10 lives
By Monday morning, April 30, after victims had failed to appear at a mountain shelter as planned, the manager of the shelter alerted authorities, who then launched a search and rescue operation. For a total of 10 persons, help came too late.
On April 29, a so-called warm-air föhn blew over the Swiss Alps, which led to severe snow conditions where the skiers were located, over 3000 meters elevation. According to meteorologist Kachelmann, first came heavy snowfall, then powerful winds with gusts of up to 200 km/hr followed.
Next temperatures plummeted precipitously. When it was over 10 persons were dead.
Media blame “climate change”
Some of the media immediately pointed the finger at climate change. In a commentary at the online Swiss-based Tagesanzeiger here, meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann wrote that the media “concentrated from the first moment on ‘ a surprising, unexpected snowstorm’, on the ‘sudden deterioration of the weather” and the ‘precipitous drop in temperature’ which some grotesquely blamed on climate change.”
Fact: freak storm had been forecast days in advance
In his Tagesanzeiger commentary, Kachelmann characterizes blaming the tragedy on climate change as false, and reminds that such weather anomalies are typical of Switzerland’s rugged mountainous terrain, and is well known.
Moreover Kachelmann notes in the commentary that the bad weather had been forecast days before it actually hit, and so it was not “a surprise”. The veteran Swiss meteorologist wrote that “all weather models” had been indicating föhn conditions  already three days before, on Thursday April 26.
And by the morning of April 27, Kachelmann wrote that the drama had already been “concrete on the weather charts” and that snow would begin to fall by 1 pm Sunday afternoon on April 29.

Swiss Alp weather chart forecast of April 27, 3 days prior to the tragedy. Image: Kachelmann Weather.
By 8 pm Sunday, the area was hit by wind gusts of up to 200 km/hr. Next temperatures plummeted.
Poor quality weather apps likely contributed to disaster
So why didn’t the climbers heed the forecast of dangerous conditions, which were clear well in advance, and avoid the area? After all, weather is the all important factor to consider before venturing out into the high elevation Alps. It’s long known not to be out in such conditions.
Quality of weather apps is “nonsense”
Kachelmann comments that reliance on the general lousy quality of weather apps likely played a major role. According to the renowned Swiss meteorologist, the sad truth is that “the worst weather forecast today by far is the one that gets used the most: the forecast app on the mobile device.”
According to Kachelmann, on the quality of app forecasts:
There’s a grotesque number of people who rely on this nonsense.”
Weather apps are “killing people”
Kachelmann notes that weather apps often have resolutions that are so poor that locally they are virtually useless. In the image in the article, he compares the quality of an app (upper image) to that used by a professional meteorologist. Kachelmann is boggled that people would think they can get good forecasts “simply by entering a zip code!”
Kachelmann concludes:
Many people believe these apps are the best when it comes to weather forecasting. The opposite is in fact true. The terrible quality of weather forecast apps is killing people.”

"Elton John has attacked the criticism of the use of private jets by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – reportedly four journeys in 11 days – by saying he not only paid for the plane, but also paid to offset its giant carbon emissions. “We ensured their flight was carbon neutral,” he tweeted. The world of carbon offsetting flights – where you can pay to have the equivalent of your emissions “cancelled out” by projects that lower or remove emissions, such as reforestation or renewable energy – is not clearcut. While some argue it is better than doing nothing, others say it allows frequent flyers to assuage their guilt and the aviation industry to grow.  “The idea that you can fly ‘carbon neutral’ is very misleading,” says Roger Tyers, a research fellow at the University of Southampton, who studies attitudes to offsetting and recently made a work trip to China by train. “A plane that flies today emits carbon today. It’s very hard to know how fast an offset can remove that amount of carbon from the atmosphere.” It is possible to be appalled by the tone of the attacks on the couple, on Meghan especially, while wondering if the pair couldn’t have made better choices, given their influence and professed concern about the climate crisis. And where is the comparable fuss about the use in the past year of chartered planes by Prince Charles, who recently said global leaders must act within the next 18 months to avert climate catastrophe? In the past year, the royal family’s emissions from “business travel” have doubled. All of us need to rethink our consumption of flights, not simply try to buy our way out with offsetting. Offsetting, says Tyers, is better than it was about a decade ago “when you had lots of stories about the money getting lost in the world of carbon finance. It’s much tighter now and money generally does go to [things like] reforestation projects.” However, he says, “it is questionable whether it will deliver what we need within the timescale necessary. And the cultural signal that it gives off – that you can have your cake and eat it – is problematic.”"

"The resources minister Matt Canavan has defended an extraordinary spray against engineering firm Aurecon over its decision to sever ties with Indian energy company Adani. Canavan had labelled Aurecon’s decision “weak as piss”, and on Thursday rejected claims from the Greens that he is a hypocrite for using public pressure to bully the company while criticising anti-coal activists.  Aurecon has decided to end its commercial relationship with Adani, including work on the Abbot Point Coal terminal in north Queensland and a solar project in Whyalla in South Australia, due to a campaign targeting Adani and its contractors in a bid to prevent the Carmichael coalmine. Canavan responded by describing Aurecon as “a bunch of bedwetters”, telling Radio National on Thursday he did so because he was “sick and tired” of the company’s “PR rot”, noting that it had not cut ties with other coal ports. “I would’ve had a lot more respect for Aurecon if they’d come out and been upfront saying they can’t do this because they’re under pressure … but to come out and try to wrap it up as a sustainable decision, give me a break.” Canavan said he “made no apologies” for his language, explaining Aurecon’s behaviour “giving in to bullies … has to be called out” and claiming it was “time to be upfront”. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has labelled Canavan a “hypocrite because he criticises campaigns against companies that don’t support his interests and yet here he is targeting individual companies [which] for their own reasons have made financial decisions because they understand coal has no long-term future”. Canavan responded that he has “no problem with people criticising the coal industry” but he objects to “people breaking the law” and “holding Brisbane to ransom” by holding up CBD traffic. On Tuesday the Palaszczuk Labor government proposed new laws with stronger penalties and expanded police powers, including to make it illegal to possess a device used for locking on, in an attempt to crack down on an escalating campaign of civil disobedience. Canavan accused environmental protesters of “wantonly [breaking] the law” and said the Queensland Labor government had “finally” decided to crack down on it after months. Aurecon had not been directly involved in the Carmichael mine – it had been the engineering, procurement and construction contractor at the Abbot Point coal terminal since 2005. Adani bought the terminal in 2011. On Wednesday Adani responded by saying it was “surprised” by Aurecon’s decision but is already in discussions with other businesses that had expressed an interest in taking up the work. “There has been a concerted campaign by extremists against our Carmichael project and businesses that partner with us,” it said. “It has not succeeded and construction of the Carmichael project is well and truly under way. “We have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to Queenslanders, Australians and the people in developing nations who desperately need affordable energy to help lift them out of poverty.”"

Scientists: ‘Unlikely Polar Bears Are At Risk From AGW’

Image source: York et al., 2016, Journal of Ecology and Evolution.
Most of the world’s polar bears live in Canada.  Hunters and elders from northern Canada’s native communities have been immersed in studying polar bear ecology for centuries.
In two new peer-reviewed papers published in the journals Ecology and Evolution and Polar Record, scientists record the observations and experiences of Canada’s polar bear “experts” — the community members who live side-by-side with these “sea bears” (Ursus maritimus).
According to scientists, no study has indicated that there is reason to presume that the perspectives of community observers are either suspect or incorrect.  In fact, there have been multiple occasions when traditional ecological knowledge gleaned from local populations accurately identified polar bear subpopulation trends before new scientific studies could be conducted to corroborate them (York et al., 2016).
The overwhelming conclusion from years of accumulated conversations with native populations about polar bears is that there is almost no connection between the long-term observations of polar bear ecology and the more recent claims that polar bears as a species are in grave danger due to climate change and thinning sea ice.
In fact, the long-term observations suggest that polar bear subpopulations are currently faring quite well, with 92% of  the subpopulations studied either remaining stable or growing in recent years.
According to Inuit observers, there may even be “too many” bears now.
Furthermore, the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) gleaned from local populations affirms that polar bears do not need thickened sea ice to hunt seals, as they can “catch seals even if the ice is really thin” (Wong et al., 2017).
The recent observations of polar bears eating land-based food, or eating out of garbage bins, is not evidence that they are hungrier and more desperate due to climate change.  According to community observers, it is quite “typical” for polar bears to forage for land-based food (and garbage), as they are opportunists when it comes to food sources.   Polar bears have been consuming land-based food well before there was concern about thinning sea ice and climate change.
A bold conclusion from York et al. (2016) is that, given the paleoclimate record of much warmer (+4 to +7.5 °C) Arctic and much more reduced sea ice thickness and extent in the past relative to today, “it seems unlikely that polar bears (as a species) are at risk from anthropogenic global warming.”

York et al., 2016
Demographic and traditional knowledge perspectives
on . . . Canadian polar bear subpopulations
Summary
“Considering both [observations from native populations] and scientific information, we suggest that the current status of Canadian polar bear subpopulations in 2013 was 12 stable/increasing and one declining (Kane Basin).”
“We do not find support for the perspective that polar bears within or shared with Canada are currently in any sort of climate crisis.”
Observations From Natives (TEK) May Be More Reliable Than ‘Flawed’ Scientific Studies
1.  “We show that much of the scientific evidence indicating that some polar bear subpopulations are declining due to climate change-mediated sea ice reductions is likely flawed by poor mark–recapture (M-R) sampling and that the complex analysis models employed to overcome these capture issues apparently fail to provide accurate estimates of the demographic parameters used to determine subpopulation status.”
2.  “There is no trend evident from the summed subpopulation numbers from the PBSG status reports. Other indications of individual subpopulation decline are in conflict with aerial survey results, TEK [traditional ecological knowledge from native populations], or subject to sampling ambiguity, with the exception of the KB subpopulation.”
3.  “We hypothesize that when polar bear subpopulation trends are evaluated by both M-R sampling and TEK; notable differences are most likely due to errors in scientific methodology rather than mistaken TEK.”

4.  “We suggest that the difference between scientific and TEK in this case is partly caused by institutional (science establishment) reluctance to accept TEK as a valid test of correspondence between scientific predictions and observable reality (Aars et al. 2006; Resolution # 1-2005). … We did not find evidence for intentional misrepresentation of polar bear subpopulation numbers or trends from TEK, aboriginal organizations, or co-management wildlife boards. The TEK we report for Canadian polar bear subpopulation trends was a consensus from all of the sources cited above, which we believe to be a comprehensive list of available sources on the TEK for polar bear subpopulation trends.”
5.  “Scientific studies have not always agreed with TEK on subpopulation trend (e.g., NB, SB, SH, and WH), but these studies have never provided any reasons to suspect that the available TEK was suspect or incorrect. Alternatively, we are aware of multiple occasions when TEK accurately identified polar bear subpopulation trends before new scientific studies had been conducted that corroborated the TEK (S6).”
Polar Bears Survived During Much Warmer Climates And With Much Less Sea Ice
 6.  “The majority of Canada’s polar bears inhabit the Canadian Arctic archipelago (Obbard et al. 2010), where 5 of 13 subpopulations are currently and historically ice-free in late summer and early fall (Lunn et al. 2002; Aars et al. 2006; Obbard et al. 2010).”
7.  “If polar bears have existed for the last 4 million years, they would have emerged during the mid-Pliocene approximately 1.25 million years before the onset of northern hemisphere glacial cycles (Bartoli et al. 2005). If polar bears emerged any time prior to or during the previous glacial cycle, they would have persisted through the Eemian interglacial period. During the Eemian interglacial, mean annual temperatures were 4°C warmer than the current interglacial (Holocene) for northern latitudes (Müller 2009), and some northern locations reached temperatures as high as ~7.5°C warmer than the mean temperature for the same area over the last thousand years (Dahl-Jensen et al. 2013).”
8.  “Given the persistence of polar bears through the current and previous interglacial periods, and their ability to accommodate extended retreats onshore and based on the empirical observations of climate and sea ice change (S7), it seems unlikely that polar bears (as a species) are at risk from anthropogenic global warming.”
9.  “Reduction in the heavy multiyear ice and increased productivity from a longer open water season may even enhance polar bear habitat in some areas (Stirling and Derocher 1993, 2012; Derocher et al. 2004; Rode et al. 2014).”

Wong et al., 2017
Inuit perspectives of polar bear research:
Lessons for community-based collaborations

Scientists/Academics Treat Native Populations (Inuit) Condescendingly
1. “From May 2011 to April 2014 over four visits, we conducted individual interviews with 23 hunters and 33 elders (48 men and eight women) comprising 32 active, 14 non-active and nine less experienced hunters.”
2. “Strong and transparent relationships between polar bear researchers and Inuit communities are necessary to overcome persisting research (and community) misconceptions.”
3. “In the past, academics have been criticised for prescribing expected research plans and outcomes in a rigid way, leading to condescending views of unfamiliar knowledge practices and unwelcoming interactions with community members (Grimwood and others 2012).  … For community members, most types of research have been viewed as inseparable from government agendas through funding and consulting programmes (Bocking 2007) and past histories and power relations have politicised views of scientific research as a whole (Reed and McIlveen 2006).”
Inuit Observations: ‘Too Many Polar Bears Now’
4. “All [Inuit] participants reported having more bear encounters in recent years than in the past. Some participants indicated that the bears they have encountered are healthy.”
5. Inuit observations of polar bear ecology:
“Last year he said that there’s more bears that are more fat … they rarely see unhealthy bears … the only time they would see one is when it’s pretty old … it won’t hunt—hunt as much … and it’s skinny. (AB9)  … Our elders, they say, they migrate, into other area… for years, and then they come back … that’s what we’re experiencing now … back in early 80s, and mid 90s, there were hardly any bears … there’s too many polar bears now. (AR16) Bears can catch seals even—even if the—if the ice is really thin … they’re great hunters those bears … they’re really smart … they know how to survive”
Inuit: Polar Bears Eating Land-Based Food Is ‘Typical’ — Not Related To Sea Ice Changes
6. “Though dietary changes have been attributed to sea ice changes limiting access to primary prey (ringed and harp seal; Thiemann and others 2008a), evidence for bears foraging on land-based foods (Dyck and Romberg 2007; Rockwell and Gormezano 2009; Gormezano and Rockwell 2013a) – reported as typical behaviour by most participants here – might also suggest an opportunistic feeding strategy (Thiemann and others 2008a).”
7. “This suggests that bears pursue readily available food sources even in the presence of preferred ones (Gormezano and Rockwell 2013b).  Bears foraging for land-based foods have been reported in the literature prior to recent concerns over climate change (Russell 1975; Derocher and others 1993; Gormezano and Rockwell 2013a).”
8. “Observations of bears consuming garbage are not uncommon (Russell 1975; Lunn and Stirling 1985; Gormezano and Rockwell 2013b)”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman-speaking readers will surely want to save the text of an interview conducted by the online Baseler Zeitung (BAZ) of Switzerland with world leading sea level expert Prof. Nils-Axel Mörner.
Photo right: Nils-Axel Mörner
Few scientists have scientifically published as much on sea level as Mörner has.
Yet because he rejects the alarmist scenarios touted by the media and alarmist IPCC scientists, the Swedish professor has long been the target of vicious attack campaigns aimed at discrediting him – yet to little effect.
Mörner, who headed of the Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics (P&G) Department at Stockholm University from 1991 to 2005, has studied sea level his entire career, visiting 59 countries in the process.
Sea level hijacked by an activist agenda
In the interview Mörner tells science journalist Alex Reichmuth that climate and sea level science has been completely politicized and hijacked by an activist agenda and has become a “quasi religion”.
According to the BAZ, recently Mörner has been at the Fiji Islands on multiple occasions in order “to study coastal changes and sea level rise”, and to take a first hand look at the “damage” that allegedly has occurred due to climate change over the past years.
IPCC is false
The Swedish professor tells the BAZ that he became a skeptic of alarmist climate science early on because “the IPCC always depicted the facts on the subject falsely” and “grossly exaggerated the risks of sea level rise” and that the IPCC “excessively relied on shaky computer models instead of field research.”
He tells the BAZ: “I always want to know what the facts are. That’s why I went to the Fiji Islands.”
“Very poor quality data” from “office perps”
Mörner also dismisses claims by the Swiss ProClim climate science platform who recently announced that the Fiji Islands are seeing a rapid sea level rise. According to Mörner the data were taken from poor locations. “We looked over the data, and concluded that they are of very poor quality” and that the researchers who handled the data were “office perps” who were “not specialized in coastal dynamic processes and sea level changes”.
Many of them have no clue about the real conditions.”
Sea level “absolutely stable”
Mörner tells the BAZ that sea level at the Fiji islands was in fact higher than it is today between 1550 and 1700. Coral reefs tell the story and “they don’t lie,” the Swedish professor said. He added he was not surprised by the data because “it is not the first time the IPCC has been wrong”.
Over the past 200 years: “The sea level has not changed very much. Over the past 50 to 70 years it has been absolutely stable”.
“Because they have a political agenda”

Not only is sea level rise due to climate change at the Fiji Islands exaggerated, but the same is true worldwide as a rule. When asked why are we seeing all the warnings from scientists, Mörner tells the BAZ: “Because they have a political agenda.”
Mörner warns readers that the IPCC was set up from the get-go with the foregone conclusion man was warming the globe and changing the climate: Mörner says: “And it is sticking to that like a dogma – no matter what the facts are.”
When asked if sea level rise poses a problem for the islands, Mörner answers with one simple word: “No.”
Strong evidence solar activity impacts sea level
The Swedish professor also tells the BAZ that the rates of water rushing into the ocean due to glacier melt are exaggerated and that thermal expansion of the ocean is minimal. Mörner adds:
Sea level appears to depend foremost on solar cycle and little from melting ice.”
Junk surveys produce “nonsense”
When asked by the BAZ why he became skeptical, Mörner recalls the “great anger” from an IPCC representative when he spoke at a 1991 sea level conference in the USA. He was surprised by the reaction, alluding to the fact that it is normal to have different views in science. And as the years followed, he became increasingly aware of the falsehoods made by the IPCC and the organization’s refusal to admit to them.
On the subject of publishing research results:
Publishers of scientific journals no longer accept papers that challenge the claims made by the IPCC, no matter the paper’s quality.”
In his decades long career, Mörner has authored some 650 publications, and he tells the BAZ that he has no plans to stop fighting. “No one can stop me.”
Near the end of the interview Mörner calls the claim that 97% of all climate scientists believe global warming is man-made “nonsense” and that the number comes from “unserious surveys”.
In truth the majority of scientists reject the IPCC claims. Depending on the field, it’s between 50 and 80 percent.”
Cooling over the next decades
Mörner also sees little reason to reduce CO2 emissions, and calls the belief in man-made climate change a religious movement driven by public funding.
In conclusion Mörner tells the BAZ that he thinks solar activity will likely decrease and that cooling will ensue over the coming decades.
Then it will become clear just how wrong the global warming warnings are.”

"Achmore is a nondescript hamlet on the A858 that cuts across the isle of Lewis and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. This is a gnarled, fractured landscape, swaddled in wind and rain, and built out of some of the oldest rocks on Earth – Lewisian gneiss, the bedrock of the island, is some 3bn years old, two-thirds the age of Earth itself. We had gone to Achmore to search out an ancient stone circle. There are dozens of these, including the most famous one at Calanais, scattered across Lewis’s melancholic moorland. The Achmore stone circle was disappointing, with little to catch the eye. But then we turned to look south. And almost gasped. For Lewis’s forbidding landscape, caught in a delicate light suffused through the late-afternoon cloud, had been transformed, becoming draped in an ethereal, almost unreal, beauty. Dozens of lochans – small lochs – dappled the foreground. Behind them, where the hills of Harris rose, were layer upon soft layer of pastel colours, from gold through green to blue, laid like chiffon scarves across the horizon.  I love bleakness. Not as a human condition but as a physical landscape. Not for me the well-tended orchards of Kent or the Constable-painted loveliness of the Stour valley. Give me, rather, the menace of Dartmoor, the strangeness of Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast, the emptiness of Rannoch Moor in the Scottish Highlands and most of all the dark, brooding allure of the Western Isles of the Outer Hebrides and the Northern Isles of Orkney and the Shetlands. These are all places that can be desolate, even hostile. Yet they are also landscapes imbued with beauty, even grace, such as that moorland in Lewis. As a human condition, bleakness suggests that one is in a place empty of joy or hope. Much of the landscape that we call bleak is bleak in a different way – because it isn’t manicured or domesticated. There is a wildness about it by which we can be discomfited and yet often also celebrate and romanticise. In his book The Wild Places, Robert Macfarlane, one of the most expressive nature writers of our time, observes that throughout history there have been two broad responses to wildness. On the one hand, it is perceived as “a dangerous force that confounds the order-bringing pursuits of human culture and agriculture”. On the other is a perception of wildness “as an energy both exemplary and exquisite, and of wild places as realms of miracle, diversity and abundance”. Wildness as a threat and wildness as a refuge. Neither perspective, though, captures humanity’s complex, entangled relationship with the wild. Human societies have in large part been carved out in defiance of nature. From the houses we build to shelter us from the elements to the medicines we develop to protect us from pathogens, from the piped water without which millions still die from diarrhoea and other illnesses, to the weather stations that provide warnings of hurricanes and heat waves, we are constantly in a struggle to shield ourselves from nature’s furies. There is a rational root to the fear of the wild and of the threat that it can pose. At the same time, the eulogisation of nature, and a yearning for a wilderness that has been lost or despoiled, is inextricably human. There are many threads to such a yen. For some, the depredations caused by human activity, from river pollution to global warming, outweigh the benefits. Along with human development has developed a disdain of progress and civilisation. For others, modernity and urbanisation have brought with them a spiritual loss, a severing of our elemental ties with nature. Whatever the roots, wildness does not simply lie “out there”, but inside, in the human imagination. We project upon the wild the fears and hopes, the emotions and passions, nurtured by history and culture and community. It is through culture and imagination that we imbue the wild with meaning. The beauty of the Western Isles and the Northern Isles is remarkable, their wildness and bleakness something to be treasured. But when I look upon them, what I see is coloured by far more than the landscape itself. It is a landscape created in the novels of George Mackay Brown, the poetry of Kevin MacNeil, the paintings of Wendy Sutherland, the photography of Rebecca Marr, the writings of Macfarlane. That, too, is remarkable and something to be treasured. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
"Thousands of animal rights and environment activists are planning to blockade Smithfield Market – the largest wholesale meat market in the UK – in the next wave of Extinction Rebellion climate protests. A new group calling itself Animal Rebellion says it has almost 2,000 volunteers signed up to take part in a two-week blockade of the central London market from 7 October.  Dan Kidby, a spokesman for the group, said it hoped to have 10,000 people taking part in the blockade. “Animal Rebellion’s message to the public, policymakers and the future citizen’s assembly is that we need to urgently end the industries of animal farming and fishing, and transition to a plant-based food system in order to avert climate breakdown, mass extinction and ensure justice for farmed animals.” In April thousands of people joined Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests around the country, including blocking key sites across London for 10 days. They called on the government to tell the truth about the climate crisis and take urgent action to avoid ecological collapse. XR has said the next wave of protests in October will be focused around Westminster. Roger Hallam, one of XR’s co-founders, said: “October is the next big rebellion against the British government for the criminal inactivity on the climate emergency and ecological collapse.” Animal Rebellion was founded in June this year when 18 of the UK’s leading animal justice organisations met and offered support for the new group. It aims to highlight the “catastrophic role” that it says animal agriculture and fishing industries play in the escalating global climate emergency. Smithfield Market did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Scientists say avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce the environmental impact on the planet, reducing the land needed for farming by more than 75% globally. Earlier this month an IPCC report said that intensive farming and razing forests for meat production was having a devastating environmental impact, and that moving to a plant-based diet would help tackle the climate crisis. Animal Rebellion said activists were being recruited and trained in nonviolent direct action before the next protests. The group is planning to shut down the roads around Trafalgar Square in central London during a broader animal rights’ march on Saturday as a dry run. Alex Lockwood, an academic, author, and spokesman for Animal Rebellion, said the group was aware that many people would find the protests challenging, but that the current food system was “unsustainable and destroying the planet”. “We expect people to be angry that we are challenging their comfortable and ‘normal’ way of life around what they eat. But unfortunately, drastic times call for drastic measures if we are to have any hope of limiting the ravages of climate change. We’re sorry in advance for the disruption this causes.” Although Animal Rebellion is a separate organisation, it has signed up to XR’s three demands of the government: to tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency; to act to halt biodiversity loss and make the UK zero carbon by 2025; and to create a citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice to decide policy. This week six activists were arrested after the Brazilian embassy in London was daubed with paint in protest at the ongoing destruction of the Amazon rainforest. There have also been smaller protests in towns and cities across the UK in recent weeks, including in Cambridge, St Ives, Weymouth and Oxford. • This article was amended on 19 August 2019 to add further detail of Extinction Rebellion’s three demands of the government. It was further amended on 3 September to make clear that Animal Rebellion was supported by the UK’s leading animal justice organisations, but they were not involved in setting it up."
"We’ll get to climate, and the rumble in the Pacific, but I want to begin closer to home. It’s been a busy news week, so you might have missed an excellent story from my colleague Adam Morton on Tuesday revealing that a coalmine in Queensland has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty under a Morrison government mechanism that is supposed to impose limits on industrial pollution. According to documents released under freedom of information laws, mining company Anglo American was given the green light under the safeguards mechanism to increase its emissions by about 1m tonnes at its Moranbah North mine, in central Queensland. The case study matters, because it helps us separate spin from substance.  Since taking the prime ministership last year, replacing Malcolm Turnbull, who lost the long war with the right of his party in part because of his desire to pursue emissions reduction, Scott Morrison has been trying to project a sense that everyone just needs to calm down on climate change. We all need to stop panicking, and causing a big ruckus, because the Coalition has sensible, practical policy mechanisms to ensure Australia meets our international commitments. Campaign calm down is part of Morrison’s ongoing effort to straddle two domestic constituencies: the coal communities who worry Labor has abandoned them in the service of climate science, and Liberal voters in the cities who think climate change is a real thing, and the government should do sensible things to try to avert it. To the coal communities, Morrison projects a disposition of “I’m on your side”. To moderate, rusted on, Liberal voters in the cities, Morrison regularly accepts the science of climate change, and signals he is not crazy retrograde on this stuff, like Tony Abbott was. His objective is to present as Mr Sensible; the pragmatist who will make a proportionate policy commitment and get it done. So there is no need for people to heed the (alleged) hyperventilations of activism, or have nightmares about melting Icelandic glaciers, burning permafrost in the Arctic, or tipping points – thresholds that, if passed, could send the Earth into a spiral of runaway climate change. It’s all under control, kiddos. There’s just one problem with this. Things are not under control. Not here. Not elsewhere. Not even close. A brief recap of what’s going on here will assist. Tracking back to Anglo, and the doubling of emissions. As things stand now, Australia has a safeguards mechanism that’s supposed to curb pollution, but allows pollution to rise. We can move next to the emissions reduction fund, which is supposed to be the centrepiece of the Coalition’s emissions reduction efforts. The ERF came back into service just before the election as part of the signalling to worried Liberal voters that Scott wasn’t Tony on climate change. (Kind of ironic, Scott telegraphing a new, less insane climate change chapter, by rebooting Tony’s fund). This was supposed to be good news, but we knew the ERF mechanism was already deeply problematic before its pre-election revival, given emissions in Australia have been rising ever since the Coalition repealed Labor’s carbon price (which actually lowered pollution) and replaced it with the fund. Recently, we’ve had yet more evidence suggesting the ERF is not fit for purpose. There was an auction process recently, and it yielded cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution. Now we’ve arrived at the Coalition’s carbon budget, which is really the linchpin of campaign calm down. Periodically, Morrison gets pressed on the gap between what he contends is happening and what is actually, demonstrably happening. When this inconvenience presents, voila, out comes the carbon budget (which in simple terms, is the actions to reduce pollution that will be undertaken between now and 2030 to ensure Australia hits the Paris target). Morrison would like voters to know his carbon budget exists, because it’s a prop to aid his prime ministerial performance. But I strongly suspect he doesn’t want people looking at it too closely, because it’s rubbery. A couple of quick examples. Almost 100 megatonnes of pollution reduction is booked to “technology improvements”. What those improvements might be is entirely unclear. There’s more abatement booked to an electric vehicles strategy that doesn’t exist, or if it does, nobody knows about it. I’d make a joke about invisible electric vehicles but none of this is funny, and it seems too soon, given we are all still processing the war on the weekend. Finally, there’s the big accounting hey presto. Carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitments) deliver a 367-megatonne contribution to our 2030 emissions reduction effort. That sounds a lot, because it is a lot. It’s basically about half the designated task. If we were in a court proceedings, we’d submit this brief of evidence, and the verdict would be short, sharp and simple: things are not under control when it comes to Australia meeting our Paris target, and we have crap policies to deal with the most serious policy challenge we face. Having established that, let’s move now from the domestic picture back to the Pacific and beyond. Pacific leaders are fully aware that things are not under control when it comes to Australia’s climate change efforts. You can understand their impatience. They are standing on the frontline of a climate crisis, and trying to prod laggards around the world. The Pacific needs the big emitters, and countries that can influence them, like Australia, to stop obfuscating and start acting while we’ve got a chance of averting the worst scenarios. So, this week, entering the global arena, Morrison found himself wedged between the campaign calm down offensive at home, and Australia’s demonstrable absence of climate leadership. This cycle will repeat again and again as Australia fronts up to the rolling international discussions about climate change, unless the government can find the will to get serious. Speaking of the sequence of global discussions, the next milestone is the United Nations climate summit in September. Pacific leaders, who exert significant moral leadership given the existential threat they face, will have wanted to emerge from this week’s Tuvalu forum with the strongest collective statement possible to project ambition at the UN. Morrison will attend the UN in September, and ahead of those discussions, the secretary general, António Guterres, has already written to Australia asking the government (and, of course, other governments) to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Some countries will go to the UN armed with new commitments, and the countries with new commitments are given prominent speaking spots. Australia is not expected to be one of those countries. The current guidance is September is too soon for Australia to have a settled position on a 2050 strategy. This is all pretty depressing, but there is one glimmer of light on the horizon. Despite all the arm twisting in Tuvalu, Australia did, in the end, sign up to a statement that commits us to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, and to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020. That would be next year. By signing up, Morrison has pushed the government past the Paris horizon, meaning Australia has entered a new round of policymaking on emissions reduction. Bear in mind emissions reduction has generated civil war inside the Liberal party for much of the past decade. If you were into conspiracy theories, you might speculate that Morrison made a lot of noise in the Pacific about protecting Australia’s coal industry to provide cover internally as he piloted the government into the post-Paris phase of proceedings without unhinged mayhem breaking out on 2GB or Sky News. The statement issued after the Pacific forum notes this post-Paris phase “may include commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050”. Shhh. Whatever you do: don’t tell Craig Kelly."
"Jacinda Ardern has declared that “Australia has to answer to the Pacific” on climate change, saying that New Zealand is doing what it can to limit global emissions to 1.5C and expects other nations to do the same.However, the New Zealand prime minister stopped short of saying New Zealand would throw its weight behind the smaller Pacific nations who are urging Australia to commit to a rapid transition from a coal-based economy at this year’s Pacific Islands Forum. “Issues around Australia’s domestic policy are issues for Australia,” she said, when asked about Australia’s coal use. Ardern said she had “every expectation that this Pacific Islands Forum will be dominated by climate change” and reiterated her government’s commitment to reducing emissions, citing the goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2035, which is currently working its way through New Zealand parliament. “Like our Pacific Island neighbours, we will continue that international call, we will continue to say that New Zealand will do our bit and we have an expectation that everyone else will as well; we have to.” Pacific leaders have this week been urging Australia to commit to urgent action to reduce emissions. On Monday, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, appealed to Australia in a speech “to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change”, saying it posed an “existential threat” to Pacific islands. Ardern refused to comment on reports that Australia has been attempting to water down the language on climate change in the communique that is due to come out of the PIF on Thursday after the leaders’ retreat. Climate Home News reported that an annotated draft of the Pacific Islands Forum declaration showed Australia trying to suppress references to the climate “crisis”, 1.5C, carbon neutrality, a ban on new coal plants and phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. Greenpeace said that Australia’s plans to water down the communique could see it become “the pariah of the Pacific”. “How does Morrison reconcile calling the Pacific family while he persistently ignores our demands for Australia to reduce its emissions?” said Joseph Moeono-Kolio, Greenpeace’s head of Pacific. Scott Morrison, who touched down in Funafuti about an hour after Ardern, set a positive tone in his first public speaking appearance, at the launch of a Pacific skills portal, at which he did not take questions. Morrison said the Pacific Islands Forum was a “family gathering” and that “when families come together they talk about the stuff that matters, that’s most important to them. Over the next few days that’s exactly what we’ll do.” His only reference to what are anticipated to be heated debates on the climate crisis was to say the leaders would be “talking about the future of our environment” as part of their discussions, as well as the future of our economies and jobs. Morrison cited his government’s renewed focus on the region, the so-called Pacific Step-Up, saying, as he has several times before: “If you’re going to step up you have to show up, and Australia’s going to show up, we’re not just going to show up here, we’re going to show up for the hard conversations, the good conversations, the family conversations that we have, that’s very much the spirit with which we’re engaging.”"
"As the Pacific Islands Forum comes to an end, Australia has yet again been shamed on a global stage for our inaction on climate change. The forum was held in Tuvalu, one of the lowest lying islands on Earth, where the effects of sea level rise are already being seen. For Tuvalu, a global commitment to limiting climate change to 1.5C is literally a question of survival. By doing everything he could to water down the forum communique’s climate language, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, refused to listen to the words of Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, when he urged leaders to focus on “survival, not saving the economies of countries”.  However, in a country like Australia, even that is a false choice. Australia more so than almost any other country has the opportunity to prosper economically through decarbonisation. We can, as they say, have our cake and eat it too. The pathway to global decarbonisation relies heavily on the shift from coal, oil and gas to renewable resources. In a decarbonised world not only do we power our homes and businesses with renewables, but we also power our cars, buses, trains and industry with wind, solar and storage. With technologies like electric vehicles, hydrogen buses and electromagnetic industrial heating, this is all eminently possible. As a country with some of the best solar and wind resources in the world, vast areas of land, a low population and manufacturing base and strong trading relationships particularly in Asia, Australia is uniquely positioned to help decarbonise our region. Indeed, it is not only our Pacific neighbours who are asking for our help. Our biggest trading partners – Japan, South Korea and Taiwan – are looking eagerly at Australia’s renewable resources to help them act on climate. Already, there are plans in development to export solar energy to Singapore through a Sun Cable from the Northern Territory. Macquarie Capital is financing the development of the Asia Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia. This project, which has recently grown to 15GW of solar and wind, will not only power the mining operations of the Pilbara and increased onshore minerals refining, it will also generate renewable hydrogen that can be exported to our neighbours. This week, Pacific leaders asked Australia to stop expanding our coal industry. As a country that has been exporting coal since 1799, this request came as an affront to our federal government. However, given that coal is the biggest cause of climate change and Australia’s largest contribution, we cannot be serious about stopping climate change without planning to move beyond coal. While moving away from coal will have its challenges, it is possible. It is also better to restructure our economy deliberately, supporting those who work in the coal industry, than for these communities to be left to the whims of global market forces. Already the Latrobe Valley Authority is showing how we might do this. From electric vehicle manufacturing, to investment in transport infrastructure, to more jobs in healthcare, their efforts to diversify the economy of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria are showing progress. Restructuring our economy does not happen over night, but we need to recognise that it has already started. In the past three years $9bn have been invested in building renewable energy generation. According to Macromonitor, the renewables boom is “currently the largest contributor to overall growth in construction in Australia”, helping to keep our economy moving forward. However, this boom will not continue without new policy as the renewable energy target comes to an end. With our economy stagnant and interest rates low, now is the time to invest in the future of Australia and in the process help ensure the survival of our neighbours. However, if the moral and economic arguments for acting on climate change are insufficient to move our recalcitrant federal government, perhaps the geopolitical argument will be more persuasive. China is actively working to strengthen its position in the Pacific, seeing this as a strategic location. Their efforts include backing the calls by Pacific leaders to act on climate and phase-out coal power, as well as direct support for infrastructure and renewable energy deployment in the Pacific. As a country that has globally committed to climate leadership, China has both the moral authority and the economic leverage to make Australia increasingly irrelevant. Scott Morison’s performance at the Pacific Island Forum has not helped this situation. Australia’s regional and global influence will not grow unless we are fair dinkum about acting on climate change. Without greater domestic action, we may be able to throw our weight around at the Pacific Islands Forum, but we will slowly lose our geopolitical, economic and moral authority in a world that has committed to act on the climate crisis. • Nicky Ison is a founding director of the Community Power Agency and a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney"
"Critical talks at the Pacific Islands Forum almost collapsed twice amid “fierce” clashes between the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, over Australia’s “red lines” on climate change. Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, who was part of the drafting committee of the forum communique and observed the leaders’ retreat, said there was heated discussion over the Australian delegation’s insistence on the removal of references to coal, setting a target of limiting global warming to below 1.5C and announcing a strategy for zero emissions by 2050. He described the discussions as “frank, fierce at times, [with] very strong positions being held”. “Negotiations almost broke down twice, [with leaders] saying ‘this is not going to happen, we’re not going to have a collective decision’,” he said. Leaders had to take a break from proceedings, which started about 9.30am local time and lasted for almost 12 hours. “That’s why it took so long,” Regenvanu said. “When things break down, you know there’s a huge amount of frustration, luckily it didn’t break all the way down and the leaders were able to bring it back.” Leaders had to cancel meetings and press conferences scheduled for the afternoon, as the retreat stretched through the afternoon and well into the night. An evening feast that was meant to mark the close of the forum, prepared by the community from one of Tuvalu’s atolls, complete with a traditional dance performance, began without the leaders. Regenvanu said one compromise proposed to resolve the impasse was to declare a climate crisis for the Pacific island states, which do not include Australia, rather than for the whole region. Regenvanu said Australia had agreed to that “in total blindness to what’s happening in their own country”. “On emissions reduction and dealing with your own climate, Australia is out there, they’re not with us,” he said. “Pretty much on everything else we’re on the same team, in terms of mitigation, adaptation, making sure there’s resourcing for all this, it’s only in terms of domestic emissions strategy that Australia is way out.” Asked whether the breakdowns came because of Australia’s refusal to budge on its positions on climate change, Regenvanu said “that would not be an incorrect assumption”. He said it was mostly Sopoaga who took the fight to Australia. Speaking on Friday morning at a joint press conference with Morrison, Sopoaga said he had told the Australian prime minister during the retreat: “‘You are concerned about saving your economies, your situation in Australia, I’m concerned about saving my people in Tuvalu and likewise other leaders of small island countries.’” “That was the tone of the discussion,” Sopoaga said. “Please don’t expect that [Australia] comes and we bow down or that ... we were exchanging flarey language, not swearing, but of course you know, expressing the concerns of leaders and I was very happy with the exchange of ideas, it was frank. Prime minister Morrison, of course, stated his position and I stated my position and [that of] other leaders: we need to save these people.” Sopoaga said the discussions were so passionate that the prime minister of Tonga cried at the retreat while talking about two young women who had presented to leaders on Monday about the impacts of the climate crisis. “The leader of Tonga actually shed tears in front of the leaders for the passion about referring to the presentation of the two young warriors of climate change the other day,” said Sopoaga. “That was the atmosphere.” Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, expressed unhappiness with the declarations on Thursday night. “We came together in a nation that risks disappearing to the seas, but, unfortunately we settled for the communique,” he said on Twitter. “Watered-down climate language has real consequences – like water-logged homes, schools, communities, and ancestral burial grounds.” Despite the concessions to Australia throughout the communique and climate change statement, Sopoaga said he thought leaders had achieved “probably the best outcome given the context and circumstances”. Regenvanu said that apart from the five red lines that “compromised” the documents, the resulting statement was a “stronger statement on climate change than the forum has ever made”. “There was reference to 1.5 [degrees warming] throughout, reference to supporting the science of the IPCC report, supporting all the stuff the UN secretary general talked about, just transition away from fossil fuels, stopping inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. “So most of the language that we wanted is in there and I think it’s a much stronger statement on climate change than the forum has ever made. That’s the positive,” he said. “I think it’s a credit to [the leaders] what we ended up with something and that we all can live with it. We all can implement it, we all can own it, including Australia.”"

Olson spotlights the “Fakegate” scandal as a salient example of the unethical and deceptive practices used by those who promote dangerous anthropogenic global warming (AGW) — a“difficult-to-sell” cause. It is suggested that the ethically questionable tactics employed by AGW “marketers” (i.e., falsely hyping “the severity, immediacy and certainty of AGW threats”) have failed and should be resisted.

Three years ago, an unheralded paper was published in The International Journal of Geosciences entitled “Climate Change Science & Propaganda” (Nelson, 2015).  The author, a retired chemical engineer, openly and brazenly characterized the United Nation’s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as an “undisputed” distributor of propaganda.

“Propaganda is a manipulation tool focused primarily on emotions. It has little to do with truth or facts and everything to do with persuasion and motivation. Whether that is good or bad, depends on whether you feel science should be boringly independent and often ignored, or entertainingly deceptive but viewed by many. If the initial reaction is emotional, it’s probably propaganda.”
“The IPCC members are obligated to uphold, maintain, and implement its principles and promote its products, and act in accordance with the manifesto (IPCC, May 2011 p. 24). They must proactively communicate with the media and correct any incorrect representations that may be damaging (IPCC, May 2011, p. 33). Bureau members must not express any views beyond the scope of the reports (IPCC, May 2011, p. 36). All members, including all lead authors (IPCC, Nov 2011, p. 16) must sign a conflict of interest form (IPCC, Nov 2011, p. 19), which indirectly obligates them to uphold the IPCC principals and products.”
“It is undisputed that not only does the IPCC recommend propaganda, it teaches and promotes it.”   — Nelson, 2015

In a new paper (detailed below), Dr. Erik L. Olson — a professor of marketing at BI Norwegian Business School (BINBS) — further derides the current marketing of an imminent human-caused climate threat.
Olson targets the tendency for the purveyors of dangerous AGW to utilize deceptive and unethical tactics in an effort to garner the public‘s attention and to “sell” governmental policies that promote costly emissions mitigation.
He analyzes the public’s response to the “Fakegate” scandal — an instance in which an activist climate researcher named Peter Gleick admittedly stole documents and deceptively posed as a Heartland Institute member in a failed attempt to undermine climate change skepticism.
The results of the analysis reveal that AGW advocates (or, as Olson calls them, “believers”) tend to justify the unethical conduct of those on their side as long as the transgression is deemed to have been for a “good cause”.
Noting that the AGW paradigm is “difficult-to-sell”, Olson warns that the utilization of deceptive headlines, the unethical practice of manipulating temperature data to “hide the decline”, stealing documents  and faking authorship . . . are not effective selling points when it comes to persuading an already skeptical public.
Instead, as a marketing tool, the utilization of deceptive and unethical  tactics are destined to fail.

Olson, 2018

“[O]pinion polls and other research show a public that frequently perceives climate science and associated AGW threats as complicated, uncertain and temporally and spatially distant (Anghelcev et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2016; Gordon et al., 2011). Thus climate scientists, celebrities, public policymakers and other AGW social marketers face a daunting task in convincing a lackadaisical and often skeptical public to support AGW mitigating behaviors and policies. The difficulty of this marketing assignment has also led to the utilization of ethically questionable tactics that hype the severity, immediacy and certainty of AGW threats (O’Neil and Nicholson-Cole, 2009; Rogers, 1975; Rosenberg et al., 2010).”
“For example, the past 25 years have witnessed a large number of greatly exaggerated predictions regarding the speed and scope of temperature increases and AGW dangers from a variety of AGW “endorsers,” which have fortunately proven to be false alarms (Bastasch, 2015; Grundmann, 2011; Michaels, 2008; Newman, 2014).  Another ethically questionable example is provided by the Climategate scandal involving members of the climate science community and their attempts to increase public certainty regarding the methods and predictions of “mainstream” climate models by blocking the publication of research not supportive of the AGW paradigm (Curry, 2014; Grundmann, 2011).”
“[C]ommercial marketers are widely criticized and distrusted because they frequently resort to ethically questionable tactics when the marketing assignment involves uncompetitive or unsought products that are difficult to honestly sell (Holden and Cox, 2013; Olson, 1995). .. [T]he use of ethically questionable persuasion techniques by social marketers is more likely to occur when the promoted cause is “difficult to sell” owing to definitional disputes between the marketer and target regarding the “greater good” implications of the promoted behaviors and public policies (Hastings et al., 2004; Holden and Cox, 2013; Spotswood et al., 2011; Von Bergen and Miles, 2015). Yet despite these philosophical discussions on social marketing ethics in the literature, there has been relatively little empirical attention given to the ethical dilemmas that social marketers face when tasked with difficult-to-sell causes such as the AGW paradigm (Freeman, 2009; Pang and Kubacki, 2015).”
“The Fakegate scandal that is the focus of the current research is different than other AGW scandals and ethical missteps, however, because the protagonist publicly admitted to the intentional use of ethically questionable tactics for the purposes of favorably influencing public opinion regarding the AGW cause. Fakegate started with the theft of internal strategy and donor documents from the Heartland Institute, a libertarian think tank and dangerous AGW “competitor” owing to their efforts to educate the public regarding climate model uncertainties and the high economic and political costs of AGW mitigation (Hoffman, 2011). … An analysis of the writing style, content details and errors in the fake document led several bloggers to speculate that the thief and fake document author was Peter Gleick, a climate researcher, environmental think tank president, chairman of a scientific association ethics committee and frequent blogger on climate science and AGW threats (Greenhut, 2012). These publicly discussed suspicions led Gleick to confess and apologize for his use of deception in posing as a Heartland board member to acquire and disseminate the internal documents.”
“Failures provide valuable learning opportunities, and the Fakegate failure demonstrates that social marketers who are unwilling or unable to honestly and persuasively debate the scientific validity and “greater good” of their cause, should not resort to ethically questionable persuasion tactics if they hope to win widespread and lasting trust and support for their social marketing objectives.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI couldn’t possibly recommend the following new book enough: The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change.
It is authored by the person whom leading German center-left “intellectual” weekly Die Zeit once portrayed (black vs white) as the Godfather of the global warming denial and doubt syndicate: Marc Morano of CFACT’s Climate Depot.

The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change 
The book has since rocketed to the No. 1 seller position in a variety of categories. That’s no surprise considering I read the first 188 pages nonstop in the first sitting alone before putting it down for the first time.
Marc Morano: the climate science Prince of Darkness
Viewed as the Prince of Darkness by climate-protection activists, Morano in his new book describes how he is in fact a real environmentalist and who, as almost every skeptic does, truly cares about the real environmental problems we face. However, one day back in 1992 the movement left him disenchanted after recognizing how leading green activists wildly exaggerated the situation in the Amazonian Forest and intentionally fabricated false stories of a world in environmental peril.
For Morano, all the fabricated doom and gloom was just too much to take. The data didn’t fit, and the characters behind the movement were clearly driven by dogma.
He has since become a hardened climate science skeptic – precisely the kind needed to critically research and expose the outright scandalous activism, deception, politicization, gross distortion and fear-mongering that climate “science” is fraught with. His book has done just that and with profound eloquence and success.
Humorous, chock-full of data and inconvenient facts
Having received an advance copy, Marc’s renowned, upbeat attack-style comes through in full color. Not only is the book humorous, but it’s also chock-full with data, facts and recent hard scientific findings that will make the Al Gore-acolytes cringe in embarrassment.
The book presents the strong arguments over a wide range of climate related issues – from energy, to natural climate factors, to weather anomalies, to sea level rise, etc. – in an easy to understand manner. It’s the book to go to if you’re having doubts about the alarmist science and the “green” direction we are being steered into.

Morano’s book exposes the hypocrisy of jet-setting, yachting limousine billionaire leftist elitists, who lead pampered lives in energy-guzzling mansions and private jets while preaching to the rest of us trying to make ends meet about the need to forego fossil fuels.
I’m also honored to note that NoTricksZone is mentioned multiple times in the book:

Only one rational conclusion
After reading this book, there is only one conclusion a rational reader could possibly draw: Climate science is corrupt, wildly exaggerated and a hoax propagated by a cabal of leftist elitists. The climate issue is the greatest distraction of our generation and among the most monumental waste of resources in human history.
“Warmists’ worst nightmare”
In the final chapter “On The Way Forward”, Morano writes climate sanity was restored to the United States with Trump’s election, and that Trump is: “The warmists’ worst nightmare: the first Republican presidential nominee who ever staked out a strongly science-supported skeptical position not only on climate change claims but also on the socalled ‘solutions’.”
Great progress in a long fight
Morano, however, does think Trump needs to do more because in his view “there is a huge vacuum when it comes to administration officials actually challenging climate change claims,” and that “this silence may result in only half-hearted measures to reverse Obama’s climate policies“.
Morano, the man behind Climate Depot, warns that the fight is far from over and that now is not the time for skeptics to let their guard down:

The green movement essentially put all of their chips onto the climate scare, and it is unlikely that they will back down anytime soon.”

Yet, after reading Morano’s book, the skeptic warriors and climate realists can rest assured that a lot of things are going their way on a number of fronts. The climate scam is moving well beyond its best-before date.

Germany’s right-wing AfD party and (at times) the FDP Free Democrats, are the only parties across the German political landscape who are challenging climate change science and the country’s much maligned Energiewende.
Of course the media in Germany, where man-made climate disaster is accepted as fact, tries to use this to portray skeptics as being extremist and crackpot.
Yet, the FDP and AfD together make up a formidable 25% of the German Parliament, and so climate policy is no longer getting the unanimous free pass it used to get. Also a faction of Angela Merkel’s CDU party have expressed reservations about climate science and green energies. Some things are moving.
Skepticism is budding in Germany, and that is in some ways remarkable in the consensus-driven country.
On Friday, March 23, before the Bundestag (German Parliament), Karsten Hilse of the AfD (Alternativ für Deutschland – Alternative for Germany) party told before Parliament that there is nothing unusual happening to the global climate today, and that the changes we are currently observing are well within the natural range.
Hilse then scoffs at claims the planet is heading for an apocalypse.

(Please excuse the poor audio quality).

Next Hilse reminds that climate is defined as the mean of 30 years of weather, and goes on to call measures aimed at “protecting weather” absurd. He also alludes to the corrupt nature of German climate research: “The institutes deliver exactly what their funders request.”
Hilse expressed his party’s doubts that one extra molecule of CO2 per 10,000 has the climate impact that is often claimed to have. He reminds that the global warming is mostly generated in models – models that are unable to reproduce the past, and thus cannot be relied on to make forecasts for the future.
At the 2:40 mark Hilse fields a question from an opposing Parliamentarian, who asks why Hilse rejects the consensus of “99% of independent scientists”. “Which scientific sources are you citing for your pseudo-statements?” Hlise explains (amid some background shouting) that the study in question is flawed: Of the 12,000 publications examined, some 8000 took no position at all. Background here.
Near the end, Hilse went on to reject the government’s de-carbonization effort by 2050, often dubbed as the Great Transformation, and Germany’s participation in binding international decarbonization treaties.
He also says the AfD is calling for a stop to the financing of pseudoscience and an immediate stop of the German EEG renewable feed-in act, which he calls a “socialist redistribution”, that so far “has cost consumers several hundreds of billions of euros”.
Parliamentarians more concerned about leaving town early
Viewers will note how the Parliament is almost empty for that particular session on CO2 emissions, which tells us just how seriously the German government takes “humanity’s greatest threat”.

Obviously few of them cared enough to show up, and most were more concerned about getting out of town really early for the weekend.

"Four days into its two-week Atlantic crossing, the zero-carbon yacht carrying climate activist Greta Thunberg is becalmed in the ocean after a choppy start to the trip, still 2,500 nautical miles from New York. In an update posted to Twitter around midday on Saturday, the 16-year-old said she was eating and sleeping well and had no sea sickness so far. Day 4. Pos 46° 20‘ N 015° 46‘ WEating and sleeping well and no sea sickness so far. Life on Malizia II is like camping on a roller coaster! pic.twitter.com/pf1PnqYCov Boris Herrmann, the experienced captain who is skippering the Maliza II, which is carrying a crew of four including Thunberg’s father, Svante, tweeted: “When you have no wind and you’re drifting around... Ahh the contrast to yesterday ... gives some time to slow the boat to have a wash and play some games ... which Greta keeps winning!” On Friday the boat, which is a high-speed planing monohull built for the 2016-17 single-handed, non-stop round-the-world Vendée Globe race, had “experienced uncomfortable conditions and everyone is feeling a bit seasick but nothing too bad or unexpected”, Herrmann tweeted on Friday. August is not the ideal time to cross the ocean as it is in the middle of the Atlantic’s hurricane season. The team’s progress is being tracked on a website. Thunberg is hoping to cross to the US in time to appear at two crucial global gatherings: the Climate Action Summit in New York on 21-23 September and the UN climate conference in Santiago in early December.  She refused to travel by plane to the US because of the environmental impact of flying. Earlier in the year Thunberg undertook a tour of European countries by train. While mainly powered by wind, the yacht draws its electricity for lighting and communication from solar panels and underwater turbines – aiming by these means for zero-carbon status. There are no bathroom facilities on board so the crew must make do with blue plastic buckets. Herrmann said the journey would show how it was possible to cope without fossil fuels. He said: “This can be positive and exciting. Solidarity with Greta is not limited to eco-activists.” • This article was amended on 13 September 2019 to clarify references to the yacht being solar-powered. The main power source was wind. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the past months a spate of scientific papers published show sea level rise has not accelerated like many climate warming scientists warned earlier. The reality is that the rise is far slower than expected, read here and here.

Alarmist bedwetting by scientists over sea level rise proving to have been needless. Photo: PIK climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf. Source: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Rahmstorf FTP folder.
Scary scenarios abound
The latest findings glaringly contradict alarmist claims of accelerating sea level rise. For example the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) here wrote sea levels would “likely rise for many centuries at rates higher than that of the current century”, due to global warming.
In 2013 The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) wrote here sea-level rise in this century would likely be 70-120 centimeters by 2100″ (i.e. 7 – 12 mm annually) and that 90 experts in a survey “anticipated a median sea-level rise of 200-300 centimeters by the year 2300” (i.e. on average circa 7 to 10 mm every year).
It’s important to note that the above scary figures given above are mostly based on computer simulations, where parameters are simply assumed by the scientists.
Evidence in fact points to deceleration

Using these modelled estimates, the globe should now be seeing a rapid acceleration in sea level rise. Yet no evidence of this can be found so far. In fact the real measured data show the opposite is happening: a deceleration in sea level rise is taking place.
Instead of the 7 – 12 mm annual sea level rise the PIK projected in 2013, a recent study appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters in April 2017 corrected the satellite measured sea level rise downwards from 3.3 mm annually to just 3.0 mm over the past 24 years – or less than half what PIK models projected.
Only 1.5 mm/year
Worse, satellite data measuring sea level have turned out to be far more complex and uncertain than one would wish, and evidence is piling up and showing that satellite data likely have been overstating sea level rise. For example when measuring sea level rise along coastlines (where people actually live)using tide gauges, the rise has even been far slower. Renowned Swedish sea level expert Axel Mörner published a paper in 2017 showing an observed sea level rise rate of only 1.5 – 2.0 mm/year.
Second half of the 20th century slower than in the first half
In another newly published paper by Frederiske et al. 2018 just this year, oceanographers estimate that global sea levels rose at a rate of only 1.42 mm per year between 1958 and 2014. That figure closely coincides with the results of Dr. Simon Holgate from 2007. According to the Holgate study: “The rate of sea level change was found to be larger in the early part of last century (2.03 ± 0.35 mm/yr 1904–1953), in comparison with the latter part (1.45 ± 0.34 mm/yr 1954–2003).”
The Holgate result was confirmed by another 2008 paper authored by Jevrejeva et al, which found the fastest sea level rise during the past 300 years was observed between 1920 – 1950 with maximum of 2.5 mm/yr.
In other words: global sea level rise has decelerated since the 1950s.
At less than 2 mm annually, sea level is rising at only one sixth of the 12 mm per year rate projected by the PIK in 2013.

0.15°C Since 1959
 – Dr. B. Smirnov, Microphysics of Atmospheric Phenomena

Image Source: Springer

Purveyors of the viewpoint that rising CO2 emissions pose a grave threat to the planet via dangerous global-scale warming presuppose that the surface temperatures of the Earth are highly sensitive to parts per million (ppm) variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
And yet the accumulation of scientific publications documenting a far less consequential role for CO2 in the climate system just keeps growing and growing — especially in recent years.
An incomplete compilation of at least 75 scientific publications now document a very low climate sensitivity to CO2 concentration changes.   Summarizing, doubling modern era CO2 concentrations from 280 ppm to 560 ppm may only raise surface temperatures by tenths of a degree – if that.
75 Scientific Papers Affirm Very Low Sensitivity To CO2
Expanding upon a 2016 scientific paper published in Europhysics Letters, Dr. Boris M. Smirnov, an atomic physicist, uses his field expertise in authoring another textbook entitled Microphysics of Atmospheric Phenomena.  The volume is one of 20 physics books Smirnov has published over the last two decades.
In chapter 10, Smirnov asserts that infrared emission from water vapor dwarfs the atmospheric contribution from CO2 within the greenhouse effect, as CO2 only “contributes in small portions“.

In fact, Smirnov finds that doubling the modern era CO2 concentration will only result in a temperature increase of 0.4°C.
He further calculates that the increase in CO2 concentration from 1959 (316 ppm) to the present (402 ppm) has only contributed 0.15°C to surface temperatures.  This means, of course, that the bulk of the temperature changes that have occurred in the last 55 to 60 years are not of human origin.
Steadily and gradually, the “consensus” position that says the climate is highly sensitive to variations in anthropogenic CO2 emissions continues to unravel.

Smirnov, 2017
It is shown that infrared emission of the atmosphere is determined mostly by atmospheric water. One can separate the flux of outgoing infrared radiation of the atmosphere from that towards the Earth. The fluxes due to rotation-vibration transitions of atmospheric  CO2  molecules are evaluated. Doubling of the concentration of  CO2 molecules in the atmosphere that is expected over 130 years leads to an increase of the average Earth temperature by (0.4±0.2) K mostly due to the flux towards the Earth if other atmospheric parameters are not varied.



Smirnov, 2016
[W]e take into account that CO2 molecules give a small contribution to the heat Earth balance and, therefore, one can use the altitude distribution of the temperature for the standard atmosphere model [1], and a variation of the CO2 concentration does not influence this distribution.  …  [I]njection of CO2 molecules into the atmosphere leads to a decrease of the outgoing radiation flux that causes a decrease of the average Earth temperature. But this decrease is below 0.1K that is the accuracy of determination of this value.  Thus, the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decreases the outgoing atmospheric radiative flux that leads to a decrease of the Earth temperature by approximately (1.8 ± 0.1) K. The change of the average temperature at the double of the concentration of atmospheric CO2 molecules is determined by the transition at 667cm−1 only and is lower than 0.1K.
In particular, doubling of the concentration of CO2 molecules compared to the contemporary content increases the global Earth temperature by ΔT = 0.4 ± 0.2K. … From this we have that the average temperature variation ΔT = 0.8 ◦C from 1880 up to now according to NASA data may be attained by the variation of the water concentration by 200ppm or Δu/u ≈ 0.07, Δu = 0.2. Note that according to formula (2) the variation of an accumulated concentration of CO2 molecules from 1959 (from 316ppm up to 402ppm) leads to the temperature variation ΔT = 0.15°C. One can see that the absorption of a water molecule in infrared spectrum is stronger than that of the CO2 molecule because of their structures, and the injection of water molecules in the atmosphere influences its heat balance more strongly than the injection of CO2 molecules.

"When the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism pledged money to News Corp and Nine Entertainment last month, some cynics wondered why the $100m philanthropic outfit was giving a leg-up to media moguls. The director of the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas, Mark Ryan, says the readers of the Australian and the Australian Financial Review, both grant recipients, deserve quality journalism.  Whether grant recipients are newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch or an independent publisher is irrelevant to the institute, Ryan says. The Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas was founded by the billionaire Australian philanthropist last year to support public interest journalism. Guardian Australia was among several outlets, including the ABC and the Sydney Morning Herald, to receive a grant. “I’ve been pretty upfront about this,” Ryan tells Guardian Australia. “For this institute to succeed, and to succeed globally, it needs to be working with everybody, including large commercial players. “We were not going to be favouring what is perceived as one side or other of Australian media. “We need to fish where the fish are and work with existing and very strong platforms. We’ll be doing other smaller and what people may think of as more deserving recipients as well. We want to partner up with anyone. We don’t want to close the door on anybody.” One of the recipients of the first round of grants is not a publication at all but the Sydney Opera House, which sources say received the largest amount of non-government funding for a festival in its history. On 1 September, the institute is partnering with the Sydney Opera House on Antidote, its annual festival of ideas curated by Edwina Throsby. As a consequence of the unusual collaboration, the festival will include panels on reporting on climate crisis, press freedom and free speech. Renowned Philippines investigative journalist Maria Ressa is heading up the panel on press freedom – My Crime is Journalism. The Rappler editor has been reporting critically on the extrajudicial killings, human rights violations and fast-rising death toll from president Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal war on drugs. The session with Ressa, Egyptian journalist Lina Attalah, Russian journalist Irina Borogan and the dean of the Columbia University graduate school of journalism Steve Coll will be moderated by Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was sentenced to seven years’ prison by  Egyptian authorities in 2014 before being deported. Meanwhile, CEO of the Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma Bruce Shapiro, Sisonke Msimang and Atallah will chat with Sky News host David Speers about communication in a polarised world in a session titled Who Gets to Speak. The Covering Climate panel will be moderated by Kerry O’Brien and feature Columbia Journalism Review editor and Climate Now co-founder Kyle Pope, the conservationist Tim Flannery and the CNN Indonesia anchor Desi Anwar. Pope is leading the Covering Climate Now initiative, which has partnered with the Guardian, and is trying to shake up the world’s media to cover the climate crisis as the most pressing story of our time. “We’re trying to get outlets to understand that we are not saying you have to hire a climate reporter,” Pope explains. “We’re trying to get people to slightly recalibrate how everyone thinks about it. Every beat reporter, including sports and business, should start to think about the changes to the climate and how they should be covered. “We’re fighting perceptions that it’s depressing, it’s complex and it’s boring. It’s about the survival of humanity, so it’s definitely not boring!” Pope says it’s not ideology which is the greatest barrier to widespread reporting of the climate crisis, but limited resources. “I don’t think the greatest challenge is the Murdoch press, and I don’t expect Fox to sign on [to the initiative]. But we have a much bigger media in the US, and you have a trifecta of companies that control the market there [in Australia]. “It’s not so much that that’s the problem. There’s been a severe reduction in news resources at almost every organisation and I think they all say, ‘Oh god you’re going to ask us to do more? We have to do more?’ “They think that they have to cover city hall or climate change. It’s not what we’re saying. You cover city hall and climate issues with the same person.” • Antidote festival is on Sunday 1 September at the Sydney Opera House • On 22 August 2019 the standfirst on this article was changed to clarify that the grant given to Sydney Opera House was the largest granted for a festival."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA German online magazine specializing on trends of the future says green power grids still have a ways to go. Meanwhile a new study suggests vegans have better love lives, and that meat-eaters smell bad and have near-zero sex drive!
According to German Trends of the Future, switching over to solar and wind energy from fossil fuels won’t be as easy as many green energy proponents think, and that “much remains to be done”.
The aim is to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050, which means the elimination of most fossil fuels, will take much longer.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne
The site, which believes human-made climate change is a real problem that needs to be solved quickly, writes that prominent energies wind and sun share the same problem: “They are not available on a regular basis”.
Unstable supply and high costs
The report sees problems with the storage technologies that are available today, such as Tesla’s Powerwall, or the larger scale technologies for entire power grids, citing high costs.
That cannot be realized today, especially for a power grid that that is 100% supplied by sun and wind energy and outfitted with the storage technology is still quite a ways out into the future.
The report thus writes that it will not be possible “to completely rely on renewable energies over the midterm”.
However, Trends for the Future adds that green energies have become “an important factor in our power mix” and is able to curb the share of fossil fuels” (although fossil fuel consumption globally continues to climb even today).
Vegans Have Better Love Lives!
And now for the comedy science of the week, from the German language Huffington Post here which has an editorial praising the virtues of veganism – the radically kooky diet that rejects all animal-based foods like “milk, eggs, cheese and yoghurt. And, God forbid, meat!

Not only does veganism offer positive aspects with respect to climate, animal welfare and health, the German HuffPo commentary claims, but it cites a new study that suggests vegans have better love lives!
The HuffPo cites a study commissioned by nutrition portal “nu3”, which looked at the love lives and lifestyles of low-carb, gluten-free, vegan, and paleo diet followers. The result, according to the study: vegans by far have the best love-life.
Vegans separating from stinky meat-eaters
The HuffPo adds that the study found: “Vegan women are averse to having sex with meat eaters, or even having a relationship with them.”
The Huffpo adds:
About 30% of vegans would leave their partner if he or she returned to meat eating!”
Near zero sex drive
According to the New Zealand study, the main reason for the aversion to meat-eaters by vegans is the “supposedly unpleasant odor” that meat-eaters have. In short, vegans think meat-eaters stink too much.
The HuffPo commentary also wrote that people who consume a lot of meat “have to use a lot of energy for digestion. They feel lethargic, heavy and the desire for sex tends to be near zero.”
Really? 🙂
Fact: Meat eaters more sane, happier
Okay, maybe us meat eaters don’t smell as nice as you flower-scented, animal-hugging, climate-rescuing vegans, but at least according to one recently published University of Graz study, us carnivores are more sane, healthier and happier overall. And we are also quite content finding ourselves at the top of the food chain, thank you.
