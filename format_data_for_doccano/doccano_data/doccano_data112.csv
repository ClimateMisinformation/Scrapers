"“We’re doomed,” says Mayer Hillman with such a beaming smile that it takes a moment for the words to sink in. “The outcome is death, and it’s the end of most life on the planet because we’re so dependent on the burning of fossil fuels. There are no means of reversing the process which is melting the polar ice caps. And very few appear to be prepared to say so.” Hillman, an 86-year-old social scientist and senior fellow emeritus of the Policy Studies Institute, does say so. His bleak forecast of the consequence of runaway climate change, he says without fanfare, is his “last will and testament”. His last intervention in public life. “I’m not going to write anymore because there’s nothing more that can be said,” he says when I first hear him speak to a stunned audience at the University of East Anglia late last year.  From Malthus to the Millennium Bug, apocalyptic thinking has a poor track record. But when it issues from Hillman, it may be worth paying attention. Over nearly 60 years, his research has used factual data to challenge policymakers’ conventional wisdom. In 1972, he criticised out-of-town shopping centres more than 20 years before the government changed planning rules to stop their spread. In 1980, he recommended halting the closure of branch line railways – only now are some closed lines reopening. In 1984, he proposed energy ratings for houses – finally adopted as government policy in 2007. And, more than 40 years ago, he presciently challenged society’s pursuit of economic growth. When we meet at his converted coach house in London, his classic Dawes racer still parked hopefully in the hallway (a stroke and a triple heart bypass mean he is – currently – forbidden from cycling), Hillman is anxious we are not side-tracked by his best-known research, which challenged the supremacy of the car. “With doom ahead, making a case for cycling as the primary mode of transport is almost irrelevant,” he says. “We’ve got to stop burning fossil fuels. So many aspects of life depend on fossil fuels, except for music and love and education and happiness. These things, which hardly use fossil fuels, are what we must focus on.” While the focus of Hillman’s thinking for the last quarter-century has been on climate change, he is best known for his work on road safety. He spotted the damaging impact of the car on the freedoms and safety of those without one – most significantly, children – decades ago. Some of his policy prescriptions have become commonplace – such as 20mph speed limits – but we’ve failed to curb the car’s crushing of children’s liberty. In 1971, 80% of British seven- and eight-year-old children went to school on their own; today it’s virtually unthinkable that a seven-year-old would walk to school without an adult. As Hillman has pointed out, we’ve removed children from danger rather than removing danger from children – and filled roads with polluting cars on school runs. He calculated that escorting children took 900m adult hours in 1990, costing the economy £20bn each year. It will be even more expensive today. Our society’s failure to comprehend the true cost of cars has informed Hillman’s view on the difficulty of combatting climate change. But he insists that I must not present his thinking on climate change as “an opinion”. The data is clear; the climate is warming exponentially. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that the world on its current course will warm by 3C by 2100. Recent revised climate modelling suggested a best estimate of 2.8C but scientists struggle to predict the full impact of the feedbacks from future events such as methane being released by the melting of the permafrost. Hillman is amazed that our thinking rarely stretches beyond 2100. “This is what I find so extraordinary when scientists warn that the temperature could rise to 5C or 8C. What, and stop there? What legacies are we leaving for future generations? In the early 21st century, we did as good as nothing in response to climate change. Our children and grandchildren are going to be extraordinarily critical.” Global emissions were static in 2016 but the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was confirmed as beyond 400 parts per million, the highest level for at least three million years (when sea levels were up to 20m higher than now). Concentrations can only drop if we emit no carbon dioxide whatsoever, says Hillman. “Even if the world went zero-carbon today that would not save us because we’ve gone past the point of no return.” Although Hillman has not flown for more than 20 years as part of a personal commitment to reducing carbon emissions, he is now scornful of individual action which he describes as “as good as futile”. By the same logic, says Hillman, national action is also irrelevant “because Britain’s contribution is minute. Even if the government were to go to zero carbon it would make almost no difference.” Instead, says Hillman, the world’s population must globally move to zero emissions across agriculture, air travel, shipping, heating homes – every aspect of our economy – and reduce our human population too. Can it be done without a collapse of civilisation? “I don’t think so,” says Hillman. “Can you see everyone in a democracy volunteering to give up flying? Can you see the majority of the population becoming vegan? Can you see the majority agreeing to restrict the size of their families?” Hillman doubts that human ingenuity can find a fix and says there is no evidence that greenhouse gases can be safely buried. But if we adapt to a future with less – focusing on Hillman’s love and music – it might be good for us. “And who is ‘we’?” asks Hillman with a typically impish smile. “Wealthy people will be better able to adapt but the world’s population will head to regions of the planet such as northern Europe which will be temporarily spared the extreme effects of climate change. How are these regions going to respond? We see it now. Migrants will be prevented from arriving. We will let them drown.” A small band of artists and writers, such as Paul Kingsnorth’s Dark Mountain project, have embraced the idea that “civilisation” will soon end in environmental catastrophe but only a few scientists – usually working beyond the patronage of funding bodies, and nearing the end of their own lives – have suggested as much. Is Hillman’s view a consequence of old age, and ill health? “I was saying these sorts of things 30 years ago when I was hale and hearty,” he says. Hillman accuses all kinds of leaders – from religious leaders to scientists to politicians – of failing to honestly discuss what we must do to move to zero-carbon emissions. “I don’t think they can because society isn’t organised to enable them to do so. Political parties’ focus is on jobs and GDP, depending on the burning of fossil fuels.” Without hope, goes the truism, we will give up. And yet optimism about the future is wishful thinking, says Hillman. He believes that accepting that our civilisation is doomed could make humanity rather like an individual who recognises he is terminally ill. Such people rarely go on a disastrous binge; instead, they do all they can to prolong their lives. Can civilisation prolong its life until the end of this century? “It depends on what we are prepared to do.” He fears it will be a long time before we take proportionate action to stop climatic calamity. “Standing in the way is capitalism. Can you imagine the global airline industry being dismantled when hundreds of new runways are being built right now all over the world? It’s almost as if we’re deliberately attempting to defy nature. We’re doing the reverse of what we should be doing, with everybody’s silent acquiescence, and nobody’s batting an eyelid.”"
"A Pakistani city has set a global record temperature for the month of April, with the mercury rising to more than 50C on Monday, prompting fears that people might leave to escape even higher temperatures when summer sets in. The southern city of Nawabshah recorded a high of 50.2C on Monday.  “We are worried that the extreme heat started too early this summer, and are planning to migrate to other cities if the situation remains the same,” one city resident, Ismail Domki, said. The director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Ghulam Rasool, said: “We have issued forecasts about the extreme heat in Sindh province but were not expecting a world record in the month of April.” Domki said the official response had been inadequate. “There is no response from the government, at least 24 cases of heatstroke were reported on April 30 and five of them were serious cases with people losing consciousness,” he said, adding that these were just known cases at the government-run hospital. A report in the Dawn newspaper said the unbearable heat forced people to remain indoors throughout the day. Roads and markets looked deserted and business activities came to a halt. The worst sufferers of heatstroke were labourers and motorcyclists. Recent summers across the Middle East and south Asia have produced sweltering heat above 50C, melting roads, overwhelming power infrastructure and raising serious questions about the liveability of settlements from Iraq to India. Last year, Pakistan was ranked among the top 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change. A severe heatwave in the southern port city of Karachi in 2015 left more than 1,200 dead, with more than 40,000 people suffering from heatstroke.  "

"Technical work undertaken for the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee assumes the ageing Liddell power plant will be out of the system by 2023 – a development that will help drive the emissions reduction requirements of the Coalition’s new energy policy. While the Turnbull government has applied extraordinary public pressure to AGL Energy to extend the operating life of Liddell, including encouraging the Hong Kong-owned Alinta Energy to make an offer for the asset, technical work done for the Neg suggests retirement is already factored into the new system.  The 58-page modelling work conducted for the Energy Security Board on the Neg, obtained by Guardian Australia, says Liddell’s retirement is one of three factors material to whether the proposed emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 can be met. The other two factors are falling demand forecasts and the entry of a large proportion of renewable energy capacity already contracted into the system. The modelling did not examine the impact of plant upgrades as a mechanism to meet the emissions reduction target because of time constraints. The modelling, done by Frontier Economics, indicates that no new coal enters the system either under the Neg, or on a business-as-usual scenario, and the Neg will drive a rising share of renewables at the expense of coal, which is forecast to fall from 73% of output in 2020 to 60% in 2030. While the government has been keen to highlight the risks of rising power prices for consumers in the event Liddell exits the system, the modelling, which assumes the power plant retires, says wholesale energy prices under the Neg will be 30% lower than under business as usual by 2030. It says the lower prices forecast as a consequence of the Neg “reflect the combination of policy certainty and a more competitive bidding process in the spot market from a higher level of contracting under the guarantee”. It suggests Liddell’s retirement after 2022 will reduce supply, which will increase prices, but the government’s policy mechanism will ameliorate at least some of the negative consequences. The modelling suggests the Neg will ensure a smoother transition than in a business as usual scenario “as bidding from existing dispatchable plant is more competitive under the guarantee” – with the policy leading to price reductions when the impact is measured over the decade. The modelling emerged after AGL Energy confirmed on Monday it had received a non-binding and “highly conditional” $250m cash offer from Alinta and its Hong Kong-based owner, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, for the Liddell power station and site. Despite months of public pressure from the government, AGL has made it clear it does not want to sell the ageing plant. The company wants to close the facility and replace it with a mix of renewables, batteries, gas power, upgraded coal power and demand response. After it received the bid from Alinta on Monday, AGL told the ASX that “no assurance can be given that any transaction will result from the offer”. “AGL has not sought to sell the Liddell power station as it requires Liddell to provide energy to its customers until 2022 and for repurposing as part of its NSW generation plan post 2022,” the company said in a statement. Alinta has signalled it is interested in a quick acquisition, and has tried to sweeten its offer by signalling it would be happy to sell power back to AGL to allow it to proceed with its own transition plans. The company is interested in expanding its market share in New South Wales. While both the competition watchdog and the Australian Energy Market Operator have argued that more competition in the NSW energy market would be beneficial to consumers, the federal government has no power to force AGL to do anything with the asset it acquired from the state government in 2014."

"With global warming, we can make predictions and then take measurements to test those predictions. One prediction (a pretty obvious one) is that a warmer world will have less snow and ice. In particular, areas that have year-round ice and snow will start to melt.  Alpine glaciers are large bodies of ice that can be formed high in mountains, typically in bowls called cirques. The ice slowly flows downwards, pulled by gravity, and is renewed in their upper regions. A sort of balance can occur where the loss of ice by melting or flowing at the bottom is equal to the gain of snow and ice by precipitation.  As the Earth warms, the melt line moves upwards so that the glacier melts faster and faster at the bottom, shortening the glacier and reducing its mass. Ultimately, the melted water flows into streams and rivers and ends up in the oceans, contributing to accelerating sea level rise. While glaciers are interesting from an intellectual standpoint, they are also important to ecosystems and society. For example, the rate of glacier melt affects downstream water levels, river flowrates, and the water available for human use. So, it would be really important for us to be able to predict what will happen with glaciers in the future and plan for how water availability will change.  Of the groups that track glaciers, my favorite is the World Glacier Monitoring Service, which publishes a survey of the mass changes from selected glaciers around the world, available here and summarized below. The graph shows changes to the mass of the glaciers that are monitored, measured in millimeters of equivalent water. But this doesn’t tell the whole story because there is very little information about glacier health in the high latitudes (Northern Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe, Northern Russia, etc.). Very few temperature records exist in high elevations in these regions. Furthermore, the temperatures do not extend back very far in time. So, it is challenging for scientists to develop a long-term perspective on glacier health in these areas. And this is why a new study attracted my attention. A paper was just published by the American Geophysical Union that shared research carried out by Dominic Winski and his colleagues.  This team of researchers extracted ice cores from the glaciers on Mt. Hunter, in Alaska. The ice cores held snow and ice from as far back as 400 years. The researchers showed that the amount of water melt currently is 60 times greater than it was prior to 1850. They also found that the summertime temperature changes on Mt. Hunter are almost 2°C per century (about 3.5°F). To put this in perspective, the temperatures are rising about twice as fast as global temperatures. The fact that temperatures on these northern mountains is rising faster than the globe as a whole is something predicted by climate models. The reason it warms so fast in these locations is that as the warming starts, snow begins to melt, exposing dark soil, which absorbs more sunlight, leading to more warming. We call this a feedback loop. There are other feedbacks at play, including changes to vertical temperatures in the air, changes to clouds, and changes to atmosphere currents. These areas were predicted to warm particularly fast, and the measurements confirm the predictions. The authors recognized that during the summer, the top layer of snow and ice can melt. The liquid water permeates the ice beneath it and refreezes, creating a more solid ice layer than before. Because the bands of solid ice are formed from melting snow, more bands of solid ice mean that summer temperatures were above freezing when the ice bands formed. Measuring the number and thickness of these bands through time gives information about how warm the summer temperatures are.  So basically, the authors used these annual ice-core bands to deduce temperatures as far back as 400 years ago. They found that the frequency of melting events increased by 57-fold from the 1650–1850 time period compared with 1980–2011. They also measured a 60-fold increase in total melt. These are staggering numbers. I asked the lead author, Dominic Winski to summarize his findings and he told me,  This research shows that peaks in the Alaska Range sustain additional summertime warming through links with rising ocean temperatures in the tropics. Not only have we learned that summers are much warmer on Mt. Hunter than they were hundreds of years ago, but our research also demonstrates how connected the climate system is, with changes in certain parts of the world affecting places thousands of miles away. It will be interesting to see if others can replicate these findings in other locations. But the collaboration of the conclusions with other evidence is quite compelling. Good work, researchers."
"A statement by the ABC’s political editor in a TV news report that Tony Abbott was “the most destructive politician of his generation” breached the ABC code for impartiality, the broadcasting watchdog has ruled. The Australian Communications and Media Authority found that Andrew Probyn’s piece to camera on a 7pm news bulletin last October was “problematic” and “incongruent” with the rest of his news report. “Although the statement was very brief, its impact was heightened by the fact that it was delivered by the ABC’s political editor in the report’s only piece to camera,” the Acma investigation found. “It was not in keeping with the ABC’s requirement to present news with due impartiality. Accordingly, the ABC breached Standard 4.1 of the Code.” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon  It is the second time since 2011 the ABC has breached its code. In Probyn’s report on the former prime minister’s speech to the Global Warming Policy Foundation thinktank, he said: “Tony Abbott, already the most destructive politician of his generation, now intends waging war on what he calls ‘environmental theology’. “If this tells us anything, it’s that Malcolm Turnbull can’t do anything to appease Tony Abbott on climate action, which may even embolden cabinet to pursue and deliver the energy policy it wants.” A former political reporter for the West Australian, Probyn had just replaced Chris Uhlmann, who resigned to join the Nine network when Laurie Oakes retired. The ABC’s own investigation found the story was impartial and in keeping with its editorial standards. “Abbott’s speech, which was made as the government are finalising their new energy policy, was therefore highly newsworthy, in the public interest and appropriate for further contextualisation and analysis,” the ABC told the Acma. “We have also referred to the Macquarie dictionary which provides the following definition for ‘destructive’: “tending to overthrow, disprove, or discredit”. It is the case that Mr Abbott over his long political career has succeeded in overthrowing his political and ideological opponents, and in his speech to the GWPF he sought to discredit or disprove the consensus on climate science. In the highly competitive context of federal politics, “destructive” is not necessarily a pejorative descriptor.” Acma disagreed and said the ordinary reasonable viewer “would have understood this statement to be a comment on Mr Abbott’s political career generally, rather than a comment specific to his involvement with climate change policy”.  “Contrary to the ABC’s submissions that ‘destructive’ is not necessarily a pejorative descriptor, the ACMA considers that the ordinary reasonable viewer would have understood it in those terms.” The ABC said Probyn had made a professional judgment expected in news reporting, as opposed to giving his opinion.

"The climate sceptic thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs was mooted as a co-host of an Australian visit by Donald Trump’s beleaguered Environment Protection Agency head, Scott Pruitt, which may have included discussion with local officials on whether environmental deals should be changed or cancelled. Emails released to the US environment group the Sierra Club under freedom of information laws show that Matthew Freedman, a Washington consultant who describes himself as “a close personal friend” of the Australian environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, played a central role in organising Pruitt’s proposed August trip before it was cancelled when Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas gulf coast. In the US, the emails are of interest as evidence that Pruitt relied on business figures and lobbyists to plan and justify his overseas travel. They were first published by the New York Times. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon  From an Australian perspective, they give insight into Pruitt’s proposed agenda and schedule. They discuss focusing on promoting “innovation deregulation”, federal-state relations and how to counter potential disagreements with Australian officials about climate change. The EPA administrator rejects mainstream climate science and worked closely with fossil fuel companies to reduce environmental regulation when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general. Freedman suggested that Pruitt meet several members of the Australian government including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull (listed as “Malcomb”), the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, and the then resources minister, Matt Canavan, along with Frydenberg. He said an initial step should be to get a better sense of any US-Australian environmental agreements and whether they should be “changed or updated or cancelled and replaced with others”. There is nothing in the emails to indicate that Australian officials agreed with this agenda. The documents include an email from the executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam, in which he proposes a two-hour roundtable for Pruitt with IPA-affiliated researchers who disagree with the scientific consensus on climate change. They included a James Cook University geophysicist, Prof Peter Ridd and the IPA senior fellow Jennifer Marohasy, who has accused the Bureau of Meteorology of corrupting the temperature record and whom Roskam described as “Australia’s authority on temperature and climate variability”. “All of these people are excellent and I know Scott and his team would learn a great deal from a discussion with them,” he wrote to Freedman. Roskam also recommended Pruitt meet Maurice Newman, a former chair of Tony Abbott’s business advisory council who has described global warming as “a delusion”, the former Productivity Commission head Gary Banks and the economist Henry Ergas. The IPA head wrote that he had spoken to the then Minerals Council chief, Brendan Pearson, who was “working with the [US] embassy” on the trip. Pearson resigned from the council late last year after its biggest member, BHP, objected to the lobby group’s advocacy for new coal plants under his leadership. In emails to Pruitt’s staff, Freedman described the IPA as a “very strong group for the administrator” and a potential co-host of the trip. He said Pruitt’s office had agreed invitations should be sought from the Turnbull government, the business lobby group the American Australian Council (of which Freedman is the treasurer) and Australian non-government organisations, including the IPA.  The consultant said discussions with the government would inevitably turn to matters on which the Trump administration differed from Australia, giving the example of climate change. He said it was important to be able to say “we agree to disagree” on it. He recommended before the meetings that Pruitt get a briefing on the destruction of coral reefs by the Chinese to have as “a good talking point” when protection of the Great Barrier Reef came up in discussions with Australian officials. Freedman recommended that Pruitt meet the Victorian Labor government so that he could say he had met “both sides”. He said visiting the state also made sense because it was “open for business” and doing creative things that could lead to US tech companies setting up headquarters there. He said he would take advice from Frydenberg’s office on meeting the federal opposition. He had been in direct contact with the minister and had had conversations with his office and the embassy. A spokesman for Frydenberg said the minister had invited Pruitt to Australia when they met in the US last year. “The administrator expressed an interest and was keen to learn more about Australia’s cooperative federalism and ‘one-stop-shop’ environmental approvals process,” he said in an emailed response. “Given Mr Pruitt cancelled his trip to Australia, no meetings reached final confirmation.” The spokesman said Frydenberg and Freedman knew each other through the Australian-American Leadership Dialogue. Roskam said Freedman, the US embassy in Canberra and the US consulate in Melbourne had approached the IPA about Pruitt’s potential visit. He said the organisation had welcomed the chance to “work closely with the world’s leading advocate for cutting environmental red tape”. The emails released to the Sierra Club include tourist and dinner recommendationssuch as a trip to Uluru and breakfast at the Boathouse restaurant in Sydney, which Freedman said was owned by the former trade minister Andrew Robb, whom the ex-lobbyist described as “a good friend”. Pruitt faces 11 federal investigations in the US, including into his spending on travel and his business relationships with lobbyists. Freedman worked on national security-related issues for Trump’s transition team but was removed after using a personal email address to conduct government business."
"In 2017, the weather in California was the hottest in history. It was hotter than in 2016, which was also the hottest in history. The vineyard owners spoke nervously of how difficult it was to find people willing to pick grapes in this heat. The apple trees dropped all their apples. Over the summer the smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning throughout the state gave me a chronic cough, which turned into walking pneumonia. People began to talk about how illnesses are getting weirder these days. I decided to attend a climate change action meeting I had seen announced in the local newspaper. It was an experimental prototype course founded on the ideas in George Marshall’s book Don’t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change. After spending 15 years studying climate change-denying microcultures, Marshall concluded that facts don’t change people’s minds – only stories do. We’re so motivated by wanting to belong that we’d rather risk the dangers of climate change than the more immediate symbolic death of estrangement from our peers. In order to address climate change in our communities, Marshall suggests, we must appeal to the same desires that religion does: belonging, consolation and redemption.  For this reason, the purpose of the group – or “fellowship”, as the organisers called it – was to borrow the most effective tools of religion in order to create a community of people who would work together when it was time to implement policy change, or even take to the streets. Their aim was to galvanise 3.5% of the local population – the number that social scientists estimate is the tipping point for effecting social change. You had to apply to join the prototype course, so after the informational meeting I wrote the organisers the following email: “I grew up with a dad who would regale us with climate change statistics over the dinner table. If my brother said he was going to a Giants game, my dad would say that he better enjoy it now because there weren’t going to be any Giants games in the future. Hanging on the wall was a colour-coded map he had created, showing what property values would be when ocean levels rose in the Bay Area. He terrorised all my friends by describing how the atmosphere would start to smell like rotten eggs as soon as the oceans warmed and started pluming carbon. In effect, I assumed that by 2020, life on Earth wouldn’t exist anymore. I teach environmental studies, and am looking for ways that I can bring hope to my students but also help motivate them (as well as myself).” The organisers tried many methods for cultivating a feeling of fellowship. They’d start the session by banging a gong, or by reciting a poem by William Stafford, or one about holdfasts – the dangly part of seaweed that clings to rock – which we were encouraged to commit to memory in order to steady ourselves when things got rough. They encouraged us to discuss our vulnerabilities. But the most effective method was to scare the crap out of us with mini-lectures about the realities of climate change, which bonded us in common terror. We were presented, at the beginning, with a self-proclaimed “humourless, brain-numbing deep dive into climate science”. They told us it wasn’t supposed to happen this quickly. Climate scientists had predicted that by 2017 we would be at 380 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but we were already past 410ppm. The man who presented this information was, like my father, a local architect. Scrunching up his face he said, “I don’t want to depress you, but I want to tell it to you straight.” The most effective glue for bonding, our organisers said, was collaboration: we needed a goal we could all work towards. Our goal was to phase out the internal combustion engine in California by 2030. They gave us questionnaires so we could spend the next week testing the public’s receptivity to this idea. Here are some of the responses we got: “What happens if the power goes out?” “Where do the cars on the road go? Do we get a free car? What happens to the oil companies? Would you be punished for having a gas car?” “Do I have to get rid of my brand-new car? How did we get into this mess? What can we do to ensure our children can understand so they know what is going on by the time they get through high school?” “Why not just get everyone to stop eating meat instead? Agriculture creates as many greenhouse gases as automobiles. Haven’t you seen Cowspiracy?” “There are so many other issues. Why electric cars? We need to change our habits! Our schools should feature human relationships and our relationship to the Earth. The 4 Rs: Reading, ’Riting, Rithmetic, Relationships.” “Could I go to Nevada to buy a car?” “Isn’t solar production toxic?” “What will I do with my beloved van that carries all my stuff day after day?” “Would there be violent, emotional reactions to such a ‘radical’ move? How do we deal with that reaction?” “I like it. Get there!” “Proud of you, Bill, for being involved. It’s inspiring.” “I’m not driving an electric car! I’m allergic to electricity and smart-meter rays!” “2030 may be too late to avoid some of the most catastrophic climate & social issues.” “We have such a gas + car culture. Why do we let high-schoolers drive to school? We need to change the consciousness. Only HS kids who work should have a car.” I was surprised by the responses. To be honest, I thought people would be more excited about it. Our climate change group provided a metastudy about the 97% scientific consensus on climate change. Because scientists never say that something is 100% true, and by nature, are often poor at communicating on an emotional level and tend to resist alarmist scenarios, the climate change deniers have been able to point to that 1-3% of doubt (97% is also the proportion of scientists who support the theory of plate tectonics). We also learned that 61% of Americans say climate change is important to them, but rarely or never discuss it with people they know. Our homework was to become climate change evangelists for a month. To prepare, we discussed how to raise the topic with a stranger: “Sure is hot these days”, or “How often do you take the train? Trying to save on fossil fuels?” or “Do you ever remember it being 97 degrees in October?” I decided, as an experiment in humiliation, to discuss climate change everywhere I went. The following are methods I do not recommend: 1. Bumping into someone’s shopping cart at the supermarket: “Oh, sorry, I was just so distracted thinking about climate change.” 2. After complaining to my boss about the measly salary I make as an adjunct professor: “I apologise for expressing myself in such a heated manner about how impossible it is to live on this salary. I was just really distressed thinking about climate disruption.” 3. During Hurricane Harvey, I was having dinner with my neighbour, whose car has bumper stickers that say things like “My other car is a broom” and “Never fear, the Goddess is here!” So it was unsurprising to hear her say: “This hurricane is Earth Mama expressing her anger at the patriarchy!” “Actually,” I said, “I’m not sure if the hurricane has anything to do with the Earth getting angry. It might have more to do with greenhouses gases. I’m not saying that climate change is causing the hurricane. It acts more like a hormone, or an adverb, an intensification of the qualities already present. I’m afraid things are only going to get worse.” 4. I went to my friend’s Blade Runner party, which was filled with fortysomething guys who kept reciting all the lines and knew all the trivia answers. During the pee break, one guy started talking about how we’d all be wearing Google Glass in 10 years. “If the Earth doesn’t burn up,” I added. “Right!” someone interjected, and I thought we might be on our way to a useful discussion. “This party just turned into a real downer,” someone else said, so we went back to the movie. Oh, no, I thought. I’m turning into my dad. Over dinner, he often told stories about how the heartbeat of the ocean might stop, which would affect the wind and freeze parts of the midwest and Europe. For this reason I think of discussing climate change as a relaxing family activity. My father’s second wife, on the other hand, got so tired of hearing about global warming that she considered getting a “Stop global dooming” bumper sticker for her car. When my brother announced that his wife was pregnant, my dad told him he wouldn’t need a college fund since there wouldn’t be any college in the future. My brother, who was tenderly grilling ribs, threw down his barbecue fork and said: “For once I want to talk about life, and not always be focused on the end!” After that, climate change became a forbidden topic on holidays. Now I was rediscovering what I had understood as a kid: people don’t respond well to threats, to cajoling, to end-of-the-world scenarios, to dystopian futures, to hopelessness. But as I watched the news about Hurricane Harvey, I was astonished that not a single anchor mentioned climate change. Instead they blamed the flooding on Houston’s paved surfaces. According to George Marshall, those who don’t believe in climate change are less likely to believe in it after a climate disaster. Every single member of our group was confounded by this. “That makes no sense!” we said to one another. If a person believes that weather fluctuates regardless of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or that catastrophes represent some kind of punishment from God, confirmation bias will lead him to view the latest climate disaster as proof. And after a climate disaster, people feel a heightened sense of community; they don’t want to get into a politicised discussion with the neighbour who just saved their dog. Furthermore, Marshall writes, climate disasters operate according to the same psychological logic people develop when they get struck by lightning. They tend to believe they are statistically immune to it happening again, even as the actual odds remain the same. And if your house floods due to a changing climate, it is more likely it will flood again. If your house burns down, it is more likely it will burn again. The night the fires started in northern California, my boyfriend and I had an argument. Afterward, he took out the garbage. “Come here,” he said when he opened the door. “Check out how hot it is outside.” A little while later, the wind started to sound like airplane engines. The following morning, my mom and my aunt both told me that they’d thought we were being attacked by North Korea. On the evening of 8 October 2017, severe gusts of dry winds blew across desiccated grasses and diseased trees caused by years of excessive heat and drought. A great flood had fattened grasses into combustible fuel. The wind knocked down power lines, which lit the trees on fire. The firestorm destroyed a thousand homes in a single neighbourhood. Neighbours pounded on neighbours’ doors, honking horns, trying to rescue one another. It took hours to leave town. Most people reported that drivers were calm, though a few resorted to the sidewalk, the median, and the opposite side of the road. One woman managed to stuff her pony in the back seat of her Honda Accord. Another woman had to choose between saving her car or her horse. She jumped on her horse in her pyjamas and rode away from the flames. The fires burned for over a week, killed 44 people, and destroyed more than 10,000 structures and square miles of land. It was the most destructive outbreak of fires in California’s history. During the fires I took walks, and I tried to read the paper falling from the sky. I wanted to collect the scattered notes, but they disintegrated when I picked them up, leaving the smell of poison on the tips of my fingers. The paper pieces lay curled like chocolate shavings. They were all the size of my palm. I was looking for stories, but I could only find information. Bible pages (sections from Genesis); phone bills; pieces of romance novels (so many of those); perfectly preserved letters so meticulously burned around the edges that they looked the way letters do when you burn them in fourth grade to make them look romantic; gold-embossed stationery with someone’s name written over and over in tiny letters at 45-degree angles; musical scores; Swedish package-tour vacation brochures; pieces of phone books (people still have phone books); a kid’s homework (he did poorly); journal pages (so many pages of people talking to themselves); as well as tar paper and bits of insulation burned until thin as paper. I walked and walked and tried not to breathe. Why was the sky directly above me blue, while everywhere else it was gunmetal grey, and flickering with particulate matter? Everyone spoke of particulate matter. In the hardware store all you needed to say was “Where are they?” and they’d point you to the pile of N95 respirator masks. Someone passed me on the trail. I imagined he was judging me for not wearing a mask, but I couldn’t read his expression because he was wearing one. I looked at the dun, shoulder-high grass. That explosive fuel, the colour of pale grasshoppers, was all that stood between an out-of-control fire and me. Outside the grocery store, the usual produce had been moved inside to avoid falling ash. Walking down an aisle, I heard a woman yelling into her phone: “Keep it watered down. Dammit! Keep watering it down!” The news never reported where the active fire was. We only knew that it was completely uncontained, and that all effort was focused on rescuing people, evacuating the hospital, and getting elderly people out of their homes. All we could do was hope the winds wouldn’t change. I walked into the grasses to get away, to get away from the panic on people’s faces. There was no digesting this fire. There was no beginning, middle or end. I couldn’t stop thinking about Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, which was now decimated. I hadn’t walked on Sugarloaf Ridge in years, but whenever I used the words “poison oak” or “gallop” or “fog”, my mind flashed femtosecond images of the park. Now it was ash. My old high school had burned down, as well as everything along the roads to get there. Before the fires, I had been teaching a class on ecology. We were learning about systems theory and the interdependency of ecosystems, how trees communicate and send messages and medicines to other parts of the forest, and draw up water to share with other plants. We learned how insects can digest the compounds in eucalyptus and create poop that inhibits the growth of encroaching plants such as mustard. This is probably one reason why the eucalyptus has been so successful as an invasive species here. But in the 1850s, when the government planted eucalyptus throughout California at maniacal speed because its fast-growing wood was essential for railroad ties and fence posts, it turned out that these trees – unlike old-growth eucalyptus groves in Australia – twisted when they dried and became so hard that they were no longer suitable for building. And now the volatile oils in their leaves turned out to be extremely combustible. In seasonably dry climates, native oaks are fire-resistant, but with the introduction of eucalyptus we introduced an extreme fire hazard. I stared at the eucalyptus twisting in the heat. The weekend before the fires, I attended a grief workshop sponsored by the climate change group. They told us that grief processed on one’s own turns to despair, but grief processed communally becomes medicine. Our workshop leader suggested that the thing that will save us may be our own broken hearts, for true action can only come through these deeper feelings. The night after the grief workshop I got into an argument with my boyfriend. “You should get out of the Silicon Valley rat race and dedicate yourself to transitioning to a green economy,” I heard myself saying. “You’re a scientist. You can help develop technologies. This article says we have to treat climate change like we are fighting the second world war. For example, we have to start movements where everyone paints their roofs white to try to dissipate the heat before it reaches a rise of 1C. We have to cut carbon emissions now,” I said. “Here’s an article about what we can do to stay below a one-degree rise. There are solutions. If you were to really internalise that we are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the last generation to be able to do anything about it, would you change your life?” Even while I spoke, I could hear myself sounding like a maniac. I kept reminding myself that people don’t respond well to threats, to cajoling, to end-of-the-world scenarios. But I couldn’t help it. I was in a bad mood because it was so hot outside. “Yes, it’s the right thing to do,” my boyfriend finally said, calmly. “But if it were really that bad, as bad as you say, don’t you think Google would be doing something about it?” On the fourth night of the fires, the humidity plummeted again, and anxiety peaked. A dry wind was expected to blow almost as strongly as on the night the fires started. I packed a suitcase full of clothes and looked around my room. Should I pack the vase I bought in Turkey? How about the old Soviet tourist books about Tbilisi? How was it possible to choose between items of sentimental value? Better to leave it all. “At least we have the public pool across the street,” my mom said. We’d heard about the couple who took refuge in their neighbour’s pool while their own house burned. They stayed in the water for six hours, covering their faces with wet shirts whenever they had to come up to breathe. “How long does it take for a house to burn?” the woman had wondered underwater. My sister-in-law called and said: “Remember how when your brother and I first got married and your dad was always talking about global warming? Turns out he was right!” My dad called: “I’ve been needing Ambien to sleep. I’ll forgo that tonight.” The next day, having survived the night and craving fresh air, I drove to the ocean. I was searching for clean air, but smoke covered the soot-coloured sea all the way to the horizon. I could have felt guilty for driving a car with an internal combustion engine, but guilt goes on hold during fires. I sped on my way home, because the rule of law no longer applies during fires. This is the wildness that descends. This is the triggered reptilian brain. During the fires we craved sugar and fat and ordered pizza and didn’t mention that we usually never order pizza. During the fires my neighbour, the goddess, forgot she was gluten-intolerant. During the fires all I could think of was the word “holdfast”. We made a plan. It seemed perfectly reasonable at the time. If the wind blew the fire this way, we would get in our cars and head to the ocean. If the fire kept following us, we would drive into the ocean. A student of mine complained that he still had to work at the bank during the fires, since his branch was the only one open in the region. In one day customers deposited $600,000 in cash – a record – which they must have been keeping under their mattresses. My student said that all day his nerves were on edge because people kept walking into the bank wearing N95 masks. Later, the firemen told us that the masks don’t actually help much. A friend who was evacuated said he grabbed his two dogs and two banjos and hustled into his car. Driving away, he realised he had forgotten to pack any clothes. During fires you hear, over and over, “I lost everything, but at least I have my life.” A couple of people, after losing everything, knocked on the door of a man whose house was for sale. They said: “We’ve lost everything. Can we buy your house and everything in it?” He left everything he owned to them, including his toaster and bath towels. The songs on the local radio stations were especially upbeat during the fires. They interspersed Tom Petty’s I Won’t Back Down with quotes from locals who had lost their houses. “Fires are burning in eight California counties,” the news announcer said, with the Tom Petty beat in the background. A woman’s voice: “I came out to get my dog and looked down the ridge and saw a glow and I looked at the wind and I told my parents that they might want to pack up something just in case, and my mom said that the fire was already at the bottom of the hill … ” No I won’t back down, no I won’t back down / You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won’t back down … Another woman: “I just want to thank all of you first responders. I love you all from the bottom of my heart. I thank you all for being there. For being away from your families, to help everyone else out there … ” Hey baby, there ain’t no easy way out / Hey … “We are Sonoma County strong … ” I cried when the song came on, though I’d already heard it five times. I cried while driving, and when I saw the banners on every highway overpass: “Thanks, first responders.” “Thank you, firefighters.” Or the signs in front of the cafes: “Firefighters eat for free.” Even as the fire raged on. All the Mexican restaurants were closed except one. I went in to get a burrito and found it full of evacuees. “Sure is busy here,” people kept saying. One man said to the cashier: “It’ll have to be bulldozed. Totally demolished. How was yours?” “We’re OK.” It was still hot: 35C (95F) in late October. We wondered if winter would ever come again. You can’t get into a pumpkin-carving mood when it’s so hot. On Halloween a few kids came looking for candy, but it seemed like everyone else went to the movies. The parking lot at the theatre was full. I had a dream that I had to evacuate, and the only thing I grabbed was the leftover bag of Halloween candy. I handed out Kit Kats to people as we ran from the fire. After the fires, on Facebook people posted about the most random item they grabbed when they evacuated. – daughter’s piggy bank with $2.35 in coins in it – Grandmother’s Christmas cactus – a wetsuit – an avocado – the cat-scratcher tree – a Hermione wand – the cookie cutters – tarot cards – all the beer – kids’ pinewood derby trophies – the sewing machine – dog’s ashes – the spice rack – Norton Anthology of English Literature – son’s Darth Vader alarm clock – husband’s Hawaiian shirt collection – jury duty notice for the next day – the cat-litter box and all the cat litter – combat-ready lightsabers – a toothbrush (even though the man who grabbed this one was evacuating to a dentist’s office) – a jar of Miracle Whip (because they were evacuating to a mayo-heavy household) The fires didn’t discriminate between the houses of the rich and the poor. Everyone’s pearls melted, no matter how large. Nor did they discriminate between the houses of the “realists” and the “idealists”. After the fires, the realists wanted to rebuild as fast as possible with the same footprint. The original developers of Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park, which was destroyed by the fires, offered to use updated versions of their old floor plans in rebuilding efforts. Homeowners were upset to learn that they were now required to rebuild in adherence with the California green building standards code. They argued that they shouldn’t have to. Before the fires, the builders who showed up to city council meetings were the same people every time – they all seemed to be on a first-name basis. But after the fires, something changed. People began presenting ideas to install rain-catchment and grey-water systems, community gardens and bike paths. They wanted to revamp the land-use laws, change the zoning for tiny houses, use fire-resistant straw-bale construction, and concrete and foam. The city council was inundated with people wanting to rebuild with green roofs and walls, to rebuild in a way that would promote bees and carbon-capturing methods, even permaculture methods and composting plants. City officials looked a little frightened as they listened to a large group of people talk about a town in Kansas that rebuilt with renewable energy after getting hit by a tornado. More than 600 people showed up for a breakfast sponsored by Daily Acts, an organisation that builds community by working with neighbourhoods to turn lawns into drought-tolerant gardens. A farmer who had lost his farm and all of his bees spoke at the podium: “Why can’t Sonoma County always be able to feed its poor?” My neighbours started talking about “agrihoods”, a new trend in which affluent, slow-foodie millennials move to neighbourhoods surrounding a farm, instead of to the golf-course communities of their parents’ generation. My dad even wrote an op-ed about it.

"France and Australia can be the heart of a new Indo-Pacific axis, promoting peace, stability and a rules-based order, Emmanuel Macron said in Sydney on Wednesday. But the French president was at pains to stress that France’s continued emphasis on its Pacific presence was not one antagonistic to China, saying he welcomed Beijing’s economic and geopolitical rise. Macron – the leader of one of the last European powers with territory in the Pacific – said his country was and wanted to remain a “Pacific power”. He will travel from Australia to New Caledonia to campaign for the territory to remain a French collectivity when it goes to an independence referendum later this year. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon  Macron said he wanted to create a “strong Indo-Pacific axis to build on our economic interests as well as our security interests”. “I would very much like France, given it is the last European member of the EU being present in the Pacific after the Brexit … to be at the heart of this project,” he said at a fraternal press conference with Malcolm Turnbull. “This region is crucial for the stability of the world.” The Australian prime minister described France as a “Pacific Ocean power”, one well-placed to work with Australia in pursuit of shared goals. “We share the vision of a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific and will work closely to realise it, whether it is closer cooperation on maritime activities, support for our friends in the Pacific through humanitarian and disaster relief, or support for infrastructure in the region,” Turnbull said. France and Australia signed several agreements on Wednesday, pledging to work together on combating cyberterrorism, on defence cooperation, on quantum computing, and on climate change adaptation and resilience. Already, the French company DCNS has been awarded the $50bn contract to build 12 state-of-the-art non-nuclear submarines for Australia.  The growing influence of China across the Asia-Pacific – in particular its military manifestations of bases built on atolls in the South China Sea – is a growing concern for western powers. People’s Liberation Army Navy ships challenged three Australian warships sailing through the sea last month, in a significant escalation of Chinese assertiveness in the region. There have also been credible reports – though denied by both sides – of Chinese intentions to build a naval port in Vanuatu. But both Macron and Turnbull said their cooperation in the Pacific was not one made in reaction or opposition to China’s growing influence.  “There is nothing against vis-a-vis China, and in reaction to the Chinese rise,” Macron said, speaking largely in English. “I think the Chinese rise is very good news for everybody because it’s good for China itself.” But both leaders stressed the need for all countries in the region to adhere to the “rules-based order” which had underpinned the dramatic economic growth countries such as China had enjoyed. “That economic rise, that growth, has been enabled and made possible by a rules-based order in our region,” Turnbull said. “The peace and relevant harmony in our region has been enabled by the adherence to the rule of law.” Riffing on a Chinese proverb often quoted by the former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Turnbull said the Indo-Pacific order must not be reduced to one where “the big fish eat the small fish and the small fish eat the shrimp”. The centrality of New Caledonia to Macron’s antipodean visit was further emphasised. “I am a big fan of shrimp,” Macron said. “Especially New Caledonian shrimp.” Earlier, he challenged Australia to do more to tackle climate change. During a speech at the Sydney Opera House Tuesday night, he called on Turnbull to show the “power of conviction” and display courage in confronting climate change, despite the ideological barriers he faces in his party room. “I am fully aware of the political and economic debate surrounding this issue in your country, and I respect this,” Macron said. “But I think that actual leaders are those that can respect those existing interests, but at the same time decide to participate to something broader, to something more strategic.”"

"Al Gore, the former US vice-president turned climate change advocate, has warned that the deepening crisis of global temperature and sea level rise – and the consequent spate of natural disasters in America – will increasingly affect black and poor people more than others. Speaking at the opening of a new national memorial and museum chronicling America’s history of lynching and racial violence in Montgomery, Alabama, Gore said that the US could expect to see many more major disasters of the ilk of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria last summer.  The most vulnerable to the damage and suffering would be poor and older Americans, infants and children, and African Americans, who live in large numbers in urban areas where the heat island effect intensifies rising climactic temperatures. Almost eight out of 10 African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-burning plant, are three times more likely to die of airborne pollution than the overall population of the US, and black children suffer twice the levels of asthma with 10 times the level of asthmatic deaths, Gore said. The former vice-president to Bill Clinton, who famously won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but was defeated by George Bush on the electoral college count, launched an attack Scott Pruitt, the beleaguered administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for whittling down safeguards and regulations on air pollution. Pruitt is fighting to save his job having become engulfed in a raft of ethical controversies. Gore said of Pruitt: “I don’t know why he’s still in office, though I kind of do know.” He went on to accuse big business of leaning on Donald Trump to preserve Pruitt’s job. “The big grifters depend on the little grifter, and the big grifters have contacted the head grifter and said ‘Keep him in there’,” Gore said. The climate change advocate was speaking at a two-day summit organized by the Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights legal group in Montgomery. Under its director Bryan Stevenson, EJI has created a new museum and memorial that commemorates the victims of racial violence in the US and looks at the roots in slavery and segregation of the modern epidemic of mass incarceration. Gore called on his audience to remain hopeful that something could still be done to combat climate change in the US and beyond. He pointed out that the first occasion in which the US could legally withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would be 4 November 2020 – a day after the 2020 US presidential election. “If there is a new president, there is a 30-day notice period to rejoin the agreement,” he said. Gore added that maybe it wouldn’t be that long before Trump left office. “We’re only a little over a year into this experiment and in science and medicine some experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons.” In his assessment, Trump had proved to be less capable of inflicting damage on the environment than he had feared, Gore said. “In the rush to do what the big polluters wanted him to do as quickly as possible they have made a lot of mistakes and the courts are striking down some of their actions. We have a lot of resilience built into the American system. They are doing damage for sure, but I believe much of it can be overturned.” Gore finished with an impassioned call for reforms to protect the US democratic system from the caustic influence of rich individuals and corporations. “Out democracy was hacked long before Vladimir Putin hacked it, by big money and big lobbying. In order to solve the climate crisis we’ve got to fix the democracy crisis.”"
"More wind farms, solar power and electric cars: these are likely to be the future of the UK, under government plans announced this week to seek a zero-carbon economy in the next 30 years. Some of the less obvious effects could be just as transformative, however, involving innovations such as smart houses and smart roads, widespread changes to the countryside wrought by new tree-planting and new farming practices designed to conserve soils.  There may need to be restrictions, too – in air travel, private transport, new building construction and our food and waste habits. At the meeting this week of heads of government of the Commonwealth, government minister Claire Perry made the surprise announcement that she would ask the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers on climate change, to consider ways the UK could become “net zero-carbon” by 2050. That is widely regarded as being in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which require governments to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to hold warming to less than 1.5C, regarded as the limit of safety for small islands, which risk being swamped by rising sea levels. Though her words were rather vague, the commitment was widely interpreted as laying the groundwork for a major change to the UK’s long-term climate policy. Currently, ministers are pledged to cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. To reduce them to net zero by the same date, with only three decades to go, is a big step up. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, a thinktank, said the government would have to bring forward new measures as a matter of urgency. “The government has made real progress on some issues, such as diesel cars and offshore wind, but there are glaring holes in areas such as energy efficiency and onshore renewables,” he said. “The UK can achieve net zero emissions, but to do so the government will need to fill these gaps and develop a new set of policies.” Benton highlighted waste, housing and transport as key areas in which new policies could cut emissions fast, and said progress on these could give the government the confidence to continue with the policies needed. Renewable energy is likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries. The industry has had a turbulent time in the last few years, with the removal or slashing of key subsidies and clear messages from ministers under the last government that onshore wind turbines were unwelcome. However, thanks largely to the growth in renewables, the UK’s electricity network was able to run without coal for two days this week, a landmark achievement. Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of trade body Renewable UK, said: “It is in the UK’s best interests for ministers to be ambitious on climate change action. The science shows we need to stay within 2C for the good of all nations, including the UK and Commonwealth countries. Meanwhile, rapid technology developments suggest that successful future economies will be those powered by low-carbon energy.” Noting that wind power is now the cheapest new form of power in the UK, she presented a vision of the UK’s low-carbon future in which society broadly would benefit, because it would mean “renewable energy, better quality homes, cleaner and more efficient transport systems and smart technologies”. She said: “What’s best for the planet can also turn out to be best for the economy and for people.” However bright the low-carbon future, hard choices will have to be made. Greenpeace’s executive director John Sauven spelled it out: no new runway at Heathrow. “The data show that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. The government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget.” Less comfortably for many environmental campaigners, the government is also likely to have to consider new nuclear reactors. The plans for the UK’s first new atomic power plant in a generation, at Hinkley Point, have already run into controversy. The price paid to France’s partly state-owned EDF has been decried as far too high, and construction has proceeded slowly.  On energy efficiency, too, the government will need a new approach. The flagship “green deal” policy aimed at encouraging householders to take on loans to insulate their properties proved a failure, and nothing new has been proposed to take its place. Ministers have shown little sign of wishing to grapple with the problem. Another technology that might have helped towards zero-emissions targets, carbon capture and storage, was scrapped under George Osborne and would be costly to revive. On a separate front, however, there have been important positive signals. As well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the UK could meet its carbon targets by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. Plans to grow new forests have been enthusiastically endorsed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary. This could provide a “carbon sink” to reduce the UK’s contributions to global warming. Likewise, better management of the soil by farmers could increase its carbon storage capacity, and Gove has made clear he sees this as a priority.  If all these developments are not enough, ministers may also seek refuge in an often overlooked part of climate change policy. Since the Kyoto protocol of 1997, systems of trading carbon have been mooted and approved as ways of generating investment flows from the rich to the poor world. The idea is that rich countries that find it costly to cut their emissions can instead offset them by funding emissions reduction projects, such as wind farms or solar panels, in poorer nations. This is controversial, as many green campaigners insist that emissions cuts must be made at home, but it may be an option ministers wish to keep open."

"While the climate policy world is littered with numbers, three of them have dominated recent discourse: 2, 1000, and 66.  At the 2015 U.N. climate summit in Paris, world leaders agreed to limit global warming below 2°C to avoid catastrophic impacts of human-caused climate change. The science consequently dictates that, for a 50% chance of staying below 2°C, around 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (or 300 billion tonnes of carbon) can be emitted between now and 2050, and close to zero thereafter. We’re currently emitting 36 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. However, the potential greenhouse gas emissions contained in known, extractable fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this carbon budget, meaning that 66% must be kept in the ground.  The debate du jour thus centers on which emissions reduction pathway is most optimal for staying below 2°C. The calculus of many policymakers, economists, fossil fuel companies, and indeed scientists, is that the most economical way to stay below 2°C is to delay most emissions reductions for decades to come, and then to play catch up by relying heavily on as-yet technically and economically unviable negative-emissions technologies. However, a crucial number has been neglected in this mainstream calculation: 6.1 million. Each year, 6.1 million lives are lost prematurely due to air pollution. Though most acutely and visibly hampering megacities of the developing world, air pollution is a growing public health emergency that affects almost all of us in our daily lives, whether or not we are aware of it. The Health Effects Institute estimates that only 5% of the global population are lucky enough to live in areas with air pollution levels below safe guidelines. Though recent studies suggest there may in fact be no risk-free level of air pollution. Why is this number relevant to climate policy? Because one common culprit is responsible for the majority of both climate change and air pollution: fuel combustion. Burning coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass – for everyday uses ranging from electricity, heating, cooking, to transportation – releases hundreds of gases and particles, some of which disrupt the climate system or are harmful to human health, or both. Climate change could also worsen air quality in the future. Decades of research have revealed that air pollution is associated with a wide range of diseases and disorders, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and premature birth. There is also emerging evidence that pollution from coal combustion and motor vehicles can cause development delays, reduced IQ, and autism in children. The societal and economic costs of air pollution are multifold. There are costs to the affected individuals, to their families and to society in terms of direct medical costs, costs to healthcare systems, productivity losses, and lower economic growth (not to mention costs resulting from damages to ecosystems). Yet almost none of these costs stemming from our fossil fuel reliance are included in the majority of cost-benefit analyses of climate mitigation strategies. A recent study estimates that the health co-benefits from air pollution reductions would outweigh the mitigation costs of staying below 2°C by 140–250% globally. Historical evidence paints a similar picture. The EPA estimates that the U.S. Clean Air Amendments cost $65bn to implement, but will have yielded a benefit of almost $2tn by 2020 in avoided health costs. Many public health expert groups have underscored the enormous opportunity for leaders worldwide to design policies and initiatives that will simultaneously tackle climate change and air pollution. Examples include replacing the most carbon-intensive and polluting sources such as coal and heavy-duty diesel with lower-emission or renewable alternatives, ending fossil fuel subsidies, redesigning urban spaces to make it easier and safer to commute by foot, bicycle, and public transportation, and transitioning to a more circular and sustainable economy. While the climatic mitigation effects of such measures are long-term and dispersed globally, the health benefits are immediate and local.  For too long, the enormous toll of disease and deaths from fossil fuel pollution has been neglected in climate change policies and underappreciated by the public. But public health data makes it clear that not all 2°C scenarios are created equal. The lives and well-being of hundreds of millions of us – especially our children – could be at stake. We would be remiss to ignore it. Dr. Ploy Achakulwisut is a Postdoctoral Scientist at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

"Leaders of Commonwealth nations are meeting in London this week instead of the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu because things did not go according to plan. In 2015, cyclone Pam roared across Vanuatu, knocking out power, crippling water systems and levelling homes, schools and churches. In only 24 hours, the storm dashed the island nation’s hopes of hosting the Commonwealth summit. Three years later, many communities have yet to fully recover, in a place where the impact of a changing climate is on full display.  Vanuatu is one of New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours and friends – and its experience is an increasingly common one. In February, Tonga was hit by its worst cyclone in decades, cyclone Gita. When I visited the country in March, I spent time with schoolchildren who were learning in tents – the roof of their school had been blown off and the classroom walls destroyed by the storm. Such extreme weather events are tragedies. They are also provocations. They tell us that climate change is not a theory, or a projection, but something that is already happening. They tell us we must be more ambitious when it comes to tackling this urgent global challenge. The Commonwealth heads of government meeting is a good place to start. Twenty-eight years ago, the same meeting produced the Langkawi declaration on the environment, among the first collective statements to cite greenhouse gas emissions as one of the chief problems facing the world. I am confident that this year’s gathering can be just as decisive by fostering bold commitments to step up climate action. And while the task ahead is immense, New Zealanders know it can be achieved because we have a proud history of leadership on challenges than can seem too hard to contemplate. We were the first country in which women won the right to vote, we were at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement, and we were at the table when the United Nations was born. And we are ready to lead on climate change, the defining challenge of our generation. That is why my government has committed to setting an ambitious new target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In June, we are starting a consultation process on how to enshrine this commitment in law. Our plan includes an expert Independent Climate Commission which will develop carbon budgets through to 2050 – setting a path to carbon neutrality that maintains enough energy to run our economy and country. Along the way, we are committed to helping regions and industries directly affected by the transition move away from fossil fuels, with billions of dollars of investment in local infrastructure and clean energy projects on the horizon. We are also active in building international cooperation on climate action. Nearly half of New Zealand’s emissions come from our world-renowned farming sector. This is why we lead the 49-nation Global Research Alliance that is developing techniques to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising food security. And that is why we are committed to helping other countries achieve more climate-friendly agricultural production, in ways that will increase farmers’ yields and build resilience while reducing emissions. Alongside the UK, we belong to coalitions of forward-thinking countries and cities pressing to phase out coal generation, eliminate harmful subsidies that encourage wasteful fossil fuel use, and help our economies transition to carbon neutrality. The international consensus on climate change in Paris in 2015 was a historic achievement. Now we all need to do our part by delivering on what we signed up to. This means setting ambitious and concrete goals, like New Zealand’s plan to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035. And it means agreeing on the finer details around holding countries accountable for reaching their Paris targets. Leadership on climate change cannot be left to the big economies. It demands broad and deep action. New Zealand contributes less than 1% of global emissions. Yet together the world’s small emitters account for about a quarter of global emissions. History calls on us to play our part. At this week’s Commonwealth meeting, I’ll be thinking about Vanuatu’s experience – and the summit that couldn’t happen. I’ll also be guided by a Māori saying from my country – Mō tātou, ā, mō kā uri, ā muri ake nei – for us and for our children after us. That is what’s at stake when we talk about climate change – the world we’ll leave for the generations that follow us. They are why we need to act now, with purpose and courage. • Jacinda Ardern is the prime minister of New Zealand"

"If you’re a millennial, the global oil and gas company Shell will have been most pleased if you’d seen one their #makethefuture music videos. Twice now Shell has lined up superstars including Jennifer Hudson, Pixie Lott and Yemi Alade to sing about solar panels, hydrogen cars, clean cooking stoves and lights powered by a bag of rocks and gravity.  In 2016, Shell even flew three of the stars to the Rio Di Janeiro favela of Santa Marta to put on a concert. Shell has said the first video – Best Day of My Life – was watched “more than 800m times”. The second video, On Top of the World, was as sickly sweet as the first and has racked up 19m views on YouTube since it was released in December 2017. Why pick Santa Marta? As Shell itself explained, it is “one of Rio’s most headline-grabbing favelas” and it’s where they chose to help a winner of one of their entrepreneur awards put up some solar panels.  If you watch the pop videos, or hang around Shell’s YouTube channel, or see much of their marketing material, or visit their very flashy tumblr site, you’ll see very little of what Shell spends most of its time and money actually doing – drilling for lots and lots of oil and gas.  How sceptical should the millions of millennials in Shell’s marketing blitz – the Jennifer Hudsons and Pixie Lotts and their millions of Twitter and Instagram followers, for example – be of Shell’s contribution to the climate challenge?  So happy I got to be a part of On Top Of The World with @Shell and 4 talented artists. Together we can #makethefuture! Have you see the full video yet? https://t.co/fEPjVdZbCT #Sponsored pic.twitter.com/DYtOzciSGC In its annual reports and brochures for investors, Shell’s forewords and introduction will always note the challenge of bringing down greenhouse gas emissions and how the future energy mix will need to change. Shell says it supports the global Paris climate agreement. But Shell’s central role in this challenge is what? Give the world more oil and gas. The marketing efforts of Shell are not new, and neither is the cynicism towards them. In 2009, the Guardian’s George Monbiot took the company to task for its advertisements and marketing messaging that had already fallen foul of advertising regulators in the UK.  In his 2012 book Greenwash (which I was paid to help fact-check), author Guy Pearse said “the award for most prolific oil industry greenwasher goes to Royal Dutch Shell” for years of campaigns just like #makethefuture.      Shell chairman Chad Holliday even went as far as evoking the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi in the company’s approach to the climate issue. “As Mahatma Gandhi is often quoted as saying, ‘The future depends on what you do today’,” wrote Holliday before outlining a new target the company had set to cut its own emissions by half by 2050. This target includes the emissions from burning all the extra oil and gas they are enthusiastically pulling out of the ground and beneath the sea bed in locations across the world. Shell says it was producing 3.7m barrels of oil every day in 2017 which, using the US EPA’s calculations as a guide, generates about 47 Mt of CO2e every month.  So what is Shell’s actual contribution to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and releasing methane that is helping drive dangerous climate change? I checked their annual sustainability reports going back to 2011 – around the time when Shell was planning its mercilessly mocked “Let’s Go” marketing campaign.  Shell’s direct emissions – those it has targeted for cuts – have hovered in the mid-70Mt mark since 2011.  In total, if you think it’s fair to include in its footprint the extra energy Shell buys to get its products to market, and then the burning of all their oil and gas by consumers, Shell’s contribution in 2017 was 664 Mt CO2e (for context, looking at figures gathered by the World Resources Institute, there are only 11 countries in the world with a footprint bigger than that). In 2011, Shell’s footprint was 570Mt. Shell has been making much of its “New Energies” venture that look at hydrogen power, wind, biofuels and carbon capture and storage. New Energies is part of the company’s “Integrated Gas” business – the same part of the company that explores for gas, extracts it, processes it and then gets it to customers.  Shell doesn’t report separately the capital spending or revenue for “New Energies” but has said publicly it plans to invest between $1bn and $2bn a year on the division.  What does that look like, in the context of capital spending across the rest of the company? In 2017, Shell made a $15.8bn profit and its annual report shows that they made capital investments of $23bn.  Shell is in the process of divesting its interests to cut debt – a divestment the company says will be $5bn a year for the rest of the decade. In Shell’s latest annual report, Holliday wrote that “oil and gas will remain central to our business for many years” and how more investment was needed to develop oil and gas reserves.  In 2017 in Canada, Shell divested out of probably the most polluting of all fossil fuel enterprises – getting oil out of tar sands in Alberta. But why did they do that? Was this a pique of conscience over the legacy those activities will leave on the environment and the climate? No.  According to Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden, the divestment was “prioritising businesses where we have global scale and a competitive advantage such as Integrated Gas and deep water.” Holliday says “the greatest contribution Shell can make to providing more and cleaner energy is to deliver more natural gas” and that, as communities “seek cleaner alternatives to coal” gas will be more important than ever.  But as some analysts note, investing in new gas infrastructure risks locking in decades more of dependency on fossil fuels that is incompatible with the Paris goal to keep temperatures “well below 2C”. Shell is currently lined up with other fossil fuel giants in a court case in the United States – accused by some Californian cities of being responsible for knowingly warming the climate and pushing up sea levels. A recent trove of Shell documents unearthed by Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers shows the company has been aware of the potential impact of the burning of its products since at least 1988.  Looking at the documents, it looks like Shell’s interpretation of the science around climate change and impacts of its products has drifted – both internally and what the energy giant was prepared to say about it in public. But back to #makeithappen and Shell’s other “challenge” – its need to keep young people on side.  In advertising and marketing industry publication Campaign, Shell’s “head of integrated brand communications”, Malena Cutuli, spelled it out.  “It’s no secret that Shell’s own macro challenge is particularly tough, so amidst deep cynicism and complexity, we needed to develop a disruptive approach to engage young people in our new energies mission,” she said.  Featured in the pop videos and tumblr sites is an initiative to give people in developing countries more clean-burning cookstoves to avoid them dying from breathing in polluted indoor air. This is a huge issue and one that the World Health Organization says kills more than four million people a year. What is Shell’s actual contribution to clean cookstoves in developing countries that gives them the licence to brag about it in slick advertisements? According to the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves directory, Shell’s contribution to their work has been $12m in donations and time spent with the initiative. That’s not a small amount, but for a company the size of Shell it is about 0.07% of its 2017 profits. Shell also took a food truck around New York and made young people jump on pads that converted their energy to electricity in return for, presumably, some food. “What better way to get people engaged in the global energy challenge than by tapping into a universal passion – food,” said Cutuli. Actually, I can think of another way. Several actually.  One might be to avoid being the gullible millennial who takes directions on the future of energy from one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies.  Another might be to “get engaged in the global energy challenge” by understanding that for all Shell’s earnestness about combatting climate change, its carbon footprint is bigger than most countries. Let’s #makethefuture."

"A few days before Christmas last year, Harry Brower, mayor of Alaska’s North Slope Borough, was at home when he heard a stunning noise – the sound of waves lapping at the shore. The sound was as wrenching and misplaced as hearing hailstones thud into the Sahara. Until fairly recently, the Arctic ocean regularly froze up hard up against the far north coast of Alaska by October. In 2017, it wasn’t until the final few days of the year that the ice encased the waves. The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s. “We’ve had a few warmer days in the past but there was nothing like the past winter,” said Anne Jensen, an anthropologist who has worked in Utqiaġvik, the US’s most northerly town, for the past three decades. It was so warm that the snow melted on Jensen’s roof, causing it to leak. “This year’s winter stuck out, insanely. It was crazy. Even the younger people noticed that this is something that hasn’t happened before.” A certain stoicism is required to live in the North Slope Borough, an area of sprawling tundra larger than 39 of the 50 US states that takes in Alaska’s northern coast. The native Iñupiat population have carved out a life here in the brutal cold of the Arctic Circle for at least 4,000 years, subsisting on bowhead whales, seals and caribou.  Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, is the largest of the region’s scattered settlements and remains a flinty and unforgiving frontier town despite the arrival of the internet, buzzy snowmobiles and exotic vegetables (a pineapple costs around $9.50 (£6.70) at the main grocery store). But the past winter, following a string of warm years, points to a pace of change not before experienced by this community. The winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, with sea ice extent hitting record lows in January and February, ending up at the second-smallest seasonal peak in the 39-year satellite record in March. The smallest was in 2017. The Bering Sea, which separates Alaska and Russia, lost a third of its winter ice in just eight February days.  Otherworldly temperatures were felt across the region, with the weather station closest to the North Pole spending more than 60 hours above freezing in February, around 25C (45F) warmer than normal, which is equivalent to Washington DC spending a February day at 35C (95F) or Miami baking at 51C (124F). The Arctic was, in spells, warmer than much of Europe. Utqiaġvik, pronounced oot-ki-ahh-vik or “place where snowy owls are hunted”, got to -1C, around 22C warmer than normal. In December, the temperature readings from the weather station at Utqiaġvik were so freakish that it triggered an automatic shutdown of the system to protect the data from “artificial” figures. It temporarily wiped a year’s worth of numbers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called the incident an “ironic exclamation point” to the climate change gripping the Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average. This winter’s extreme warmth was, in part, driven by an unusual number of storms in the Atlantic that brought balmier air to the Arctic. But scientists warned that 2017 and 2018 should not be dismissed as mere outliers.  “There’s no reason why this sort of warmth won’t continue. Within the lifetime of middle-aged adults, the Arctic has completely changed,” said Rick Thoman, a Noaa climate scientist based in Fairbanks, Alaska. “The magnitude of change is utterly unprecedented. For a lot of the people who live there, it’s completely shocking.” The changes are potentially existential on the north slope, where sea ice provides a crucial platform for catching and hauling in whales – a key food source and cultural totem for the Iñupiat. The spring whale hunt, where emerging cracks, or “leads”, in the sea ice funnel whales into the path of waiting hunting crews, requires dependable environmental cycles that have served the Iñupiat for thousands of years.  “All the indications are there will be a very early loss of ice this year,” Thoman said. “In the 1990s they could do whale hunting in Utqiaġvik up until May or even June. There’s no real chance of that now – the ice will probably start breaking up by early May. “Native peoples of Alaska are very resilient; they’ve lived here for many millennia for a reason. Some will have to move, hunting will have to change. It can be done but it won’t be easy, it won’t be cheap. There will be a big cost, both financially and culturally.” Utqiaġvik is wrestling with a number of climate impacts. Its coastline, increasingly shorn of sea ice, is eroding at a concerning rate. The melting of permafrost, long-frozen soils that scientists forecast could end up releasing huge amounts of carbon, is causing some buildings to slump, their walls radiating with cracks. But it’s the potential threat to the whale quota that causes most angst. Slain whales need to be quickly pulled up on to the sea ice and butchered before the cetaceans’ cooling systems halt and they essentially cook from within. Lack of thick, multi-year ice could hinder the haul-out. Caught whales could even fall through the ice if it’s too thin. “A couple of years ago the ice was rubble, it was just breaking up,” said Nagruk Harcharek, who has spent many of his 33 years whaling near Utqiaġvik. “It was really late this year and everyone noticed. I’d be lying if I said people aren’t worried. “Some families rely upon whales for their food. It’s so central to our culture. The spring hunt is spiritual – sitting out there on the ice edge is pretty quiet. There’s the unknown. There’s not much going on. You’re watching, waiting.” Other heritage is already being lost, with archaeological sites along the coast being washed away at a quickening rate. In September, a major storm crunched into the coast and threatened Birnirk, a village that was inhabited for 1,000 years and is a national historic landmark.  “It’s very, very grim,” said Jensen, who has worked to excavate and protect several sites. “Most of the coastal sites will be gone in the next 10 to 15 years if the rate of erosion keeps up.” Across Alaska, dozens of coastal towns are at risk of becoming uninhabitable, with a handful actively seeking to relocate. Melting permafrost is buckling roads into potentially deadly big dipper rollercoasters, as well as threatening to dislodge doses of locked-up mercury. Glaciers near Denali, the tallest mountain in the US, are disappearing faster than at any time in the past 400 years. The Alaskan government recently warned this bewildering rate of change risks the physical and mental health of its citizens, citing a condition called solastalgia, the distress caused by severe disruption to the environment near home.  “Alaska is on the frontlines of climate change,” Bill Walker, the state’s governor, warned last year. Walker, an independent, has convened a panel to come up with some sort of climate change strategy by September.  Somehow, it will have to suggest a way forward that doesn’t rattle its economically important oil and gas industry, which has received staunch support from a Trump administration that has started to dismantle help for those pummeled by rising seas and storms. For a reliably Republican state, polling shows unusual numbers of Alaskans are concerned about climate change and, at least sometimes, openly fret over its consequences. “People are feeling the impacts of climate change, we hear that on a daily basis,” said Nikoosh Carlo, the governor’s climate adviser. “It’s a non-partisan issue here. For some communities, the next storm could wipe out critical infrastructure.” The lack of any federal or state plan to deal with the looming climate crisis isn’t causing mass panic in Utqiaġvik, at least. “We are capable of adapting to any changes,” said Charlie Hopson, a veteran Utqiaġvik whaler. “We’ve been around for thousands of years and we’re going to keep living. We do our own thing here. The government doesn’t know shit. We don’t need them.”"

"They might seem solid, but rocks gradually erode. Wind, rain, ice and snow all contribute to weathering; nibbling away at mountains, sea cliffs, limestone pavements and even solid granite tors.  Freshly exposed rock surfaces react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to make bicarbonate ions, which flow down to the ocean (hitching a ride on rivulets of rainwater) and are used by ocean critters to make limestone. This natural process helps to keep the Earth cool by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it up in rocks underground for a few million years.  So could we speed up this cooling process by smashing up more rocks? German scientists have been investigating the cooling potential of two types of rock: dunite and basalt. Their results, published in Environmental Research Letters, show that, if done on a large scale (comparable with today’s coal industry), crushed basalt could mop up nearly 10% of mankind’s carbon dioxide emissions every year, while dunite could absorb double that. Basalt could also have the co-benefit of adding nutrients to soil in tropical regions.  Pricewise, the technique would cost about 10 times as much as afforestation and about two to four times as much as carbon capture and storage.  "
"Scientists have long known that the amount of ice in the Antarctic is steadily decreasing. They were surprised, however, to discover recently that up to a quarter of the melting occurs in the depth of winter, when the average temperature is 15C below freezing. The melting is caused by a phenomenon called the föhn effect. The föhn or foehn wind was first noted in the Alps, and occurs when a wind blowing over mountains descends on the far side. The increase in pressure at lower altitude causes the mass of air to warm up by about one degree per hundred metres. Such a wind blowing down from a high mountain range can easily rise above freezing. The Chinook wind in the Rocky Mountains is sometimes called “snow eater” for its capacity to strip snow from the slopes.  The winter Antarctic ice melt was discovered by a team led by Peter Kuipers Munneke of Utrecht University, using data from satellites and unmanned weather stations. It was presented to the European Geosciences Union in Vienna in April. The Antarctic has the highest elevation of any continent, and consequently fierce föhn winds. The new results show that these hot winds are making a significant contribution to ice melt.          "

"TIME magazine announced last week that Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt is among their 100 most influential people of 2018. George W. Bush’s former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman delivered the scathing explanation: If his actions continue in the same direction, during Pruitt’s term at the EPA the environment will be threatened instead of protected, and human health endangered instead of preserved, all with no long-term benefit to the economy.  As a perfect example of those actions, the Daily Caller recently reported that at a gathering at the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Institute, Pruitt announced that the EPA and federal government will soon end two important science-based practices in evaluating the costs and benefits of regulations. When the EPA regulates pollutants, the practice often yields what are called “co-benefits.” For example, limiting allowable mercury pollution can force dirty coal power plants to install pollution-control equipment or shut down. Since coal plants produce other pollutants like soot, the regulations not only reduce mercury levels, but also particulate matter in the air. The latter isn’t an intended consequence of the regulations, but creating cleaner air and healthier Americans are unintended “co-benefits” of limiting another pollutant. In doing cost-benefit analyses, the EPA accounts for all direct benefits and indirect co-benefits of its regulations. Certain industry groups and conservative pundits don’t like that approach, because they care more about polluter profits than they do about clean air and healthy Americans. However, during the George W. Bush administration in 2003, the Office of Management and Budget issued a guidance saying that it’s important to consider co-benefits: Your analysis should look beyond the direct benefits and direct costs of your rulemaking and consider any important ancillary benefits and countervailing risks. An ancillary benefit is a favorable impact of the rule that is typically unrelated or secondary to the statutory purpose of the rulemaking (e.g., reduced refinery emissions due to more stringent fuel economy standards for light trucks)… Pruitt wants to disregard this Bush-era guidance and instead consider only the costs and benefits of regulating the “targeted pollutant” (mercury, in our example). They want to ignore the lives saved by also incidentally reducing particulate matter pollution. To be blunt, this makes no sense, unless your goal is to protect polluters at the expense of public and environmental health. As a backup argument, industry groups argue that the EPA overestimates these co-benefits because particulate matter (specifically, PM2.5) isn’t harmful to human health below a certain threshold value. Not coincidentally, Pruitt’s EPA hired a scientist who has argued that American air is “a little too clean for optimum health.” However, EPA looked at the associated science and issued a memo in 2012 concluding, Studies demonstrate an association between premature mortality and fine particle pollution at the lowest levels measured in the relevant studies, levels that are significantly below the [National Ambient Air Quality Standards] for fine particles. These studies have not observed a level at which premature mortality effects do not occur. The best scientific evidence, confirmed by independent, Congressionally-mandated expert panels, is that there is no threshold level of fine particle pollution below which health risk reductions are not achieved by reduced exposure. The bottom line is that when considering all effects, the benefits of EPA pollutant regulations often far outweigh their costs. However, the American public sees the benefits in the form of cleaner air and water, better health, and avoided premature deaths, while industries bear the costs of complying with the regulations by reducing their pollution. Hence industry groups and their allies in the Pruitt EPA are trying to cook the books to favor profits over public health. It’s worth reflecting on the disparity between the president’s claims that EPA’s goal is to achieve “record clean Air & Water” and its apparent actual goal of maximizing polluter industry profits. While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job! At the Heritage Institute gathering, Pruitt also promised that the Trump administration will stop using the ‘social cost of carbon’ – an estimate of how much carbon pollution costs society via added climate damages – in crafting regulations. The Obama administration first started using the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analyses of various government regulations. For example, when the Department of Energy considers stricter energy efficiency standards for appliances, it will account for the benefits of slowing climate change by reducing electricity consumption. Industry groups challenged that policy in court, but the Obama administration won. Under Trump and Pruitt, the EPA has started engaging in bogus accounting to deflate the estimated social cost of carbon, and now Pruitt has promised they’ll stop using it altogether. It’s simply another way for the EPA to put industry profits above public health benefits. Pruitt hasn’t yet made good on these promises to the polluting industries, but if he does, environmental groups are confident they can beat him in court. David Doniger, senior strategic director of the National Resource Defense Council’s climate & clean energy program told me: If Pruitt finalizes the Clean Power Plan repeal or any other rule by revising consideration of co-benefits in this way, or dropping them entirely, you can be 100% sure that we and others will sue, probably in D.C. Circuit challenges to his actions. We are confident the courts will hold this reversal of practice arbitrary and capricious. The only sound way to assess the benefits of a rule, and to weigh them against costs when that is allowed, is to assess all the benefits that can be reasonably expected to come from the action.  It’s worth remembering that “The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.” The mission of the Pruitt EPA seems to be maximizing polluting industry profits at the expense of human health and the environment.  It’s also important not to let Pruitt’s rank corruption and scandals distract from the damage he’s doing to EPA’s mission. As Christine Todd Whitman noted, the whole world is worse for Trump having nominated and the Senate GOP having confirmed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA into a new era of maximizing industry profits and pollution at the expense of public and environmental health."

"The novel “supermaterial” graphene could hold the key to making one of the oldest building materials greener, new scientific research suggests. Graphene has been incorporated into traditional concrete production by scientists at the University of Exeter, developing a composite material which is more than twice as strong and four times more water-resistant than existing concretes.  Unlike previous attempts to use nanotechnology in concrete, which have focused on modifying the existing components of cement, the new technique allows a layer of graphene to be suspended in water.  The method produces a high yield of concrete without defects, which can be used in conjunction with modern manufacturing techniques and could be scaled up, the researchers believe, at a relatively low cost. The composite could be used directly on building sites, enabling the construction of strong and durable buildings using less concrete and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using graphene meant the researchers were able to roughly halve the amount of materials used to make concrete. Its water resistance makes it suitable for construction in areas that are hard to reach for maintenance, while the strength of the composite will make buildings more resilient to future shocks and strains, researchers say. In addition, the technique could be copied in incorporating other nanomaterials into concrete construction in the future, which could pave the way to further innovations in the industry. Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience at the University of Exeter’s engineering department, said: “Our cities face a growing pressure from global challenges on pollution, sustainable urbanisation and resilience to catastrophic natural events. This new composite material is an absolute game-changer in terms of reinforcing traditional concrete to meet these needs.” Graphene is a form of carbon first reliably produced at the University of Manchester by researchers in 2004, work which led to two Nobel prizes. It is made up of a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Its structure gives it important physical qualities, including efficient conductance of heat and electricity and unusual strength. Concrete has been used as a building material since the Romans, some of whose concrete structures still stand today. It is the commonest building material, along with steel, but greenhouse gas emissions from concrete and cement-making remain stubbornly high, in part because of the energy used in their creation but also because the chemical processes required involve the break-up of limestone and release of carbon dioxide. Cement-making accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, and manufacturers must make sharp reductions if the Paris climate goals are to be met, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project, in a recent study. The University of Exeter research, in a paper entitled Ultrahigh Performance nanoengineered Graphene-Concrete Composites for Multifunctional Applications, is published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, and was funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The samples of the composite tested so far all come up to British and European standards, so getting the composite material into use should be possible. Dimitar Dimov, lead author of the study, said: “Finding greener ways to build is a crucial step forward in reducing carbon emissions around the world. This is a crucial step in the right direction to make a more sustainable construction industry.”"
"Watch out for the return of the sailing ship. After a commitment last month to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050, the race is on to find new technologies that can green the 50,000-strong global shipping fleet. Wind power is one of the options being discussed.  International shipping accounts for more than 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, roughly the same as aircraft. But the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change left control of the shipping industry’s emissions to the International Maritime Organisation. While environment groups applauded the agreement to cut hard and deep by 2050, they pointed out that it falls far short what is technically achievable. A report published just before the meeting by the International Transport Forum (ITF), a thinktank run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), found that the industry could achieve up to 95% decarbonisation as early as 2035 using “maximum deployment of currently known technologies.” Low-tech solutions The good news is that easy-to-do low-tech solutions can deliver a lot. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping line, has already discovered it can cut fuel use 30% simply by steaming more slowly. Because of the wide availability of cheap (and often dirty) fuel, shipping has traditionally been wasteful. Most merchant ships are made of heavy steel rather than lighter aluminium, and don’t bother with obvious energy-saving measures like low-friction hull coatings or recovering waste heat. More slender ship designs alone could cut fuel use — and hence emissions — by 10-15% at slow speeds and up to 25% at high speeds, says the ITF. But replacing the existing fleet would take time. The average age of today’s shipping fleet is 25 years. Rules of energy efficiency for new ships introduced by the IMO in 2013 will only fully come into force from 2030, meaning that any switch to slender ships would not apply to most ships at sea until mid-century or beyond. But much could be done more quickly by retrofitting existing ships with technology to cut their fuel use and hence emissions, according to the ITF. Here are just four: Fitting ships’ bows with a bulbous extension below the water line reduces drag enough to cut emissions 2-7%; A technique known as air lubrication, which pumps compressed air below the hull to create a carpet of bubbles, also reduces drag and can cut emissions by a further 3%; Replacing one propeller with two rotating in opposite directions recovers slipstream energy and can make efficiency gains of 8-15%, Cleaning the hull and painting it with a low-friction coating can deliver gains of up to 5%. Entirely new ships Putting together better designs and better fuel will create entirely new kinds of ships in future. And the blueprints are already being drawn up. The Aquarius Ecoship, a cargo ship devised by a Japanese company called Eco Marine Power, is driven by a phalanx of rigid sails and solar panels. The same system could power oil tankers, cruise ships and much else. It would not, the designers admit, entirely eliminate the need for conventional fuel: Even with large batteries to store the solar and wind energy, back-up would be needed. But it could cut emissions by 40 percent. Going one better, the Japanese shipping line NYK boasts that its design for a 350m-long container ship, the Super Eco Ship 2030, would use LNG to make hydrogen to run fuel cells. Backed up by solar panels covering the entire ship and 4,000 square metres of sails to catch the wind, the combination could cut emissions by 70%. Or for a completely zero-carbon option, engineers at Wallenius Wilhelmsen, a Scandinavian shipping line, offer the E/S Orcelle, a lightweight cargo ship designed to transport up to 10,000 cars (electric, we trust) on eight decks. It would be powered by electricity, half coming directly from wind, solar and wave energy, and the other half from converting some of that energy into hydrogen to power fuel cells. The company says the ship could be afloat by 2025. Today’s ships are in many respects almost indistinguishable from those of a century ago. But the IMO decision to finally get with the global climate agenda has fired the starting gun on what is set to be a race to create a new standard for low-carbon shipping that should be the norm just a few decades from now. Banishing conventional fuel Some of the biggest gains will require banishing conventional petroleum-based fuel, says the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, a progressive industry ginger group whose members include cruise lines and commodities shipping lines. Innovations ranging from biofuels to liquefied natural gas (LNG), nuclear reactors to sails to catch the wind, and hydrogen to solar panels have been proposed. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, and nobody is putting all their money on one solution. Biofuels are problematic because they take land to grow, though specially engineered crops such as algae could change that, says the ITF. While electric engines already operate on some short ferry journeys, the sheer weight and space taken up by batteries on oceangoing ships make them unviable until there are breakthroughs in lithium-ion batteries. Solar power can only augment other power sources. One innovation already underway is converting ships to run on LNG. There are already more than a hundred LNG-fuelled ships globally. A new generation of giant cruise ships powered this way and carrying up to 7,000 passengers will be launched by MSC Cruises starting in 2022. Some LNG ships claim a reduction in CO2 emissions of 15%, though that depends crucially on keeping leakage of the greenhouse gas methane to a minimum in ships and bunkers. The first LNG-powered cruise ship is the Viking Grace, operating between Finland and Sweden. This vessel has another claim to fame. As of this April it also boasts the first ship-based “rotor sail” to capture power from the wind. Rotor sails have a large spinning cylinder amidships. Wind hitting the rotor creates a vertical force that can be used to power the ship, a phenomenon known as the Magnus effect. The Viking Line says the extra power will reduce the ship’s CO2 emissions by 900 metric tonnes (1,000 tons) per year. "

"An academic paper on global climate zones written by three Australians more than a decade ago has been named the most cited source on Wikipedia, having being referenced more than 2.8m times. But the authors of the paper, who are still good friends, had no idea about the wider impact of their work until recently.  The paper, published in 2007 in the journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, used contemporary data to update a widely used model for classifying the world’s climates. Known as the Köppen Climate Classification System, the model was first published by climatologist Wladimir Köppen in 1884, but it had not been comprehensively updated for decades. The lead author of the paper is Dr Murray Peel, a senior lecturer in the department of infrastructure engineering at the University of Melbourne, and he co-authored the updated climate map with geography professor Brian Finlayson and engineering professor Thomas McMahon, both now retired.  “We are amazed, absolutely amazed at the number of citations,” Finlayson told Guardian Australia from his home in Melbourne. “We are not so much amazed at the fact it’s been cited as we are about the number of people who have cited it. “It’s pleasing that research you’ve done is something other people are finding useful.”  The trio knew their paper had an impact in academic circles and in scientific literature, with the Köppen Climate Classification System used by researchers in a range of fields including geology, sociology, public health and climatology.  But Finlayson said they were unaware of the more widespread success until a journalist from Wired contacted them about the results of an analysis by Wikipedia of the top 10 sources by citation across every Wikipedia language. All 10 were reference books or scientific articles. The updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification boasted 2,830,341 citations, easily surpassing what came in at No 2, a paper published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry that had 21,350 citations. Finlayson said the popularity of the paper emphasised the importance of open science, which is the concept that data and findings should be openly and freely available so that others can use and benefit from them. Wikipedia operates on a similar concept, and credible citations are crucial to the encyclopaedia’s reliability. “The journal we originally published the paper in is free and open access, and we chose the journal for that reason,” he said. “People noticed and said, ‘Hey, we have an updated climate map, we’ll use that’, and then it spread.”  At the time, open access journals were rare. “I have always been a supporter of open science,” Finlayson said. “Research is no good to anyone locked in a cupboard, or published in a journal you have to pay a lot of money to access.” He said he first began working with paper co-author McMahon in 1981, and that they got to know Murray, who is “a fair bit younger,” when he became one of their PhD students.  “He did his PhD on global hydrology and kept working with us in that area over the years, and we are all still very good friends and kept publishing together,” Finlayson, now 73, said. “We agree on most of the serious things and then every now and then we have differences of opinion. So we talk about it, and then we set out to test who is right, and write a paper on the results. “If you want to form an academic group of people who work together well, the fact that they’re friends helps a lot. You’re not concerned about things like someone getting more kudos than you are.”"
"The former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he will write a $4.5m cheque to cover this year’s US commitment to the Paris climate agreement.  Donald Trump last year pulled the US out of the deal, which was signed by Barack Obama, making the US the only country opposed. Even Syria, torn by a seven-year civil war, has signed the pact. Bloomberg, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at about $50bn, was speaking on Earth Day, to CBS’s Face the Nation. He did not commit to provide funds beyond 2018 and said he hoped that by next year Trump would have changed his mind. “America made a commitment and as an American, if the government’s not going to do it, we all have responsibility,” he said. “I’m able to do it. So, yes, I’m going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.” Trump, he said, should be able to “listen to others and change his mind. A person that doesn’t change their mind isn’t very smart. And he’s been known to change his mind. “He should change his mind and say look there really is a problem here. America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.” Asked if he thought the non-binding nature of the Paris deal was a problem, in terms of other countries not sticking to its aims for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the effect of climate change, Bloomberg said: “Look, it’s dangerous to keep doing what we’re doing. “If everybody would do the right thing, yes, it would be better. But if some people or some countries do the right thing we all benefit from that. “All I know is that America, I believe, will meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount, and if we do it hopefully other countries will do it as well.” Asked if he was “filling a leadership gap”, the media baron – who was a Republican mayor and considered a 2016 presidential run as an independent – said: “Well, I think that this is what the American public when you poll them say they want to do.”  The odds on him running for the White House in future, he said, were “not very high”. The Trump administration has also rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations at home. Bloomberg said the man in charge of much of that roll-back, Scott Pruitt, Trump’s scandal-ridden Environmental Protection Agency chief, had “walked away 100%” from doing his job, which “is to protect the environment”. Bloomberg said Pruitt, who has expressed doubt about accepted climate science, was “saying the environment doesn’t need protection” and saying instead he would “try to protect jobs”.  “That’s not his job,” Bloomberg said. “His policies are not good for the world. That to debunk science and walk away from it is just ridiculous. Even if you don’t believe it. If there’s a possibility that it’s right, you have to take prophylactic actions to prevent a disaster.” Firing Pruitt would be up to Trump, Bloomberg said, adding: “If he could get Scott Pruitt to change his policies, then he can keep him.”"

"Sales of electric cars in the UK have risen 11% on last year, putting the country in the premier league of those ditching petrol and diesel engines, though it is still miles behind Norway and China. An analysis of the latest global sales of electric vehicles found that nearly half the vehicles registered in Norway in the first three months of 2018 were electric (48%), compared to just over a third (35%) during the same period in 2017. The vehicles are run almost exclusively off the nation’s hydropower resource, underlining Norway’s claim as the world leader. China’s raw numbers were the most impressive, even if the total market share of e-vehicles was only 2% of new registrations. In the first quarter of 2018, 142,445 electric vehicles – private cars, lorries, trucks and buses – were sold in China, a 154% increase on the previous year. Stefan Bratzel of the Centre of Automotive Management (CAM), which compiled the data, said: “China and Norway are exceptional in e-mobility. The lead market remains China, where substantial industrial policy motives are driving battery-electric vehicle technology forward. “In Norway, where now almost half of new vehicle registrations are e-vehicles, it becomes clear how quickly a change in drive technologies can take place. Generally, e-mobility is also gaining momentum.” In the UK, e-vehicle sales reached 14,084 units in the first quarter of 2018. Plug-in hybrid vehicles accounted for 71% of the sales. The market share of electric vehicles increased from 1.5% a year ago to 2%. The German market is also be gathering momentum, with the share of electric vehicles rising from 1.2% in 2017 to 2%. At the same time, new registrations of diesel vehicles are in freefall. According to the latest data, diesel’s market share is 31.3% – a decline of 25.4% on the year before. Globally, new registrations of e-cars are expected to increase moderately by 2020, and will range between 2.5% and 6% of market share, according to CAM.  By 2025, about 25m newly registered electric cars are expected in the most optimistic scenario, which would equate to a 25% market share; this could potentially rise to a 40% share by 2030."
"After almost three decades of environmental activism, Bill McKibben has become the Earth’s investment broker. “There’s no way at this point to solve [climate change] one person at a time,” McKibben told Guardian Australia. The author and founder of 350.org is at the start of an Australian tour, speaking with councils and unions, banks and superannuation funds – anyone with serious cash to invest – about backing an aggressive shift to renewable power sources. What started as a campaign for ethical investment, a push for divestment from fossil fuels, has now become in part a pitch to capitalists that there is money to be made from backing renewables. “When we started the divestment stuff six years ago, I was operating entirely on moral grounds,” McKibben said. “But it quickly became apparent that it was a much more financially savvy idea than we’d given ourselves credit for. Anyone who five years ago did it made out like bandits.” On Tuesday, McKibben will launch a report by 350.org, the University of Technology, Sydney, and Future Super, showing 7.7% of Australia’s superannuation savings could fund a full transition to renewables by 2030. McKibben said this was not just an activist’s pipe dream. In New York, the city and state pension funds divested from fossil fuels. Dozens of Australian councils have followed suit. “I’ve been interested to watch the fact that financial types are picking up more quickly what’s happening than political types,” he said. “The solar guys haven’t made their money yet, so they can’t [buy political influence]. But if you’re running a pension fund or you’re running a big investment company, you can’t make any more money out of coal. Its day is done. But there’s clearly money to be made from sun and wind, so that’s where they’re headed.” McKibben has wasted no time in Australia, heading to the country’s two most prominent beachheads. In Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export port, he stood in the shadow of piles and piles of black coal, and met local community groups. “There is a one-to-one relationship between those huge mountains of coal behind us and the fact there are countries that are not going to exist by the end of the century,” he told them. “One is directly related to the other one.” At the weekend he visited the Great Barrier Reef. There he saw two versions of a future he warned about almost three decades ago. The first was a “horrifying” vision of, as he titled his first book, the end of nature – a reef at the northern end that had been effectively “cooked”, as leading reef scientist Terry Hughes described it, during the 2016 marine heatwave. “It was a spot with close to 100% coral mortality, and it was depressing, grey monochrome, drab expanse of, well, of dead life,” McKibben said. “A kilometre away we stopped again. It was only about half dead. And it was a reminder of what a remarkable corner of God’s brain the coral reef is. It was filled with colour and vibrant life. “One doesn’t know whether to be happy whether it remains as alive as it is, or sad that so much of it has already been destroyed.”While McKibben was heading to the reef, news broke that the federal government would fund a $500m “rescue package” for the reef. To those who know the science – that the bleaching and death of corals is demonstrably due to climate change – the commitment was laughable. “To simultaneously promote the world’s biggest coalmine while pretending to care about the world’s largest reef is an acrobatic feat only a cynical politician would attempt,” McKibben said. Back on land at Port Douglas, his reaction to seeing the reef was: “We need to accelerate. “The point is all about pace. We need to push everybody to put up renewables at the pace that’s now possible. Elon Musk demonstrated the pace that’s now possible [with the South Australian Tesla battery project]. Everybody should be trying to operate at that pace. “Everyone knows that 70 years from now we’re going to run this planet on sun and wind, the question is whether we’re going to be running a broken planet. The reef is one of the clearest signs of that breakage. It’s a demonstration of the foolishness of what we’re doing. It’s not like this is some obscure mystery.  “It’s important to understand that the reef is not a dead ecosystem. Human beings do not have the right to write it off as an ecosystem, and it remains a miraculous place even if that miracle is now hanging by a thread. It should serve as a reminder for us all that we need to double down on aggressive, aggressive action. “Really the dominant emotion is one of fear that the world won’t rise to the occasion.”"
"As a test location for a project that aims to ensure the livability of Earth, a frozen lake near the northern tip of Alaska could seem rather inauspicious. While the North Meadow Lake near Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic’s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming. Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice – equivalent to the size of Costa Rica – with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com “The ice in the Arctic isn’t going to come back by itself,” said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. “And we don’t have much time left.” Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore’s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006.  “It hit me like a train,” she said. “The importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me. “I looked at it and thought: ‘What if this is a materials problem?’ You go through the list of things that aren’t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it’s a fairly short list. I’ve been through a few options and this one has legs.” For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota.  Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqiaġvik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra – there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer. “Leslie is kind of a one-off,” said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. “I think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that’s realistic and is going to save the world, I don’t know.” Field is attempting to resurrect the reflectivity lost by the Arctic as sea ice has receded due to a warming atmosphere and ocean. Sea ice is being lost at a rate not seen in at least 1,500 years, with Nasa calculating it is disappearing by about 13% a decade.  In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles – the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s.  As sea ice is lost, it locks the Arctic into a downward spiral. Less stark white reflective surface, or albedo, means more dark ocean, which absorbs sunlight rather than repels it, thus speeding up the warming process and spurring further melting. Older multi-year ice, 10ft thick in places, accounted for just 1% of the winter ice pack last year, meaning the sea ice that remains is now largely composed of newer, thinner and less reflective ice. Field claims that her solution could save what’s left. Tiny balls of silica, measuring less than the breadth of a human hair, should reflect 90% of the sun’s heat. This “emergency first aid” is framed as a chance for the world to be afforded more time to slash greenhouse gas emissions.  The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It’s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft.  Field isn’t targeting the whole Arctic region – instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard – but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour. The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn’t certain as yet, despite a “large-scale launch” of ice covering earmarked for 2020. The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s. “It’s not chump change, but compared to other options it’s cost effective,” she said. “It’s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.” Ice911 isn’t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic.  A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze. “Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.” In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won’t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed.  No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option “soft” or “eco” geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough.  There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun’s heat away from Earth; or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to “brighten” them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia’s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin “sun shield” to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching.  A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the “StratoCruiser” – a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard’s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources. These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive. János Pásztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored.  In a speech to Arizona State University, Pásztor singled out Keith’s experiment. “Some time within the next year, we may see the world’s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,” he said. “We urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society’s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.” Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas.  “I think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,” said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. “I don’t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.” Bitz said she was “not very optimistic” about Ice911’s plan as it creates “very small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems”, despite Field’s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. The silica material will average 60 micrometers, which is “well out of the range of danger” caused by particulates that are typically smaller, at 10 micrometers or less, according to Roman Decca, who works on strategy and engineering at Ice911. “You could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,” said Bitz. “The idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it’s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.” Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “Weather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,” she said. “It might all be a bit futile.”"
"In the township of Chamanculo, in Maputo, Mozambique, a network of household taps made the community water pump obsolete years ago, freeing residents from the daily burden of lugging massive jerrycans of water long distances. But a water crisis, partly caused by an ongoing drought affecting much of southern Africa, is already reversing progress in this coastal city. An emergency “orange alert”, declared last February by the country’s disaster management council after failed rains, has triggered such strict water rationing across the capital city that the taps are turned off every other day and irrigation is banned. Unable to afford the private wells, boreholes and extra tanks used by the rich to buffer themselves from the restrictions, Chamanculo’s residents once again find themselves gathering at a single tap. At 9am, a steady stream of mostly women, some with babies strapped to their backs, line up at Pragosa, a Portuguese construction firm, which is providing free water from a private borehole to the community during the emergency for an hour every day. They fill up 25-litre canisters and carefully balance them on their heads, often making repeat trips home and back again. Helena Metela, 20, a mother of a three-month-old boy, Ali, says it is a struggle but she has no choice. “The construction company is a little bit far from my home,” she says. “It takes time. Maybe an hour.” With no end to the current water shortage in sight, the municipality is considering bringing back community pumps to deal with the dwindling supply. Unlike Cape Town, in neighbouring South Africa where the water supply is at breaking point, Maputo has not got to the stage where officials have predicted a “day zero”, when taps are forecast to run dry. But it is clear that without urgent action, Maputo could be the next southern African city to suffer extreme water shortages. Worse still, future projections are for the city to double in size, from 1.7 million people to 3.5million by 2035, sending demand for already scant water resources soaring further. So pressing is the issue that late last month government departments, water utilities, regulators and NGOs gathered in downtown Maputo for a crisis meeting to discuss possible solutions. At the meeting, held jointly by the Mozambique government and WaterAid, official after official warned that the situation was “critical”. Nobody present was in any doubt of the role climate change is playing in the water shortages. Meteorologists who talked to the Observer reported shifting rainfall patterns, high temperatures and more extreme weather events in recent years. Predictions are that in Maputo and other coastal cities increased pressure on fresh water supply is set to increase. Jonathan Farr, a senior policy analyst at Wateraid, said climate change was “eating up the world’s water”, while also making it harder to find a solution. “Things that have worked in the past are no longer enough. Climate change makes everything considerably more serious. Cape Town was something you wouldn’t expect to happen. We are now seeing it potentially in Maputo.” An hour’s drive west from Maputo is the vast Pequenos Libombos dam, which feeds into the Umbeluzi river, the main source of water supply to Greater Maputo. Completed in 1987, the dam has a capacity of 400 million square metres. But in the last two years, the water level has dropped dramatically. Standing on the bridge above the reservoir, Jaime Timba, the dam’s director, points to a series of yellow guages on the dam’s wall, well above the current water level. “The water level is too low for the scale,” Timba said “We need to build a new one.” It is only the second time in a decade that the water level has been so depleted. The last time was in 2016, when it fell to 13%. Some water restrictions were enacted then, but they were not sufficient. Meanwhile, everyone prayed for more rain. In the last four years the Umbeluzi river basin has recorded below average rainfall for the whole basin, while evaporation rates have risen, according to Wateraid. Swathes of land across the region, from South Africa to Zambia, have been hit by high temperatures and low rainfall. Though rainfall in Mozambique has been reasonably good elsewhere, Swaziland in the south-west, whose rivers feed into the Pequenos Libombos dam, has suffered. Jacinto Laureiro, the mayor of Boane, a town in Greater Maputo, said: “We need to change from thinking about the next 10 years or even 20 years, to thinking long term.” The current situation, he said, had developed over time, due to population growth, a lack of investment in infrastructure measures to capture water, and because of climate change. Asked if the situation could deteriorate, he said: “Only God knows.” Antonieta Ruben, 53, a widow, was sceptical that she would see improvements any time soon. “I don’t have hope,” said Ruben, who has two sons at university in Maputo and sells chickens to support her family. “This is a normal crisis. They can have promises of getting water but nothing is done.”"
"Hundreds of thousands of people will be forced from their homes on low-lying islands in the next few decades by sea-level rises and the contamination of fresh drinking water sources, scientists have warned. A study by researchers at the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Deltares Institute in the Netherlands and Hawaii University has found that many small islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans will be uninhabitable for humans by the middle of this century. That is much earlier than previously thought.  Experts say the findings underline the looming climate change driven migration crisis that is predicted to see hundreds of millions of people forced from their homes in the coming years. More than half a million people around the world live on atoll islands, often extraordinary and beautiful structures based on coral reefs. Their closeness to sea level makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change.  The increase in urgency comes because, according to the authors of the report, previous studies had been based only on predicted sea-level rises. Today’s study also examined the impact of wave driven flooding on the availability of fresh water. Saltwater flooding, leading to the contamination of water sources, will see most atolls become uninhabitable sometime between 2030 and 2060, said Curt Storlazzi, USGS geologist and lead author of the new report. “The tipping point when potable groundwater on the majority of atoll islands will be unavailable is projected to be reached no later than the middle of the 21st century.” The primary source of freshwater for populated atoll islands is rain that soaks into the ground and remains there as a layer of fresh groundwater that floats on top of denser saltwater, according to the study. But as atoll islands are regularly swamped by salt water this freshwater will be contaminated making “human habitation difficult in most locations beginning between the 2030s to 2060s, requiring the relocation of island inhabitants or significant financial investments in new infrastructure.” “The overwash events generally result in salty ocean water seeping into the ground and contaminating the freshwater aquifer. Rainfall later in the year is not enough to flush out the saltwater and refresh the island’s water supply before the next year’s storms arrive repeating the overwash event,” explained Stephen Gingerich, USGS hydrologist and co-author of the new report. The authors say although the study was focussed on Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands, the results will apply to people living in atolls around the world – including the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and north-western Hawaiian Islands. But the fate of people living on atolls will be just one part of the much wider climate migration crisis, said Dina Ionesco, head of migration, environment and climate change at the International Organisation for Migration. “Millions of people are going to be at risk from extreme heat, extreme water shortages and flooding as well as sea level rises... we are talking about something that is going to play a huge role in the years ahead in terms of forcing people to leave their homes.”"
"Scientists working to stop rising seawater damaging the fragile ecosystems of the Louisiana coastline have unveiled a massive new weapon: an enormous replica of the lower Mississippi delta. At some 10,800 sq ft, the model is more than twice the size of a regulation basketball court. Housed at Louisiana State University’s center for river studies, the “Lower Mississippi River Physical Model” will help experts work out how best to enact a state plan to fight coastal erosion.  The plan calls for diverting nutrient-rich river water from the Mississippi into marshes and wetlands that in recent years have been inundated with salty water from the Gulf of Mexico. Researchers hope that such infusions will reverse some of the devastation the salt water has caused as it has killed off animal and plant life. Clint Willson, the LSU professor who heads the Center for River Studies, said researchers would be able to study “the flows and the water stages of the water levels in the Mississippi river”.  “We can also model or simulate the transport or the movement of the Mississippi river sand down the river, and we can do all that in roughly one hour to replicate one year on the river.” Seawater encroachment has not just damaged wetlands – in many places it has erased them completely. According to Rudy Simoneaux of the state’s coastal protection and restoration authority, Louisiana is estimated to have lost 2,000 sq miles of coastline since the 1930s. That is an area roughly the size of Delaware. The LSU model cost $4m and is housed a stone’s throw from the actual Mississippi river in Baton Rouge. Among questions that researchers hope it will help to answer are: how will opening one diversion affect the river’s flow? How will diversions affect dredging done by the US army corps of engineers? How will multiple diversions along the river affect each other? “What you do in one place has an impact on another,” said Willson, “and so the idea of looking at larger-scale impacts or larger-scale processes is critical to looking at what the potential impacts are or the unintended consequences of projects, and so a model of this scale allows you to do that.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."
