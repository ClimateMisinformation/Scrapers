"As components of the global cryosphere, mountain glaciers are known for their high sensitivity to climate change. Glaciers are the result of solid precipitation and reflect its variability from one year to the next. The ablation process – by which glaciers lose snow and ice, converting it into water and vapor – depends directly on the energy balance at the surface. Therefore, the processes of accumulation and ablation are the physical link between glaciers and climate, which explains why these ice bodies are such valuable tracers of climate variability on the scale of decades and centuries.  In early 2000, glaciers in the tropics covered a total of approximately 1,900km², with 98% in the Andes between Colombia and Bolivia, predominantly in Peru (70%) and Bolivia (20%). Despite their small global volume – equivalent to less than 0.3mm of sea level rise – these glaciers are important for two reasons. First, they are excellent indicators of climate trends and variability – definitely the best indicator in the tropical zone. Second, they play a significant role in hydrology and water resources such as fresh water, power generation and irrigation. My main contribution since 1991 has consisted in achieving a network of permanently monitored glaciers, through which the evolution of these glaciers is analysed and the future of the water resource modelled. This effort was conducted by the French research institution IRD, and a small team of French researchers within the framework of a straight cooperation with several Andean institutions in each country. Tropical glaciers have experienced a strong decline in recent decades. However, going back several centuries and reconstructing the entire process of glacier shrinkage from the “little ice age” - the last glacial maximum occurred in this part of the Andes between the 17th and 18th centuries – Andean glaciers began to retreat around AD1730-50. However, glacier depletion has increased dramatically in the second half of the 20th century, especially after 1976. We can claim that in recent decades the glacier recession moved at a rate unprecedented for at least the last three centuries – in 30 years, they have lost between 35% and 50% of their area and volume. Small glaciers are the most vulnerable, and are disappearing. The consistency of this signal back from Colombia to Bolivia shows the homogeneity of the change in these low latitude mountains. The atmospheric warming is the factor that can best explain this consistency, up to ~0.7°C since 1950 and more marked since 1976, while the trend in precipitation is much less homogeneous over this area and is affected by a significant decadal variability. Regionally, the tropical Pacific – through the ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) and the PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) modes – controls most of this variability. The significant increase in the frequency and the intensity of warm El Niño events between 1976 and 2007 were partly responsible for the glacier depletion process, combined with global warming. The energy balance at the glacier surface shows that the greatest energy available to melt ice comes from the radiative balance. The increasing atmospheric temperature observed at elevations of 5,000m and more cannot melt ice directly, but change the nature of precipitation. Indeed, due to the rise of the freezing line, the snow-rain limit is moving to a higher elevation. This prevents a long-lasting snow cover with a high reflectivity to form and protect the glacier surface. Consequently exposed to the radiation influx – particularly strong in the tropics at high elevation – glaciers melt at high rates. It is obvious that the glacier retreat has begun to affect water resources – however, the issue is complex. On the one hand, the decrease in ice reserves increases the availability of the resource, but otherwise, reserves diminish when the ice masses are reduced too much. The continued deterioration of glaciers will also have inevitable consequences in the high basins – not only on water resources, but also undoubtedly on ecosystems connected to ice masses.

"Australian scientists have assessed how 35 common fish species are coping with climate change, finding that most have to deal with new conditions and many are moving towards polar waters to find suitable habitats. Research led by the University of Tasmania’s institute for marine and Antarctic studies analysed the climate sensitivity of fish found off the south-east coast of Australia. The region is one of more than a dozen global ocean “hotspots” – others include off Brazil, in the Indian ocean and the North Sea – where the water is warming much faster than the global average for the world’s oceans. The 35 species of fish, ranked for their importance to the commercial fishing industry as well as their ecological significance, had a varied response to increasing sea temperatures and changing levels of nutrients and plankton. Species such as abalone, blue swimmer crab, southern calamari, southern rock lobster and western king prawns will experience a high impact from changing temperatures. Australian salmon will face similarly large changes due to altering winds and currents, while black bream will have to cope with changed freshwater flows. Species were assessed on their distribution, how many eggs they lay and their capacity for movement. Researchers stressed that not all of these changes would be disastrous for fish, but that most of the studied species will have to alter their habits or range of habitat in some way, with many shifting towards cooler waters near the poles to survive. “We found a mixed bag – some positive and some negative,” said Dr Gretta Pecl, lead author of the study. “Some species are shifting south and increasing their range, while others are already at their tolerance for temperature and as it warms, their range will shrink. “In Tasmania, there’s been an increase in snapper and yellow-tailed kingfish, which is great for the fishing industry. But in South Australia, there may be parts of the gulf regions unsuitable for snapper and it may decline there. “Temperature will be the major factor and off the coast of Tasmania the rate of warming is four times the global average. For species that are highly sensitive to temperature, it will affect the rate of growth, the amount of energy it needs and its oxygen consumption. Almost no aspect will be unaffected.” Pecl said fish species were being increasingly sighted outside their traditional ranges, such as coral trout seen in New South Wales, a manta ray off north east Tasmania and whale sharks getting as far south as Perth. International research published in 2013 found that fish species were being pushed towards the poles at a rate of 7kms every year as they chase the climates they can survive in. The global sea surface temperature has increased by around 0.1C per decade since the 1970s. As well as warming waters, marine creatures have to deal with increasing acidification as excess carbon dioxide is absorbed and lowers the pH level of the oceans. The research into how fish will cope with climate change was funded by state and federal government agencies and will be shared with other countries to help them manage their fisheries. US and Canadian authorities have already adapted and applied the data. "
"It’s not possible to listen to petroleum industry executives defending their reckless extraction of oil without feeling that we are living in an age of madness. In a recent private conversation under the Chatham House rule, one of the world’s most senior industry leaders, who is considered to be at the more moderate end of the spectrum, insisted that we are going to burn all the world’s hydrocarbons despite the consequences.  His reasoning is that a growing population in the developing world needs energy to raise living standards, that renewables will not become a dominant energy source till the end of the century and that politicians don’t have the courage or power to limit production. He acknowledged that the burning of all reserves would almost certainly lead to temperature rises of up to 4C, but argued the best way forward is to focus on limiting the damage through such technologies as carbon capture and storage. He’s hardly alone. In a shareholder letter in May, Shell wrote that ­– with energy demand growing – the world would need oil and gas for many decades to come and it doesn’t expect to have any stranded assets, or reserves that can’t be tapped. Meanwhile, in a report in March (pdf), ExxonMobil also expressed confidence that none of its hydrocarbon reserves would be stranded: “We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide.” As the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting opens in Davos, Switzerland, I asked the former US vice president Al Gore and climate economist Lord Stern, two of the world’s most respected climate activists, to make sense of the arguments of those running the fossil fuel industry. The simple fact is that their opinions don’t make any sense, Gore told Guardian Sustainable Business. He remembers being astonished by the argument of one oil executive at Davos, who asked: “what good is it to save the earth if humanity suffers?” Gore, who believes 80% of coal and two thirds of oil must be left untouched if we are to remain within a 2C temperature rise, said: “I had to think long and hard to think what that statement meant. It’s a non sequitur.” He quoted Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a former oil minister in Saudi Arabia, who famously said: “The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, and the Oil Age will end long before the world runs out of oil.”  As we cross the tipping point where distributive energy sources are available at rates below those for carbon based resources, then this transition [away from petroleum] will become unstoppable,” Gore said. “This will take place; the only question is how quickly.  It is wishful thinking on the part of the oil company executive you are quoting that it will all be burnt. It cannot all be burnt. Even if there is no government action, the constraints of mother nature will show it is a non-sustainable pathway.” Lord Stern, who wrote the landmark 2006 Stern review of the economics of climate change, says it is no surprise oil executives are seeking to defend their corner, and quotes socialite Mandy Rice-Davies’ famous response in court to Lord Astor’s denial of any involvement with her: “He would, wouldn’t he?” Like Gore, Stern said basic arithmetic tells us that it is impossible to burn all the world’s hydrocarbons without devastating consequences. The earth has not seen a 3C rise for 3m years, he pointed out, and it has been tens of millions of year since there has been a 4C rise. The consequences, he argued, would be “huge amounts of the world wracked by constant extreme weather”, with some parts of the world turning into desert and others disappearing under water. There are many people in the hydrocarbon industry, in oil and gas and coal, who would like to believe they will be the driving force in energy for the next century,” Stern said. “But what they are proposing would be mad and reckless, so the question will be how fast will the pressures be to do something different.  People are recognizing just how dangerous it is and how fast technologies are changing and what they can do on energy efficiency, on solar and with sustainable cities.” Environmentalist Jonathon Porritt wrote in the Guardian last week that after years of working with oil companies, he is now convinced they will not adapt as a result of being trapped by a short-term mandate that leaves little room for maneuvering, such as shareholder expectations and “the staggering amount of economic value now at risk”. This has been quite a painful journey for me personally,” he concluded. “I so badly wanted to believe that the combination of reason, rigorous science and good people would enable elegant transition strategies to emerge in those companies. But we learn as we go. And go those companies surely will, if not in the near future.” When I asked Gore whether there needs to be more pressure on oil companies to change direction, he said the most effective intervention would be to start putting a financial price on carbon and a political price on denial. “Companies are insisting on their right to use our atmosphere as an open sewer,” he said. “In London a long time ago, a famous doctor connected the dots between sewage and cholera. We are connecting the dots between dirty energy and dirty weather, and in order to drive the kind of constructive change necessary, we need to put a price on carbon.” Gore says public pressure for action is essential, which lies behind his announcement at Davos to launch a second round of Live Earth concerts to promote awareness of climate change. The concerts, which he hopes will make up the largest global campaign in history, will take place across all seven continents – including Antarctica – on 18 June. Gore hopes to collect a billion voices to say “take action now”. This Davos coverage is funded by The B Team. All content is editorially independent except for those labelled “brought to you by”.

"The world can enjoy higher standards of living and more travel, while drastically cutting emissions to avoid dangerous climate change – but only with sweeping changes to our infrastructure, the natural world and agriculture, a new analysis has found. The UK government analysis also assumes that billions of people will remain in dire poverty at mid-century, despite efforts to lift them to greater prosperity, as the population rises to an estimated nine billion people. Dealing with greenhouse gas emissions will require a transformation of electricity generation, including an expansion of renewable energy and nuclear power, as well as more public transport and changes to the built environment, according to the key findings of the Global Calculator, an online software tool developed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), with partners.  The calculator is intended to show the likely outcomes of a variety of choices that policymakers and the public can make to tackle global warming, such as investing in nuclear, insulating houses, making electrical appliances more efficient and using electric vehicles. Some of the findings are likely to be controversial. The analysis suggests that to cope with the food demands of a rising population, much more land will need to be brought under cultivation, which could have harmful side effects on biodiversity, and genetically modified crops may be needed to boost yields.  Far more intensive agriculture will be necessary, with the amount of beef raised in confined systems – vast cattle warehouses in which the animals rarely or never see grass – accounting for as much as 15% of the global herd by mid-century. Consumers must also switch away from eating beef to poultry and vegetables. The analysis also found that deforestation must be halted and the extent of forested land increased by between 5% and 15% by 2050 – a mammoth task, given the failure of efforts so far to halt forest destruction. However, the analysis depends on several key factors. For instance, within the emissions limits required to hold global warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, in theory it ought to be possible for everyone in the world to travel 12,400km a year, up from an average of 8,300km a year at present.  Currently, people in the US travel an average of 16,000km a year, and in the EU about 10,000km, while the average Indian travels 6,000km and Chinese less than 2,000km a year. So the increases in air travel in the developed world seen in recent years, thanks to the proliferation of cheap flights, will have to be severely limited in future to stay within these levels. Similarly, nutrition that fulfils our daily needs, of 2,100 calories a day, is possible for the entire planet, but is unlikely to reach everyone without a transformation in global equity. According to the models used to develop the calculator, billions of people are likely to remain in poverty at mid-century, and they are unlikely to benefit much in the form of the better nutrition, better housing or increases in travel which are theoretically possible. Decc officials were unable to tell the Guardian what the emissions outcomes were likely to be if campaigners succeeded in “making poverty history”. The cost of meeting the 2C scenario was likely to be about 2% to 3% of global GDP annually, on average, between now and 2050, the officials said. Anyone can use the tool to experiment with different possible future scenarios, for instance by seeing how much renewable energy would have to be generated in a future where nuclear energy was avoided, where other emissions cuts would have to come from if people took many more flights than they do today, or how much land could be freed up for forests if more people adhered to a mostly vegetarian diet. Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: “For the first time, this calculator shows that everyone in the world can prosper while limiting global temperature rises to 2C, preventing the most serious impacts of climate change. Yet the calculator is also very clear that we must act now to change how we use and generate energy and how we use our land if we are going to achieve this green growth.” Campaigners welcomed the tool as showing that action on climate change was compatible with prosperous lifestyles for much of the world.  Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “The need for urgent action to avoid dangerous climate change is well accepted, but the steps we should take are often hotly contested. This excellent tool enables everyone to play the role of world leader and make decisions on the action we should take in key areas such as energy, manufacturing and farming.  “It shows we can still avoid the world warming by much less than 2C above pre-industrial levels – all we need is the will to act. This calculator demonstrates to our political leaders that a cleaner, safer, fairer world is possible.” The tool is being offered to other governments, for use in the run-up to crunch negotiations in Paris at the end of this year, at which a new global agreement on emissions, to come into force after 2020, is supposed to be signed."
"Tony Abbott is “living in the 18th century” when it comes to tackling climate change, Labor has said, after the release of a new report warning that Australia’s temperatures could rise substantially in coming decades. Modelling by the national science agency the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology has predicted average temperatures in Australia could rise by more than 5C by 2090.  It warned that the “business-as-usual” approach of burning fossil fuels will contribute to soaring global temperatures. Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, criticised Abbott for focusing on the issue of knighthoods which he said “doesn’t reflect national priorities”. “Instead of indulging his strange personal fascination with the British royals … Tony Abbott would have been much better served spending some time on a serious climate change policy,” Butler said on Tuesday. “But we know Tony Abbott still lives in the 18th century and refuses to join the rest of us to face this challenge.” The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said potential changes in climate will derail plans for Australia’s future. “Australia’s future is grim in the climate sense,” Milne said in Hobart on Tuesday. “All the projections they [the government] want to talk about – about the economic growth, about food and agribusiness – will come crashing down unless we get serious about global warming.” The Climate Institute has urged the government to invest more in decarbonisation and improve environmental resilience. The head of the institute, John Connor, said: “This new data reinforces earlier analysis for Treasury that showed large chunks of the Australian economy will be whacked by global warming.”  “Under scenarios of unchecked or part-checked pollution, sectors like agriculture, health, and ecosystems are hit well beyond their ability to adapt.” “This shows starkly how deep pollution reductions and decarbonisation of the economy is squarely in Australia’s national interest,” Connor said. “This needs to be the guiding principle in the government’s decision this year on Australia’s post-2020 pollution reduction targets.” The Australian Conservation Foundation warned that “some parts of Australia could become uninhabitable”. “These projections show Australia will suffer more extreme heat and drought, having massive implications for agriculture, tourism, water supply and liveability,” Victoria McKenzie-McHarg, the foundation’s climate change program manager, said. “The number of hot days in the country is set to increase substantially.” “It makes you wonder what it will take to get the federal government to take this issue seriously,” McKenzie-McHarg said.  “This year must become the year our government starts to play a constructive role in the global effort to tackle climate change.” A spokesman for Ian Macfarlane, the industry minister, said: “The Australian government is committed to tackling climate change and is delivering strong, effective and practical action through its direct action plan and $2.55 bn emissions reduction fund. “Unlike Labor, the Coalition is tackling climate change without a painful carbon tax that hurts Australian pensioners, families and businesses.”"

"Winters may be getting shorter, but watch out when it does snow: climate change is super-charging storms like the blizzard engulfing the American north-east, scientists said on Monday. The heavier storms of recent years – snowfalls that shut down cities and brought heavy flooding to coastal areas of New England – carried the imprints of climate change, as researchers get better at detecting the fingerprints of global warming, even from snow.  It was too soon to pin the current storm to climate change, but a trend line was emerging, the scientists said. “The snow season is getting shorter,” said Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “But the interesting thing is you can end up with heavier snows in part because of climate change.” In general, climate change produces more extreme precipitation in North America – and if it’s cold enough, that produces snow. “There is a little bit more oomph to these storms when they do develop, the so-called nor’easters in particular,” said  Nor’easters pack their punch from the contrast between cold land temperatures and the warmer Gulf stream and surrounding waters. Five of New York’s biggest snow storms have occurred since 2000, and 2014 was the hottest year in 130 years of temperatures records. Ocean surface temperatures off the US Atlantic coast were unusually warm last year – about 2F above normal over huge expanses of the Atlantic off the east coast. As result, there was about 10% more water vapour in the atmosphere, Trenberth said. Approximately half of that extra moisture was due to climate change, he said. Every a 1F difference in temperature produces about 4% more moisture. “You can easily get as much as 20% more snow out of a storm than you would otherwise, as long as it is cold enough so that all of that moisture gets converted into snow. And that is usually the case in the wintertime,” Trenberth said. Researchers identified a similar interaction inland, known as the lake effect – when cold air meets water that has still not frozen over – well before last November’s white-out in Buffalo. The current storm’s projected accumulations – above 2ft in the New York area and around 3ft in Boston – could rank among the biggest in the 130 years since records began. The so-called Juno blizzard is also bound to create impacts not traditionally associated with blizzards – storm surges and coastal flooding, especially in the Cape Cod area. Sea level rise off the east coast is already expected to be about 8in – or more – by the end of the century. “Flooding is going to be a major issue for the Cape and New England,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, a meteorologist at Climate Central. “The way this storm is just bombing out of there – just the intensity it’s creating off the coast – it is going to add even more water and pull it on to shore,” she said.  “It is everything interconnecting and exploding all at once.” Scientists hesitate to link individual storms to climate change and said repeatedly that this week’s storm was not caused by climate change. But scientists, zeroing in on the causes of individual storms, now believe about 35% of the rain that came down with hurricane Sandy was produced by climate change. On Monday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo reiterated his observations from that storm, citing “a pattern of extreme weather”. Researchers are also beginning to detect the hand of climate change on winter storms. The so-called Snowmageddon of February 2010 also saw unusually high surface temperatures in the Atlantic, with temperatures up to 3F above normal that led to exceptional amounts of moisture being fed into the circulation of the storm and resulted in exceptional snow amounts in the Washington DC area. The landmark United Nations IPCC report on climate change warned that nor’easters like this week’s storm could grow stronger with climate change, because they are driven by the contrast between Arctic air and warming sea surface temperatures. “There is no doubt that a component of that anomalous warmth is due to human-caused climate change. Those warm ocean temperatures also mean that there is more moisture in the air for this storm to feed on and to produce huge snowfalls inland,” Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement. “Climate change is making these sorts of storms more common, much as it is making Sandy-like superstorms and unusually intense hurricanes more common.” Those storms were not created by climate change, Mann said. But, he added: “They were likely made worse by climate change.”"
"World cities are experiencing more heatwaves and fewer cold spells, according to a study of extreme temperatures in hundreds of urban areas over the past 40 years. It found that many cities are seeing fewer extremely windy days than in the 1970s and have more extremely hot individual days and nights.  The climate researchers from US and Indian universities identified 620 of the world’s urban areas with a population over 250,000 and then chose 217 which were situated close to an international weather station with rainfall, wind and temperature records stretching back to 1973.   They found that four of the five years with the most heatwaves had occurred since 2009. They were experienced mostly in Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America.  “The number of extremely hot days increased significantly at most sites [over the 40 years]. However, a few urban areas in East Asia showed significant declining trends. Only 2% of the urban areas experienced significant declines in the frequency of extreme hot days,” said the authors.  “Extremely windy days declined substantially during the last 40 years with significant declines in about 60% in the urban areas,” said the authors, who defined heatwaves as periods of at least six days where the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99% of days since 1973.  The results, published in Environmental Research Letters, also showed a significant decline in six-day or longer cold spells. Around 17% of urban areas were found to have experienced a significant increase in daily rainfall and 10% experienced a significant increase in annual maximum precipitation. “Our results show significant increases in heat waves and the number of hot days and warm nights, and at the same time declines in cold waves and extreme windy days in many urban areas over the last 40 years. We also find that the number of changes in precipitation extremes was modest, which is somewhat surprising as our previous work showed a predominance of increases in precipitation extremes in major US urban areas,” said lead research author Vimal Mishra from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar. “Urban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area; but they are the centre of wealth, so damage to urban infrastructure could result in potentially large economic losses,” he said.

"World leaders have been exploding a lot lately. In December North Korea brought Sony Pictures to its knees over their planned release of The Interview, a film that notoriously ends with Kim Jong-un’s head detonating when hit by a tank shell. Kingsman: The Secret Service concludes in similar fashion, but on this occasion the exploding head belongs not to a brutal dictator but the world’s most famous liberal politician. The scene, which takes place during a lavish montage of expiring dignitaries, acts as a grisly exclamation point at the end of one of the most sustained acts of right-wing film-making since its jingoistic 1980s action heyday. Kingsman is the fifth feature-length effort from producer-turned-director Matthew Vaughn, whose filmography also includes Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class and a 2008 short film used as a party political broadcast for the Conservatives. Adapted from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons’ comic book series The Secret Service – although given its prevailing interests it could have conceivably been based on a couple of old copies of FHM found in the woods – the film follows the talented but unvarnished youth Eggsy (Taron Egerton) as he vies to join the titular covert organisation, while being mentored by the agency’s top spy Harry Hart (Colin Firth).  Despite stealing much of its plot wholesale from Men in Black, Kingsman is a James Bond pastiche in its bones, teeming with quips, easily dispatched henchmen and umbrella-derived weaponry. Most crucial to completing the 007 look is a megalomanic villain, who takes the form here of Samuel L Jackson’s Richmond Valentine. A genius tech entrepreneur with a fondness for McDonald’s and limbless sidekicks, Valentine plans to use malevolent SIM cards to force most of the world’s population to violently kill each other, leaving only a select few to inhabit the Earth. The problem with this, other than it being ridiculous and making absolutely no sense, is his motivation. Rather than pursuing money, power, or any other capitalist goal traditionally desired by supervillains, his monstrous strategy is an attempt to halt global warming.  That last point demands to be repeated: the world-threatening villain of Kingsman is a climate change activist. In the film’s most mortifying attempt at being self-referential, Hart and Valentine have a tense dinner together, with Hart expressing his distaste for modern Bond films, declaring: “Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day.” The depiction of Valentine’s plan as a throwback to a less serious era of spy movies is revealed as a feint, with the ulterior motive of undermining environmentalists: not only is the character amoral and dispassionate, but his methods are buffoonish, the doomed-to-fail scheme of a lisping, squeamish eccentric. Everything about Kingsman exists to disguise the fact that it is solidly conservative – even the theme song is by Take That, presumably recorded as part of some elaborate tax-avoidance scheme. If the film is a throwback, then it’s a throwback in the worst manner: not a carefree romp, but James Bond shooing away a female masseuse with a smack on the bottom, telling her it’s time for “man talk”. It is an unpleasant, carelessly violent cartoon, in thrall to the establishment and utterly contemptuous of women and the working class. The extent of Kingsman’s troubling moral viewpoint is matched only by the determination of reviewers to overlook it. “Just try not to think too much,” suggests Time Out. This curiously disengaged sentiment runs throughout a surprising number of the film’s overwhelmingly positive reviews. Call it the Blurred Lines defence, where the unsavoury message of a work of popular entertainment doesn’t matter so long as it’s catchy. And in filmic terms, Kingsman is catchy: the action is well staged and attractively shot, Firth is an engaging presence as ever, and the whole thing thrums along at a steady clip. Vaughn is an undeniably talented director, but he is also a deeply reactionary one, a fact mostly ignored in light of his enjoyable, seemingly flippant output. Is it meaningful that Kingsman’s genocidal villain is an environmentalist, or that it features a leering, lengthy scene involving the brutal massacre of dozens of innocent people, or another scene in which Taron Egerton’s hero will rescue an imprisoned woman he doesn’t know only if she agrees to kiss him, or that most of the working-class people it depicts are violent layabouts, or that it ends by killing the most notable left-wing political figure in modern history, who is shown earlier to support the antagonist’s plan to decimate the Earth’s population? Yes. These things are very meaningful: just because a film acts as if it doesn’t take itself seriously isn’t an indication that this is the case. Kingsman is the cinematic equivalent of Nigel Farage, hiding its unpalatable political convictions beneath a studied affectation of cheerful irreverence. It may as well be holding a pint, in tweeds, grinning with just its mouth."
"Have you ever watched a zombie movie and wondered if the protagonists will grow physically tired from having to repeatedly kill zombies that inevitably rise once again from the dead? That’s how people often feel when confronted with climate change myths that were debunked years ago. These myths never seem to stay dead, inevitably being revived by climate contrarians no matter how conclusively and repeatedly they’ve been debunked. And so we have writer Matt Ridley once again published in the London Times complaining, “Rather than attack my arguments, my critics like to attack my motives.” That’s undoubtedly because when an individual keeps repeating the same myths over and over again, people eventually grow tired of debunking those myths and naturally question the motives of the individual who keeps making them.  Let’s look at a few examples from Ridley’s latest article. He claims not to be worried about global warming for a few reasons, including, The failure of the atmosphere to warm anywhere near as rapidly as predicted was a big reason: there has been less than half a degree of global warming in four decades - and it has slowed down, not speeded up. This is incorrect – average global surface temperatures have warmed between 0.6 and 0.7°C over the past 40 years (lower atmospheric temperatures have also likely warmed more than 0.5°C, though the record hasn’t yet existed for 40 years). During that time, that temperature rise has temporarily both slowed down (during the 2000s, when there was a preponderance of La Niña events) and sped up (during the 1990s, when there was a preponderance of El Niño events). Climate models accurately predicted the long-term global warming trend. Ridley continues, Sea level has risen but at a very slow rate - about a foot per century. Given that sea level has risen faster than predicted, if you’re arguing against the dangers posed by global warming, sea level is a poor choice. Climate research projects a sea level rise in the ballpark of 1 meter (3 feet) by the year 2100 if we follow the business-as-usual path advocated by folks like Matt Ridley. Also, I soon realised that all the mathematical models predicting rapid warming assume big amplifying feedbacks in the atmosphere, mainly from water vapour Here Ridley is again quite wrong. We know that water vapour (as a greenhouse gas) will amplify global warming because a warmer atmosphere can hold more of it. Observations have confirmed this is exactly what’s happening in the real world. This isn’t an assumption of models – it’s based on scientists’ understanding of basic atmospheric physics. Another thing that gave me pause was that I went back and looked at the history of past predictions of ecological apocalypse from my youth - population explosion, oil exhaustion, elephant extinction, rainforest loss, acid rain, the ozone layer, desertification, nuclear winter, the running out of resources, pandemics, falling sperm counts, cancerous pesticide pollution and so forth. There was a consistent pattern of exaggeration, followed by damp squibs: in not a single case was the problem as bad as had been widely predicted by leading scientists. That does not make every new prediction of apocalypse necessarily wrong, of course, but it should encourage scepticism. At least Ridley admits that this is a poor excuse for dismissing the threats posed by climate change, but it’s a far poorer excuse than he realizes. The reason that the worst possible consequences from acid rain, ozone depletion, pesticide pollution, and so forth weren’t realized is that we took action to mitigate those threats. Specifically, we put a price on the pollutants that caused acid rain and ozone depletion, and regulated pesticide use. Those are precisely the solutions proposed to mitigate global warming. Ridley makes a similar error when discussing IPCC global warming projections, My best guess would be about one degree of warming during this century, which is well within the IPCC’s range of possible outcomes. A further 1°C global warming by 2100 is only a possibility in one of the scenarios considered by IPCC (called RCP2.6 or RCP3-PD, where ‘PD’ stands for a rapid peak and decline of carbon emissions).  It’s the scenario in which there is an immediate and aggressive global effort to cut carbon pollution. Specifically, human global carbon emissions peak in 2020, after which they decline at a rate of around 3.5% per year, reaching zero in 2070 and continuing to fall as we remove carbon pollution from the atmosphere. Matt Ridley opposes immediate aggressive efforts to cut global carbon pollution. It’s disingenuous at best for him to argue that his beliefs about modest global warming are consistent with the IPCC projections whilst advocating against the relevant pathway. It’s like arguing, “My belief that I can lose weight while eating lots of cake and ice cream is well within medical doctors’ range of my possible health outcomes.” There are numerous other errors and zombie myths in Ridley’s piece that I won’t go into. For example, he revives long-debunked myths about the ‘hockey stick’ and ‘Climategate.’ Worst of all is the conclusion to which Ridley’s flawed arguments lead – that we needn’t take serious action to mitigate global warming because he doesn’t believe climate consequences will be serious. One need only read the climate science literature (summarized by the IPCC) to see how dangerous the potential consequences of climate change are if we fail to take serious action to avoid them. Ridley believes future warming will be relatively small and hence the impacts relatively bearable, but it’s just that – his (non-expert) belief. He argues that rather than mitigate the immense risks posed by global warming, the world should share his belief and take the gamble on the best case scenario that climate change doesn’t turn out to be too terrible. This is the part of the story where we’re obligated to recall that Matt Ridley was the non-executive Chairman of Northern Rock, a British bank that in 2007, was the first in over 150 years to experience a run on its deposits. Under Ridley’s chairmanship, the bank pursued a high-risk, reckless business strategy that eventually backfired, and had to be bailed out by British taxpayers to the tune of £27 billion ($41 billion). Ridley apparently didn’t learn from that fiasco, and wants to repeat the same high-risk strategy with the global climate. His reasoning is based on zombie myths, and if he’s wrong again, this time nobody will be able to step in and bail out the Earth’s inhabitants. • The original photograph on this article was changed on 26 January 2015 because readers found it offensive."
"New research published this week reveals that vast stretches of the ocean interior abruptly lost oxygen during the transition out of the last ice age that occurred 17,000–10,000 years ago. This event was the most recent example of large-scale global warming, and was caused primarily by changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun.  Past climate events provide informative case studies for understanding what is currently happening to the modern climate system. For this research, marine sediment core records across the Pacific Ocean were used to reconstruct the subsurface “footprint” of dissolved oxygen loss during abrupt global climate warming.  Like most of the life on the planet, the large majority of marine organisms need oxygen to live. Most marine life, from salmon, crabs, to shellfish, respires oxygen and many forms are intolerant of low oxygen seawater. Low oxygen zones have been incorrectly referred to as “dead zones.” In reality, they are host to bizarre ecosystems of extremophiles: worms, bacteria, and specialized urchins and bivalves colonize these harsh environments.  But, importantly, few commercially significant species of fish or shellfish can live within the low oxygen zones. So, if you are a microbial biologist you might be very excited to find a low oxygen zone, but if you are a commercial fisherperson, that low oxygen zone represents a no-go environment for fishing.  I asked Dr Tessa Hill, associate professor in the Department of Earth of Planetary Sciences at the University of California at Davis, and one of my coauthors on this research, to reflect on motivation behind this project. She said, This study provides an excellent example of utilizing past periods environmental change to understand and predict the consequences of human-induced climate change, and where we may be headed in the future. The new research, which I led, found that entire ocean basins can abruptly lose dissolved oxygen in sync with other global-scale climate change indicators: temperature rise, atmospheric carbon concentration increases, and sea level rise.  From the Subarctic Pacific to the Chilean margin in the Southern Hemisphere, we found evidence of extreme oxygen loss stretching from the shallow upper ocean to about 3,000 meters deep in some regions. The transition from the last ice age to today’s warmer climate substantially reduced the oxygenated habitat of the global ocean and reorganized the distribution of marine life.  Low oxygen zones were not found in the upper ocean in the glacial world; once the deglaciation (ie the shedding of massive glaciers, the rise of global temperatures) was underway, ocean systems dramatically responded. Upper ocean ecosystems, which are those that are connected to the surface ocean and have high concentrations of dissolved oxygen, were compressed towards the ocean surface. Below these oxygenated ecosystems, vast and inhospitable low oxygen zones developed.  Major changes in the distribution of oxygen are already underway in the modern ocean. Modern losses of dissolved oxygen have been detected in every ocean basin by oceanographers and modern instrumentation. I asked Dr Lisa A Levin, Distinguished Professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego for her perspective on climate-influenced oxygen changes. She told me, It is important that oxygen appears on our ‘radar screen’ as we look into the future, for oxygen loss in the ocean exerts critical control on the numbers, types and distributions of fish and shellfish that we harvest. By understanding the coupling in the past between the global climate system and oxygen in the ocean we are better prepared to adapt human activities to future changes in oxygenation. Oceanographers can anticipate that subsurface low oxygen zones have the capacity to rapidly expand to states that the Earth hasn’t seen in 14,000 years. How do we manage and conserve an ocean that is moving towards a physical state that has never been observed in human history?  These are real and critical issues that modern fisheries, conservation and resource management will have to grapple with in the coming decades. The immense risk of ocean oxygen loss in a future of climate change essentially dwarfs the existing modern paradigms of ecosystem-level conservation and management action.  To reframe this information, not as a scientist, but as a citizen, a SCUBA diver and salmon eater: we really have a lot to lose in the face of climate change. We need a living, breathing ocean to sustain us, and to sustain the balance of our ocean’s biodiversity, in the future.  It is my hope that this research can illustrate the risks to our living planet and our food system, which go hand-in-hand with of the need for political solutions to human-caused climate change that are thus far lacking."
"The 2,500 business leaders, academics and policymakers meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week need to look beyond current financial concerns and focus on the effects that war and climate change are having on the fight against poverty, the head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned. Speaking as she prepared to travel to Davos, Helen Clark urged the forum to reflect on the global consequences of climate change, Ebola and the crises in Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Central African Republic.  “They’ll be discussing the new global context of volatility, uncertainty and unpredictability – no doubt with both the Swiss franc issue and the rouble on their minds,” she said. “But they need to look at this whole overview of what is happening with war, conflict and climate: globalisation speeds up the impact of any adverse trend anywhere.” The former New Zealand prime minister, who will also be discussing the best ways to help the Ebola-affected west African countries recover from the epidemic, called on those at Davos – and the wider international community – to show ambition and determination during a crucial year for development. In September, the UN general assembly will meet in New York to adopt the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which will replace the millennium development goals (MDGs). Less than three months later, the UN will hold negotiations in Paris in a bid to reach agreement on cutting carbon emissions. Clark, who was in London to discuss the SDGs at the Overseas Development Institute, acknowledged the scale of the issues but said she was confident of real progress if everyone played their part. “It’s going to require leadership globally, locally and nationally to really pick up the agenda and run with it,” she said. “It’s not just something that public finance can do: it needs investment, it needs trade – and it [means] dealing with the corruption that permits the illicit financial flows that are draining developing countries’ resources.” Perhaps the biggest difference between the MDGs and their mooted successors, said Clark, was the scale of the ambitions underpinning the latter. “The MDGs were in many ways about tackling poverty with official development assistance,” she said. “The SDGs are about the way we live, behave, invest, do business, produce and consume … This isn’t just going to be ODA, it’s going to be growing economies and domestic resource mobilisation and allocation; it’s going to be bankability, which means being credit-worthy and attracting investment and facilitating trade. All of this means better governance, better regulation, an enabling environment, and the rule of law.” Vital to the new agenda, she said, was the presence of SDG 16, which calls for the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, the provision of access to justice for all, and the building of effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. “You don’t eradicate poverty without a number of other things going on,” said Clark. She also said that although the current shape of the SDGs – 17 goals and 169 targets – was unlikely to change dramatically, the UN was still exploring ways to simplify the agenda around six key themes: people, dignity, prosperity, justice, partnership and planet.  “There’s not a great appetite for the member states to open it up again because they feel that a lot of compromise and consensus was built in the open working group,” she said.  “The question is whether this idea of having the six organising or clustering principles will get some traction. In terms of framing the agenda, there’s something quite catchy about that and we need to catch people’s imagination with this because if you just say ‘sustainable development’, eyes glaze. If you say, ‘17 goals’, it takes a genius to recite the 17.” "

"Name: Learjets. Age: 51.  Appearance: Whooshing, expensively, across the clear Swiss skies to Davos. The annual World Economic Forum, dedicated to – among other things – serious discussion of how the 2,500 delegates drawn globally from the highest echelons of politics and business may unite to combat climate change? Yes. Coming by private jet? Yes. How many private jets? An estimated 60% of the heads of state and industry invited will be taking about 1,700 private flights in and out of Zurich and other airports to attend. To attend discussions about climate change, overconsumption, man-made pollution, unsustainable living, that sort of thing? Yes. What’s your point? A private jet burns as much fuel in an hour as a car does in a year. Are you talking about a Learjet, a Cessna Citation, a Dassault Falcon, Gulfstream or a Challenger? I think all of them. That’s good, because they’re all coming in and out of Davos this year. Do you not think that’s a little hypocritical? In what way? Are you being deliberately obtuse? You don’t get to Davos by taking notice of little people’s complaints. No, you get there by fossil fuel-burning private jet. Exactly. Otherwise someone might have missed the VTR Bank’s opening party, with gold-and-neon-light-clad women serving caviar and vodka and performances by Grammy-winning guitarist Al Di Meola and other stars. Or their share of the cocktails being mixed by the 25 expert bartenders flown over there from London’s LiquidChefs. I see. But seriously – how else are important, busy people, who also need privacy and, this year especially, high security, supposed to get there? They can’t hop on a hemp bicycle and pedal there, much as you might like them to. I know. I just think there must be something between a hemp bicycle and Gulfstream/Cessna/Learjet. An eco-bus, driven round Europe picking up all the ministerial attendees in a big loop, powered by their own faeces? Symbolically, in so many ways, that would be excellent. You fall somewhere between a hopeless idealist and a functioning imbecile. Now get into this Falcon. I’ll open her up and show you what this baby can do. Davos, caviar, here we come! Do say: “I read all the briefing notes on the plane. I come refreshed, prepared and perfectly primed to solve every problem on the agenda.” Don’t say: “My own jet might be cheaper than renewing my annual travelcard.”"

"Kentucky senator Rand Paul backpedalled Tuesday on comments he made about vaccines that quickly drew the condemnations of everyone from medical professionals to senior Republican party members to the formerly quarantined healthcare provider best remembered for calling out Paul’s potential rival for the White House. Paul’s attempt at clarification landed as Republicans in Washington, from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to House speaker John Boehner to the dozen or so members of the prospective 2016 presidential field scrambled to describe their views on vaccination.  Following controversial comments by New Jersey governor Chris Christie regarding a measles outbreak spreading across the US, Paul set off another cascade of criticism when he told CNBC on Monday that vaccinations could lead to “profound mental disorders” and that parents “should have some input”. In his follow-up statement, Paul sought to make a distinction between correlation and causation – the kind of science-minded distinction that some of his critics saw him as abandoning. “I did not say vaccines caused disorders, just that they were temporally related – I did not allege causation,” Paul said in a statement. “I support vaccines, I receive them myself and I had all of my children vaccinated. In fact today, I received the booster shot for the vaccines I got when I went to Guatemala last year.” The senator added a tweet for good measure: Ironic: Today I am getting my booster vaccine. Wonder how the liberal media will misreport this? pic.twitter.com/1vSqwfBp5u The explanation attempt came after Paul’s initial remarks were condemned by medical experts and contradicted by top members of Paul’s own party – and not just because the senator “shushed” his interviewer. Boehner dismissed Paul’s comments in a reply to reporters on Tuesday: “I don’t know if we need another law, but I do believe all children ought to be vaccinated,” Boehner said. Kaci Hickox, the nurse who found herself in the middle of a political firestorm last year after she was quarantined upon her return from west Africa despite never contracting Ebola, joined the chorus of critics on Tuesday. “I am very disappointed with Rand Paul’s statements,” Hickox told the Guardian in a phone interview. “I know he’s a physician, but the science is very clear, and I hope that he and other leaders consider the different sides of an issue before making statements about vaccines that are unfounded in science. “I wouldn’t trust anyone in a leadership position who wasn’t following the science,” she added when asked about comments about vaccinations this week from other potential candidates. Governor Christie, whose Ebola policy led to a mandatory 21-day quarantine for Hickox against her will, kicked off the most recent public health tempest during a trip to London by saying that in setting vaccinations policy, the government must strike a “balance” between public health and parental discretion. In an immediate attempt to squash the criticism, a Christie spokesman issued a follow-up statement, saying: “With a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.” Longtime observers of Paul’s political career – and his record on issues from climate change to the handling of Ebola cases – saw the same Paul they have always known: more faithful to libertarian principles than to science. On the vaccines issue, however, Paul may have arrived at a juncture where his political philosophy loses its traction on public policy – and potentially limits his appeal to a broader constituency. “The meta-message that he’s sending is definitely libertarian and directed at this base, which, unlike most politicians, I think he’s consciously trying to expand,” said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. “If he can find a way to say something that his base both subscribes to, and general listeners can say, ‘Yes, well, I agree with that’ – that has the gradual effect of expanding the base. “He does seem to be a skeptic of science in more than one regard.” Paul’s career, from the time he was a practicing ophthalmologist in Kentucky, has always been marked by disruptive political idealism. An objection to the certification policies of the American Board of Ophthalmology led Paul to form his own certification system. He has used his medical background to summon political authority, as when he criticized the Obama administration’s handling of Ebola patients in the United States last fall. Warning that the disease was easier to catch than Aids and suggesting that medical officials were mishandling the outbreak, Paul said of White House officials: “You start to wonder about a basic level of competence.” Ultimately, the Ebola protection measures proved sufficient. But Paul gave voice to the same authority he seeks on other issues, including man-made climate change. Paul describes the science behind man-made climate change as inconclusive. “Somebody tell me what 100 years’ data is in an Earth that is 4.6 billion years old?” he said last spring in a conversation with former presidential adviser David Axelrod. “My guess is that the conclusions you make from that are not conclusive.” Paul has been similarly slow to heed scientific warnings of dangers to his constituents from pollution due to coal-mining practices such as mountaintop removal, said Thom Kay of the pro-environment nonprofit group Appalachian Voices. “He’s really shown no sign that he cares about any of the science that says how bad mountaintop-removal coal mining is for water quality,” Kay said. “It’s the sort of thinking that I think he takes to climate change.” Kay said that Paul had not sought ways to move the costs associated with environmentally harmful mining away from residential communities and back to coal companies. “It’s against his political beliefs to shift those costs back to a company, and because of that, it seems really difficult for him even to admit that carbon dioxide is real pollution, or that dumping coal-mining waste into streams is going to pollute the streams,” Kay said. “The science is really clear on it … But instead of recognizing any of that, he sort of ignores it. More so than denies it.” Cross, of the University of Kentucky, said Paul was generally good at speaking to multiple audiences. “He has this rhetorical trope of phrasing things in a way that it sounds to the people out there on the fringe that he’s agreeing with them,” said Cross. “But if you really parse his statements, he’s leaving himself room for fact-based logical dialogue. When he says something like, ‘there has to be a role for parents’ – well, most people can agree with that.” Measles cases in 14 states have been tied to an initial case inDecember at Disneyland theme park in southern California. Confirmedcases include five Disney employees. The Centers for Disease Controlcounted 102 measles cases total in January, a year after the worstoutbreak of measles since its elimination was documented in the UnitedStates in 2000, with 644 cases recorded in 27 states in 2014. “The stakes are high and this is a disease that we’re seeing,” Hickox told the Guardian. “The current outbreak is over 100, but those numbers will probably continue to grow because of the infectiousness of measles.” Another prominent doctor turned political figure who is expected to seek the Republican nomination in 2016, Ben Carson, also injected himself into the measles debate on Tuesday. “Although I strongly believe in individual rights and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit, I also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society,” Carson said in a statement. At a hearing on the underwhelming flu vaccine before the House energy and commerce subcommittee, one congressman read part of Paul’s interview aloud and asked the four scientists before him what they thought. The senator’s comments were not backed up by science, the witnesses all said."
"Climate change will threaten the viability of grassroots sport in Australia, and elite tournaments will have to adapt to rising temperatures, extreme rainfall and shrinking snow cover, a report has warned. The extreme heat policies of sports such as tennis, Aussie rules and cricket will have to “dramatically improve” to protect the health of competitors at all levels, the Climate Institute analysis concluded.  The report, featuring a foreword from former AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou, warned that while elite sport might be able to adapt to a changing climate, the “ability to respond at local sporting grounds is more questionable”. The Climate Institute compiled the report in the wake of the blistering heat that affected the Australian Open tennis tournament last year. Players and court staff fainted, water bottles melted and a participant even warned someone might die after temperatures hit 43C. The Open has since introduced new protocols that require the match referee to consider suspending play if the ambient temperature reaches 40C. But the Climate Institute warned that the heat policies of other sports were patchy, with a recent AFL match taking place in 38C heat and last year’s Tour Down Under having no heat stipulations, even though cycling races in certain states are normally halted in extremely high temperatures. “Heat policies are a bit confused and ambiguous between state and national levels,” said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute. “The Australian Open got caught short last year and these tournaments need to have proper heat policies given extreme heat is becoming more common. “Sport is very dear to people, it’s core to our way of life and it is worth $13bn a year to the Australian economy. Some sports will be at the limit of their ability to adapt or will have massive costs in order to continue, due to climate change. “Some sports could wither on the vine if we choke off local sports. Professional tennis players can have retractable roofs and be wrapped in cotton wool but we risk the grassroots feed-in of those sports.” According to climate projections published by the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology this week, Australia will warm by up to 5C by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t curbed. The number of days over 35C is set to treble in Melbourne and Hobart and quadruple in Sydney. In Brisbane, there would be 20 times more hot days, while Perth would spend two months a year above 35C and Darwin 10 months a year above that mark. The Climate Institute warned this would have a significant impact on the health of sports participants. And elongated droughts in parts of Australia, coupled with extreme rainfall, will degrade community sporting grounds and even affect large stadiums, such as the Suncorp stadium in Brisbane, which was covered in 1.5m of water during the 2011 Queensland floods. Some of the most dramatic changes could hit those who enjoy winter sports, with the CSIRO report warning of “very substantial decreases in snowfall, increase in melt and thus reduced snow cover”. The Climate Institute cites further research by Griffith University that predicts a 60% reduction in snow cover by 2020, making it increasingly hard for skiers and snowboarders to enjoy the slopes. During the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, more than 100 athletes put their name to a letter from US skier Andy Newell, who warned that climate change must be tackled due the “reality” of deteriorating snow conditions. The Australian Olympic aerial skier Lydia Lassila said: “Given the unpredictable nature of our Aussie winter, many Australian athletes already train predominantly at overseas facilities or resorts. “Although I would like to train on home soil, I haven’t been able to since 2009 due to inconsistency of the conditions.” Connor said: “These impacts increase exponentially the longer we stuff around. Team Australia, if I can borrow that phrase, needs to lift its climate game. If we don’t stop pumping heat-trapping pollutants into the atmosphere, things are going to get worse.”"

"How depressed would you be if you had spent more than 40 years warning of an impending global catastrophe, only to be continually ignored even as you watch the disaster unfolding? So spare a thought for Jørgen Randers, who back in 1972 co-authored the seminal work Limits to Growth (pdf), which highlighted the devastating impacts of exponential economic and population growth on a planet with finite resources.  As politicians and business leaders gather in Davos to look at ways to breathe new life into the global battle to address climate change, they would do well to listen to Randers’ sobering perspective. The professor of climate strategy at the Norwegian Business School has been pretty close to giving up his struggle to wake us up to our unsustainable ways, and in 2004 published a pessimistic update of his 1972 report showing the predictions made at the time are turning out to be largely accurate. What he cannot bear is how politicians of all persuasions have failed to act even as the scientific evidence of climate change mounts up, and as a result he has largely lost faith in the democratic process to handle complex issues. In a newly published paper in the Swedish magazine Extrakt he writes:  It is cost-effective to postpone global climate action. It is profitable to let the world go to hell. I believe that the tyranny of the short term will prevail over the decades to come. As a result, a number of long-term problems will not be solved, even if they could have been, and even as they cause gradually increasing difficulties for all voters. Randers says the reason for inaction is that there will be little observable benefit during the first 20 years of any fiscal sacrifice, even though tougher regulations and taxes will guarantee a better climate for our children and grandchildren. He has personal experience of this, having chaired a commission in Norway that in 2006 came up with a 15-point plan to solve the climate problem if every Norwegian was willing to pay €250 (£191) in extra taxes every year for the next generation or so. If the plan had been given the green light, it would have allowed the country to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds by 2050 and provide a case study other rich countries could learn from. He says:  In my mind, the cost was ridiculously low, equivalent to an increase in income taxes from 36% to 37%, given that this plan would eliminate the most serious threat to the rich world in this century. In spite of this, a vast majority of Norwegians were against this sacrifice. To be frank, most voters preferred to use the money for other causes – like yet another weekend trip to London or Sweden for shopping. When it comes to more regulation or higher taxes, Randers says voters tend to revolt and, as a result, politicians will continue to refuse to take courageous steps for fear of being thrown out of office at the next election. “The capitalist system does not help,” says Randers. “Capitalism is carefully designed to allocate capital to the most profitable projects. And this is exactly what we don’t need today. “We need investments into more expensive wind and solar power, not into cheap coal and gas. The capitalistic market won’t do this on its own. It needs different frame conditions – alternative prices or new regulation.” An obvious solution is putting a price on carbon so that companies are forced to internalise the external costs of CO2 emissions, but despite many progressive companies calling for such a tax, Randers says voters will be loath to pay more. Optimists who believe this stalemate will end once it becomes profitable to solve the climate problem have a very long time to wait, according to Randers. “It will always cost more to produce clean power from coal, than to produce dirty coal power as we do today,” he says. “It will always cost to collect the CO2 emitted from the burning of coal. And global society will be burning coal for a very long time unless something drastic is done.  In the face of such intractable opposition, what can we do? Randers says the first step is to communicate effectively to citizens that short-termism represents a real threat to the sustainability of democratic society. Second, we should argue for the use of low discount rates in public cost-benefit analyses and encourage the use of common sense rather than quantitative analyses when deciding whether to make long-term investments. One way would be to set aside a fraction of society’s investment flow for long-term purposes, in similar fashion to the military budget. Another sensible change, he argues, would be to lengthen the election period in order to give politicians time to implement unpopular measures before they lose the next election, and to guarantee all workers receive an adequate salary after their “dirty” jobs have been closed down until they get new “clean” jobs. Randers says:  These five solutions have all been proposed, and sadly rejected by a democratic majority, as has the most obvious sixth solution, which is to reinstall enlightened dictatorship for a time limited period in critical policy areas, like the Romans did when the city was challenged and which is the solution currently pursued by the Chinese Communist party, with obvious success in the poverty/energy/climate area. But I agree that the obvious solution of strong government appears unrealistic in the democratic west. Given that Randers believes these proposals will fail, what does he suggest? Rather than being idealistic, he says we need to promote policies that offer long-term solutions and short-term benefits. He gives the example of the Tesla electric car, which offers superior short-term advantages that compensate for the high price. He also highlights the introduction of huge subsidies in Germany for those who were willing to install solar panels on their rooftops or windmills in their fields, although Randers points to the system ending after many years because voters did not like the extra tax. For many decades, Randers has refused to sweeten the bitter pill of climate change and is not going to start now. Some dismiss his pessimism as belonging to the past and argue we are transitioning to a new era of global climate action. But they would be wrong to ignore the warnings of an elder who has borne his scars with honour and dignity, and who continues to devote his energy to solving the greatest challenges facing humanity.

"As farmers age around the globe – I estimate that the average age is 55 – we need to make sure that young people see the food system as a viable career option. These farmers are the future of food. They can help to mitigate and potentially reverse climate change, curb unemployment and provide more nutrient-dense crops to the world. Unfortunately, farming is usually seen as a last-resort profession. Rural youth migrate to cities in search of employment, and lack of infrastructure and education leads to poverty and malnutrition. But investing in young agricultural leaders has the power to transform the entire food system. Government leaders, businesses, and farmers groups need to make agriculture something youth want to do, not something they feel forced to do.  Climate change presents complex challenges for farmers of all ages, but youth are eager to use technology to access community-driven networks that harness knowledge to help. The Agroecological Intensification Exchange, for example, connects online users to innovations all over the world. Agroecological intensification aims at improving productivity and efficiency through better farm management, improved stability and diversity of yields and enhanced use of local resources. The site’s database, with case studies and research on topics from crop ecology to disease management, is a resource for practitioners and researchers in developing countries seeking to improve agricultural systems and adapt to the changing climate. Networks with an explicit focus on youth are also crucial. The Global Forum on Agricultural Research and the Young Professionals for Agricultural Development (Ypard) are focusing on cultivating the next generation of farmers, researchers, scientists, agronomists and policymakers. Ypard has grown into a network of more than 4,500 members in 117 countries and young professionals share innovations and learn from farmers and researchers in other parts of the world. Ypard involves youth in critical conversations about agricultural research and policy including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations and other important meetings where youth typically don’t have a voice. Youth unemployment rates are on the rise in many developing countries – today, some 4.5 million youth around the globe are unemployed. But increasing the appeal of professions in agriculture can help solve this economic problem – creating social stability and food security. For farming to attract youth, it must become more profitable. Luckily, the development of agriculture-focused cell phone applications is transforming the way people run their farms: sub-Saharan Africa has more 650 million cell phone subscribers, and the number is growing. Tigo Kilimo in Tanzania and Mobile Agribiz in the Democratic Republic of Congo provide small-scale farmers with crucial weather information and agricultural tips. And SokoniSMS64 in Kenya sends farmers texts with accurate market prices from around the country, helping them negotiate with traders and connect to markets. Access to this information can help farmers make the right decisions about what to plant and who to sell to – decisions that make a big difference about whether a harvest is profitable. Achieving food security and combating malnutrition in the developing world also depends on improving the nutrient density of the crops. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad) emphasises that while increasing productivity and profitability are important, improving nutrition requires more attention. This can be achieved, in part, through changes in practices – including better storage, preservation and processing.  And instead of growing starchy staples, young farmers are diversifying crop production to increase nutrition and incomes. Developing Innovations in School Cultivation, or Project Disc, in Uganda, is working with nursery school to high school students to develop a better appreciation – and taste – for indigenous foods. Edie Mukiibi, the project’s co-founder and now vice president of Slow Food International, says that “if a person doesn’t know how to grow food, they don’t know how to eat”. By working with schools to get students excited about indigenous plants, cooking, and preserving foods, Project Disc is instilling a positive perception of farming and lifelong knowledge about nutrition.  Empowering youth in developing countries to bring their energy to the agricultural sector is an ongoing effort. This effort must begin again with each new generation to help nourish both people and the planet. And it requires the support of policymakers, consumers, and innovators worldwide – the future of food depends on it. Danielle Nierenberg is president of Food Tank. Follow @DaniNierenberg on Twitter.

"The Action/2015 campaign (This year is key to poverty and climate goals, stars warn world leaders, 15 January) is a welcome initiative that underlines the importance of 2015 as a crucial year in the fight against poverty and climate change, with pivotal UN summits taking place. The campaign released new data showing the number of people living in extreme poverty – on less than $1.25 a day – could be reduced from over 1 billion to 360 million by 2030 if the right decisions are made. However, poverty is more than a lack of income: people living in deprivation face many simultaneous disadvantages. Health, education and living-standards deprivations are equally important to measure, as the 7 million people who took part in the UN’s My World survey, the Open Working Group and the secretary-general’s December 2014 report stress. The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative proposes one feasible option: to complement the $1.25/ day income measure with an improved multidimensional poverty index (MPI 2015+) that would ensure the many overlapping disadvantages experienced by the poor, such as malnutrition, poor sanitation and lack of education, are not overlooked. According to global MPI estimates, 1.6 billion people across 110 countries are multidimensionally poor.  Considering two measures – income poverty and the MPI 2015+ – would empower leaders to combat poverty in its many dimensions. As Action/2015 underlines, making the right decisions this year is key – but we need to select the right tools for fighting poverty to ensure the right policy decisions can be made in future too.Sabina AlkireDirector, Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative • As celebrities and campaigners begin to talk about what will follow on from the millennium development goals, it is vital that we do not ignore the needs of the disabled people who live in developing countries. Disabled people are often the poorest and most marginalised from their communities. Many disabled people struggle to earn a living, and as a result their families face severe financial hardship. Often, disabled people have not benefited from international aid. For example, one-third of the 58 million primary-school-aged children who are out of school worldwide are disabled. When the MDGs were agreed by world leaders in 2000, there was no mention of disability in the eight goals or in the 60 indicators of the 21 targets. This needs to change. In order to truly tackle poverty it is vital that the needs of disabled people are met and they get targeted support.James ThornberryDirector, Sense International"
"Christiana Figueres, who heads up the global climate change talks, was visibly moved as she urged business leaders to take action to avoid runaway climate change at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos on Thursday. “This is the first generation that is becoming aware of what we have done, because the previous generation had no clue,” said the executive director of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. “We can’t blame them, we can’t blame ourselves because we’ve been put in this situation, but we do have a responsibility to do something about it and not to pass it on to the next generation.”  Looking at her daughter sitting nearby, Figueres’ eyes well up. Her desire to secure a meaningful climate deal later this year in Paris is clearly as much a personal concern as a global one. While it is incumbent on the world’s politicians to secure a deal, it’s apparent they need help: just yesterday, the US Senate failed to pass resolutions acknowledging that climate change is the result of human activity. The private sector can play a pivotal role in giving politicians the confidence to act, Figueres said. “I don’t think anybody can question the fact the role of business is fundamental, independently of [on] what side of the spectrum business stands,” she said.  Engagement from the private sector, Figueres says, needs to come in three forms: vision, action and voice.  Vision is about business leaders understanding the consequence of climate change for their companies and ensuring they align their operations with staying within a 2C rise in global temperatures. Executives then need to think through what they need from governments at both national and international level in order to pursue that path. “This is about vision, not short-termism,” Figueres said. “It’s not just about energy efficiency measures today, which represents only a tiny, tiny little first step. It’s about starting there but then understanding where we have to be over the next 50 years.” Once companies have a clear destination, they need to focus on closing the distance between where they are now and where they want to be, she says. The final step is to become much more vocal about the need for transformational action. “It is no secret that we have a very small number of corporations that are being very vocal, and that there’s a huge number of companies – the silent majority – that are not participating in this discussion and are not engaging with governments with respect to the very clear guidance and regulatory certainty that they need,” she said. Figueres believes the lack of advocacy by companies is due to the fact that most of them still do not feel immediately threatened by climate change. In a PwC survey this week, global warming didn’t even make the list of CEO’s top priorities or concerns. But Figueres warns that if executives continue to focus only on what’s in front of their noses, they will put their companies’ long-term survival at risk. They can see that in the long run, having a stable planet and economic system is actually better for them in their operations and their business continuity, and that there is a huge opportunity for growth and for new profit, for new jobs, new industries and new technologies,” she said.  “But that is not compelling enough to actually have the CEO get up there and use his voice and leadership because the pain in the shoe is not enough. There is this abstract sense of yeah, we all want to be better off, but maybe somebody else should be doing something about that. In the meantime, I have my payroll to worry about.  Whereas those companies that are very active and do have a voice perceive that they’re immediately threatened.” Businesses, regardless of their size, have largely failed to look deeply at the impacts of fossil fuels, she said: “They just use electricity and that’s the sum total of their engagement in this process.”  Despite the need for more action, Figueres said she was heartened by the number of major businesses that attended the climate change summit in New York last year, and in particular by the engagement by whole sectors, such as insurers and more progressive sections of the investment industry. There has also been a sea change in the attitude from governments about the need to collaborate with the private sector. “There has been quite an evolution in the understanding of the very positive contribution that the private sector can make,” she says. “I remember when I got to the secretariat five years ago that the private sector was a taboo word that never would have appeared in any text of governments. Yet now you have the text actually inviting quite openly the participation of corporations. She acknowledged that there’s still a long way to go in what she calls “an evolutionary process”. But with just 10 months to go before the Paris talks open, Figueres also recognised the need for urgent action and referred to having a time bomb on our hands. When one strips everything away, Figueres says that what business leaders need to do most is get in touch with their common humanity. We speak of business as though there was a head there, a thinking brain, and that’s not so,” she says. “We have a role to play in life, whether that is being the head of a Fortune 500 company, or being a junior professional in an NGO, and we must step up to those roles. “However, what cuts across all of those differences is the fact that we’re all human beings, all of us, and we all are either parents or aunts and uncles or grandparents and we all have a responsibility to the future.”  This year’s Davos coverage is funded by The B Team.

"Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to the UN World Meteorological Organisation, as rising carbon emissions continue to trap heat and drive climate change. The WMO’s new analysis narrowly places 2014 as the hottest recorded since 1850, as have recent analyses from other organisations. The WMO analysis is particularly authoritative as it brings together a number of leading temperature records, as well as alternative ways of estimating the warmth of the globe. The average global air temperatures over land and sea in 2014 were 0.57C above the average of 14.00C for the 1961-1990 reference period. The record temperature was above those in 2005 and 2010, the next hottest years, but only by a small amount which was within the margin of uncertainty in the calculations. “The overall warming trend is more important than the ranking of an individual year,” said WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud. “2014 was nominally the warmest on record, although there is very little difference between the three hottest years.” “We expect global warming to continue, given that rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the increasing heat content of the oceans are committing us to a warmer future,” he said. “In 2014, record-breaking heat combined with torrential rainfall and floods in many countries and drought in some others – consistent with the expectations of a changing climate.” Global sea-surface temperatures reached record levels in 2014, which is significant because 93% of the heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases from fossil fuels and other human activities ends up in the oceans.  The WMO said it was notable that 2014’s record temperatures occurred without a fully-developed El Niño event.  These occur when warmer than average seas in the eastern tropical Pacific combine, in a feedback loop, with weather systems to drive up temperatures. The high temperatures in 1998, the hottest year of the 20th century, occurred during a strong El-Niño. On land, England saw its hottest year in three and a half centuries, according to the Central England Temperature data set.  The confirmation of 2014’s extreme heat comes ahead of the next round of preparatory UN climate change negotiations in Geneva, starting on 9 February. These are intended to pave towards a global agreement to tackle climate change, the deadline for which is a summit in Paris in December. The WMO analysis is based, amongst others, on three datasets - Hadcrut, NOAA and NASA - and the analysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts."

"The symbolic doomsday clock moved to three minutes before midnight on Thursday because of the gathering dangers of climate change and nuclear proliferation, signalling the gravest threat to humanity since the throes of the cold war. It was the closest the clock has come to midnight since 1984, when arms-control negotiations stalled and virtually all channels of communication between the US and the former Soviet Union closed down. “It is now three minutes to midnight,” said Kennette Bennedict, the executive director of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, announcing the two-minute shift toward the midnight hour.  The move came as scientists sounded a warning about climate change for the second time in three years. The last move of the clock hands, from six minutes to five minutes to midnight, in 2012, was also because of climate change. As the scientists noted last Thursday, 2014 was the hottest year in 130 years of systematic record keeping. Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000. But the scientists suggested that the greater danger lay in the failure of leaders to recognise and act on climate change. “Stunning government failures have imperiled civilisations on a global scale,” Benedict said. “World leaders have failed to act on a scale or at a speed to protect humanity from catastrophe.” The greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change have risen more since 2000 than in the three previous decades combined, Richard Somerville, a research professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said. Even so, he observed, negotiators had steadily lowered their ambitions for a global climate deal. Meanwhile, the scientists said, global efforts to reduce nuclear arsenals have slowed since 2009, and all of the nuclear powers were expanding reactors and weapons programmes. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists created the symbolic clock in 1947 to indicate the cold war threat. In 1991, when the threat of nuclear annihilation receded with the end of the cold war, the clock stood at 17 minutes to midnight. But it was now moving closer to the apocalypse because of climate change. “We are not saying it is too late to take action, but the window to take action is closing rapidly,” Benedict said."
"Britons are more likely to agree the climate is changing than at any time in recent years, with nearly nine in 10 people saying climate change is happening and 84% attributing this somewhat or entirely to human activity, new research has found. Two-thirds say they are concerned by global warming.  When asked to name major threats to the UK in the next two decades, 15% of those polled listed climate change without prompting, putting it in fourth position behind immigration, the economy and health. But among people who had direct recent experience of flooding, the number nearly doubled, to 29%. Nick Pidgeon, professor at Cardiff University, who co-authored the research, said this showed that there was a clear link between last year’s severe flooding incidents, which left thousands homeless, and the perception of global warming. “An association between last year’s winter flooding and climate change has been forming in the minds of many ordinary people in Britain, who also view these events as a sign of things to come,” he said. This link should be used by scientists and politicians to reinforce their message that action on carbon emissions is vital, he added. “In my view they [scientists] should be a bit more decisive in saying extreme weather is one of the risks of climate change,” he said. A poll last August found the floods had caused 27% of the UK public to increase their belief that climate change was manmade. The science of climate change “attribution” – linking specific extreme weather events to the effects of global warming – is making substantial progress, so it is becoming increasingly possible for scientists to tie particular weather patterns to climate change. Across the UK, only 13% of the population take the opinion that climate change is not caused by human activity. That contrasts with 2011, when 21% of people said climate change was mainly or entirely the result of natural processes.  The Ipsos MORI survey questioned 1,002 respondents from across the UK, together with another 995 people from five areas of England and Wales that were afflicted by last year’s winter flooding. Of the latter group, 135 respondents had suffered directly from the flooding last winter. A large majority (75%) of the general sample said the floods were some of the worst events to have happened to the UK in recent years, and 82% said the country had not been prepared for them. Only 36% thought the affected regions had coped well with the impact of the floods. Nearly two thirds (63%) said the floods were caused, at least in part, by climate change.   Most people are also willing to take action on greenhouse gas emissions, and to have the government and businesses take action, the Cardiff poll found. More than eight in 10 said they would buy more energy-efficient appliances and cut down on energy use at home, while 53% said they would be willing to make significant lifestyle changes to address climate change. Four in 10 said they would reduce the amount they travel by car. Three quarters of people said they supported the UK signing up to international agreements to limit emissions, with 14% neutral and only 7% opposed. On subsidies for wind farms and other renewables, people are split down the middle: four in 10 people support tax increases to pay for more renewable energy, with a similar number opposed and a further fifth neutral. Nearly half support road pricing schemes, with 18% neutral and a third opposed. When asked what they would do about climate change, including options to change to a green energy supplier or sign a petition, only 14% said they would contact their local MP on the issue. This could provide a clue as to why so many MPs, Conservatives especially, are able to be markedly more sceptical on climate change than the electorate – if voters are not telling them it is an issue they care about, they may be more likely to follow their own inclinations or be swayed by lobbyists."

"Snow on the roofs of the ski chalets at the upmarket ski resort may be one of the defining images of Davos, but it will be the warming of the planet that is at the top of the issues under discussion at the World Economic Forum. In the kind of speaking double act beloved of the event’s organisers, Al Gore, the former US vice-president, who has described climate change as “the biggest challenge our civilisation faces”, will discuss the subject alongside Pharrell Williams. The pop star, who reached No 1 with Happy, is appearing as creative director of Bionic Yarn, a company that turns fibres from recycled plastic into durable textiles.  The energetic Gore is also participating in other events looking at how business should respond to climate change, alongside Lord Stern, president of the British Academy, and speakers from the insurance company Axa. • Elsewhere, conflict is the number-one issue for the political and business elite this year. The rise of Islamic State has awoken fears over failures of national governance and the collapse of nation states. Several Middle Eastern leaders are in attendance, including Egypt’s president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi; King Abdullah of Jordan; Haidar al-Abadi, the prime minister of Iraq; and Massoud Barzani, the president of the autonomous Kurdistan region. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder that “long-forgotten” disputes can flare back into life, the World Economic Foundation says, with widespread consequences for a whole region. Petro Poroshenko, the president of Ukraine, will be looking for backing as his country risks defaulting on its debts. He should get support from George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, who is pushing European governments to offer Kiev more help. He will be lobbying the likes of Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s François Hollande and Italy’s Matteo Renzi. The terror attacks in France this month will also be debated and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair, will take part in a session on Wednesday examining whether religion is a pretext for conflict. • Global authorities were slow, at least initially, to respond to the Ebola outbreak and provide resources to the countries affected, according to the organisers at Davos. The forum will ask what lessons can be learned. Panellists include Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the United Nations, as well as Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation. Alpha Condé, the president of Guinea, who has faced accusations of being initially slow to respond to Ebola, is also speaking. The New York Times quoted him recently as saying: “While shaving, I think of Ebola; while eating, I think of Ebola; while sleeping, I think of Ebola.” • Central banks will be a major topic of conversation in the meeting rooms, coffee shops and bars of Davos as monetary policy in Europe and the US continues to diverge and inflation falls across the global economy. The shock abolition of Switzerland’s currency gap last week has left many financial firms nursing losses and reminded us all that 2015 could be a turbulent year in the markets. Thomas Jordan, the Swiss central bank chief who sparked the turmoil, can expect a lively reception. At least seven other central bank chiefs are attending, including the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. However, the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is not attending this year. He will be stuck in Frankfurt handling the ECB’s meeting on Thursday, where a big quantitative easing (QE) programme could be announced. At a debate on the prospect of higher interest rates in the US, delegates from emerging markets will be pushing American officials to handle the ending of the QE programme responsibly after seeing “hot money” pour into their economies. They do not want a repeat of the currency crisis that struck Argentina during last year’s meeting. • Meanwhile, the tumble in the oil price to five-year lows means different things to different Davos attendees. It is a bitter blow to exporters, raises political risk in the Middle East and hits growth in emerging markets. Once he arrives in Switzerland, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, Opec’s secretary general, will face criticism from producers over the cartel’s refusal to cut supplies."
"Despite the new Republican majority and the oil industry gunning for the president’s agenda on emissions cuts and the Keystone XL pipeline, Barack Obama will show he’s no lame duck on climate change, White House officials insisted ahead of his second-to-last State of the Union Address. After using his executive authority over the last 18 months to propose new carbon pollution rules for power plants, an historic emissions deal with China and – just last week – the roll-out of measures aimed at methane, Obama will also likely tout new smog rules on Tuesday. He may even tip his hand on the contentious pipeline currently being debated in the Senate.  But a year after stating the increasingly obvious yet again – “Climate change is a fact,” Obama said in his 2014 address before Congress – it appears the president may have to use the high visibility of the speech to re-affirm science before he can double down on his action plan. And then, a few minutes later in what could make for a fiery political night on the environment in between talk of taxes and housing, Joni Ernst will take the national stage to deliver the official Republican response to Obama’s address. Ernst, the freshman ​senator from Iowa elected on a promise to “make ’em squeal”, does not accept that climate change is real. Neither do a large number of Republicans in power in Congress, despite new research released last week showing that majorities of moderate and liberal Republican voters do, in fact, accept the existence of climate change. “I don’t know the science behind climate change,” Ernst, who wants to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and scrap the Clean Water Act, said at a campaign debate last September. “I can’t say one way or another what is the direct impact, whether it’s man-made or not. I’ve heard arguments from both sides.” The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is already arguing to overturn Obama’s use of executive action to fight climate change. “I’ll let scientists debate sources and their opinion of that change,” House speaker John Boehner said at a GOP retreat last week, insisting that the “real question” was whether “every proposal we see out of the administration with regard to climate change means killing American jobs.” The main oil industry lobby, the American Petroleum Industry, was also bracing for a fight, unleashing a new ad campaign, after spending more than $327m on public relations over five years. “I do think that the president will sketch out his vision of climate on a global scale and that is why we believe it will focus on the methane issue,” the API chief executive, Jack Gerrard, told a conference call with reporters. But the Obama administration’s strategy to cut methane emissions by 40% to 45% over the next decade is just one part of a multi-pronged plan, even though, as one White House official said on Friday, “there will be attempts to impede or scale back our actions.” Obama has consistently promoted an “all of the above” energy strategy, including the use of fracked natural gas. So he was expected to run the gamut on Tuesday – and not just talk about low gas prices at the pump.  But judging on past performance, Obama could take time to re-affirm, once again, that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and already poses a danger to the US and the world. “When our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did,” Obama said last year. “Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend, but the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15,” Obama said in 2013, before a wave of data continued that trend. The president promised then “to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future” – and increasingly in the months following the last major election before he leaves office, those actions have arrived. In its run-up to Tuesday’s speech, White House officials insisted Obama will keep pushing on his climate action plan, in addition to what senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer called on NBC Sunday an emphasis on “middle class economics”. The White House official on Friday pointed to a new report from scientific agencies on Friday confirming 2014 as the hottest year on record as “another reminder that climate change is not a problem for the future”. “It’s happening here and now, and we can’t wait to take action,” the official said. “We will continue to move forward on this vital issue.” Perhaps the most closely watched moment in Washington for a potential surprise on Tuesday night – other than the rebuttal from the sometimes unpredictable Ernst – will be the degree to which Obama invokes the Keystone XL pipeline. The White House has said repeatedly over the past several weeks that Obama would veto current legislation to force approval of the project, though the president has never gone so far as to issue a public veto threat himself. A state department review is expected early next month, after a holdup on the project’s proposed route recently cleared a Nebraska court. Republicans have pushed ahead, and could vote on the bill as early as this week, after the State of the Union address, despite the president and other Democratic leaders dismissing Republican claims on the project’s economic benefits. “It’s taken us a while to get going on this bill,” McConnell said. Republicans do not currently have the votes to override an Obama veto, but it was thought there was still an outside chance Obama could leave open the door to work with Congress on energy efficiency. The question is whether Keystone – and the facts – will get in the way."

"In a critical year for action to prevent runaway climate change, one would hope the issue would rank high on chief executives’ list of business risks to worry about. So it comes as a shock to discover that climate change appears so low on their list of concerns that professional services group PricewaterhouseCoopers did not even bother to include it in its global survey of business leaders.  PwC’s 18th annual global CEO survey, released Tuesday to coincide with the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos, failed to even ask 1,322 business leaders about their global warming concerns after only 10% registered concern the previous year. A spokeswoman for PwC said that climate change did not make it into the top 19 risks CEOs were questioned about because of their lack of interest in the subject. At a time when sustainability experts are calling for tougher regulation to drive climate action, the PwC survey shows that overregulation leads the list of CEOs’ perceived risks, with 78% saying it threatens their organisation’s growth prospects. This level of concern is the highest ever seen in the survey and up six points from last year. Countries where concern about overregulation is highest include Argentina (98%), Venezuela (96%), the US (90%), Germany (90%), the UK (87%) and China (85%).  Other high-priority risks include the lack of key skills in the talent pool, government responses to fiscal deficit and debt burden, geopolitical uncertainty, cyber security and social instability. More evidence that CEOs are not engaged on climate change comes from the responses to a question about their top priorities for government. Only 6% of respondents listed reducing the risk of climate change as a priority, putting it at the bottom of the list. What CEOs most want from politicians is to maintain a competitive and efficient tax system, a priority cited by two-thirds of those surveyed, followed by access to a skilled workforce, physical infrastructure, affordable capital and digital infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the bad news does not end there. When CEOs were asked about the changes they are seeing in international policies and regulations, collaboration between governments and businesses to mitigating climate change risks more effectively again ended up on the very bottom of the list. Nearly half said collaboration was not improving, with less than a third seeing an improvement. These survey results suggest that beyond the very few progressive companies that are taking the risks of climate change seriously, the majority are failing to register the magnitude of the problem. It seems that CEOs are so overwhelmed by short-term fears that they are failing to look further ahead. What they care most about is meeting their short-term growth targets: according to the survey, CEOs are less optimistic about global growth prospects than a year ago, with just over a third expecting global economic growth to improve in 2015, down from 44% last year. Significantly, 17% of CEOs – more than twice as many as a year ago – believe global economic growth will decline. The survey highlights just how little CEOs understand climate change and the impacts it will have for generations to come. Unless action is taken now, it will be impossible to keep within the global goal of a 2C temperature rise (pdf) to prevent irreversible climate change.  While optimism abounded during the climate change talks in New York last year, business hardly had any presence at the annual UN climate change conference in Lima, Peru, in December. The meeting at Davos this week will include a number of sustainability-related events, and it would be wise for participants to reflect on whether they are making as much progress as they had hoped – and how to do more. The truth is that politicians will fail to act decisively on climate issues unless they are confident that enough companies are prepared to support their stand. Unless we see a sea change in the global business community’s involvement in fighting climate change, corporations will continue to be seen as part of the problem rather than the solution – and consumers’ trust that companies will do the right thing will fade even further.

"As the US political fight over climate change moves from Washington DC to 50 state capitals, companies that are serious about sustainability need to support the EPA’s proposed rules to curb carbon pollution from existing power plants. So, at least, says Mindy Lubber, the president of Ceres, a nonprofit that brings together companies, investors and public-interest groups to advocate for sustainability. “Companies have the strength and power – the footprint to make a huge difference,” Lubber told me at a lunch earlier this month. Ceres celebrates its 25th anniversary Tuesday.  It’s hard to overstate the importance of the proposed power plant rules, which are the cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s climate agenda. Power plants account for nearly 40% of all US greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA is asking each state to develop a plan to meet federally mandated carbon limits. But 29 of 50 states are now led by Republican governors, most of whom are likely to oppose the new rules. If the EPA effort falls flat, there’s no way the US can lead the way to a global climate agreement. Ceres and Lubber have set out to persuade corporations to support the EPA and the president, and overcome their habitual, instinctive resistance to government regulation. “It is going to be long and tedious and complicated,” Lubber admits. “And really hard.” Boston-based Ceres, one of a handful of US green groups to focus on business, has never shied away from complex, unglamorous environmental work. Formed in 1989 in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Ceres has helped make sustainability reporting a common practice, developed best practices for corporate sustainability, promoted corporate buying of renewable power and spotlighted climate risk in the insurance industry, all in an effort to find common ground among capitalists and environmentalists. “Our mission is to integrate sustainability into capital markets,” Lubber says. “And we’ve never deviated from that.” By some measures, Ceres has had considerable impact. Corporate responsibility reports – an idea birthed by Ceres in the late 1990s – are now widespread.  Increasingly, big mainstream companies – Lubber cites General Electric, PepsiCo, Disney and the Detroit automakers, along with the usual suspects like Unilever and Ikea – regard sustainability and climate change as core business issues that require the attention of top executives and corporate boards.  “The conversation has changed,” Lubber says. “It’s remarkable.” Ceres’ work with institutional investors has made a difference, too. Some investors, particularly those who take the long view, have come to see climate change and water scarcity as financial risks that need to be disclosed and addressed by corporates. “I can tell you with certainty that the [US Securities and Exchange Commission] would not have mandated the disclosure of climate risk if it had not been for the investors coming to them, petitioning, lobbying,” Lubber says, even if compliance with the SEC guidance has been spotty. Yet Lubber makes clear that neither companies nor investors are moving far enough or fast enough. “We’ve got to ramp up, materially, investments in clean energy and decrease carbon emissions,” she says. Even among the biggest companies, many of whom have pledged to curb their environmental footprint, carbon emissions are rising at an unsustainable rate. Scientists say emissions need to decline sharply to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. But instead of shrinking, self-reported greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s 500 largest businesses – companies that are often noisy about their sustainability commitments – actually grew by 3.1% between 2010 and 2013, according to a worrisome Thomson Reuters report released last month. That’s why it’s important for companies to support the EPA’s power plant rules, Lubber says. Mandating that existing power plants cut US carbon-dioxide emissions by 30% by 2030 from 2005 levels would bend the emissions curve downwards. Last month, Ceres released a statement supporting the rules that was signed by more than 200 companies, many small or midsized. Big firms to sign on included Ikea, Kellogg, Levi Strauss, Mars, Nestle, Nike, Novelis, VF and Unilever.  By contrast, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the America Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Mining Association and the US Chamber of Commerce, which represents many thousands of businesses, have formed a coalition called the Partnership for a Better Energy Future to oppose the EPA rules. The group says the EPA’s rules will raise electricity costs, increase blackouts, destroy jobs and damage America’s competitive position in global markets. It’s this kind of position – pitting the environment against the economy – that Ceres and Lubber hope to head off by persuading more companies to speak out about the need for climate action. She holds out hope that business voices can help turn political conservatives’ opinions around. After all, she says, liberals and conservatives alike “would throw themselves in front of a bus to save their grandkid. And we’ve got this bus coming at us”.

"It’s widely accepted that climate change will have bigger negative impacts on poorer countries than wealthy ones. However, a new economic modeling study finds that the economic impacts on these poorer countries could be much larger than previous estimates.  As a result, they suggest that we should be aiming to limit global warming to near, or perhaps even less than the international target of 2°C. This conclusion is in sharp contrast to current economic models, which generally conclude that the economically optimal pathway results in a global surface warming around 3–3.5°C.  Current economic models mainly treat economic growth as an external factor. In these models, global warming and its impacts via climate change don’t significantly affect the rate at which the economy grows. However, several economic studies have concluded that this is an inaccurate assumption, with a 2012 paper by Melissa Dell and colleagues taking the first stab at quantifying the effects of climate damages on economic growth. The new study by Frances Moore and Delavane Diaz of Stanford University calibrates the climate ‘damage functions’ in one of these economic models (DICE, developed by William Nordhaus at Yale) using the results from the Dell paper. They grouped the world into rich and poor countries, finding that while the economies of rich countries continue to grow well in a warmer world, the economic growth of poor countries is significantly impaired. As a result, Moore and Diaz conclude that the economically optimal pathway could be very similar to the most aggressive scenario considered by the IPCC (called RCP2.6). In this scenario, human carbon emissions peak almost immediately and then decline until they reach zero around the year 2070.   Moore and Diaz find that if climate change does affect GDP growth in this way, then the best path for society would limit temperatures to between 1.6 and 2.8°C warming in 2100, with a best estimate of around 1.7°C warming. The study estimates the impact on economic growth in poor countries if we continue on a business-as-usual carbon pollution and rapid climate change path: The average annual growth rate in poor regions is cut from 3.2% to 2.6%, which means that by 2100 per-capita GDP is 40% below reference. One challenge is that there are two factors that may contribute to the bigger impact of climate change on economic growth in poorer countries, and we don’t know which effect is bigger. As poor countries are, on average, hotter than rich countries, they are exposed more frequently to damaging temperatures and therefore show higher sensitivity to temperature. Under this mechanism, the sensitivity of rich countries would increase as they warm. Alternatively, higher temperatures may be more damaging in poor countries because their economies are reliant on climate-exposed sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction, or because risk management options such as insurance or air conditioning are not as widely available. In this case we would expect the sensitivity of poor regions to warming to decrease as per-capita GDP increases. In other words, poorer countries may have the resources to adapt to climate change as they become wealthier in the future. On the other hand, if their economic growth is sensitive to global warming mainly because they’re located in hotter parts of the planet, then their economies will struggle in a hotter future world. The ‘social cost of carbon’ is an estimate of the costs of carbon pollution to society via climate damages. It’s an important number in terms of setting federal policy. In May 2013, the US government revised its estimate of the social cost of carbon from $22 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted to $37 per ton, to great consternation from the Republican Party. The new figure was based in large part on the average of the estimates from current economic models.  However, Moore and Diaz conclude that when accounting for climate impacts on economic growth, the social carbon cost rises to between about $70 and $400, with a best estimate of over $200 per ton. This suggests that even the new, higher US government estimate is too low. Frances Moore told me, Our estimate of $200 per ton includes the assumption that there will be fairly rapid and effective adaptation to climate change impacts. If there is no adaptation, then the social cost of carbon is substantially larger. So its not an either / or choice between adaptation and mitigation policy. The results of this study also suggest that estimates of the social cost of carbon to date have underestimated the already large uncertainty in its value. This suggests that climate policies should focus on risk management, as Delavane Diaz explains, Rather than attempt to identify a single exact value for the social cost of carbon, mitigation policy should be designed with the goal being to manage uncertain climate risks. There’s another important take-away from this study. There have been a lot of arguments, based on current economic models, that the costs from climate damages won’t be so large, and that we should instead focus on other problems. By failing to account for the impacts of climate damages on economic growth, to date these models appear to have significantly underestimated their costs.  When accounting for the full impacts of climate damages, there’s a strong economic case for immediate aggressive efforts to cut carbon pollution."
"It’s 2050 and global warming has brought the planet to its knees. London is gripped by drought, Miami has been abandoned because of rising sea levels and cases of historic climate abuse are being tried in the courts. The UN collapsed long ago and has been replaced by New Atlantis, which under the calming leadership of Secretary General Bryony Weller (Tricia Kelly) has restored some order. But the problems of ongoing climate change need to be urgently addressed, and with Weller sick and relinquishing her post early, the leadership of New Atlantis is up for grabs. Will it be the head of Industry, Defence or Reform who gets the job? You get to vote, but only after you’ve spent 80 minutes wandering the building, hearing what they each have to say and watching what their departments do. Will you vote for Reform, who argue that it’s people’s behaviour that must change, even if it means introducing unpopular policies such as one child per family? Industry claims it can solve problems through creating biofuels and asteroid mining, while Defence reckons that controlling the seas is crucial. Outside, the young are protesting their disenfranchisement and trying to make their voices heard.  It’s a neat idea, but very imperfectly realised in a piece that despite the urgency of its subject matter lacks dramatic focus and momentum. You would actually find out more about climate change and the solutions proposed by spending 80 minutes online than you do by wandering around here and being confronted by scientists who lack acting skills and actors who lack scientific skills. There’s too much nitty gritty and not nearly enough framing information about exactly how this world and New Atlantis operates. There’s zero human interest too: these aren’t characters, just mouthpieces. Less a piece of theatre and more of an imaginatively conceived but poorly executed education project. • Until 25 January.

"For many months a leading barrister has been delving into the secrets of the police’s long-running undercover infiltration of political groups.  What he turns up could well prove to be highly embarrassing to police chiefs.   Since last March, Mark Ellison QC has been investigating whether campaigners have over the decades been unjustly convicted because key evidence gathered by undercover police units was concealed from their trials. More than 50 campaigners have already had their convictions overturned or were wrongly prosecuted. (The cases involved undercover officers Mark Kennedy and Jim Boyling).  Ellison’s inquiry has official backing as it was commissioned by home secretary Theresa May. When she originally announced the inquiry’s remit, it appeared that his deadline to complete his inquiry was March 31 this year.  But now it seems that his inquiry will take longer than expected. On Friday, the Home Office said in a parliamentary answer that Ellison is now only “intending to provide a progress report” by the end of March.  It appears that this progress report is likely to estimate how many convictions of activists could be unsafe and outline reasons that may have caused the miscarriages of justice. It is unclear when he is due to complete his inquiry.  It may be that his inquiry is taking longer because he is uncovering a lot of unsafe convictions of activists.  This blog examines how Ellison was commissioned by the home secretary after he had aired misgivings about the conduct of the undercover police during his previous inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case. He had found that the undercover police operated as if the legal rules requiring them to disclose evidence to ensure fair trials did not apply to them.  He had also suggested that the undercover police knew that evidence advanced by prosecutors against campaigners was false but did nothing, hid vital evidence, and could have encouraged others to commit crimes.  According to its official remit, his inquiry has been initially focussing on the Special Demonstration Squad and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU), but could be broadened out to scrutinise other covert work. Friday’s parliamentary question was asked by Green MP Caroline Lucas, who - with her Green colleague Jenny Jones - has been one of the few politicians pursuing the truth about the undercover operations.  Potential miscarriages of justice will be sent to the official watchdog, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, to see if they should be referred to the appeal courts.  Mike Penning, the policing minister, declined to tell Lucas how many cases have been sent to the CCRC so far. "
"Syriza’s election victory has kindled hopes of an environmental champion pushing for greater climate ambition on the European stage, but the party will need to balance its green credentials with a commitment to new coal plants, and ambivalence about a major gas pipeline. Syriza is in an alliance with a faction of the Greek Green party, which will have at least one MP in the new government, and it is seen by many as a tribune of European social movements, particularly environmental ones.  Elements of Syriza’s domestic agenda will delight environmentalists. The party believes in small-scale diversified renewables production, coordinated with local people through community-level decision making. It also plans a big expansion of energy efficient building renovations – seen as the most cost-effective means of simultaneously cutting emissions – and fuel poverty. “Alexis Tsipras embodies the hope for a change of direction in the European council,” said the Green party’s co-presidents Rebecca Harms and Philippe Lambert, welcoming the election result. “The Greens/EFA group in the European parliament will do everything it can to support good cooperation between the EU institutions and the new government in Athens. Syriza’s failure would benefit only the extreme right.” This last point is no doubt true. But Syriza is torn between an economy that has contracted at a scale and speed not seen since the 1930s and a sizeable chunk of its party that is eager for growth now, at any cost. The government will need to quickly reframe the debate about ‘sustainable growth’ or lower green expectations, or both. Syriza also plans to build new coal lignite plants – albeit, as cleanly as possible. “To build one new lignite plant but replace two others which are of older technology and emit more pollution, could be seen in technical terms as an improvement,” Harris Konstantatos, a member of Syriza’s central committee, told the Guardian, from Athens. But coal is also the most carbon-intensive of all fossil fuels, and environmentalists argue that ‘clean coal’ techniques simply displace pollutants from one waste stream, such as fly ash, to another, such as water outflow. Syriza’s commitment to growth itself would be challenged by many European Greens, but Konstantatos said that ‘degrowth’ ideas would be viewed as “absurd” in the austerity-wracked Greece of today. Leading party thinkers see the ‘keep fossil fuels in the ground’ idea as equally inappropriate – when even Germany continues to burn coal. “If we face fiscal difficulties from abroad in the medium term, then to burn more lignite instead of importing energy will seem a wise thing to do,” a Syriza source said. “If we don’t have money to import petrol then we will burn lignite which is free – not of a carbon footprint – but relatively cheaper. One way or another Greek lignite will be exploited.” Syriza is also keeping cards close to its chest on the issue of an east Mediterranean gas pipeline to alleviate Europe’s energy security concerns, with gas from Cyprus and Israel. The Guardian understands that informal – though not yet face-to-face – negotiations have taken place between Syriza and the EU over what could be the largest pipeline project in the world, and among its most politically fraught. “It’s a big and complicated issue, requiring strategic choices in accordance with how relations between Greece and the EU develop,” a source said. “Unfortunately, the issues of energy corridors and energy security in general are seen through the lens of geopolitics, rather than ecology. It is safe to say that the national pipelines are part of larger renegotiation of Greece’s position in Europe’s architecture.” An announcement may be made when the new government’s programme is outlined in parliament. The issue highlights the tightrope Syriza is walking between the radical intent of large parts of its membership and the compromises that may be foisted on it, if it is to deliver on its manifesto. As its own positions make clear, “We are an eco-friendly party and protection of the environment is at the top of our agenda,” the Syriza MEP Kostas Chrysogonos told the Guardian. “We humans are part of mother nature and not its rightful owners. We should behave accordingly.” The party was pledged to end a planned gold mine in Halkidiki, which would devastate the local environment, he added. Syriza is suspicious of market-based mechanisms like the EU’s emissions trading system, which it sees as a way of distributing public subsidies to wealthy polluters, while doing little to tackle emissions. It publicly strives for a third way of economic development. “We cannot and must not reproduce the well-known business-as-usual developmental models because we missed the rest of Europe’s industrial development train a century ago,” said Konstantatos. “It is rational for Greece to go green.” “Smart micro-grids can make much more efficient use of renewables to cater for islands that are not connected with continental grid, or make changes at the regional level,” he added. “You don’t need to reproduce the carbon model, with centralised plant that distribute everywhere. We must not reproduce this.” Here too though, Syriza will face some local opposition to wind turbines, fed by community resentment at wind farms centrally-licensed by the previous government with little regional planning, that enriched big industrialists. Both reds and greens in Syriza share a belief in economies based on human needs and wellbeing, rather than consumerist wants. But it may take time for the fledgling government to resolve the tensions between these, and align them with a daunting reconstruction programme. It remains to be seen whether that time will be forthcoming. "

"As the last day of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, kicks off, we asked participants to share the ideas they are taking away about the real things they can do to help solve the world’s top challenges.  But Davos has also taken plenty of flack for its exclusivity, and we also want to democratize the discussion.  Given the huge scope and scale of problems such as climate change, health and inequality, many big bold ideas are needed to really move the needle. We’re looking for strong commitments from business leaders; inspiring ideas from academics, nonprofits and readers; and personal pledges from consumers. Check out the wide-ranging responses readers already have contributed to the discussion, and share your own ideas here or in the previous post’s comments. If you’re able to make a personal or professional pledge, tweet #GSBDavos. We’ll pull some of the most inspiring thoughts from both into this thread, and look for your responses to these ideas in the comments below this post. What has stuck out most to us at Davos is two things: first, the impressive number of corporations that have made bold commitments to help curb climate change, and second, how few of those companies are talking to their consumers about it. This is a gap, but also an opportunity for the vanguard of progressive companies surging to the forefront of this transition – working toward 100% clean energy, building sustainable technologies, and starting to replenish forests. If these efforts are to succeed, it is important for multinationals to build public trust and affinity – but most consumers still have little idea about the transformational strides these brands are taking. Imagine how powerful a message that could be, if the world’s leading companies coordinated to show their consumers how they’re leading the transition to a clean, prosperous future. And if those same companies provided a way for consumers to support those commitments and take actions of their own? The impact could be game-changing. At Purpose, we launched Here Now in October in part to close this gap by developing a flexible, shared platform from which companies may begin having these discussions in ways that are relevant to consumers. We believe companies stand to reap substantial rewards – both in branding boosts from association with this vanguard of leading consumer brands and in business impact from the ample opportunities to integrate climate commitments with key selling periods and sustainable product lines. By joining the wider wave of mobilisation currently underway, these corporations can ensure that 2015 is the year climate action hits a tipping point. All they have to do is start talking, and invite others to join. – Paul Hilder, executive director of Here Now, and Jeremy Heimans, CEO of Purpose In many discussions at Davos this week, I’ve heard company leaders and regulators refer to a product’s “lifecycle” and its “end of life”. But this illustrates old thinking in which products are born from resource-intense raw materials amid sophisticated global supply chains and die a crude, even toxic death in the form of refuse piles, followed by burial in land, in rivers, at sea or by cremation in burn piles or even “waste to energy” plants.  These are old stories of throwing things away in a world with more than enough. But now, as we recognize the limited growth of constrained resources in a shrinking world, perhaps we can see that “away” has gone away. We need a new vocabulary to fit in with that new reality: I’d like to replace “lifecycle” and “end of life” with thinking about “endless use” and “endless resourcefulness”.  As an architect, I think about the old design directives: Less is More (and then Less is a Bore). Today, I am saying Endless is More. – William McDonough, founder of McDonough Innovation and chair of the World Economic Forum Meta-Council on the Circular Economy CEOs play a key role in setting company strategy, so it’s clear that any big corporate sustainability effort needs commitment from the top to succeed. Yet, in Davos we learned from our BCG/MIT Sloan Management Review study that only 21% of executives surveyed feel that their board is very supportive of their sustainability activity. Compounding this finding, we know that many companies are too busy trying to cover a broad range of areas, when in reality meaningful impact comes from focusing on one or two key issues. Equally important is the understanding that many of today’s sustainability issues cannot be solved by one company or organization alone. Developing solutions requires collaboration – like we see happening with efforts to reduce deforestation in the palm oil industry – to ensure efforts have a meaningful, widespread impact. Tackling sustainability issues on a company-by-company basis isn’t enough; companies and industries need to start working together. Businesses should decide on one key issue on which to focus now, and get three of their peers to join a collaborative group – such as the UN Global Compact program – that is working on broader, more systemic solutions to the issue. – Knut Haanaes, senior partner and global practice area leader for strategy and sustainability at BCG Davos tends to cover a lot of subjects, and this year’s edition is no exception. It occurs to me, though, that there are really two Davoses: Opportunity Davos and Threat Davos. It’s a tale of two cities. Opportunity Davos is represented by possibilities opening up due to technology, emerging economies and women’s empowerment. Threat Davos is represented by risks from European economic malaise, cybersecurity and geopolitics. Sustainability, particularly the challenges of decisive action on climate change and of achieving truly inclusive economic growth, is where these two Davoses meet. Al Gore’s updated presentation underlined the rising economic and social risks of inaction. Unilever’s Paul Polman is again playing the role of chief climate statesman from the business community, pointing to the innovation opportunities business can unearth as it works to mitigate impacts and prepare for changing climate. Davos can generate extremes of both unwarranted optimism and pessimism. The broad attention to sustainable, inclusive prosperity seems to get the balance right, suggesting that this is where the real action is. It is essential that the circle of companies prioritizing climate be widened. Businesses can do this by building more tangible collaborations, like 2014’s commitments on deforestation and a price on carbon. These deliver measurable impacts that improve business to demonstrate what’s possible outside of the ideological cheerleading and skepticism that too often marks our debates. – Aron Cramer, president and CEO of BSR As I conclude another World Economic Forum, it’s positive to again see climate change high on the agenda of corporate leaders. As CEOS are preparing for Paris where a global climate agreement is set to be reached, three issues have emerged from the various sessions here in Davos as critical for success: making the case for carbon pricing, corporate goal setting aligned with science targets, and transparency on corporate reporting on emissions.  What’s still missing from the conversation is the important role of emerging markets. The time has come to show true leadership in all areas. Only with strong business support can we lay the foundation for the climate challenge to change markets and reverse political positions. - Georg Kell, executive director of the UN Global Compact From inequality to climate change, the hot topics at Davos make it clear that commerce has created a legacy of problems, the solutions to which are either deferred for generations or impossible within any reasonable number of human lifetimes.  One might say our first industrial revolution production model – take, make, waste – has used unprincipled commerce as a weapon to wage unintentional war with the planet and all its creatures, and now, almost like a fearful retreating army, it is continuing to lay it all to waste.  Any thinking person today recognizes the urgent calamity of climate change and pollution. Now is the time to fiercely and intentionally wage peace on the planet, with commerce – as the only human institution big enough, creative enough and fast enough – as the engine of principled prosperity and beneficial change.  The job of business now is to support customers by producing benefits and assets for society, not liabilities and detriments.  – William McDonough, co-author of Cradle to Cradle and The Upcycle and chair of the World Economic Forum Meta-Council on the Circular Economy Here in Davos I’ve been asking myself, what’s the most important issue being discussed: economic inequality, gender equality, climate change, human rights. It’s occurred to me that this year’s World Economic Forum is not about these issue taken separately, but rather bringing them all into one set of global, moral, and political commitments. It’s about world leaders collaborating to bring about the changes so desperately needed. The sustainable development goals are a great example of this. Thousands of businesses from around the world will commit to action towards a more sustainable world. And it’s more than lofty goals and talk: they will also measure results, and communicate their progress to the world. – Michael Meehan, CEO of the Global Reporting Initiative There was a danger, with the economic and political outlook so uncertain, that immediate challenges would crowd out discussion at Davos of long-term challenges. I am glad to say – at least as far as the issue of global water supplies goes – this danger was avoided.  We were helped by the WEF’s own annual Global Risk Report which, for the first time, made water the number one threat to the world’s stability and prosperity. This would come as no surprise to the third of the world’s population already living in water-stressed areas. Are we taking this threat seriously enough yet? No, but discussions at Davos revealed an increased determination from governments and businesses to work together to respond to the challenge. Many businesses – including SABMiller – are not only reducing our own water usage, but actively joining partnerships to conserve supplies well beyond our operations.  As the Millennium Development Goals have shown, though, global focus is essential to deliver the scale of change needed. Businesses must back calls for water to be a high priority in the post-MDG framework to be agreed upon this autumn – and then commit ourselves to do all we can to meet these targets.  – Mark Bowman, managing director of SABMiller Africa  (read more responses here) 1. Pledge that each process, product, services will be delivered which do not cause negative climate change 2. Pledge to make each individual at the age above 18 as employable by imparting certain skills – Ravi, a Guardian reader in Pune, India An unlikely pledge to put the apparently insurmountable social and environmental issues first, whatever the cost for economic growth and corporate interests. – Luiz, a Guardian reader from Curitiba, Brazil Given the new fiscal space opened up by the oil price collapse, the time is now right for a bold pledge from business to get behind a global carbon tax. If it has to happen, and happen soon, why not now? – Chris, a Guardian reader in the UK I would ask business leaders to shift to renewable energy sources for 80% of their energy requirements in the next 10 years, covering energy requirements of every aspect of their business lifecycle - from procurement, to production, to marketing & distribution, to end lifecycle. – Aditi, a Guardian reader in New Delhi, India The environment is being trashed at every level. Businesses must lead in reversing this trend which includes climate change, water, food, economic inequality, gender inequality, etc. It is all connected.The downstream cost must be included in all production, and waste and damage to the environment must be paid for up front. It is very difficult to clean up the mess we have created, and future generations and many other species will suffer because of this negligence. We have a short period of time to change our ways. Don’t waste any more time. – Alex, a Guardian reader from Sydney, Australia I would urge enterprises to take a risk on sustainable investments that take more than one year to show returns. I’d also ask them to consider how inequality will increase if climate change is not attended urgently and how markets will collapse if inequality is not levelled. – Karina, a Guardian reader in Nuevo Leon, Mexico • Commit to real consequences for rule breaking A commitment to wind up corporations who flout the laws that the rest of the world must live by. In general, if a corporation breaks the law, then send it to jail in the same way an individual is denied liberty.  The corporation would then be either wound up or given over to the employees of said corporation. – Kris, a Guardian reader in Australia I’d like the WEF to pledge to leave Davos after 2015 and take the annual conferences to the front lines of unsustainable development, so that the challenges are up close and personal to its delegates.  I’d like to the WEF to say: “We will meet in the mega-cities of the global South. We will meet in Detroit. We will meet in New Orleans. We will meet in the favelas. We will meet the people most affected by the unsustainable developments in our environment, societies and economic systems.” – Ian, a Guardian reader in London #GSBDavos Nature is finite & we need an economy that can work with that.

"Oil giant BP is being challenged to confront the risk that climate change may pose to its future in a shareholder resolution published on Wednesday. Pension funds controlling hundreds of billions of pounds are among the 150 investors demanding the company tests whether its business model is compatible with the international community’s pledge to limit global warming to 2C.   The 2C target means only a quarter of existing, exploitable fossil fuel reserves are burnable, according to a series of recent analyses, implying that trillions of dollars of oil, gas and coal held by investors could become worthless and that further exploration for fossil fuels may be pointless.  The same shareholder resolution, which includes a ban on corporate bonuses for climate-harming activities, has been tabled with Shell and both will be voted on at forthcoming annual meetings. “Climate change is a major business risk,” said James Thornton, chief executive of the environmental law organisation ClientEarth, which helped coordinate the resolutions. “BP and Shell hold our financial and environmental future in their hands. They must do more to face the risks of climate change. Investors can help them by voting for these shareholder resolutions.” The co-filers of the resolution include local authority pensions funds in the EU and US as well as UK ones, such as Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Lambeth, the Environment Agency, the Church of England and the Methodist Church. “The financial risks of climate change are greater in scale and closer in time than most investors realise,” said Howard Covington, former chief executive of New Star Asset Management. “These resolutions help contain those risks at minimal cost. Investors have every reason to support them.” A BP spokesman said: “We continue to have constructive discussions with these and other shareholders on these points. The shareholder resolution is being filed for our 2015 AGM [in April], and we will carefully consider it and respond appropriately before the meeting.” Exxon Mobil responded to a similar shareholder challenge in 2014 by stating that it believed it was “highly unlikely” that governments would succeed in their aim of cutting carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Shell’s response to the same concerns was to state “there is a high degree of confidence that global warming will exceed 2C by [2100].” The 2C limit is widely seen as the threshold of dangerous climate change. BP and Shell were targeted by the new shareholder resolutions because they have the biggest carbon footprints of all the companies listed on the London stock exchange. The resolutions also challenge the companies to reduce their own emissions and invest in renewable energy. Financial experts, including the Bank of England, Goldman Sachs, Standard and Poor’s and Axa IM, have warned of the risk climate change policies pose to fossil fuel companies. Coal, oil and gas companies are also under attack from a fast-growing campaign that aims to stigmatise them by persuading investors to dump their fossil fuel shares, a call backed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and others. Some argue that engaging with fossil fuel companies is a more effective tactic than divestment. But Jonathon Porritt, one of the UK’s most esteemed environmentalists who spent years working on sustainability projects with BP and Shell, last week said engagement was now futile because “hydrocarbon supremacists” at the companies had successfully ousted reformers wanting to diversify into green energy. • This article was amended on 21 January 2015.

"European countries should be given binding targets for installing technology to capture and store carbon emissions, according to a new report for the European commission.  The UN’s climate science panel says such technology could have to account for over a fifth of the world’s carbon cuts by 2050 and the new paper, produced by consultants for the EC, says there is a “genuine and urgent” need for it in Europe.  Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an experimental technology that traps emissions produced at power plants to reduce their contribution to climate change. “An EU roadmap for CCS with binding targets for 2030 sends a clear signal of intent to members of the UNFCCC process that the EU’s CO2 ambitions will be realised, thus maintaining a leading position for the EU in the climate debate,” says the EU guideline report, seen by the Guardian.  It calls for CCS roadmaps to be developed by EU countries and for the commission to prepare a list of potential CCS storage sites.  Graeme Sweeney, chair of the European Technology Platform for Zero Emissions Power said that CCS goals had to be ambitious. “We should put something in the order of 220m tonnes of CO2 underground across the EU by 2030,” he told the Guardian. “Perhaps three quarters of that should come from the power sector and at least a quarter from industrial sources such as steel, cement and aluminium.” Sweeney, a former CO2 adviser to Shell, also called for a “parity of policy” in public funding for CCS and proven carbon-cutting technologies such as renewables and energy efficiency.  The commission has not set binding 2030 targets for either renewables or energy savings. Some environmentalists fear that CCS could encourage fossil fuel extraction to continue unabated, locking-in future emissions, and displacing other low carbon investments.  But Simon Bennett, a CCS analyst for the International Energy Agency said that it was important to reject “unnecessary favouritism” in low carbon policies, although he stopped short of calling for equal funding for CCS.  “We see that CCS remains a critical technology if we are to achieve global climate targets,” he told the Guardian. “We think that now is a good time for the EU to reflect and bring forward policies that will give industry and EU stakeholders confidence that CCS is a valuable and investable technology for Europe.” The UK government and some fossil fuels companies have lobbied hard for a technology-neutral approach that would allow more public money to kickstart the CCS industry.  Globally, CCS demonstration projects have fallen short of predicted results. In Europe, the commission had expected 12 large CCS plants to be working in Europe by now, but only two are so far operational – both in Norway – and just 13 exist in the world.  Most of these are associated with Enhanced Oil Recovery, a technique that pumps liquefied carbon into depleted oil and gas fields to extract the last remaining fossil fuels, before the fields are capped. The report recommends making existing data on oil and gas fields available to enhance the CCS exploration phase.  Environmentalists welcomed a recommendation in the report for the commission to investigate the feasibility of a US-style emissions performance standard in Europe that would be compatible with Europe’s carbon trading scheme. “The commission now has no more excuses to further delay a much needed debate on the role of this policy for power plants,” said Darek Urbaniak, a WWF energy policy officer. “This will not only prevent lock-ins of the worst polluting infrastructure but also providea clear investment signal for the decarbonisation of the power sector.”"

"The unlikely combination of Pharrell Williams and Al Gore have announced what they hope to be the largest global campaign in history, in the form of a second round of Live Earth concerts to promote awareness of climate change. The concerts will take place across all seven continents – including Antarctica – on 18 June. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the pair were joined by producer Kevin Wall to unveil an event aiming for a global television audience of 2 billion across 193 television networks. Williams, who is the event’s creative director, did not reveal any details of who would be performing at the stadium shows, saying he was keeping surprises in store, but said: “Instead of just having people perform, we literally are going to have humanity harmonise all at once.” Williams recalled playing Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro in 2007, describing it as “a ball”. However, he said, “You would have pundits and comedians who didn’t understand global warming and we were often ridiculed. We wanted to do something very different this time.” Williams’s commitment to raising awareness of climate change is longstanding. When he collaborated with Madonna on the 2007 single Hey You, 25 cents from each of the first million downloads was donated to the Alliance for Climate Protection. A promotional clip shown before Williams spoke offered a caption promising 100 artists in the seven shows. Each event will last from four to six hours. Wall said: “The power of music is unique, because it’s borderless, without language, Pharrell will use that power. When you combine music with a message, you can effect change.” The European leg of the event will take place in Paris, ahead of the 2015 UN climate change conference in the French capital, scheduled for December. The organisers say that 1o2 broadcasters have so far signed up to carry the event. At the first Live Earth event – also organised by Gore and Wall – on 7 July 2007, more than 150 acts performed in 11 locations around the world. The concerts were used as the launchpad for a seven-point pledge that invited attendees: The concerts were broadcast to more than 130 countries. Though the coverage was watched by 19 million people in the US, and won a then-record online audience of more than 8 million viewers, the event was not a ratings success in the UK, with a peak audience of about 4.5 million. That was attributed to a combination of good weather, live Wimbledon coverage, and the fact that it came just six days after the Concert for Diana, which had attracted a TV audience three times larger.  The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis was lukewarm about the London concert, writing: “There are moments of total bafflement: even with the lyrics changed to reference climate change, there’s a certain majestic inappropriateness about David Gray and Damien Rice singing Que Sera Sera. What there isn’t is any real emotional heft, or urgency, or sense of event.” Among the acts who appeared at the 2007 concerts were: Genesis, the Black Eyed Peas, Metallica, the Beastie Boys (all London), Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Bon Jovi, the Police (all New York), Angélique Kidjo, Baaba Maal (both Johannesburg), Linkin Park, Rihanna (both Tokyo), Snoop Dogg and MIA (both Hamburg)."
"Our coastal seas play a much bigger role in our lives than simply providing a nice backdrop to a fish and chip supper on the beach and the occasional paddle when the weather allows. The sea close to the coastline is known as the shelf sea and it extends out until the seabed reaches a depth of 200 metres. In the UK our widest shelf sea reaches 300km from the mainland. These shallow shelf seas make up only 5% of the world’s oceans but 15-20% of all life in the ocean lives here. They remain mysterious. “We are not entirely sure how the shelf seas can sustain quite so much biological growth,” says Professor Jonathan Sharples from the University of Liverpool. “They must receive nutrients from the deep ocean to fuel this growth, but we don’t know how this happens.” Whatever the reason, these shallow seas sustain 90% of the world’s fisheries and are one of the most important ecosystems on Earth. As well as helping to supply our national dish, these shelf seas play an important but not completely understood role in controlling the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. In the same way as trees and vegetation on land, shelf seas can suck out CO2 from the atmosphere like a pump. There are two parts to the shelf sea CO2-zapping machine. “First, CO2 dissolves in the surface of the ocean if the concentration of CO2 in the sea is less than in the atmosphere,” says Dr Joanne Hopkins from the National Oceanography Centre. “You could think of this as the reverse of bubbles escaping when you open a fizzy drinks bottle – because the concentration of CO2  in the air is less than in the bottle.” The other important part of the system is the micro-organisms themselves, which the shelf seas are teeming with.  If you were to take a swim in the sea and accidentally gulp some water you would swallow thousands of micro-organisms called plankton, which amazingly, given their minute size, are a crucial food source for whales. There are two types of plankton: phytoplankton (tiny marine plants) and zooplankton (tiny marine animals). One thousand of the smallest phytoplankton would measure 1mm, while typical zooplankton are 1-5mm in length. Plankton make sea water look murky and this biological material is rather romantically known as “marine snow”. As phytoplankton grow they take up CO2  and convert it to organic carbon and oxygen, in the same way as a leaf does by photosynthesis. “Half of the oxygen we breathe comes from forests, the other half from these tiny marine plants,” says Sharples. “The zooplankton then eat the organic carbon that the phytoplankton are made of.” “The oceans remove about one-third of the total carbon we put into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuels, and shelf seas play a disproportionately high role because of their high biological activity,” says Dr Louise Darroch from the British Oceanographic Data Centre. “We want to understand how plankton extract CO2  from the atmosphere and how their ability to remove CO2  may be sensitive to changes in our climate.” In order to tackle this important question, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs have funded a project called Shelf Sea Biogeochemistry which will take measurements throughout shelf seas in a number of expeditions over the next year. Sharples, Hopkins and Darroch returned from one of these surveys just before Christmas. “Our research expedition took us to the Celtic Sea aboard the UK’s newest research vessel, the RRS Discovery,” says Sharples. “The expedition was 25 days long with no sight of land. The ship carries 50 people, roughly half of them scientists and half crew. At 100 metres long, the ship is capable of working in most weathers, though seasickness can be a bit of a problem for the first few days as we all get used to the motion.” The research involved measuring the concentration of nutrients and organic material in the water, collection of sediment from the seafloor and monitoring changes in the temperature and saltiness of the water. A range of instruments was used – including autonomous gliders that measure temperature and water turbulence, and are controlled remotely by someone sitting comfortably onshore – as well as “snowcatchers”. “Snowcatchers are huge plastic tubes, as tall as a room and one metre in diameter, that are lowered beneath the sea surface to a particular depth where they are closed, capturing the water around them along with all the marine snow floating in it,” says Hopkins. Once up on deck, scientists can investigate how plankton – and importantly, zooplankton faeces – can settle. “Particles in the ocean sink, taking with them lots of carbon that was removed from the atmosphere. It’s what happens to these particles and the carbon they carry that forms the basis of a large component of our work,” says Darroch. If organic material sinks quickly, the carbon reaches the seabed before dissolving, and under the right conditions it can be locked up long-term in the deep marine realm. If undisturbed it will remain there, and this is how fossil fuels form – if the right conditions prevail over millions of years. Studies like this will provide a better understanding of how much CO2  is removed from the atmosphere in shelf seas today. Once we know this we can more effectively model how future changes in climate will affect this ecosystem, and the waters that we rely on so heavily for energy, food and recreation."
"Australia has come 12th on an index that ranks wealthy nations according to how their policies affect poorer countries, performing strongly on trade but placed second to last on its stance on the environment. The 2014 commitment to development index, compiled by the US thinktank the Center for Global Development (CGD), found Australia was second only to New Zealand on trade policies due to the low tariffs on imports from developing countries. Australia was also praised for its role in peacekeeping efforts.  However, the report stated: “On the negative side, Australia has the highest greenhouse gas emissions, high fossil fuel production, low gas taxes, and low government spending on research and development, all of which drags down its final score.” Of the 27 wealthy nations analysed – comprising countries in western and southern Europe, north America and Japan and South Korea – only Canada was ranked worse than Australia on the environment. Australia is mid-table for its foreign aid contribution and foreign investment, with relatively high rankings for security and migration. Australia’s ranking for technology investment was in the bottom third. Overall, Denmark was placed first in the index due to its foreign aid contribution, encouragement of research and development and investment in developing countries. Sweden was second, with Finland rounding off a Scandinavian top three. Australia, which came 12th last year, was placed ahead of the US, Japan and Germany, but behind the UK, France and New Zealand. The commitment to development index has been compiled each year since 2003, ranking countries on policies that affect the 5 billion people who live in poorer countries. Marc Purcell, the executive director of the Australian Council for International Development, the peak body for aid agencies, said Australia’s performance on foreign aid was worse than illustrated in the report. In December, the government decided to cut $3.7bn from the foreign aid budget, on top of the $7.6bn cut, over five years, announced in the budget.  “This report doesn’t take into account those massive cuts, so Australia should be lower,” Purcell told Guardian Australia. “We are dropping behind other countries on foreign aid and we will be at our lowest ever level in a few years’ time. You only have to look at the UK, which has increased its commitment to helping the poorest in the world to see how far backwards Australia is moving. “Australia’s aid program is the major tool for soft diplomacy and actually achieving poverty alleviation. The government has taken a wrecking ball to poverty alleviation efforts over the past year.”  Purcell said Australia could improve its ranking by lifting its humanitarian refugee intake to 20,000 people and by developing a market-based system to lower carbon emissions. “It’s widely recognised that Australia doesn’t have a credible position on climate change and we will have to lift our game,” he said. “Australia has to start rebuilding its aid budget, gain a credible position on climate change and increase its refugee intake. Then you’d see Australia in the top 10.” While Australia has signed free trade deals with China, Japan and South Korea over the past year, Purcell said a global trade agreement was needed to help people in developing countries. “Wealthy countries have significant barriers when it comes to products of developing countries and a global trade agreement is the only way to see improvements,” he said. “Bilateral trade agreements are really peripheral to this.” The Center for Global Development said the world’s richest countries could all do more to create more coherent, development-friendly policies. “We should stop thinking of development policies as sacrifices that rich countries need to make for poor countries”, said Owen Barder, the director of CGD’s Europe office and author of the index. “It is in all our interests to collect taxes that are due; generate and spread new ideas and knowledge that enrich all our lives; protect our planet; build institutions that make our world safer and fairer; and from a fair and open trading system. What gets measured gets done – in 2015 the world must agree how to measure progress on these issues.” The CGD identified three major international summits in 2015 that could be used to improve matters – a gathering to discuss the replacement for the expired millennium development goals, a new framework for sustainable development targets and a crunch meeting in Paris to thrash out a deal to tackle climate change."
"The Australian government’s marine research agency is looking to genetically alter species of coral to help them cope with rising sea temperatures, as new modelling showed the coverage of living corals on the Great Barrier Reef could decline to less than 10% if warming continued. Scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science have partnered with the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology to look at how “assisted evolution” may help corals more quickly adapt to climate change. These studies are some of the first conservation-based, non-commercial uses of genetic modification.  A study modelling the prospects of the reef using a decade of data found there was a “very high likelihood” of coral cover plummeting below 10%, with corals replaced by sponges and algae as temperatures increased. This would take the Great Barrier Reef beyond what previous studies suggested was a key “tipping point” that would threaten the reef’s ability to recover and grow. Such a reduction, the study suggested, could occur with just 1C to 2C of further warming in areas of the reef already experiencing pressure from other impacts such as fishing and pollution. This amount of warming is virtually locked in due to the current amount of greenhouse gas emissions. “The Great Barrier Reef used to be one of the more pristine examples of reefs globally, but it has suffered a decline and will continue to do so if action isn’t taken,” said report co-author Jennifer Cooper, a James Cook University PhD student who worked on the study with scientists from the UK and the US.“Our model showed that reducing the impact of other human threats to the reef, such as overfishing and pollution, did mitigate coral decline. However, if temperature increases more than 2C the benefit of lowering threat levels may not be enough to stop further coral loss.  “This suggests that climate change, and more specifically sea surface temperature increase, is an important driver of change on the reef.”   The stark warning on the reef’s future prospects follows a period of decline that has seen coral cover drop to 14% – half of what it was 30 years ago. Climate change, pollution and a plague of coral-eating starfish have been identified as the main causes of the deterioration.  Aims is now looking at radical new ways of helping Great Barrier Reef corals deal with the rapid rate of warming and acidification of the oceans.   Initial work has begun at the Australian institute’s sea simulator in Townsville, Queensland, where different types of coral were picked shortly before their annual spawning and matched via IVF to create new hybrids. Scientists reared the coral larvae and then settled them to assess their growth into juveniles. Coral from the central part of the Great Barrier Reef has been crossed with coral from the colder reaches of the southern reef to see if the resulting hybrid was more resilient in higher temperatures. Scientists are also looking at whether they can alter the microbial communities, the algae that live within coral tissue, so they can adapt to climate change. It is hoped the research can speed up the evolutionary process so that corals can cope with the almost unprecedented rate of warming in the oceans. While corals can adapt to different temperatures, it usually takes thousands of years before they can evolve within gradually changing climates. Dr Madeleine van Oppen, a senior principal research scientist at Aims, told Guardian Australia: “We can create genetic diversity and new genetic variations, and then let natural selection pick and do the rest.”  “We are trying to accelerate the process of what happens in nature, to help them to cope better. This is theoretically possible. “We want to spend the next five years experimenting, to find out which manipulations work best. It’s an important area to invest in. We need these methods available in case we want to implement them. If we don’t, we may be too late if the situation does get bad. “The health and coral cover of the reef has declined over the last decade, it’s a great concern.” Scientists are increasingly looking at new ways to mitigate the impact of warming seas, such as shading corals, in case emissions are not radically cut to stave off the worst of climate change. Unesco’s world heritage committee will consider whether to list the reef as “in danger” in June. On Monday, the Australian government submitted a report to Unesco that argued the listing was not justified due to its efforts to reverse the reef’s decline."
"The mild winters experienced in western Europe compared with similar latitudes in Canada are caused by the conveyor belt of warm water that transports heat from the tropics past Britain to the Norwegian Sea. Alarm that this current, known popularly as the Gulf Stream, may slow down or stop because of climate change has led to international efforts to monitor its flow and temperature.  Measurements began in 2004, so it is too early to assess trends, partly because the water temperature does vary from year to year. This has a direct effect on the British winter, but the surprising part is that it can cause very cold winters to come in pairs. The severe winters of 2009-10 and 2010-11 occurred when vast areas of high pressure over the Arctic were accompanied by a band of low pressures immediately to the south. These conditions coincided with large reductions in the strength of the conveyor transporting heat to Europe. Cold water left over from the first winter, trapped below the surface during the summer, resurfaced during the next winter causing a second bout of severe weather. Scientists from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton studied past records and found two similar patterns in 1969-70 and 1978-79. In both cases the pairs of cold winters appear to be caused by a reduction in the heat and flow of the Gulf Stream. The research will help predict future pairs of severe winters but also gives a disturbing vision of what would happen if this warm current fades away altogether."

"A major survey of US opinions has revealed that huge numbers of people reject Darwinian evolution, consider GM foods unsafe to eat, and doubt that human activity is warming the planet. The report by the Pew Research Center in Washington DC was conducted with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and sought to compare the opinions of a cross-section of the US public with those held by the AAAS’s scientific members.  Published in the journal Science, the survey found that 31% of the US public believed that humans had existed in their present form since the beginning, with a further 24% stating that humans had evolved under the guiding hand of a supreme being. In contrast, only 2% of AAAS scientists said humans had not evolved in their time on Earth. The proportion of the public who believed evolution had happened through natural processes, as described by Charles Darwin more than 150 years ago, was only slightly greater than a third at 35%. The survey drew on phone interviews with 2,002 US adults chosen to be representative of the nation, and online questions of 3,748 US-based members of the AAAS. The US has embraced genetically modifed crops, with 69m hectares (170.4m acres) given over to their cultivation, but the survey suggests the technology is still regarded as contentious by a significant portion of US society. A striking 57% of the public surveyed by Pew believed that GM foods were unsafe to eat. The overwhelming view of the scientists, was that the food was safe, with 88% having no concerns about eating GM. Perhaps the most contentious issue the survey touched on was climate change, where only half of the population agreed with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change view that climate change was mostly driven by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels. Nearly half said there was either no good evidence for global warming, or that the recent warming of the Earth was due to natural climate variability. Scientists and the broader public disagreed most strongly about the safety of GM foods, though their views differed substantially on global warming too, with 87% of scientists believing that climate change was mostly caused by human activity. Alan Leshner, the chief executive of the AAAS, said the survey revealed a worrying gulf between the opinions held by scientists and the general public. “There is a disconnect between the way in which the public perceives the state of science and science’s position on a variety of issues,” he said. “And that’s a cause of concern.” Cary Funk, lead author of the report, said the number of issues that scientists and the public disagreed on, and the amount to which they disagreed, were both surprising. One of the few issues the two groups did agreed on was that the International Space Station had been a good investment for the country. There were some other areas where scientists and the public shared concerns. Both delivered damning verdicts on US science education, the K-12 primary and secondary school system. Among the general public, 68% considered US science education average or below average, and an overwhelming proportion of scientists, 84%, agreed with them. In some cases, a poor science education was at the heart of the differences in opinion, Leshner said. “Sometimes it’s simply a lack of understanding, sometimes it’s an economic or a politicial issue, and sometimes it’s a conflict between, say, core religious belief, or core values, and what science is showing,” he said. “In all of these cases, science is being trumped by these other factors and scientists need to do something to turn that around.” “It’s not about whether the public is dumb or not. It’s partly a function of the American educational system that does a terrible job ... at educating young people in science, math and technology,” he added. Perhaps reflecting a common scepticism over climate change, the survey found greater support among the public for fracking and offshore drilling than among the scientists. Enthusiasm for building more nuclear power plants was far higher among the scientists than the public, with 65% versus 45% in favour. In an accompanying editorial, Leshner issued a call to arms, urging scientists to strike up “respectful dialogues” with groups in community clubs, science museums and religious institutions. “The opinion gap must not be allowed to swell into an unbridgeable chasm,” he warned. “We need to have what scence is showing be represented accurately and for people to at least have that in their toolbox when they make their own decisions,” Leshner said. “It works against the benefit of humankind for people to have distorted views of what the actual facts are.”"

"Age: 68. Appearance: Very like a clock. What time is it? Three minutes to Blammo. Sorry? Three minutes to the End of Days, Apocalypse o’clock, Rapture-thirty. Is that GMT? It is if GMT stands for Goodbye Mankind Time. According to the Doomsday Clock, armageddon is at hand. Rats, I just bought theatre tickets. Do I have time to tell my line manager he’s a cock? You might want to hold off on that. The Doomsday Clock is but a symbolic measure of the relative probability of us being wiped out, with midnight representing global catastrophe. Who sets this Doomsday Clock? The Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in Chicago, a team that includes 17 Nobel prize winners. So it’s the nuclear threat they’re concerned with? It used to be exclusively nuclear, but since 2007 they’ve also reckoned with climate change. Is three minutes to midnight the closest we’ve come to the Big Rip? Not quite. In the 19 times they’ve adjusted the clock since 1947, the worst reading was 11:58, back in 1953 when the United States decided to develop the hydrogen bomb. But three minutes to 12 still sounds terrible. It does indeed. The clock’s just been moved forward two whole minutes, and it hasn’t read 11:57 since 1983, a period of heightened cold war tension. What’s the cause for the latest alarm? Greenhouse gas emissions and the nuclear arms race “pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity,” said Kennette Benedict, executive director of the bulletin. And I thought we were doing so well with all that. Think again: widespread nuclear modernisation programmes are underway, and £660bn is being invested annually in fossil fuel infrastructure. What’s the furthest we’ve been from Doomsday, clockwise? Seventeen minutes to midnight, back in 1991, when the US and USSR signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, just before the Soviet Union collapsed. Those were the days. Yes. It was much easier planning a spring wardrobe when you knew there was going to be a spring. Do say: “This sober warning must spur our leaders to take decisive action on nuclear proliferation and global warming.” Don’t say: “Hit snooze, will you?”"

"Environmental campaigners are calling for people to declare their love for the planet on 14 February – Valentine’s Day. The Climate Coalition, made up of more than 100 UK organisations campaigning for action on climate change, is asking people to submit photos of things they love that they fear losing due to the effects of climate change. Submissions so far include photos of rivers, coral reefs, wildlife and “the changing of the seasons”.  The UN has acknowledged that people in developing countries will be among those most affected by climate change, with a gradual rise in sea levels, higher temperatures and more unpredictable rains. The coalition’s campaign comes after the UN Development Programme head, Helen Clark, called for world leaders to acknowledge the impact climate change is having on the fight against poverty. Mohamed Adow, senior climate change adviser at Christian Aid, a member of the coalition, said the campaign was an opportunity to capture the attention of world leaders in the lead-up to UN climate talks in Paris in December. “This year is an important opportunity for tackling the ever-increasing threat of climate change,” Adow said. “The Climate Coalition’s show the love campaign aims to make sure that the government and big business know that people around the world care about climate change.  “The campaign aims to show politicians who are embarking on a general election campaign that tackling climate change is important to us because it will affect the things we love most, like our lifestyles, our children’s futures, our hobbies, passions, safety and wellbeing, both here and globally.” We’d like to hear from you – what treasured things in your community could be affected by climate change? It may be a feature of your local environment, something your community relies on, or something more abstract. Upload your photos and stories via GuardianWitness and we’ll choose our favourites to share on the site. If you’re unable to upload photos, share your thoughts on how climate change could affect life in your community."
"It isn’t news to anyone that global temperatures are rising. Last month was the warmest December the world has seen in 135 years. Last year was the warmest year on record: according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the average combined temperature of land and ocean surfaces was 1.24°F about the 20th century average. Yet, as you may have noticed or read, it’s been snowing on the east coast of the United States – a lot. And that too is the result of what we call “global warming”.  It seems to be counterintuitive. Aren’t we worried about melting ice? Yes. Isn’t snowpack diminishing high in the mountains, where it matters most? Yes. But it is also true that in some places in the world – and the northern United States is one of them – dramatic winter snowstorms are exactly what scientists expect from climate change. Snow, after all, counts as precipitation. And the International Panel on Climate Change says that it’s “very likely” that, as the world warms up, “extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent” in North America. Warmer global temperatures mean more moisture gets sucked into the atmosphere, and at some point, that moisture comes down – come rain or come snow, you might say. Climate scientists don’t like to attribute any one nasty storm to climate change. (It is possible, but it’s a huge task to crunch all the necessary data and only a handful of studies have tried.) But they do know that winter storms in the northeast US have indeed been increasing in frequency and intensity. As Mashable’s Andrew Freedman points out, five of New York City’s top 10 snowfalls happened in the past 15 years. Record snowstorms can occur during warm years, too, one study found: while the researchers documented an increase in extreme regional snowstorms over five decades, they noted that about a third of those storms happened during years that were warmer than average. Snow days used to be welcome fun. But because winters are getting warmer, average snowfall over a whole season is often down. And whatever snow does fall often melts more quickly than it did in the past. So, even after a massive snow fall, we don’t get much time to enjoy its pleasures – digging out igloos once the storm has passed, pretending we’re Laura Ingalls Wilder and trying to make maple candy in the snow, sledding down that one big hill. Big snowstorms instead just leave long-lasting scars. That’s particularly true on the east coast, where flooding and storm surges can threaten beaches – the heart and soul of the American summer. Living inland, you might not normally associate a snowstorm with a flooded basement. But that’s what people who are close to the water need to be prepared for during a storm like this one, when the winds whip up waves taller than 10 feet and tides surge higher than normal. On Monday, the National Weather Service was predicting “severe beach erosion” in particular for Massachusetts, which just released a report on coastal erosion inspired by damage inflicted by winter storms in 2013. Shorelines are already prone to erosion during winter months, but this storm could wash away enough sand to cause new inlets to break through barrier beaches. This is akin to the coastal damage other parts of the Northeast saw during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 – high winds and water are a bad combination, no matter what time of year they happen. This will happen even as on mountaintops snow is melting earlier, ponds are no longer freezing over for the winter, and the world is getting warmer. We call this “climate change” now, instead of global warming, because the phenomenon is so full of contradictions. A warmer average temperature doesn’t mean that snow will disappear instantly; a warm winter can still have a record snow storm and beaches are in danger in the winter, too. The reality of climate change is that it doesn’t stop just because winter comes. Warming up the world is tipping all of its weather systems out of whack, and it seems like every year some new record is broken. So starting 2015 with a record-breaking snowstorm won’t necessarily keep it from also being one of the hottest years on record. That’s just the kind of can’t-win contradiction that we’ve created by messing with the environment of a perfectly good planet."

"It is nearly 27 years now since a Nasa scientist testified before the US Senate that the agency was 99% certain that rising global temperatures were caused by the burning of fossil fuels. And the Senate still has not got it – based on the results of three symbolic climate change votes on Wednesday night. The Senate voted virtually unanimously that climate change is occurring and not, as some Republicans have said, a hoax – but it defeated two measures attributing its causes to human activity. Only one Senator, Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, voted against a resolution declaring climate change was real and not – as his fellow Republican, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma once famous declared – a hoax. That measure passed 98 to one. But the Senate voted down two measures that attributed climate change to human activity – and that is far more important. Unless Senators are prepared to acknowledge the causes of climate change, it is likely they will remain unable and unwilling to do anything about it. Democrats had planned the symbolic, “sense of the Senate” votes as a way of exposing the Republicans’ increasingly embarrassing climate change denial. Further climate votes will come up on Thursday. Two were tacked on as Democratic amendments to a bill seeking to force approval of the contentious Keystone XL pipeline – despite a veto threat from Barack Obama. The third, introduced by a Republican, affirmed climate change was real but expressed support for the Keystone XL pipeline. The first vote, introduced by the Rhode Island Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, said only: “To express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax.” But Republicans have grown canny about being called out as climate deniers. For the Republican party leadership the current preferred phrase now is: “I am not a scientist” – which casts doubt but avoids outright denial. However, Obama made that line a butt of his jokes in the State of the Union address.  Inhofe, the veteran climate denier in the Senate and incoming chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, stunned a number of Democrats when he asked to co-sponsor the amendment.  For a moment it looked like the ultimate climate denier had had a change of heart – but no. Inhofe was ready to acknowledge climate change was occurring but he was adamant it had nothing to do with human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels. “Climate is changing and climate has always changed and always will,” Inhofe told the Senate. “The hoax is that there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate. Man can’t change climate.” The quick thinking from Inhofe now leaves Wicker, the new chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as the only Republican to still embrace the entire idea of climate change as a hoax. Wicker did not immediately comment on his vote. But he has regularly said that there is no firm evidence of global temperature rise. An amendment introduced by the North Dakota Republican and Keystone bill sponsor, John Hoeven, attributed climate change to human activity, but said the pipeline would have no significant impacts. Fifteen Republicans voted in favour - but Hoeven winded up voting against his own measure. The vote failed to gather the 60 needed votes, falling 59-40.  The final climate amendment, introduced by the Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz, went further, stating: “human activity significantly contributes to climate change.” Only five Republicans supported it – Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Ted Cruz of Texas – all thought of as leading Republican contenders for the 2016 presidential race – voted against. The bill was defeated 50-49. Environmental groups claimed a partial victory – at least Republicans were admitting climate change was indeed occurring. “I’m hoping that after many years of darkness and blockade that this can be a first little vote beam of light through the wall that will allow us to at least start having an honest conversation about what carbon pollution is doing to our climate and to our oceans,” Whitehouse told the Senate. But the Senate has acknowledged the existence of climate change before and, as long ago as 2005, voted to affirm that human activity was its driver. Since 2005, there has been an entire decade of accumulating evidence in real-time of the effects of climate change – and its threat in the future. “We are worse off than 2005,” said Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University who writes about the climate denial movement. “The resolution saying that anthropogenic climate change is real and we need to act passed in 2005, and failed in 2015,” he said in an email. “A similar resolution failed today. 10 years, more certain science, less political will.”"
"Exactly one year ago, fierce winter weather was causing havoc across the UK. Large parts of the Somerset Levels were submerged, Wales had been battered by coastal storms, residents in the Thames estuary were on red-alert, and Cornwall was cut off by rail, as the line at Dawlish collapsed into the sea. Although storms are an integral part of the great British winter, these floods were remarkable, leading the news agenda for weeks on end and causing disruption to thousands of people’s lives. In a changing climate, floods like these will happen more often, and they will become more intense. But did people make the link between the flooding and climate change?  A new study released today by the Understanding Risk team at Cardiff University provides some fascinating answers to this question. In the months following the flooding, a nationally representative survey of around 1,000 people was conducted, asking about people’s views on climate change, on the floods, and whether they saw a link between the two. The results were striking. Most respondents (85%) felt that flooding had become more common, and that it would continue to get worse in the future. At the same time, scepticism about climate change was at its lowest for 10 years: very few people disputed the link between human activity and climate change. Two-thirds of respondents thought the floods were a sign that the impacts of climate change were already beginning to be felt, while an even clearer majority (72%) agreed that the floods were a sign of what we should expect in the future from climate change. As would be expected, people also pointed to other important factors (such as insufficient investment, and poor river dredging) to explain the damage caused by the flooding. But climate change featured surprisingly strongly in the mix. So did the flooding act as a trigger, focusing people’s minds on the risks of climate change? A standard survey would be unable to answer this question. Tempting as it may be to make this inference, it is crucial not to confuse correlation with causation: perhaps people who were already concerned about climate change were more inclined to make a link to the floods, rather than the other way around. But in this study, the nationwide survey was compared to a second group who lived in one of five areas of the country that had been directly affected by the flooding. This allowed the researchers to examine the impact that “being flooded” had on people’s attitudes towards climate change. Again, the findings were striking. People who had experienced flooding were not only more concerned about climate change, but also more likely to report that they had become more concerned about climate change in the past 12 months. In the national sample, around 15% of people spontaneously named climate change as one of the three most serious issues facing the country – in the flood-affected sample, this rose to nearly 30%. When asked whether their local area was likely to be affected by climate change, 61% of respondents who had been flooded said yes, compared to only 15% of the national sample. It is perhaps not surprising that floods of this magnitude would leave a mark on the national consciousness. But the fact that the flooding also impacted on people’s views about climate change is important. And from a communications perspective, the findings offer some crucial signposts for how to engage the public more effectively. Firstly, events like these provide a chance to build public support for policies that will reduce climate risks in the future – provided communities are approached in a sensitive and respectful way. Climate change is a notoriously intangible risk for people to grasp. But when floods bring the problem closer to home, there is a window of opportunity for having a national conversation about climate change that is not usually open. The survey findings also offer some guidance about what form this conversation could take. There were consistently high levels of agreement with statements about the increasing prevalence of flooding, attribution of the floods to climate change, the need to be better prepared in the future and the importance of supporting an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions. To illustrate how these findings are relevant to public engagement, consider the following example narrative – the sort of statement that a campaigner, a policymaker or a community activist might make: “It’s clear that the climate is changing – many of us have noticed the signs. In fact, after the economy, immigration and the NHS, climate change is one of the most serious issues facing the UK. Most people sense that flooding is already getting worse, and fear that it will keep getting worse in the future. The floods of 2014 show us what we can expect from climate change, but we were unprepared and understandably, people felt angry. The government should take steps to protect people from flooding in the future, by supporting an international agreement to limit carbon emissions in Paris later this year.” It is a powerful message - but every single sentence reflects the sentiments expressed by survey respondents, and draws on the exact wording of questions where there was agreement by more than 70% of those surveyed. Because of the probabilistic and often indirect link between weather and climate, clearly worded statements about cause and effect – or confident predictions about climate impacts in the future – are often problematic for scientists to make. Data on public perceptions cannot overcome the challenges associated with the complexity of the relationship between weather and climate. But the survey findings suggest that appealing to popular opinion on the need to take climate impacts more seriously may be an effective alternative approach. The message for politicians, campaigners and communicators is clear: scepticism is low, and concern about flood risks is high. The argument that climate change is a “vote-loser” is no longer a credible excuse for inaction.

"Shell is set to confront the risk that climate change may pose to its future, after backing a resolution from activist shareholders. The move came on the same day it announced $15bn (£10bn) in cost cutting due to plummeting oil prices and said it wanted to resume drilling for oil in the Arctic.  The resolution, filed by 150 investors who control hundreds of billions of pounds, requires the oil major to test whether its business model is compatible with the pledge by the world’s nations to limit global warming to 2C.   The 2C target means only a quarter of existing, exploitable fossil fuel reserves are burnable, according to a series of recent analyses. That implies trillions of dollars of oil, gas and coal held by investors could become worthless and that continuing exploration for fossil fuels may be pointless.  The resolution, also filed with BP, includes a ban on corporate bonuses for climate-harming activities and a commitment to invest in renewable energy.  “This is a turning point and demonstrates the power of activist strategies to deal with climate change,” said Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, which helped coordinate the resolutions.  “We maintain our commitment to engage with shareholders in this area,” said Shell’s executive vice president JJ Traynor, in a letter to shareholders, in which he asked them to back the resolution. “We look forward to implementing the resolution should it be passed at the AGM.” The proposal will need the support of 75% of shareholders to pass in May. “This is a huge victory for the climate, which demonstrates the power of positive shareholder engagement,” said Elspeth Owens, at environmental legal group ClientEarth, which also helped coordinate the resolutions. “The vast majority of Shell shareholders are now likely to vote in support. This throws down the gauntlet for BP to face up to its climate risk.” Some investors concerned about global warming have chosen to sell off their fossil fuels stocks in a fast-growing campaign of divestment that seeks to stigmatise the companies. They argue that current business models are unsupportable given that over $700bn a year is spent exploring for new oil, gas and coal, despite three-quarters of existing reserves being unburnable if climate change is tackled.  But other investors argue engaging with companies through shareholder resolutions, for example, has more effect. “We think our supportive but stretching shareholder resolutions could help focus attention on this increasingly complex challenge for companies, investors and policy makers,” said Helen Wildsmith, at CCLA, a UK-based fund manager for charities, churches and local authorities, many of whom co-filed the BP and Shell resolutions. “We view Shell’s decision as a potential turning point in investor engagement with the industry on carbon asset risk,” said Andrew Logan, oil & gas program director at the sustainability group Ceres, whose Investor Network on Climate Risk has 110 institutional investors with collective assets of $13 trillion. “However, investors will be closely scrutinizing Shell’s disclosures, particularly in light of its decision today to greenlight drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, one of the highest cost and highest risk projects in its entire portfolio.” Major funds around the world are becoming increasingly concerned that limits on carbon emissions will harm the finances of fossil fuel companies and lead to investors losing money.  One of the largest institutional investors in the world, the $177bn New York State Common Retirement Fund, issued a new warning on Thursday. “We are obviously very concerned about the wellbeing of the fund, which is heavily invested in energy stocks worldwide,” said Pete Grannis, New York State deputy comptroller, whose office is the sole trustee of the fund, which has one million members."
"Sixty-two years ago today, the combination of a severe storm and high spring tide brought catastrophe to the east coast of England, as the water rose to six metres above sea level and overwhelmed the land. The Dutch had it even worse, with the loss of 1,800 lives – they called it the Watersnoodramp, the “flood disaster”. But Suffolk and Essex suffered badly, too, with 307 deaths in all, including 38 at Felixstowe, 37 in Jaywick, and 58 on Canvey Island. A couple of documentaries appeared around the time of the 60th anniversary of the flood but compared with the commemoration of the 2004 Asian tsunami the coverage was modest. There wasn’t the footage; the only survivors with memories of the event were past pension age, and the loss of life was on a smaller scale. But perhaps another factor explains the neglect: resignation to the idea that the North Sea is destined to wreak havoc periodically and that nothing can be done to prevent it. A recent unpublished Environment Agency analysis suggests as much, predicting that 7,000 homes, with a total value of more than £1bn, will be lost over the next century – 800 in the next 20 years. The current consensus is to let them fall into the sea (with no compensation for homeowners), since the cost of protecting them is too great. In some areas a shoreline management policy of “holding the line” or “managed retreat” will muffle the blow. But huge damage will be done in the east, where rising sea levels and a “soft” coastline have already claimed many a clifftop home. Climate change is part of the problem. But it’s no use pretending the problem is new. “This year also,” the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records in 1099, “the sea flood sprung up to such height, and did so much harm, as no man remembered that it ever did before. And this was the first day of the new moon.” Further flood disasters were recorded in 1236, 1251, 1551, 1690, 1703, 1736, 1881, 1897 and on through the 20th century. The most vivid accounts of the 1953 flood came from unlikely sources. One was Hilda Grieve, an archivist in the Essex Record Office, who for her book The Great Tide tracked the tide, hour by hour, as it came down the coast, and drew on a vast collection of witness statements. A handful of these border on the comic – like the firefighter rescuing a woman on Canvey Island who won’t stop talking (“I had to tell her to shut her mouth because the water was up to her neck”). More commonly, they are tragic, like the father remembering the son who died in his arms: “After a while he did not speak any more and appeared to go to sleep.” Another account of the flood, so far unpublished, is the 18,000-word diary kept by PJO Trist, Philip John Owen Trist to give him his full name, who worked for the Ministry of Agriculture and was responsible for the clean-up operation. His remedial work included flying over flooded farmland and surveying the damage: “From Orford to Iken, the flooded level of about 2,400 acres was a pathetic sight … Below the Minsmere cliff, known to thousands who have had tea and bathed there, the shingle beach was almost unrecognisable … Poor Minsmere! Once again she lay drowned in a sea of salt.” Trist had the right name for the job. His diary is full of sadness – for cattle and livestock swept away, for the thousands of rabbits lying dead in the marshes, for the poisoning of arable land by salt water (out of 4,000 acres flooded, only about 200 bore a crop in 1953). But perhaps the key moment comes when he momentarily forgets the “visions of mud and men and water” as he drives through the park at Boulge Hall, near Woodbridge, to the churchyard where Edward FitzGerald lies buried, and imagines “the peace of his lazy days up and down the Deben”. It’s Trist’s way of measuring depredation against a more benign image derived from literature. And there’s certainly no shortage of such images: every British coastline has its legends (of shipwrecks, piracy and selkies) but the stretch from Cromer to Felixstowe is among the most documented – and the most heavily populated with writers. FitzGerald grew up in Suffolk and spent most of his life there. It was in a cottage on the family estate at Boulge Hall that he translated the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám and conjured an alternative notion of the east – not wintry storms and bleakness but camels, desert, a convivial jug of wine. Persia and Woodbridge don’t have much in common but the original poem’s emphasis on mortality (“I came like water and like wind I go”) and its evocation of a paradise in the wilderness resonated with FitzGerald. The translation eventually made him famous, but by then his passion was for sailing rather than literature: he bought a yacht, the Scandal, then a herring-lugger, and would sail from the Deben to Lowestoft or over to Holland. The land felt mean and enclosed to him; society, too. But he loved the open water – and, rather than being buried, would have liked his ashes to be scattered on the sea. Or so WG Sebald claims in The Rings of Saturn, after visiting FitzGerald’s grave during his pilgrimage through East Anglia in the 1990s. The coastal chapters of the journey are eventful: Sebald encounters a herd of swine at Covehithe, sees a couple having sex on the beach below (“the man’s feet twitched like those of one just hanged”), and has a kind of panic attack on Dunwich Heath. But the overall mood is one of melancholy, because the erosions of time and place have destroyed the buildings and aspirations that interest him: “The east stands for lost causes,” he writes, “you can sense the immense power of emptiness.” The nadir comes at Shingle Street, “the most abandoned spot in the entire region, which now consists of just one wretched row of humble houses and cottages and where I have never encountered one single human being.” It’s an unduly bleak view of a place I find haunting and beautiful. But it’s true that the beauty is what WB Yeats would call a “terrible beauty” – not least because of the rumours that began in 1940 and persist to this day of a thwarted German invasion, and the loss of hundreds of lives. Less in doubt is what happened at Dunwich, a once thriving medieval city later reduced by storms and floods to a tiny fishing village (now the only fishing is done by solitary anglers). Dunwich began to decline in 13th and 14th centuries, and there are photos of the last of its eight churches, All Saints, gradually disappearing into the sea between 1904 and 1919. Edward Thomas gives a snapshot on a visit in 1908: Oh Dunwich is beautiful. I am on a heaving moor of heather and close gorse up and down and ending in a sandy cliff about 80 feet perpendicular and the black, peat-strewn fine sand below. On the edge of this 1½ miles away is the ruined church that has half fallen over already. Four arches and a broken tower, pale and airy. George Crabbe remains the most celebrated poet of the Suffolk sea and of its power to destroy lives. But many other poets have written about it since: Frances Cornford, with her “far-off gulls like risen souls”; Alun Lewis, briefly stationed there during the second world war; Andrew Motion, who tells of the legend of the Orford Merman; Anne Beresford, Katrina Porteous, Anthony Thwaite, Michael Hamburger and more. Many novelists, too, have set their fictions on the Suffolk coast, PD James, Ruth Rendell, Esther Freud and Julie Myerson among them. Julia Blackburn is about to publish two books set there – one a long poem in which grief over her husband’s death is offset by descriptions (and photos) of murmurations of starlings above Walberswick, the other a life of the Norfolk fisherman and artist John Craske. Then there are the visitors, with their passing impressions: Carlyle, Hardy, Gissing and – least passingly – Swinburne, whose long poem, By the North Sea, strikes a note of Sebaldian gloom: “A land that is lonelier than ruin,/ A sea that is stranger than death.” Swinburne swamps his poem in such morbidity that he deserves the fun poked at him by Craig Brown, another east coast resident, in one of his clerihews: “Algernon Swinburne/ Let his skin burn./ He forgot the Skin Factor Five/ On a trip to Covehithe.” But he was one of the earliest writers not only to document coastal erosion, but to see it as a metaphor for human mortality: “Like ashes the low cliffs crumble,/ The banks drop down into dust.” In an age of rising sea levels and climate change, the east coast’s vulnerability is ever more apparent, which may be why writers are drawn to it – in a spirit of protection not exploitation. If they can’t shore up actual defences, they can, through language, conserve the cliffs and beaches under attack. As John Donne said, ‘if one clod is washed away, Europe is the less.’ • Blake Morrison’s new collection of poems, Shingle Street, is published by Chatto on Thursday.

"European politicians are expected this week to back by a narrow majority early action to bolster prices on the EU carbon market and sharpen a weapon against climate change that recession has blunted.  Thursday’s vote, one of several legislative stages, will be closely watched by traders.   The Emissions Trading System (ETS) is designed to make polluters pay for their emissions but a surplus of more than 2bn carbon allowances generated by economic crisis has crushed the market.  That means industry can still burn highly polluting fuel, such as coal, at little cost as permits are worth only around €7 per tonne.  Before new rules can enter the statute books, Thursday’s vote in the European Parliament’s industry committee must be followed by another next month in the environment committee, then a plenary parliamentary vote and endorsement from the 28 EU states.  The European Commission, the EU executive, last year proposed putting hundreds of millions of ETS allowances in a Market Stability Reserve (MSR) starting from 2021.  Member states Germany and Britain, however, which want to boost zero carbon power generation, say 2021 is too late and have led the push to get the MSR in place for 2017. Big utilities including Germany’s E.ON also support early action.  “All efforts must be made to have the proposed market stability reserve running already by 2017,” a German government paper circulated by diplomats in Brussels says.  Energy intensive industry and nations such as Poland whose economy relies on coal are likely to oppose that.  The price of carbon permits rose last week after a vice president leading parliamentary negotiations said he had secured a deal in the main political grouping, the European People’s Party, for 2019.  The market took that as a sign that the full parliament will endorse carbon market reform earlier than the Commission has proposed.  Parliamentary sources said lobbying would be intense ahead of each vote, making the individual outcomes hard to predict. But they anticipated the industry committee would narrowly back 2019 and the environment committee would overwhelmingly support 2017.  “If the earlier start date (2017) wins and there is agreement to transfer backloaded (removed) permits straight into the reserve, then I would expect a significant price hike,” one trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  But as the market had already priced in a start before 2021, support for 2019 might have little impact. "

"America’s top environmental official has assured the Vatican that the pope and Barack Obama are singing from the same hymnal when it comes to fighting climate change. In a visit to the Vatican, Gina McCarthy, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), conveyed a message to the pope that Obama shared his view that fighting climate change was a moral obligation.  “I want him to know that the president is aligned with him on these issues and that we are taking action in the United States,” McCarthy told the National Catholic Reporter ahead of the meeting. She went so far as to suggest that Obama was “working with the pope” when it came to climate change. That alliance, between Obama and the pope, followed from the view that leaders have a moral duty to preserve the earth and protect those most at risk from the consequences of climate change, McCarthy said. “I think the most important thing that we can do, working with the pope, is to try to remind ourselves that this is really about protecting natural resources that human beings rely on, and that those folks that are most vulnerable – that the church has always been focused on, those in poverty and low income – are the first that are going to be hit and impacted by a changing climate,” she said. EPA officials said McCarthy used the meeting to applaud the pope’s efforts to fight climate change, and to brief the Vatican on Obama’s plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming. “It was really about the efforts the US is taking on climate change and the need for everyone to be involved both domestically and internationally – both to work with the pope and thank for his efforts on this far,” a spokesperson said. McCarthy did not meet the pope, but was greeted by a quartet of Vatican officials, Monsignor Antoine Camilleri, the undersecretary for relations with states and the ministry’s top environmental official, Paolo Conversi as well as Cardinal Peter Turkson, president of the pontifical council for justice and peace, and his director of environmental affairs, Tebaldo Vinciguerra. The four officials will help prepare a highly anticipated encyclical on the environment and climate change, expected to be published in June or July. On Saturday, McCarthy was due to tour the Vatican’s solar panels, which are on top of the Paul VI hall. The pope said earlier this month that climate change was “mostly” man-made, and he said he hoped the encyclical and a planned address to the UN in September would push leaders to take more “courageous” actions. The EPA administrator was born into an Irish Catholic family from Boston. Her trip to the Vatican, however, was part of a broader mission of putting climate change above partisan politics and persuading the American people to get behind the climate plan. The pillar of the US climate plan – the first rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants are due to be finalised this summer. But they are under attack from Republicans in Congress and industry, who are trying to block or reduce the emissions cuts. “One of the challenges that I think we face in the US is that climate change is very often viewed as a political issue,” McCarthy told reporters ahead of her meetings. “And environmental issues are not political.” She went on: “I think we need to get this out of the political arena and get it back to the arena we work most effectively on: what’s right for our kids, for our families, for public health, and what solutions do we bring to the table that are going to address those?” Obama has no chance of meeting his emissions reductions targets if those rules are stalled or weakened. US officials and foreign diplomats believe an attack on those rules would shake international confidence in climate change negotiations heading towards a conclusion in Paris at the end of the year – putting the global effort to fight climate change in peril, along with that of the US. Over the last 18 months, McCarthy has been doggedly visiting state and local leaders to try to gin up support for the power plant rules. Last week, she visited Aspen to mobilise support from the winter sports industry, which depends on cold weather and snow. Some conservative sections of the church are opposed to Obama’s power plan. “Preservation of the environment and promotion of sustainable development? No problem. But climate change and the blundering malicious environment of the UN? No thanks. The pope can do better,” wrote Thomas Peters, a writer for Catholic Vote."
"There are two fundamental principles that have to underpin any debate about shale gas development in the UK. The first is that fracking cannot go ahead without proper environmental safeguards in place. The second is that the development of shale gas, cannot come at the expense of meeting our legally binding obligation to avoid dangerous climate change. No sensible government can govern in these challenging times without putting climate change at the core of what they do. That’s why Labour has committed to a 2030 decarbonisation target for our power sector and pledged to make climate adaptation a national priority to protect the country from extreme weather caused by climate change. David Cameron however has gone from promising to lead the “greenest government ever”, to ditching the “green crap”. Now he is pursuing shale gas development at any cost. Labour will take a different approach.  That’s why on Monday Labour will force a vote to prevent shale gas developments in the UK unless loopholes in the environmental regulation are closed. It is simple common sense that shale gas extraction cannot go ahead in the UK without a proper system of robust regulation and comprehensive inspection. In Scotland, Jim Murphy has made clear that as First Minister he would use the powers Holyrood already has to block shale gas extraction until the regulation is right and people can be confident it is safe. Over the last three years, Labour has worked with organisations including the RSPB, Friends of the Earth and the Local Government Association, drawing on work by Royal Academy of Engineering and other bodies to produce a list of 13 necessary conditions to reform the regulatory regime for shale gas. The conditions include independent inspection of well integrity, mandatory monitoring for fugitive emissions and a presumption against development in protected areas such as National Parks. They represent a comprehensive approach, based on scientific evidence, to bring coherence to the UK’s regulatory framework. The Tory and Lib Dem opposition to these measures stems from a fanatical faith in the potential benefits of shale gas. These have been misleadingly overhyped at every turn. Just one well has been fracked in the UK – in Poland, they drilled almost 100 wells, only to discover that the resource was not economic to extract. Like many gold rushes, Poland’s shale gas turned out to be a fantasy. The lesson from Poland is that by trying to turn shale gas into a silver bullet for all our energy problems, David Cameron is banking on a resource whose potential in the UK is unknown. Nor would UK shale gas deliver the benefits seen in the US, where widespread production has led to falling prices. The geological, regulatory and market conditions of the UK mean that any gas produced will be more expensive to extract and will be sold at the current European price. David McKay, the former Government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, has rubbished the argument for lower prices. With a regulatory regime that is fit for purpose it is feasible that shale gas could have a positive impact on our security of supply. 8 out of 10 homes still rely on gas for heating – this is not a fuel that we can do away with overnight. In the context of declining North Sea reserves, a new, indigenous source of gas could help to reduce our dependence on imports. The Committee on Climate Change concluded that the development of shale gas could actually lead to a slight decrease in UK emissions, since it is likely to be cleaner than imported Liquefied Natural Gas from Qatar. Labour is clear that any potential benefits cannot come at the expense of our environmental standards. That is why Labour will vote to prevent any developments of shale gas in the UK unless the Tories and Lib Dems concede to the much needed and fundamental reforms of the regulatory regime that Labour have proposed. A future Labour Government won’t allow shale gas development to degrade our natural environment or compromise our climate change commitments."

"The end may not quite be nigh, but according to a bunch of eminent scientists, it is getting nigher. Every year they reset the Doomsday Clock, which represents how far from Armageddon we are. Currently, it’s three minutes to midnight. “The probability of global catastrophe is very high,” says the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in Chicago, which moves the hands back and forth. “And the actions needed to reduce the risks of disaster must be taken very soon.”  I can’t say I entirely trust a clock that was set at a less menacing seven minutes to midnight during the Cuban missile crisis, the closest we’ve ever been to annihilation. Although it’s common to hear people say that the world seems to be a particularly frightening place at the moment, I’m not sure if this is objectively true. The prevalence of the phrase “age of anxiety”, for instance, has been falling almost constantly since the late 1950s, when it was twice as common as it is now. Whether or not our assessment of the current level of danger in the world is correct, it’s not what the scientists cite as the greatest perils that worry us the most. The threat of global warming is higher than ever, but because the consequences still seem distant for most of us, I doubt many people feel anxious about it. That’s what happens with hypothetical threats that don’t bite: eventually they lose their capacity to make us afraid. After climate change, even fewer people now worry about nuclear weapons, the second biggest threat mentioned by scientists. It’s not like the cold war, when Russia and America often seemed intent on mutually assured destruction. When the chain of events that would lead to oblivion are hard to fathom, it’s hard to feel too afraid. The big geopolitical threats that face us are all like this. We know they are there, but only on an intellectual level. As a result, we only get frightened when we think about them, which we naturally ensure we don’t do too often. Those that alarm us the most are not necessarily the most dangerous, but merely the most evident. Terrorism and global pandemics are scarier than concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere because we have a steady stream of incidents that serve as harbingers of worse to come. We say the world is a scary place but it seems few are seriously scared by it. That’s why it is a common comedy trope to have someone go to a therapist and tell them they’re depressed because of the intractable problems in the Middle East. Taking antidepressants because of family or work problems is seen as entirely natural, whereas seeing a shrink to deal with your apprehension that Nigel Farage might enter parliament is not. Our problem is that we are pretty good at dealing with our state-of-the-world anxieties, but bad at dealing with their root causes. Perhaps the growth of positive psychology has unintentionally exacerbated this by making us all more aware of what we can do to worry less, rather than what we can do to make the source of our worries go away. It is, after all, easier to conquer our fears than to vanquish the things we are afraid of. If we genuinely want a less dangerous planet, we ought to be more distrustful of our own fears as reliable barometers of real risk. Instead, let’s make a sober assessment of where the dangers really lie and then set about trying to create a safer world on the basis of what our brains, rather than our guts, tell us. We have much more to fear than fear itself."
" Last year was the warmest on record, and climate change will be high on the agenda during the first full day of events in Davos. Al Gore, the former vice-president of the US, who has described climate change as “the biggest challenge our civilisation faces”, is taking centre stage alongside Pharrell Williams, the pop star who sang “Happy” but who is appearing as creative director of Bionic Yarn, a company that turns fibres from recycled plastic into durable textiles. Gore is participating in other events looking at how business should respond to climate change, alongside Lord Stern, president of the British Academy, and speakers from the insurance company Axa. Other events covering this topic include “Building for the Storm”, asking how governments should respond to climate change. Another session will look at how a comprehensive global climate deal can be achieved.  Conflict is the number-one issue for the political and business elite this year. The rise of Islamic State has awoken fears over failures of national governance and the collapse of nation states.  Several Middle Eastern leaders are in attendance, including Egypt’s president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi; King  Abdullah of Jordan; Haidar al-Abadi, prime minister of Iraq; and Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan region.  The Ukraine crisis is a reminder that “long-forgotten” disputes can flare back into life, the World Economic Foundation says, with widespread consequences for a whole region. Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine, will be looking for support as his country risks defaulting on its debts.  Poroshenko should get support from George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, who is pushing European governments to offer Kiev more help. He will be lobbying the likes of Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s François Hollande and Italy’s Matteo Renzi.  The terror attacks in France this month will also be debated, just days after many heads of government marched in Paris. On Wednesday, the former UK prime minister Tony Blair will take part in a session examining whether religion is a pretext for conflict. Global authorities were slow, at least initially, to respond to the Ebola outbreak and provide resources to the countries affected, according to the organisers at Davos. So what lessons can we learn? Panellists discussing the subject include Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the UN, as well as Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation. Alpha Condé, the president of Guinea, who has faced accusations of being initially slow to respond to Ebola, is also speaking.  The New York Times quoted him recently saying: “While shaving I think of Ebola, while eating I think of Ebola, while sleeping I think of Ebola.”  Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is among those speaking on the topic of “In Tech We Trust”. Eric Schmidt, the boss of Google, is one of this year’s co-chairs while Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Satya Nadella of Microsoft will also be involved in a debate on the future of the digital economy.  Cyber-security should be high on the agenda too, following David Cameron’s controversial suggestion that governments should be given access to encrypted data. Jack Ma, founder of China’s search engine Alibaba, is also a key speaker.  Central banks will be a major topic of conversation in the meeting rooms, coffee shops and bars of Davos this week, as monetary policy in Europe and the US continues to diverge and inflation falls across the global economy.  The shock abolition of Switzerland’s currency gap last week has left many financial firms nursing losses, and reminded us all that 2015 could be a turbulent year in the markets. Thomas Jordan, the Swiss central bank chief who sparked the turmoil, can expect a lively reception. At least seven other central bank chiefs are also attending, including the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. The European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi isn’t attending this year. He will be stuck in Frankfurt handling the ECB’s meeting on Thursday, where a big quantitative easing (QE) programme could be announced.  Earlier that day a debate will take place on the prospect of higher interest rates in the US. Delegates from emerging markets will be pushing American officials to handle the ending of the QE programme responsibly, after seeing “hot money” pour into their economies. They don’t want a repeat of the currency crisis that struck Argentina during last year’s meeting.  Income inequality has featured highly on Davos’s agenda for several years, but progress remains disappointingly slow. The World Economic Foundation sees rising socioeconomic inequality as driving “social fragility”. It reminded delegates that the average income of the richest 10% of nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is now nine times larger than that of the poorest 10%. The global unemployment rate is expected to remain at current levels until 2018, showing the failure to tackle the challenges thrown up by the financial crisis.  Bill and Marissa Gates, and the Oxfam International executive director Winnie Byanyima will be putting the case for more support for developing nations; Byanyima has extra clout as a co-chair of this year’s meeting. The OECD chief Angel Gurría and Guy Ryder of the International Labour Organisation will be lobbying for workers to get a better deal.  The tumble in the oil price to five-year lows means different things for Davos attendees. It’s a bitter blow to exporters, raising political risk in the Middle East and hitting growth in emerging markets. Once he arrives in Switzerland, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, Opec’s secretary general, will face criticism from producers over the cartel’s refusal to cut supplies. Western leaders are more sanguine, welcoming the boost to consumers’ spending power. Environmental groups, though, will be urging oil producers not to drag their feet over green technologies."
"The Trans Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement so significant and important, its details can’t be disclosed. The TPP, sure to make an appearance during tonight’s State of the Union, is a 21st-century trade agreement involving 11 Asian countries along the Pacific Rim, and said to cover 40% of the world’s economy.   The TPP is a subject close to the heart – and the economic plans – of President Obama. In a November trip to Beijing, he urged other world leaders to finalize the agreement, calling it a “high priority” that would strengthen American leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and lead to growth, investment and job prospects for more workers.  The administration has argued that the deal will allow lower tariffs for American exports, in an environment of increasing competition, especially from China. Obama is also touting the deal as a boon for small businesses. When 98% of the US’s exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships will help them create even more jobs, he proclaimed in last year’s State of the Union address. “Listen, China and Europe are not standing on the sidelines. Neither should we.” Right now, American citizens will have to take those promises about the impact of the TPP on faith.  The TPP is one of the largest international trade agreements the US will sign, yet most of it is mired in secrecy. Congress won’t have access to the TPP before it is signed, and the terms won’t be publicly disclosed – ironic since the negotiations include 600 corporate advisers, including representatives of Halliburton and Caterpillar.  A chunk of the trade deal was leaked most recently by a Wikileaks release. “Everything we know about it are from document leaks,” says Maira Sutton, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  That sets light to the anger of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called the TPP “disastrous” and “written behind closed doors by the corporate world”. He denounced its purpose “to protect the interests of the largest multinational corporations at the expense of workers, consumers, the environment and the foundations of American democracy.”  It’s not just Sanders, who is among the most progressive in Congress. Democrats have long expressed their opposition to the deal, even though 14 unions and consumer groups and environmental groups are also involved in the negotiations.  No matter: the president says he is ready to defy his fellow Democrats to push through the TPP. In a case of odd bedfellows, Obama has found new Republican allies in pursuing the deal. US trade representative Michael Froman promised that the Trans Pacific Partnership was on course and due in as little as two months.  Obama’s State of the Union address should give the TPP another push – even as public interest groups, trade experts and digital freedom advocates voice their criticism of the agreement, particularly its secrecy. What makes the TPP distasteful to experts is its resemblance to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), signed in 1994 between the US, Canada and Mexico.  Post-Nafta, the US saw a mass exodus of jobs, with nearly 700,000 jobs offshored, 60.8% of them in manufacturing.  Now as the Obama administration uses the same verbiage as the Clinton administration used two decades ago, trade experts are alarmed at what is to come. The incentives of the Trans Pacific Partnership are going to cause millions of additional jobs to be lost, says Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch.  Wallach quotes the Department of Labor statistics to show that the workers in the US who lose their jobs to trade agreements in the manufacturing sector when re-employed earn only three-quarters of their original earnings, in three out of five cases. “The opposition to the trade agreement comprises unions, environmental, consumer groups – in other words, the entire Democratic base,” says Wallach.  Wallach says that the agreement is based on the terms of the US-Korea free-trade agreement, which were derived from Nafta. The complications include limits on food safety and a ban on the export of gas derived from fracking – which “would limit our ability to have energy policies to combat the climate crisis”, Wallach says.  Another complication: the terms of the TPP won’t be open to debate. A fast-track treatment is likely, with Congress implementing the deal without changes.  “The president wants the authority to railroad through Congress to sign the agreement even before Congress,” explains Wallach, saying it delegates congressional authority to the president. Yet Obama insists that the TPP’s terms are new and improved. The president’s only advice to critics: “Don’t fight the last war.” ‘It copies and pastes US law into international law’ The Trans Pacific Partnership, although billed as a trade agreement, includes provisions on intellectual property and copyright that are usually outside the boundaries of trade, critics say.  For instance, there is a scuffle around the TPP’s rumored treatment of Digital Rights Management tools, which corporations use to limit access to digital devices – often to prevent piracy.  TPP has provisions that make it a crime to break these locks, and to do things that aren’t even copyright infringement.  “These DRM laws prevent us from doing that research legally,” says Maira Sutton, a policy analyst at Electronic Frontier Foundation. “That’s our main concern.” Sutton objects that the TPP will extend problematic US laws into international law. One example: the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prosecutors used to hound open-web advocate Aaron Swartz.  “Similar provisions in the TPP that will prevent whistleblowers and journalists from accessing or ‘disclosing’ trade secrets through a computer system,” Sutton says.  Sutton adds that the recent Sony hacks would not be reported freely under the provisions of the TPP, says Sutton.  The third issue the EFF is concerned with is that of intermediary liability, which burdens ISPs and websites with stricter copyright infringement laws in a way that is veiled censorship, cautions Sutton. Climate activists have been the most vociferous in opposing the TPP’s many terms. As John Fullerton wrote in the Guardian: “What few seem to realize is that this agreement, if approved as is, could make it virtually impossible for the United States to meet its current and future climate pledges.” Elizabeth Warren too has come out against the deal. In a letter to Froman last year, Warren and two other Senators objected that the TPP “could make it harder for Congress and regulatory agencies to prevent future financial crises”. Warren and others have raised concern over a provision called “investor-state dispute settlement” which gives foreign corporations the political power to challenge US laws in front of a small private group of attorneys that answers to no country.  “If the foreign country prevails, the panel can order compensation from American taxpayers without any review by American courts,” Warren warned. One such panel in 2006 forced the Czech Republic to pay $236m to a Dutch bank for not providing it with a bailout, Warren wrote.  Even though dissent is plenty, the means for these public advocates to get involved in the TPP are few.  Public interest groups that want to be on trade advisory committees in order to participate in the negotiations are required to sign non-disclosure agreements, which robs them of the voice to object.  Sutton, of the EFF, says it is the organization’s responsibility to share information with the public and to do public advocacy.  “If we were to sign on to this trade advisory committee to influence the text, then we tie our hands behind our backs to do the work that we need to do,” she tells the Guardian."

"Did you hear the one about the climate policy analyst? Or the polar bear who walked into a bar? Climate change is not generally considered a source of amusement: in terms of comedic material, the forecast is an ongoing cultural drought. But perhaps campaigners have missed a trick in overlooking the powerful role that satire and subversion can play in social change. Could humour cut through the malaise that has smothered the public discourse, activating our cultural antennae in a way that graphs, infographics and images of melting ice could never do?   This is the challenge that a panel of British comedians, including Marcus Brigstocke – a seasoned climate humourist, will take up at an event on Tuesday evening hosted by the RSA and the Climate Outreach and Information Network in London (the event is fully booked but it will be streamed live online). Maybe laughing about something as serious as climate change is just another form of denial. But perhaps its relative absence from the comedy realm is another warning sign: despite decades of awareness raising, the cultural footprint of climate change is faint, fragile and all-too-easily ignored. The first example of a climate-policy parody was probably the ‘Cheat Neutral’ project: a slick spoof of the logic of carbon offsetting whereby people could pay someone else to be faithful, giving them the opportunity to cheat on their husband or wife. And there have other good video mockeries – including one warning that wind farms will blow the Earth off-orbit – which have captured the comedy potential of bizarre debates about energy policy.  This year, Greenpeace teamed up with the surreal comedian Reggie Watts to promote the idea of a 100% renewably powered internet. There have been sporadic examples of climate change ‘stand-up’. And the ever-reliable Simpsons has been occasionally willing to engage.  But these are the exceptions that prove the rule: for the most part, climate gags are notable by their absence. An ongoing challenge is the polarised nature of the climate debate, with climate scepticism closely pegged to political ideology. According to Nick Comer-Calder, of the Climate Media Net, getting people laughing is a good first step to getting them talking – even across political divides. One analysis found that major US satirists, such as Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert, have given more coverage to climate change than many of the news channels – although admittedly, this is a pretty low bar to clear.  But while online ridicule directed towards climate ‘deniers’ (generally portrayed as either too stupid to understand the science, or as conspiracy theorists) may appeal to the usual crowd, its hard to see how this kind of approach will breach the political divide. After all, the feeling of being laughed at by a sneering, left-leaning elite is not appealing. One notorious attempt by the 10:10 campaign and director Richard Curtis at ‘humorously’ marginalising opposition towards environmentalism backfired completely. It turns out that most people don’t find graphic depictions of children’s heads exploding all that hilarious after all… What’s required is for climate change to seep into the fabric of satirical and humourous TV programming, in the same way that other ‘current affairs’ often provide the backdrop and context for creative output. Jokes ‘about’ climate change can in fact be ‘about’ any of the dozens of subjects – family disputes over energy bills, travel and tourism, or changing consumer habits – that are directly impacted by climate change.  Its an interesting irony that while the ‘pro-climate’ discourse can often feel po-faced and pious, climate sceptics have wasted no time in parodying the climate community. The Heretic, a play by Richard Bean, built its dramatic tension around the conflict between a sceptical climate scientist and her cynical departmental head who is suppressing her data in order to keep his grants flowing. The characters are overdrawn and instantly recognisable. And, as a result, it works: it is good drama, entertaining, and laugh-out-loud funny. While climate change itself is never going to be a barrel of laughs, we seem to be suffering from a collective lack of imagination in teasing out the tragi-comic narratives that climate change surely provides. Thinking harder about how to plug climate change into our cultural circuits – not as ‘edutainment’ but simply as a target of satire in its own right – will be crucial in overcoming the social silence around the issue. The science-communicators don’t seem to be making much progress with the public: maybe its time to let the comedians have their turn."
"Don’t underestimate the power of an image: We worked with a community to develop a photo-story of their understanding of how climate change affects them. Most of these folks had never been to school, but the images they took tell their story and how much debate they elicited in their presentation attests to the power of an image.

"Wow, was this a bad year for those who deny the reality and the significance of human-induced climate change. Of course, there were the recent flurry of reports that 2014 surface temperatures had hit their hottest values ever recorded. The 2014 record was first called on this blog in December and the final results were reported as well, here. All of this happened in a year that the denialists told us would not be very hot.  But those denialists are having a tough time now as they look around the planet for ANY evidence that climate change is not happening. The problem is, they’ve been striking out.  And just recently, perhaps the most important bit of information came out about 2014 – how much the Earth actually warmed. What we find is that the warming is so great, NOAA literally has to remake its graphs. Let me explain this a bit. We tend to focus on the global temperature average which is the average of air temperatures near the ground (or at the sea surface). This past year, global air temperatures were record-breaking. But that isn’t the same as global warming. Global warming is properly viewed as the amount of heat contained within the Earth’s energy system. So, air temperatures may go up and down on any given year as energy moves to or from the air (primarily from the ocean). What we really want to know is, did the Earth’s energy go up or down? The trick to answering this question is to measure the change in energy of the oceans. A thorough review of ocean heat measurement methods is found here; we paid the requisite fee to make the paper open access. Anyone can download and read it.  So what do the new data show? Well, it turns out that the energy stored within the ocean (which is 90% or more of the total “global warming” heat), increased significantly. A plot from NOAA is shown above. You can see that the last data point (the red curve), is, literally off the chart.  The folks at NOAA do a great job updating this graph every three months or so. We can now say that the 2014 Earth had more heat (thermal energy) than any year ever recorded by humans. We can also say that the folks at NOAA will likely have to rescale their graph to capture the new numbers. The NOAA site is updated by Dr. Tim Boyer and can be found here. Click on slide 2 to view the relevant image. If people want to read a review of ocean heating that is written for a general audience, I suggest our recent peer-reviewed paper which can be found here. So when we look back on 2014 and the records that fell, it gives us some pause about the so-called pause (hat-tip to Dr. Greg Laden for that phrase). Some people tried to tell us global warming had “paused”, that it ended in 1998, or that the past 15 years or so had not seen a change in the energy of the Earth. This ocean warming data is the clearest nail in that coffin. There never was a pause to global warming, there never was a halt, and the folks that tried to tell you there was were, well, I’ll let you decide. For me, the facts speak for themselves."

"Climate change has an image problem. And it’s not socks, sandals and floral pattern hemp shirts. Typical depictions of the issue, such as homeless polar bears, steaming smoke stacks and swirling storms, are failing to provoke meaningful engagement. Work needs to be done to find a new generation of images that can switch people on and encourage them to take action. If you thought 2014 – the hottest year since records began – was significant in terms of climate change, 2015 is likely to top it. Just over one month in and we’ve had devastating floods in Malawi, killing nearly 200 and displacing 200,000. Al Gore and Pharrell Williams have taken centre stage at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, announcing Live Earth 2015, a music concert that will span seven continents – including Antarctica – this summer.  The UK will be having a general election in May, in which the ascendant Green party is hoping to give the political establishment a run for its money. And of course, the year will close with COP 21 in Paris where a new international agreement on the climate must be agreed. It’s impossible to predict how any of these events will pan out, or what super storms will hit where and when. But what we do know is that their stories will be told and retold with the aid of hundreds of videos, photos, cartoons and graphics all over the world. Images are a powerful and increasingly prolific tool for communication. They can convey complex messages instantly, in a way that is easy to remember – and as a result are frequently shared online. They also have the potential to transcend the language barriers inherent to written and spoken word – particularly significant when conveying a global problem like climate change to an international community. Certainly the relentless stream of high-resolution, cinema-screen size images forming the backdrop to Al Gore’s Davos address creates a powerful visual narrative that requires little or no English to understand. But what if these depictions of climate change that we have become so used to are, in fact, not fit for purpose? What if instead of helping people engage with the issue, they’re actually switching people off? Characterised by uncertainty and made up of long-term, cumulative processes, climate change is for many audiences – particularly those in wealthy, industrialised nations – vague and abstract, making it difficult to visualise and meaningfully comprehend. Yet while research into the verbal communication of climate change has proliferated – some excellent resources can be found at the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, Talking Climate, and the Climate Outreach and Information Network (where I recently completed a research internship) - our understanding of how people think about and react to visual stimuli is limited to a handful of academic studies that focus on documenting the discourse and measuring the public’s response to it. Few people offer the practical guidance we desperately need on how to use images to deepen public engagement. I say desperately because the same selection of images are being produced and reproduced, circulated and recirculated year on year, with little or no understanding of their effect. Whether it’s major campaigning organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, or international news outlets such as the Guardian and Huffington Post, the delicate balance of making an image powerful and ensuring its message is meaningful is not always struck. Questions are starting to be raised, however. The UK Climate Change and Migration Coalition recently published a piece asking whether the wrong images are being used to illustrate stories of human movement connected to shifting weather patterns. So, at this crucial juncture in the calendar, with the window of opportunity for preventing the most serious impacts of climate change still open – but closing quickly – focusing our attention on finding potent images that will develop and enhance people’s commitment to tackling the issue is a critical challenge. It requires us to think creatively about balancing urgency with saliency, connecting global impacts to local actions and combining methods of artistic and scientific practice. The Climate Coalition’s powerful For the Love of… campaign and 10:10’s hugely successful It’s happening gallery offer some indication of where this type of work could take us. But we need far more. Not only this, we must find a way of connecting this new generation of visual language to the diverse values and interests of a wide range of audiences, so we can not only increase engagement with climate change but broaden it, too.

"A new global pact on climate change, due to be signed this year in Paris, should be a “Magna Carta for the Earth”, Prince Charles has urged. He said this year marked potentially the “last chance” to save the world from the perils of global warming, with the Paris conference and the United Nations’ plan to replace the millennium development goals with a new set of sustainable development targets. “We simply cannot let this opportunity go to waste. There is just too much at stake, and has been for far too long.”  He told a meeting of forestry and climate experts in London: “In the 800th anniversary year of the Magna Carta, perhaps this year’s agreement of the new sustainable development goals and a new climate agreement in Paris should be seen as a new Magna Carta for the Earth, and humanity’s relationship with it.” But he warned of difficulties ahead as the negotiations build up: “[This is] an absolutely crucial opportunity, if not the last chance before we end up in an irreversible situation, for the international community to establish a new set of interlocking, coherent and ambitious frameworks governing human development, poverty, disaster risk reduction, the natural environment and climate change. We could, and should, see an agenda set for the coming decades that is capable of transforming the prospects for humanity by improving and nurturing the state of the planet upon which we all depend.” His insistence that 2015 will be a make-or-break year for the climate, and environmental sustainability, were echoed by Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and now the UN’s special envoy for climate change, charged with bringing nations together for a successful outcome at the Paris conference in December. She told the Guardian: “This is the most important year since 1945. In 1945, at the end of the second world war, we got the charter for the United Nations, the international institutions [that embodied it], the Marshall Plan, and a few years later we got the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This year we have to get a similar order of decisions, which will determine the future for decades, and longer.” She pointed to the possible Paris agreement and the sustainable development goals as twin aims that would complement each other in building a more environmentally and socially secure future for the world. At Paris, governments are expected to sign a new global pact by which nearly all of the world’s nations, both developed and developing, would set out clear targets and measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions, to come into effect from 2020. These goals would replace the current targets, set out in 2009 at the Copenhagen summit, to curb emissions – and, in the case of industrialised nations, to make absolute cuts in carbon output – by the end of this decade Already, the world’s two biggest emitters and economies – the US and China – have set out carbon targets, in the case of the US to cut by 26% to 28% by 2025, compared with 2005 levels, and in China’s case to cause emissions to peak by 2030. The EU has also set out its plans for a 40% cut in emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Other major economies are expected to come forward with their proposals by April, followed by a period in which the plans will be evaluated before the crunch negotiations take place over two weeks in December. However, emissions targets – and the crucial question of whether they will be adequate to stave off the worst effects of global warming – are not the only sticking point. Developed countries are also being urged to reassure poorer nations that they will provide financial assistance to help them cut carbon and cope with the effects of climate change, amounting to more than the $100bn a year that should be flowing to the developing world by 2020. As yet, there is no agreement on this. Separately, but also under the auspices of the UN, governments are expected to pass a set of goals on issues as diverse as poverty, environmental protection, water, nutrition and health, to take over from the millennium development goals that expire this year. Robinson said both were needed. “On Paris, I am increasingly hopeful that we will get an agreement. But that will not come into effect until 2020. The sustainable development goals will come into effect next year, and they will be vital to the pre-2020 period,” she explained. She added: “This is the most important year of my lifetime, for the sake of future generations and to see intergenerational justice. We cannot miss this opportunity.”"

"Did you hear? MasterCard has introduced a new credit card where “every swipe” helps offset your personal carbon footprint. For every dollar you charge, Sustain:Green, which manages the rewards program, will offset two lbs of CO2.  That’s right, now you can finance your annual vacation to the Bahamas without feeling guilty! And if you believe that, have I got a credit card for you.   Oh, how ridiculous this new eco-marketing venture is. There’s the sustainababbly (pdf) name, and an uninspired and politically correct choice of offset project (planting trees).  Even worse, the concept reinforces the idea that climate change – and its solutions – can be solved on an individual level, and manipulates consumers into feeling good about consuming. Slavoj Žižek said it best when he described how, in this new stage of “cultural capitalism”, the absolution for your consumer-sin is embedded directly in the price of the product. Now, don’t get me wrong. If Americans are going to use credit cards, it’s better that we use a Sustain:Green card instead of one that gives them free stuff ­– such as free miles for carbon-laden airline travel. At least this way rainforests in Brazil will get some new trees via the certified Mata no Peito forest preservation project.  But how much money would a cardholder have to spend in a year to offset his or her footprint? The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates 2012 emissions at 6.53bn metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, which comes to an average of 20.8 metric tons (45,800 lbs) per US resident.  Using the EPA’s estimates and taking into account the bonuses the card offers (2,500 lbs for every $1,250 spent per quarter), cardholders would have to spend just under $18,000 a year to offset a typical American’s emissions. (It would be less in the first year, when the card offers a one-time 5,000 lb bonus with cardholders’ first purchase.)  Assuming, that is, that the offsets work – that the trees are planted; that the livelihood projects that are funded actually create sustainable alternatives to logging and growing soy; and that these projects don’t inadvertently displace indigenous people or finance the planting of mono-cropped tree farms, as many other offset projects have. Even if the Mata no Peito project is sound and well-managed, new research has found that the full social cost of a ton of carbon may be more like $220, not the $13.12 per ton available on Terrapass or the less than $9 per ton value placed on it by Sustain:Green, assuming a 1% cashback rate. Maybe some low-hanging offsets can be plucked for now. But ultimately, the scale and scope of emissions reductions are so great that we need to focus corporate, governmental and citizen energy on steeply pricing carbon and keeping a large percentage of our fossil fuel reserves – 82% in the case of coal – safely buried in the ground. The message of a card like this one is that we can spend our way to a greener, climate-friendly planet. It leads us in the wrong direction. A far better choice for a smart, green consumer would be to choose a credit card that gives cash back ­– at 1% that $18,000 would return $180 – and donate that money to an NGO working to effectively tackle the root causes of climate change. Take your pick of root causes: a consumer culture stimulating overconsumption; corporations pushing consumers to use more fossil fuels and eat more animal products; or an absurd lack of resources for basic family planning services, to name a few.  I can imagine a much bolder carbon offsetting initiative. Sustain:Green’s rewards dollars could support basic contraception access in the US, for example. Every new American is projected to create an average of 9,441 metric tons of carbon dioxide over his or her lifetime. Providing birth control – whether condoms, intrauterine devices or pills – costs relatively little. Every cardholder could potentially cut tens or even hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 during their lifetimes, which would result in quite an effective offset program. With current offsets available, $180 could buy 13.7 tons of offsets at $13.12 per ton (as is available on Terrapass), which is less than what the card delivers. So if you’re in favor of offsets, this card makes sense. But offsets, as they work now, aren’t effective enough to combat climate change on the scale needed. I hate to once again play the grumpy environmentalist, but it’s hard not to see this new card as a cheap marketing ploy to pull more green consumers into using credit cards (and running a monthly balance, which is where the big bucks are). The trouble is, offsetting our consumer lifestyle won’t get us to where we need to go. We need to consume far less, move away from a growth-centric economic system and reduce the human population – all of which will take bold institutional changes, not a credit card upgrade.  The real danger here is that so-called “green consumption” will serve, not as a gateway to further action, but as an end in itself. As environmental science professor Michael Maniates of Yale-NUS College wrote more than a decade ago: “Individualizing responsibility does not work ­– you can’t plant a tree to save the world.” Instead, he wrote, it “diverts attention from political arenas that matter. In this way, individualization is both a symptom and a source of waning citizen capacities to participate meaningfully in processes of social change.”  If Sustain:Green is up for making a political activism offset credit card, that might do the trick.

"In Davos, Switzerland, the elite will not put up with anything other than perfect ski slopes – even if the climate change they are helping to create is stopping nature from doing the task herself.  The World Economic Forum kicks off today surrounded by mountain slopes that owe some of their beautiful whiteness to 380 massive snow canons that have spent months pumping out hundreds of millions of litres of cold water mixed with air. It’s a powerful metaphor.   As Florian Grimm, the local head of snow management, told a colleague recently: “Today nobody would accept stones any more, or spots of grass in spring. They just want to have white from the top to the valley, and they know we have a system to do this.” Despite all the talk, the wealthy elite gathered in Davos gain too much status, wealth and power from the maintenance of our destructive economic system to spearhead its transformation. I was discussing this issue yesterday with Nick Robins, co-director of UNEP’s inquiry into a sustainable finance system. He says the snow canons are a perfect analogy for the state of mind of political and business leaders – which is to prop up the existing system for as long as possible. That, of course, cannot succeed because denial hastens the very collapse they seek to avoid. We need a new way of thinking and we need it fast. “Creating man-made snow to keep the ski slopes open is what reactive adaptation looks like in reality,” says Robins. “Clearly we are going to need to work much more creatively to respond to the sustainability challenges rushing towards us and get to the root of the problem.” I also spoke to climate expert Jorgen Randers, co-author of the seminal 1972 report Limits to Growth, who worries about the lack of creative thinking at the gathering of powerful global leaders. “I am afraid the results will be limited, because Davos – for ideological reasons – tends to constrain itself to actions that are profitable from a business point of view. What is needed to solve the climate problem is a strong state which can put in place solutions that are not profitable, nor cost effective when using conventional measures.” This is not to decry the successes of the World Economic Forum, which Dominic Waughrey, WEF’s head of public-private partnerships, highlighted this week. It also is not to suggest that the business leaders attending Davos are bad people. They are not, and the more progressive leaders deserve respect for their attempts to bring about change. But most have been seduced by their lofty position in society: their wealth insulates them from the consequences of their actions. Perhaps we should coin a new phrase, “the prosperity trap”, for it is psychologically as debilitating in its own way as the poverty trap (although such a comparison in everyday life would be grotesque). For this reason, Davos, the winter playground of the rich, is perhaps one of the worst places in the world to bring together global leaders – because there is not the merest hint of the poverty suffered by billions of people. Without emotional connections, these leaders – the vast majority of whom are men – will use their intellectual prowess to find solutions with little attention trickling down to the greatest agent of change: our hearts. Tim Haywood, group finance director of Interserve, a multinational support service and construction company based in the UK, recently described how he woke up to the need to take action on sustainability only after his daughter repeatedly voiced her concerns. If only more children of the elite would shake off the shackles of entitlement and take the battle to limit climate change and social injustice to the breakfast table. Rather than only looking for solutions, it would also be a good idea for Davos delegates to start asking better questions. At a recent gathering of sustainability experts, someone took the disruptive step during a break of refashioning the scores of sticky notes highlighting upcoming specialist sessions into the words “we don’t know”. As Davos convened for 2015, Adriaan Kamp, founder of Energy For One World, said: “We need a revolution. We need to instil a new spirit in our companies, society and economies. Our present constellation of leadership and status quo simply won’t do. They have failed. The elite can’t change the elite. So the better question to ask ourselves is how we, the professionals in business and society, can organise ourselves differently to clean up this mess? How can we organise for true success and a true new growth?” Taking time to ponder questions such as these may be the most important activity this week in Davos. The answers that will emerge over time will help determine the world we live in. Thomas Mann, who visited Davos in the early 20th century, marvelled in his novel The Magic Mountain at “the towering marble statuary of the high Alps in full snow”. As the participants in Davos roll up their sleeves up and get to work, let them hold that image in their mind and recognise how important it is that those born in the 22nd century are able to witness such extraordinary majesty and get a taste of heaven on earth.
