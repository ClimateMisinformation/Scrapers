Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: reaction from Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke here (in German), who says this is a welcome but not surprising conclusion.
UPDATE 2: The names of two of the resigning scientists are known: Mr “Honest Broker” Hans von Storch and German Weather Service VP Paul Becker.
The print edition of Der Spiegel this week has a short article that tells us what every sober person in Germany already knows: coping with climate change here will not pose any difficult challenges.

Spiegel writes: German Academy of Sciences and Engineering calls off the climate catastrophe.
In fact we know this to be the case for the rest of the world, unless of course the climate veers into another ice age like situation. The above conclusion was reached by the German Academy of Sciences and Engineering (Acatech) in a study commissioned by the German Federal government. According to Acatech President Reinhard Hüttl:
No climate conditions are going to occur here that already do not exist on the globe elsewhere and that we cannot cope with.”
Worse for the climate alarmists, the report goes on to say that warming will even bring benefits along with it, such as longer growing seasons and reduced wintertime heating costs. Readers should note that typical Germans heat their homes about 8 months per year.

Now we know that for some people bedwetting is a tough habit to break, and so we hope this latest news will help put some of the less chronic among us on the path to recovery.
Concerning rising sea levels, the scientists say that this ought to be an important concern, but “the scientists reject horror scenarios”. The scientists add:
A climate-related mass migration to Germany appears improbable.”
Four alarmist scientists walk out in protest of the good news
People of normal psychological balance would of course be relieved to hear this good news. But in catastrophe-obsessed Germany, this is unfortunately not the norm, rather it’s the exception. A number of scientists, bent on spreading fear, are angered by this good-news conclusion. Spiegel writes:
There was a dispute about the reliability of climate prognoses. Because of the involvement of RWE Innogy supervisory board chairman Fritz Vahrenholt (Social Democrat Party), four scientists resigned from the Committee. The former Senator of Environment of Hamburg accused established climate science of exaggerating man’s share in causing climate change.”
Fritz Vahrenholt is a professor of chemistry and co-author of the controversial skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. The names of the four scientists who resigned are still not known. It’s tough when people no longer want to play along with the alarmist hoax.

"In an effort to suppress federal climate research, the Trump administration will direct state agencies to no longer consider worst-case scenarios of global warming. Climate modelers working for federal agencies will only be permitted to forecast to 2040, decades before the as-much-as 8C degrees of global warming that could take place by 2100 if we continue on our current path. William Happer – most recently famous for complaining that the “demonization” of carbon dioxide “really differs little from the Nazi persecution of the Jews” – will lead a team charged with reviewing the science produced by government researchers, no doubt hunting for references to the disastrous sea-level rise, crop failures and health impacts continued warming stands to create.  The irony in all of this is that Trump, Happer and company may have a firmer grasp on the epic scope of these climate projections than many Democrats. As Naomi Klein argues, even the right’s fervent conspiracy theorists tend to understand at some level how profound the implications of this crisis are for business as usual, which has distributed its profits among elites of both parties. “Members of Trump’s cabinet,” Klein has written, “with their desperate need to deny the reality of global warming, or belittle its implications”, nonetheless “understand something that is fundamentally true. To avert climate chaos, we need to challenge the free-market fundamentalism that has conquered the world since the 1980s.” For all their bluster and junk science, Republican decision-makers have a clear sense for their own self-interest – and just how much is at stake for them and the rest of the 1%. Consider Happer himself, a retired physicist who has spent his post-academy days hopping between various climate-denying thinktanks, a good many of them funded by the fossil fuel industry. In 2015, Greenpeace activists duped Happer into agreeing to write a report on the benefits of carbon dioxide for a fictional oil company. The (real) coal company Peabody Energy has paid him to deliver testimony at a state hearing in Minnesota, and Happer has joined hands with groups like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute – all recipients of ample industry funding – to bolster Trump’s agenda and cast doubt on the scientific consensus. As the New York Times reported in its article on the White House’s new climate plans, both Happer and John Bolton – who tapped him for the administration – have received generous support from the Mercers, the rightwing family credited with both spreading climate denial and helping fuel the opioid epidemic. We can’t know whether Happer genuinely believes the nonsense he’s spouting, or is just being paid well enough to sound like he does. The answer doesn’t really matter. Any clear-eyed assessment of what the science is telling us spells out who the winners and losers of rapid decarbonization would be. To cap warming at around 2C – a threshold many already dealing with climate impacts argue is too high – about three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves will need to be kept underground, a reality that if realized as public policy would crater the stock price of energy companies. Climate scientist Kevin Anderson has estimated that if the top 10% of greenhouse gas emitters were to live like the average European – an improvement even for many of us in the United States – global emissions could decline by a third. It is “possible with the laws of chemistry and physics”, according to IPCC scientists, to limit warming to the boldly ambitious target of 1.5C. The problem is our politics, and how much of a stranglehold the fossil fuel executives with the most to lose from decarbonization have over them. Establishment Democrats, meanwhile, are asleep at the wheel. The pitch for taking on the climate challenge is a compelling one for reasons well beyond the fact that it could prevent runaway catastrophe. The Green New Deal promises a well-paid job for everyone who wants one, a real mass transit system, clean and affordable energy and universal healthcare – a necessity as people leave their jobs to find new work in the transition away from fossil fuels. While several Democratic primary contenders have embraced the Green New Deal and begun proposing their own plans, the frontrunner in that race, Joe Biden, and the Democrats’ congressional leadership have been cooler toward it, offering neither a decarbonization plan nor a compelling reason for voters to get behind them come 2020. That’s a dead end for the planet, but also for the party’s political prospects. With Donald Trump at their helm, Republicans will keep denying climate change because it represents a dire threat to their fossil fuel donors’ bottom lines. Democratic leadership would do well to follow the lead of their party’s insurgent progressive wing, and take the climate threat as seriously."
"The head of Scotland’s nature conservation agency has warned the country faces an “apocalyse” of flooded towns, dead forests and polluted rivers unless urgent action is taken to cut CO2 emissions. Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said the world had barely a decade to shift to a low carbon economy before the effects of global heating were irreversible and catastrophic. She said there were very clear threats facing Scotland, and by implication the rest of the UK, unless radical action was taken by 2030.  “Imagine an apocalypse – polluted waters; drained and eroding peatlands; coastal towns and villages deserted in the wake of rising sea level and coastal erosion; massive areas of forestry afflicted by disease; a dearth of people in rural areas; and no birdsong,” she told the Royal Society of Edinburgh on Thursday evening. “All of this is possible, and there are parts of the world we can point to where inaction has given rise to one or more of these nightmare landscapes.” Osowska said current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere meant global heating of 1.5C was almost inevitable, requiring adaptation in the way people lived. To prevent even more heating, there had to be sweeping changes to the way land and seas were exploited for food, towards much more sustainable food production; a marked shift towards sustainable transport systems; increased green spaces in urban areas; and significant reform of the economy, to promote greater equality. Likening the relationship between the Earth’s climate and its biodiversity to a marriage, she said there had been major shifts in climate and nature before. “But the rate of the current shift is both unprecedented and phenomenal,” she said. “In the space of geological seconds – possibly milliseconds – we have crashed the marriage. Our actions threaten to disrupt the harmony that has existed over the last 10,000-15,000 years. We are entering a climate which may not be capable of sustaining the planet’s billions of people and nature as we know it.” She cited goals set out in a recent report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), a government body that advises the UK and devolved governments on climate policy, which has called on the UK to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050. The UK government has so far failed to endorse that. That required converting 20% of agricultural land to forestry, biomass for energy, or expanding carbon-rich peatlands; a switch to electrically powered transport; increasing renewable energy production by 50%; and heavy investment in carbon capture and storage, to pipe the CO2 still being produced underground. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The CCC said Scotland could achieve net zero – a figure that allows some CO2 emissions as long as that carbon is absorbed by other measures – by 2045 because it has greater scope for new forestry and renewable energy production. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has adopted that goal but her government has yet to set out how it will be achieved. MSPs at Holyrood are resisting proposals for mandatory 20mph zones in urban areas and taxing workplace parking to help cut transport emissions."
"I’m taking part on Friday because adults, and especially politicians, have not done enough to save our future. We have to get them to listen to us and believe what scientists have to say. I’m participating in a strike located in Tampere. We will get together on Sori Square (Sorin Aukio) and march to the central marketplace (Keskustori). I think the earth needs this climate strike movement. And we need it too, because it’s our future that is in danger. I’m so happy to see the youth rise and demand back a planet where we can live. Elina, 14, Finland  I don’t want to see the world struggle; the world dying because we are not doing anything about it. We are making more disaster by not changing bad habits to help the climate crisis such as fossil fuels, cars, palm oil, plastic and ruining animal habitats. I feel responsible to do something and take action especially as I love animals and according to the science many can disappear in my lifetime. I am half Balinese and the climate crisis affects places like Bali and it mainly hurts the poor people there as they don’t live in houses that can stand the dramatic changes in the weather. So I want to try to help the world become a better place. How can we stop climate change if we don’t know what to do? I feel that we should learn more about this at school and specialised people should come and talk to us. We need more people’s ideas about what to do and how they think we should help. Nia, nine, Kent, England I find the movement inspiring, powerful and making change. In Iowa, I’ve been on strike for the past 10 weeks. In those weeks, there has been historic flooding in western and eastern Iowa. But this flooding is nothing compared to the cyclones that hit Mozambique. We must act now. I believe there is a climate emergency, so we are marching to the city hall to call on our council to declare a climate emergency and update their climate action plan to meet IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] standards. There are no more excuses. Massimo, 14, Iowa, US I’ve always been somewhat aware of the climate crisis but until recently I didn’t realise how bad it actually was, and I didn’t feel like there was much I could do about it anyway. I thought I was the only young person who actually cared about this, and all I could do was recycle. Then, last November, I found out about Greta Thunberg and the school strike movement and I thought: “Wow, this is something I can do!” At first I was hesitant about starting my own strike; as I am home-educated the idea of asking other young people to strike sounded a bit odd. But on 15 March I went to the Cambridge strike and I was absolutely astounded by the amount of other kids there! It was amazing when I realised that so many other people care about this. After that I decided to stop messing around and decided that the climate crisis was more important than a fear of whether other kids would listen. Eva, 12, Suffolk, England I will be taking part on Friday because I am scared for mine and other children’s futures. Our planet was handed to us broken and destroyed from previous generations and it is seriously unfair that we should be hit with its full effects. There was Hurricane Sandy and there were floods but I moved to New York in 2014 and live pretty high up so I don’t get hit as hard as people in Redhook or the Rockaways might. I feel both empowered and scared. It is awesome that we have come this far and that kids have taken notice of our world’s faults but it’s frightening that we have to. If adults had taken action before it escalated to this point, we would have had a lot more time to help piece Earth back together. To the kids, keep working hard and we will eventually force adults to take action, this is our future we are protesting for, they can’t take it away. To the adults who aren’t doing anything, you have let it get this far, when will climate change have killed enough people for you to take notice? To adults who are trying to help, thank you. We need more people like you to get this job done. Every person counts. To everyone, think when you go to a cafe, do I really need this plastic bag or straw? Remember to refuse. Zola, 11, New York, US"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA chief scientist Waleed Abdalati has issued a response to the letter of protest from 50 former esteemed scientists, engineers and astronauts. Unfortunately, his response only adds to NASA’s embarrassment.
Normally when a professional organisation gets a high level complaint from such a number of esteemed members, the first step is confirm and to look into it seriously. Something like: “Thanks – we’ve received your complaint; we’ll look into it and get back to you”.
Apparently the chief of NASA no longer bothers taking the precaution of following up and investigating high-gravity issues from within. He just dismisses them off the bat. Not only is this inappropriate, but it is also reckless managerial behavior.
Abdalati has failed to exercise due diligence in the face of a serious matter.
Here’s NASA’s “us-against-them” response:
NASA sponsors research into many areas of cutting-edge scientific inquiry, including the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate. As an agency, NASA does not draw conclusions and issue ‘claims’ about research findings. We support open scientific inquiry and discussion.
“Our Earth science programs provide many unique space-based observations and research capabilities to the scientific community to inform investigations into climate change, and many NASA scientists are actively involved in these investigations, bringing their expertise to bear on the interpretation of this information.
We encourage our scientists to subject these results and interpretations to scrutiny by the scientific community through the peer-review process. After these studies have met the appropriate standards of scientific peer-review, we strongly encourage scientists to communicate these results to the public.

If the authors of this letter disagree with specific scientific conclusions made public by NASA scientists, we encourage them to join the debate in the scientific literature or public forums rather than restrict any discourse.”
Sheesh – no wonder the Challenger blew up! Have they not learned anything?
Instead of sweeping serious issues under the carpet, how about contacting those with the grievance and looking into it to see if there is something behind it? Did you even bother to call them?
Did NASA tell Morton Thiokol engineers to take the peer-review route in 1986?! Who are they kidding?
NASA’s knee-jerk dismissal of the letter of complaint is dubious, and reveals an organisation that is no longer functioning correctly. Its off-hand decision to dismiss the letter is amateur, unprofessional and stunningly negligent. Here, unwillingness to investigate is cover-up.
Abdalati’s handling of this matter is a scandal, and is on par with a CEO ignoring a letter from 50 women managers bringing up sexual harassment issues.
Moreover, open scientific discourse begins by looking into claims of serious deficiencies, and not ignoring or suppressing them.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie Welt blogger and science journalist Ulli Kulke writes here about how another scare story (melting permafrost) is a load of “imbecility”.

In the above paper, permafrost expert Georg Delisle shows that permafrost scare is irrational bedwetting. Source: Poster Bad Honnef.
Some alarmist scientists claim melting permafrost could lead to a dangerous “tipping point” as methane and CO2 released would act to enhance global warming further, which in turn would cause more permafrost to melt, thus accelerating global warming until it careens out of control.
Just in time for Doha, this disaster scenario has once again been hyped up, with Kevin Schaefer of the National Snow and Ice Data Center recently sounding the alarms. So has UNEP.
Kulke writes, however, that the permafrost is much more stable than claimed and that studies have been conducted on permafrost – since decades. Kulke writes:
I remember a seminar in Bad Honnef in the spring of 2008 where geoscientist and permafrost expert Georg Delisle from Hanover presented his research.

He studied time periods from the last 10,000 years when the global temperature was warmer than today for several thousand years by as much as 6°C. Ice cores that had been extracted from Antarctica and Greenland provide exact information about the composition of the atmosphere during the these warm periods. His conclusion: ‘The ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica provide no indication of any elevated release of greenhouse gases at any time even though back then a deep thawing of the permafrost when compared to today would have been the case.’  This was clear to see on the poster he used for his presentation. Obviously CO2 and methane are much more stable in the ground also when it thaws, Poster Bad Honnef.”
Delisle is an expert on permafrost. What does he think about the claims being made that there’s a risk it will thaw out and release lots of climate-shattering gas? Kulke tells us what Delisle said emphasis added:
‘…it is utter imbecility to suppose that the entire permafrost could thaw out by the end of the century. It would take thousands of years.‘ His study ‘Near-surface permafrost degradation: How severe during the 21st century?’ was the basis for his presentation. It had been peer reviewed and has not to my knowledge been refuted to this day. 2007GL029323.”
Kulke writes that it would be nice if the IPCC took such research into account, the same applies for the sun as a factor as well.
By the way, the Poster Bad Honnef concludes:
• Permafrost in the Arctic will remain mostly intact in the 21st century.
• When making a comparison to other earlier warm periods, the massive release of greenhouse gases from disintegrating permafrost is considered improbable.
Another global warming myth debunked. Now bring on the “melting ice caps”.

Low carb living. (Image source: http://www.psychicdonut.com/wp)
First they tell us we’re too fat and lazy, and that we need to be more active instead. But now that too turns out to be undesirable because according to a Max Planck Institute scientist, you end up breathing harder, thus emitting more CO2 and making the climate worse as a result. I kid you not!
The scientifically moronic Handelsblatt today here has the latest idiotic piece titled: Climate Killer From The Lungs. A reader asks the Düsseldorf-based financial daily how much CO2 a human emits. Every week the Handelsblatt answers such stupid questions as part of its Klima-Orakel – in an effort inform (lol) its readers on climate change.
To answer that question, the Handelsblatt consults Matthias Heil of the Max Planck Institute for heart and lung research, who says that fit, muscular people breath out more CO2 than unfit people do, and that things get really bad when we become physically active. According to Heil:

During rest, about 4 litres of air pass through the lungs per minute. But that jumps to over 50 litres during physical activity. Over an entire year it comes out to 2100 cubic meters of air, or 168 kg of CO2, when at rest and 25,500 cubic meters of air, or 2040 kg of CO2, when at constant physical activity.”
Of course nobody is physically active constantly over the course of a year (especially me). We could say say that each human breathes out roughly 1/4 ton of CO2 per year, and thus that adds up to a couple billion tons. Heil concludes (emphasis added):
The figures foremost show one thing: Individual lifestyle has an enormous impact on our CO2 emission. From that standpoint, a small non-athletic person who never moves and spends the whole day on the sofa has the optimum climate result.”
Boy, I feel a lot less guilty already. Damn! I’m really doing my part.
Are there any guys out there whose wives would believe this crap? “Sorry honey, but fixing up the house is gonna make me breathe harder and that’s bad for the climate.”
Sounds like a good way to get assaulted by the rolling pin.

"The Labor leadership aspirant Jim Chalmers says the party’s entire policy agenda, including its ambitious 45% emissions reduction target, could be upended in the wake of Saturday’s shock election loss. “Everything is up for grabs,” Chalmers told the ABC TV’s Q&A program when asked whether Labor would review its climate policy.  Most of the panel discussion revolved around Chalmers, who confirmed he was considering nominating for Labor’s leadership ballot. Chalmers was repeatedly backed into a corner when asked how his party’s platform might shift in the aftermath of the disappointing result on Saturday. He was forced to acknowledge that something needed to change but unable yet to say what those changes might be. “All of these policies after an election loss are up for review, they’re up for discussion,” Chalmers said. “We have to reflect on that, obviously. We’re not going to pretend that we are not going to give consideration to all these policies. “Obviously the vote was disappointingly weak. I’m not going to pretend that away, I’m not going to try and sugarcoat that. “Our job now is not to engage in some year-long pity party or drag our arses around, our job now is to rebuild and renew and refresh.” Thanks @qanda for an excellent exposition of all the policies the Opposition won't be implementing because they lost the election two days ago. #qanda In an episode devoted mainly to campaign inquests, the retiring minister Christopher Pyne said he thought Malcolm Turnbull would have won the election had he not been dumped by the Liberal party last year. “What Scott did was … an amazing achievement. I think Malcolm would have won the election as well. I still believe that. We gave ourselves quite a handicap last August.” Pyne said complaints about Clive Palmer’s advertising spend – a $60m yellow campaign that heavily attacked the opposition leader Bill Shorten – were “sour grapes” and that the same criticism had not been directed at other third-party electioneering. “A lot of [Palmer’s advertising] was complete and utter rubbish. That’s his business. That’s his business whether he spent $60m. We don’t like what GetUp has done. We don’t like what the ACTU has done. They don’t donate to us. But that’s the way things are.” The business leader Ming Long said she did not think Palmer was “stupid” for spending so much money on a campaign where he polled about 3.4% of the national vote. “He’s a businessman,” she said. “He wants an investment for that $60m return. It’s important for the journalists and the media in our country to keep an eye on is there a deal. Is he getting some sort of return for that?” The journalist Alice Workman, of the Australian, highlighted how effective the Coalition campaign in regional Queensland had been at capturing concerns from coalminers about jobs. “Climate change means different things to people in inner-cities than it does to people in Queensland,” she said. Chalmers conceded that coal had hurt Labor in key central Queensland marginal seats. “Clearly in central Queensland and north Queensland we had a problem and that’s reflected in the results,” he said. “We would be dishonest if we tried to claim that coal didn’t play a part in that. But nationally, overwhelmingly, we need to deal with climate change. Nationally, renewable energy needs to play a bigger part of the mix.” Has “the silent majority” spoken? Are progressive parties like Labor out of touch with the majority of voters? #QandA pic.twitter.com/0eHkOda1XP In a rare hour of air time, particularly one so focused on the climate crisis, the controversial broadcaster Alan Jones managed to say little that was more outlandish than his coral-coloured suit jacket. He aimed a few barbs at Labor, using lines such as the “economic suicide note” which he had repeated ad nauseam during the election campaign. Finally, with a few moments of the panel discussion remaining, Jones could contain himself no more, trotting out a convoluted climate denial argument about the trace amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, one refuted by scientists as contrarian nonsense. Workman rolled her eyes and said: “Oh my God.” Jones retorted: “Alice, you’ve been speaking for most of the night.” The host, Tony Jones, suggested Jones might need to be fact checked. It was unclear whether he was referring to Workman’s air time, or the need to decipher the broadcaster’s personal climate science."
"I have mentioned this before, but the mystery persists. Matt Canavan, the federal resources minister, has an economics degree, graduating from the University of Queensland with first class honours. Canavan also worked at the Productivity Commission prior to entering politics, first as a staffer for Barnaby Joyce and then as a senator for Queensland.  His professional background would point to a basic level of respect for facts and evidence – unless Canavan was the only staffer ever to work at the Productivity Commission overheard insisting stoutly in the tea room that everything needed to remain just the same, forever. It would also suggest a degree of fluency with the concept of industry transformation, a minor speciality of the commission. It is possible, of course, that Canavan departed the technocracy and sought refuge in political life in order to enact a state of being called the permanent present, but in any case, let’s not sweat the mystery, because we need to review the latest thinking of the resources minister. In an interview with The Australian, Canavan – normally a great champion of the resources sector – shared a few words of rebuke. If I’ve understood him correctly, the resources minister expressed objection to “loud” Australians getting all mouthy about climate change, in the process (somehow) encouraging resources companies (timid characters that they are) to advocate carbon pricing and discouraging banks (also notoriously timid corporate players) from lending to new coal projects. “Loud” Australians, he said, were skewing the debate. It’s not entirely clear who these “loud and undemocratic voices within our community” are. Perhaps Canavan meant the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, who in March warned climate change poses risks to Australia’s financial stability, and, in the process, noted policymakers needed to consider warming as a trend and not a cyclical event. Perhaps he meant the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. In March Apra flagged an intention to increase scrutiny of how banks, insurers and superannuation trustees are managing the financial risks of climate change to their businesses. The Apra executive board member Geoff Summerhayes noted earlier this year the drive towards decarbonisation was being driven not by noisy undemocratic interests but “by the decisions of governments, business leaders, investors and consumers”. The regulator surveyed 38 large banks, insurers and superannuation trustees in 2018 to assess their views and practices on climate-related financial risks, and that survey found a third of respondents believed climate change was a material financial risk to their businesses right now, and half believed it would be in the future. Half of the insurers surveyed said they were already feeling the effects of climate change. “Companies that fail to respond to these forces risk being left behind,” Summerhayes said. Perhaps Canavan meant the corporate regulator Asic. Last year that regulator said climate change was “a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries” and warned directors and management of listed companies “to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks including climate risk that may affect the company’s business”. In that report, 17% of listed companies in the Asic sample identified climate risk as a material risk in their operating and financial reviews. Just in case this isn’t obvious, this isn’t wild, activist talk fomenting in the organic groceries of Brunswick, a revolution cooked up between the kale and the quinoa. This is hard-headed analysis by regulators with serious governance responsibilities. This is an inconvenience, I suspect, for Australia’s resources minister but basic facts don’t change courtesy of an election result. Governments don’t mandate reality, even when they win elections they didn’t expect to win. Basic facts remain the same. Canavan reasons these companies need to desist with their current dispositions on climate change, carbon risk and lending because the voters have spoken. Well, which voters? Because when it comes to this issue, voters expressed different views in different parts of the country. Which voters are we heeding? Here’s another basic fact. It is profoundly obvious to anyone taking the time to absorb what resources companies are saying about carbon pricing that this is not some weak-kneed capitulation to abstract activism (although obviously these companies are attentive to the views of their shareholders, who are increasingly attentive to carbon risk). The persistent call is actually a cry for help. Fiona Wild, the head of sustainability at BHP, told the Australian Financial Review last year carbon pricing was both a thing, but also a proxy for something that’s been missing from climate and energy policy in Australia for the best part of a decade. Sanity. “I think in the Australian context what we’d really like to see is a really well integrated climate and energy policy which looks at affordability, reliability and emissions reductions and that’s what we’re aiming for,” Wild said last October. Big corporations can’t operate in a world that remains tethered to the permanent present of Canavan’s imagining, they have to plan for the future, and the future is carbon constraint. That will either happen in a managed fashion, where governments tell Australians the truth about what needs to happen, and try to smooth the transformation, or it will happen chaotically, with maximum cost and maximum mayhem. Rather than wagging his finger at banks and resources companies, which operate in the real world and make rational decisions, Canavan would be better placed thinking about his core responsibilities as a policy maker, including what the resources industries of the future might look like, and how to create economic opportunity for the blue collar workers he purports to represent.

Last week my wife and I spent a few days in Berlin, and we visited the German Historical Museum.
Part of Germany’s very early history involves the Roman Empire, which never succeeded in taming the unruly tribes east of the Rhine.

Climate change during the Roman Empire days, when CO2 was below 300 ppm.
One of the exhibits there was accompanied by a piece of interesting text, which I photographed (without a flash), see above. The Roman empire collapsed in part due to climate change back then.
I thought the climate was gentle when atmospheric CO2 concentration was below 300 ppm – steady, unvariable and associated with few weather extremes. That’s what fraudster warmist climatologists tried to have us believe with an assortment a various hockey stick charts.
Someone needs to tell the German Historical Museum that.

"It has taken Roger Tyers four days to reach Moscow by train from Kiev. His destination is Beijing: a trip that will take 14 days, with a couple of overnight stops along the way. Tyers, an environmental sociologist at the University of Southampton, is on his way to China to research attitudes to the environment, the climate emergency and personal responsibility. “Given that, I thought it would be somewhat hypocritical of me to fly,” he says over Skype from his hostel room. It has been months in the planning – he had to convince his bosses to give him a month off to travel to and from China. Has it been a pain? “It definitely has. It’s a matter of getting your train schedule in line with your visa requirements. I didn’t realise I needed a visa to travel through Mongolia, even though I’m not stopping there. There have been moments when I’ve been close to giving up and either cancelling the whole trip or just booking a flight.” But he is glad he has stuck with it, he says. “I have to prove it is possible.”  The no-fly movement is a small but growing community of people who are drastically reducing the number of flights they take, or giving up air travel altogether. Many campaigners say they feel flying is about to receive the same attention as shunning plastic or eating less meat because of its 2% contribution to global carbon emissions, predicted to grow to as much as 16% by 2050. In Sweden, where the movement has taken off, a new term has emerged: flygskam, meaning “flight shame”. Siân Berry, the co-leader of the Green party, has called on people to take no more than one flight a year and suggested a tax should be imposed on further journeys. Berry hasn’t flown since 2005. The climate activist Greta Thunberg hasn’t flown since 2015; she did her European tour last month by train. In January, she attended the World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland, travelling 32 hours each way by rail, while a record number of private jets – about 1,500 – brought the rich and powerful attendees. It is becoming harder to defend alleged hypocrisy, however well-meaning. The actor Emma Thompson was criticised for flying from Los Angeles to support the Extinction Rebellion protest in London, not only by the usual naysayers eager to point out double standards, but also by environmental campaigners. “She could just as easily have paid for a billboard poster in Piccadilly and got her message across there,” said Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist who hasn’t flown since 2004, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The issue has been significant among environmental scientists for years; the Flying Less campaign, aimed at academia, has been running since 2015. Paul Chatterton, a professor of urban futures at the University of Leeds, also hasn’t flown since 2004. “I think every academic has to justify why they are flying to that particular ‘must-go’ conference. If we have something really important to say, say it in a different way.” He travels to European conferences by train. “One of the privileges of being a middle-income professional – and this is a direct plea to other middle-income professionals – is that you can negotiate with your boss and you have a bit more money to get the train. I’m not talking about people who can’t afford to do that, because I know trains are more expensive.” As for Chatterton’s no-fly family holidays, the best ones have been taking the ferry from Hull to Rotterdam and cycling around the Netherlands. “You travel light, you make it an adventure with your kids,” he says. “Who wants to sit in a departure lounge? You get the excitement of travelling through places, figuring out what the next journey is. I think we have to get back into the idea that travelling is special; it’s a privilege.” Most flying is carried out by a small proportion of the population. Aled Jones, the director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, says we have become used to the low-cost weekend flight abroad in a short space of time. “When I was growing up, and certainly for the generation before, flying on holiday was not something you expected to do,” he says. “By radically cutting down, we’re not going back to the dark ages; we’re going back to when people holidayed in the UK. It will be less of a sacrifice for a lot of people than we expect.” He admits that addressing “love miles” – flying to see family who live abroad – is “a very different challenge”. Maja Rosén, who lives in Sweden and gave up flying in 2008, had always kept quiet when friends talked about flying abroad on holidays – until last year. “I thought: ‘How is it possible I’m more scared of destroying the mood than climate collapse?’ I decided that my new year resolution last year would be to start asking some inconvenient questions. I realised that most people weren’t aware of the impact from flying and how huge it is.” She and a friend started a campaign, Flight-free 2019 (now Flight-free 2020), to encourage people to pledge not to fly. By the end of 2018, 15,000 Swedes had signed; by the end of this year, she thinks it will be 100,000. It has changed the conversation around flying in the country: passenger numbers dropped at Swedish airports in 2018, while a record number of people in the country took the train. “People don’t realise that what they do as an individual is so important because it affects those around them,” says Rosén. “If you keep flying, all your friends will as well. You contribute to the norm. But if you decide to give up flying or take a flight-free year, that makes others reflect. Change can happen fast as soon as enough people start acting. Before, people saw flying as an experience or something you do, it wasn’t in the category of consumption, but I think now people are starting to realise that by taking a flight they are a heavy consumer of fossil fuel.” There is now a British arm of the campaign, run by the writer Anna Hughes, who last took a flight eight years ago. More than 1,000 people have pledged to have a flight-free year. Hughes likens it to the Veganuary campaign, by which people give up animal products for January to raise awareness of veganism and change behaviour. She has travelled to Ireland, Denmark and other European countries – and seen a lot of the UK. “There is nowhere I can think of that I want to go that I can’t get to by bike, train or boat. If I was going to go further, I would just take a long time to do it.” The author Nicola Davies is taking long-haul flights for a couple of upcoming commitments, but after that she will radically rethink her flight consumption, she says. There will almost certainly be no more European flights; she has already travelled to the Balearic Islands in Spain by car. “We did the journey down to Barcelona in two days, then the ferry crossing is eight hours,” she says, adding that it requires a bit more planning than travelling by plane. “It’s much more exciting, much closer to the real skin of the planet than the feeling you get from going to an airport, popping into a metal tube and then popping out at some other point on the planet with no real grasp of the distance, habitat, people and cultures you’ve passed over on the way. “I think this shift to no, or fewer, flights is an opportunity to redraft what travel truly means, rather than a sort of consumerist ticking of boxes. If we give up the idea of the weekend break in Budapest or the three days in Miami for a stag do, I think that’s probably helpful – for us as human beings, as well as for the planet.” There are people who are reminding us that it is possible to travel overland with young children. “We’ve gone to Italy by train, Spain, different parts of France,” says Linda Thomas, a fashion designer. For the first couple of years, giving up flying felt like a loss, she says, but the train-travel website seat61.com has enabled them to plan more adventurous journeys. “We’ve had some really incredible wildlife experiences. There would be a feeling of guilt otherwise – that you’re seeing something, but also contributing to its demise at the same time, when you’ve taken a long-haul flight to get somewhere. It doesn’t feel like a loss; it feels like we’ve gained new experiences.” Wendy and her husband have cut down on flying in recent years and decided to stop altogether at the beginning of 2019. “We couldn’t really justify it any more. Something that was purely for fun didn’t feel enjoyable any more; it didn’t feel right.” They have had fantastic family holidays by train, starting with a trip to Chamonix in the French Alps with their six-month-old daughter, but Wendy says it has been hard not seeing her husband’s family, who live in Malaysia. Cath Heinemeyer, a researcher and community artist who hasn’t flown for 19 years, says visiting family has been a challenge. “My family live in Northern Ireland, my husband’s family live in Germany and we live in York. We do see them, but we see them less frequently, for a longer time.” She admits they haven’t faced family commitments that would be simplified by flying. “Our parents are in reasonable health. Maybe it will get challenging if we’re suddenly called to support them in their later years. We would have to decide that on a case-by-case basis.” It can be more expensive – “You need to get a bit savvy about booking” – and it requires research, she says. “We have had mishaps, where we’ve had tiny children and missed a train connection and had to find last-minute accommodation in some city.” Heinemeyer felt a twinge of regret at missing her high school reunion in Canada, but otherwise not flying hasn’t felt like a sacrifice, she says. “I like the children to realise how far they’ve travelled and see how the landscape changes. It’s just a thing we’ve always worked around. Your journey becomes part of your holiday.” Lewis McNeil, a project manager for the charity the Orchard Project, proved the viability of long-haul overland travel after he gave up flying in 2006. There was “a ‘letting go’ period akin to the end of a relationship, but things got exciting when I realised that one can still travel, and travel far, while creating a fraction of the emissions that air travel is responsible for”, he says. He has gone by coach to many European destinations, finding the train too expensive if booked last-minute, but his most intrepid no-fly holiday was a nine-day cargo-ship journey from France to Trinidad in the Caribbean, booked through a specialist company, then on to Venezuela by boat. “The idea behind this is that you’re piggybacking on emissions that are already going to be emitted – that cargo ship, as unsustainable as it is with our crazy trade system, is going anyway. With flying, flights depend on demand.” The journey was magical. “Watching dolphins and whales, seeing incredible starlit skies in the middle of the Atlantic, swimming in the little plunge pool, swotting up on Spanish, making friends with the Filipino crew and sharing music. It was pretty expensive, at €90 (£79) per person a day, but that included food and a lovely en suite room complete with a porthole and a writing desk.” He returned from Colombia to the Netherlands. The key to flight-free travel, he says, is “seeing the journey as part of the adventure” – although travel pillows, eye masks, earplugs, snacks, books and a tablet with films downloaded all help. After Moscow, Tyers will get the Trans-Siberian railway to Irkutsk, then on to Beijing. “Not everybody can do it, I understand that,” he says. “Not everybody has the time, or bosses who are willing to let people take longer to get places. But for those who can – and I think a lot more people can than realise – flying less is good; it’s enriching.” He is pessimistic that people will change voluntarily to the degree needed. “But we’ll see. Often the cultural change comes first, then political change – and I do think there’s something in the air.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSulfur Dioxide and Arctic Warming
By Ed Caryl
Sulfur dioxide, SO2, is not a greenhouse gas. But it should not be ignored when discussing climate. We know that the SO2 injected into the stratosphere by large volcanoes such as Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo, can cause cooling for a period of years. This is because of the reflective haze created by SO2 combining with water vapor to create sulphuric acid aerosol that then takes two or three years to fall down to altitudes where they find enough water vapor to grow, form clouds, and rain out.
We know that SO2 from industry and fossil fueled power plants form smogs and low clouds that produce acid rain down wind from the sources. We know what damage acid rain can do when the acid content is high enough to harm plant life. But little attention has been paid to the climate effects of the smogs themselves.
We know that low clouds and fogs keep surface temperatures from falling at night, as well as keeping surface temperatures from rising during daylight.
We know that in the polar regions in winter it is night all the time.
Now put those things together. In the Arctic, in winter, smogs and low clouds caused by SO2 will trap heat below them 24 hours a day, and in the spring will prevent sunlight from reaching and warming the surface. On the Arctic Ocean, this will delay both freezing in the winter and melting in the spring.

Figure 1: NORSEX ice extent for the last five years plus 2012 to date.
 We can see clearly that the freeze-up in the Arctic has been delayed in recent years compared to the 1979 to 2006 average. Because the freeze-up is delayed, there is less ice to thaw in the spring, so that delay is less obvious, except that the ice minimum is also delayed compared to the average. Now we get to why? First, we look at two temperature anomaly maps of the Arctic.

Figure 2a and 2b: Temperature anomaly maps from Climate4You of the Arctic for all of 2011 and March of 2012. Note the location of the warming.

Now another map. This is a map of northern Russia.

Figure 3: Google map of northern Russia. The indicator on the map is the location of Norilsk.
Norilsk is the location of the world’s largest nickel mine. They also recover copper, cobalt, platinum, and palladium. Nearby, coal is mined to support the power needs of the city (130,000 population), the mine, and the smelter operations. SO2 emissions are about one million metric tons per year. This one location is responsible for 1% of all the SO2 emissions in the world, 10% of all of Europe’s emissions.
CNN reports that there is not a single living tree within 48 kilometers (30 miles) of the nickel smelter. 2,832 square kilometers (1093 square miles) of forest have been killed, and another 5371 square kilometers (2073 square miles) have been damaged. For a full report on the damage read this pdf document.
Norilsk Mining has other smelters on the Kola Peninsula very close to the Norwegian border. They also emit large amounts of SO2. Both locations are well above the Arctic Circle. All these emissions are within a very sensitive part of the Earth: the Arctic.
During the winter, the winds in the Arctic are variable, depending on the position of the Arctic front. The winds alternate between blowing to and from the land, moving any pollution over the Arctic Ocean or inland. In Figure 2b, in March,
the pollution from Norilsk was moving over the ocean much of the time. You can see the ebb and flow of the winds as they moved the sea ice in an animation of the last year here (from NRL).
Normally, SO2 is not a greenhouse gas, but it is in the dark of winter in the Arctic. In combination with water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas, it produces smog and low clouds that reflect heat back to the surface when it is dark, and upward into space when the sun shines. This distorts the melting and freezing patterns resulting in less ice in the Arctic Ocean. Yes, the reduction in ice in the Arctic is anthropogenic, with a Russian accent.
One thing people don’t know is that the platinum/palladium used in in automotive catalytic converters comes from Norilsk. We are simply moving the pollution from a distributed source, automobiles, to a concentrated source in Siberia. We are all responsible for Arctic warming.
Postscript: Norilsk Mining plans to reduce SO2 emissions by two-thirds as soon as they develop the necessary technology. They think this can be done by 2015 or 2020. Just in time for the general global cooling.

"It’s going to be hard for those who care about and work on climate change but we must dust ourselves off, because neither despair nor emigrating to New Zealand will help solve the mess Australia’s climate policy is in. The government has been re-elected with a minimalist climate policy and a weak emissions target, despite widespread community support for action on climate change. Where to from here?  The near term looks grim. The Coalition government will feel locked into its stance against climate action, even if many smart heads in government will understand that a do-nothing approach is unwise. The Labor party might feel that its progressive stance on climate change hurt it. Tax policy might have swung the election, but climate change clearly played a role. But climate policy will not be stuck there, even if it is a slow and hard road. There are strong international pressures, most of the Australian business community does not want the economy stuck in the past, and the states will not accept a vacuum on climate and energy policy. The world has started the transition to a low-carbon energy and industrial system. Australia’s best bet is to make use of our tremendous opportunities for low-carbon energy production. Hanging on for grim death to the high-carbon industries of the last century is no economic strategy. The world will not carve out a niche for Australia to continue prospering as a 20th-century style high carbon economy. Global demand for coal will fall. The future for our energy industries is in cheap renewable energy. All that before we even consider our country’s vital interest in a strong global climate effort. We are on the frontline of climate change impacts. Meanwhile in our public and political debate, obfuscation and scaremongering must not win out over analysis and strategy. We need a real national conversation about what role Australia can play in the low-carbon economy of the future. We need to understand where the economic opportunities lie, we need a blueprint for a low-carbon energy and industrial system to encourage investors. And we will need to support the regions and communities where economic activity will dry up, particularly coal regions. Why are we not getting there? Tony Abbott put the finger on it in his concession speech after losing his seat in parliament. “Where climate change is a moral issue we Liberals do it tough. But where climate change is an economic issue we do very well,” said the man who gained the prime ministership by stoking fear about a carbon tax. In electorates that are not affluent, fear about cuts to income are potent. Labor focused on strong ambition for climate outcomes but did not talk much about how to achieve it, or the costs and benefits. It got stung by shoddy claims that a strong emissions target would be very costly, to which Labor did not have a good answer. Cutting emissions can be achieved with low economic cost and some direct benefits, even before considering climate damages avoided. Wind and solar power are now by far the cheapest ways to produce electricity from newly built plants in Australia. A sensible policy would be to facilitate the rapid investment in renewables, guide an orderly exit from coal, and encourage industry to move to zero-carbon energy sources. Various state governments see it that way. If the do-nothing approach prevails, the national electricity market will continue to be in a mess. More coal power stations will exit suddenly when old equipment fails. Replacement investment in renewables and storage will not be ready, causing power prices to shoot up like they did after the closure of Hazelwood. Without a low-carbon roadmap, money spent ensuring reliability of the grid will not be what is needed long term. The federal government may again be tempted to subsidise the refurbishment of old coal plants, and to lavish coal subsidies on Queensland. The incumbent energy industries will see their profits will remain high. Consumers, energy-using businesses and taxpayers will pay the bill, and emissions will be unnecessarily high. With effective policy, things could be very different. Australia could meet practically all of its energy use from solar and wind power. We could use green electricity and renewables-based hydrogen in industry and in transport. We could build up an industry that produces green hydrogen, ammonia, aluminium and steel for export to countries who are less fortunate than Australia in their endowment with renewable energy opportunities. Those industries could grow larger than the coal and gas industry now is. They could last indefinitely and help the world decarbonise. To the many people in Australia who care deeply about climate change and dedicate some of their life to finding solutions, the election outcome will seem like a hard blow. But do not despair, do not retreat. Continue your work, with objectivity, integrity and dedication. Countries that produce and export large amounts of fossil fuels have an uphill battle for forward looking policy on climate. But the opportunities in the global shift to clean energy are compelling, and coal is not the future. Let’s insist on having that national conversation. • Frank Jotzo is the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University"

"When a letter from BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, Larry Fink, landed in inboxes in January saying that the world’s biggest investor would no longer invest in companies that are not compliant with the Paris climate agreement, people took notice. The media jumped on the announcement, which appeared to herald a new era of finance facing up to the perils of the climate emergency. The letter was a hoax, carried out by the Yes Men, a group of pranksters with a history of embarrassing big companies. But while the message was fake, the concern behind it was not: environmental campaigners see BlackRock as a key obstacle to progress on meeting climate crisis goals. Now they are stepping up the pressure on the world’s biggest asset manager – which faces its shareholders at its annual meeting on Thursday – to use its influence on some of the world’s biggest polluters, as it has done previously on issues such as executive pay. Fink, who was paid $24m (£18.8m) in 2018, began BlackRock as part of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity group, and spun it out in 1995. Since then, New York-based BlackRock has risen to become an investing behemoth, controlling $6.5tn in assets – a value more than twice the annual output of the UK economy. That staggering size has placed BlackRock at the heart of the global fossil fuel industry: it is the largest investor in coal worldwide, according to InfluenceMap, an environmental campaign group, and has by far the highest density of coal holdings of the world’s 10 largest investors. BlackRock effectively owns 2.1bn tonnes of thermal coal reserves, based on the size of its stakes in major miners. BlackRock is counted among the top three shareholders in every oil “supermajor” bar France’s Total, and is among the top 10 shareholders in seven of the 10 biggest coal producers, according to Guardian analysis of data from financial information firm S&P. Yet Fink, 66, who moves in US Democrat political circles, argues it is not his company’s duty to fight the climate emergency. In the real version of his annual letter to shareholders, published in January, Fink said that his overriding duty is to make customers money. “Our firm is built to protect and grow the value of our clients’ assets,” Fink wrote. “We often get approached by special interest groups who advocate for BlackRock to vote with them on a cause. In many cases, I or other senior managers might agree with that same cause – or we might strongly disagree – but our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter here. Our decisions are driven solely by our fiduciary duty to our clients.” After publication of this article, BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify it that considers climate change a significant investment risk that has the potential to impact the long-term value of many companies. Critics argue this approach is not financially sustainable in the long term, given the likelihood that the climate crisis is expected to make some business models redundant or even illegal through measures such as bans on petrol- and diesel-powered cars or fossil fuel companies being forced to leave oil in the ground. Lauren Compere, a managing director at Boston Common Asset Management, a US investor, said investor action on the climate emergency was “not about being political”, but was rather a case of looking at the risks presented by the crisis to savers’ assets. Compere, whose job involves engaging with companies over issues such as the climate crisis, said other investment funds could put greater pressure on businesses. “There are big players that could be more proactive, more consistent, and frankly should probably be leveraging their assets more,” she said. “Across the globe it is not acceptable to sit on the fence not leveraging your assets.” Casey Harrell, a senior campaigner at the Sunrise Project, part of a broad coalition of groups putting pressure on BlackRock’s environmental record, said: “There is a real big disconnect between words and deeds that needs to be highlighted.” Investment strategies that follow environmentally friendly companies should be part of BlackRock’s core offer to clients, rather than an option they must actively choose, he added. BlackRock has acknowledged the growing demand for greener investment products as it tries to gain millennials as customers and employees. In October 2017 it hired Barack Obama’s former climate change adviser, Brian Deese, to be managing director of its sustainable investing business, which now has $32bn in assets under management. Former UK chancellor George Osborne is another part-time employee, earning £650,000 a year, although climate crisis was not included on the list of topics – such as China and European politics – that he is advising on. Regarding investment attitudes towards companies that are undeniably contributing to the climate emergency, BlackRock and other major investors argue it is better to push for change from within. After publication BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify that the large majority of its equity holdings are held through index funds and ETFs, which are designed to track indices controlled by third parties in which customers have chosen to invest. As a result, BlackRock focuses on engaging with companies to understand how they are managing material risks, including climate related risks, a spokeswoman said. With BlackRock’s scale, meaningful engagement would be a gargantuan task. BlackRock’s stewardship team of 43 people – which decides how BlackRock votes at shareholder meetings – must cover every major listed company in the world across 90 markets. When it does engage, evidence of progress is limited. BlackRock said it had 232 “engagements” with companies on climate-related matters during the year to June 2018. Only a fifth of the companies bothered to respond in “substantive fashion” to requests to disclose climate risks to their businesses – or to say why they did not plan to do so. BlackRock could not provide any quantitative evidence that its engagement approach was working. Research by Majority Action, a pressure group, found that BlackRock lags many of its rivals in supporting climate-related resolutions.In the year ending 31 August 2018, BlackRock supported only 23% of climate crisis reporting proposals – to make companies report their carbon dioxide emissions or their exposure to climate emergency-related risks – compared with 33% at US-based Vanguard and 85% at the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal & General. In some cases BlackRock has stood in the way of environmental action. The company voted against a 2018 proposal for Royal Dutch Shell to carry out detailed scenario planning for a world affected by temperature rises of 2°C, “because we found the proposal overly prescriptive”. In the case of US oil company Chevron, BlackRock was among the investors that could have tipped the balance in favour of imposing targets for reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas. Some 45% of shareholders voted in favour, but BlackRock and Vanguard, both of which held more than 6% of the votes, opposed the motion. In a statement to the Guardian, BlackRock said it was better, given the firm’s commitment to long-term investment in businesses, to discuss climate policy with companies than to challenge them through shareholder resolutions. “Given the multi-year nature of the energy transition and the challenge of addressing climate change, our process emphasises engagement before voting because we find that is the most effective way to achieve productive outcomes in our clients’ long-term interests.” While BlackRock is by no means the only investor dragging its feet on climate issues, its power and totemic place at the top of the investment world mean it could have an outsized impact, according to activists. “There’s a bit of a herding mentality in the institutional investors,” said Jeanne Martin, a senior campaigner on fossil fuels at ShareAction, a responsible investment charity. “If they start using their shareholder rights at these companies that would really shift the dial.” • This article was amended on 23 May 2019 to insert clarifications from BlackRock."
"The chief executive of National Grid has warned that Labour’s renationalisation proposals would hold back the UK’s move to cleaner energy and mean higher prices for customers, as the company reported an £1.8bn annual profit. National Grid, which runs the UK’s national electricity network, said its profit for the 12 months to 31 March was down by nearly a third from £2.7bn the year before. It wrote off £137m of costs spent to connect two nuclear UK projects in Cumbria and Wales that were cancelled, and also took a financial hit from a seven-month labour dispute at its US business. Mounting a staunch defence against Labour’s proposals to renationalise the FTSE 100 company, John Pettigrew, the chief executive, described them as a huge distraction. He indicated that nationalising power networks could lead to higher costs, which would be passed on to consumers, who pay for energy transmission through their utility bills. “It’s very clear that it will not either accelerate the decarbonisation agenda in the UK, not will it result in lower costs for customers. It will delay the decarbonisation in the UK and potentially increase costs for customers.” National Grid became a commercial business in 1990 when the UK’s electricity industry was privatised. It listed on the London stock exchange five years later. Pettigrew said when he started out in the industry 30 years ago, there was “slow decision making, bureaucracy and it felt like Yes Minister”. He added: “You need operations that are nimble and can make decisions quickly.” He said the UK had a world-class energy network and stressed that National Grid was ramping up investment to £5bn a year, from £4.5bn last year. It is putting £2.2bn into interconnectors – transmission cables for electricity to other countries – and 90% of the energy delivered by them will be clean. Labour argues that taking the companies that control the UK’s £62bn energy infrastructure back into state ownership is key to decarbonising the economy, and would end the rip-off of customers, with shareholders paid £13bn in dividends over the past five years. Nationalisation would affect National Grid and the network arms of Scottish Power and SSE, which control the pipes and cables that supply homes and businesses with gas and electricity. Labour and consumer groups have criticised National Grid and other energy infrastructure firms for making big profits and paying out large sums to shareholders, while consumers pay for the cost of maintaining the network through their bills. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s shadow business and energy secretary, said about National Grid’s results: “These figures speak for themselves … As a country we face a huge challenge to rapidly decarbonise our energy system while bringing costs down for households – and we simply cannot afford to continue with a privatised monopoly that puts the public at such a structural disadvantage.” National Grid paid £1.2bn in dividends to shareholders last year. Pettigrew acknowledged that the regulatory environment would get tougher. Ofgem wants to reduce the amount of cash which is flowing into the pockets of shareholders, by setting the rate of return paid to investors at 3% to 5%, rather than the current 7%. However, National Grid argues that a fair return would be 5.5%. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “Statutory profit is down markedly, returns on equity are under pressure and the company is hit by a write-off relating to cancelled nuclear power plants. “At least the inflation-protected dividend is intact and reassuringly the company has renewed its commitment to grow the payout in line with RPI inflation going forward.”"

This is a short extension to my last article on Why The Earth Is Cooling. When I first began exploring Modtran, the numbers it produced for downward radiation at the surface seemed to make no sense. It nearly always produced the same number, and I thought that part of the program was broken. On reflection, it became clear that the numbers were correct and that I had fallen into the warmist trap of believing that CO2 really does something to the Greenhouse effect. When the numbers in the very low humidities were charted, all became clear.
Here is what Modtran says about downward or “back” radiation at the Earth’s surface for values of humidity from 0 to 90% and CO2 from 0 to 1000 ppm.

You should notice that the legend cites six traces, but you see only four. That is because the 10, 50, and 90% humidity traces are superimposed. There is very little change in the downward radiation for any humidity from 10% and above and for any CO2 concentration from zero to 1000 ppm, or indeed for any concentration of CO2 up to 10,000 ppm.
Here are the Excel numbers copied from Modtran used to draw the above table:

As you can see, only in the driest desert on Earth will increasing CO2 increase the “back” radiation. Water vapor is by far the strongest greenhouse gas, but it is nearly saturated at 10% humidity. At 10% humidity and above, no amount of CO2 does anything. Most of the humidity on Earth is in that area on the right where doubling CO2 will do nothing to increase the long-wave radiation from the sky. Yet another warmist fail.
Unless the entire planet very soon goes to zero-percent relative humidity, we can go ahead and shut down the global warming hoax industry. If it’s happening, it is hardly because of CO2.

Thankfully, however, there are still a few sane journalists left among us. Kulke is among that very small group and reminds us: “Is the ice melt at the North Pole really unprecendented? There are indications that show otherwise.”
Kulke labels claims of Arctic ice melt reaching “unprecedented” levels “gross nonsense” and reminds us that “during changeovers between warm and cold periods there have been already completely ice-free Arctics on multiple occasions.”
Kulke also quotes Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) physicist Rüdiger Gerdes (in Bremerhaven, Germany) who says the high Arctic temperatures are not only because of man-made greenhouse gases, but also because of natural periodic fluctuations with a rhythm of 60 to 70 years. Kulke quotes Gerdes:
Right now we are in a warm phase.“

Kulke explains, citing NSIDC Director Mark Serreze, “…the summer of 2012 was not especially warm at the higher latitudes” and that the sea ice development was unusual this year. Kulke writes that in March 2012, sea ice area was greater than at any time in the last 5 years and ice melt proceeded normally during almost the entire melt season until early August when a huge storm caused the sea ice area curve to turn sharply downwards to a level never seen – in at least 30 years, that is.
Kulke tells his readers that there’s a lot more to the Arctic than just temperature. Over the years scientists are finding out that it is a lot more complex and involves ocean currents, drifting, precipitation, freezing and thawing cycles. he adds:
That’s why serious scientists refrain from making statements such as ‘like never before’ when discussing the ice situation in the Arctic. Statements about the Arctic during times before satellites are made only with great reservations. About 50 to 70 years ago – a time when there was no systematic measurement and evaluation of temperature and sea ice area – we are finding a growing number of newspaper reports about dramatic disappearances of ice all around the North Pole, and could have been worse than today. The Franz-Josef-Land islands, which can be reached by boat only a few weeks a year, could be reached for 8 months in some years. Especially interesting, during one trip underneath the Arctic ice in the summer of 1958, the US submarine ‘Skate’ was able to emerge in open water 9 times – with one of those directly at the North Pole. At the end of the 1930s, Soviet scientists observed along the Arctic coast that it was 6°C warmer for an extended time than it was during the times of the Nansen ice drift  – somewhat warmer than today. The time period corresponds to the rhythm that AWI scientist Gerdes mentions.”
And Kulke cites Steven Goddard’s blog:
At the website www.real-science.com/arctic“ there’s an entire series of international newspaper article facsimiles from various years that document a number of profound Arctic climate fluctuaions earlier. The tenor of those articles, like today: The sea ice at the North Pole threatens to disappear”.
After a years-long spell where climate catastrophe alarmism had to go without without new record data, it can now enjoy a warm shower with Arctic sea ice. But on whether we are dealing with a record that goes way back, that is however very much in question.”

It’s  utterly disgraceful that the VP of the US would stoop so low. Biden symbolizes what’s wrong with science today. Either it is being run by absolute ignoramuses, or just plain deceitful people. The evidence indicates it’s the latter.
According to Biden, government running science can only produce wonderful miracles, and quickly – in just a few years!

Already today they have the means to control global climate, they say. A world without ills awaits you! What are you waiting for?
Excerpts of Joe Biden speaking at Cypress Bay High School graduation ceremony (emphasis added, and not in order):
Imagine the breakthroughs that are on the horizon and just beyond it. Imagine by the time you’re in a position to buy your first home, putting a roof of solar shingles that will cost no more than today’s ordinary shingles that will be able to power your home, heating, cooling, running appliances at a fraction of the cost your parents pay today.  Imagine a world in which hunger is vanquished by crops that don’t depend on the soil or water or fertilizer or pesticides to thrive! They’re just around the corner. Imagine famine being a memory — and with it, the end of so much war and conflict that plagues so much parts of the world! Imagine a day when the lightweight materials, cleaner fuels, [and] advanced engines simultaneously make our air cleaner — allowing us to go the equivalent of hundreds of miles to the gallon. And maybe, most importantly, freeing us from our dependence on foreign oil and all that entails for a nation. Imagine a day within your lifetime when doctors can and will engineer your white blood cells to attack cancer cells and leave healthy cells untouched, allowing cancer patients to live out a full life without undergoing the difficulty some of you observe, painful chemotherapy and radiation procedures. Imagine a day, when in your, doctors are able to regenerate entire body parts and limbs that have been damaged and lost, not only saving tens of thousands of lives, but restoring the thousands of  our Iraq and Afghan veterans coming back in need of prostheses, so they will be able to live a full and ambulatory life.”
If his audience believes all that, then those graduation caps really need to be replaced with dunce hats.
Remember:  if anything ever happened to Obama, he’d be President! With a little luck, only another half year before we’re out of the woods.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls was interviewed by Bettina Hahne-Waldscheck of the Swiss magazine “factum“.I’ve translated and summarized the interview, paraphrasing for brevity.
factum: You’ve been criticising the theory of man-made global warming for years. How did you become skeptical?
Puls: Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data – first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it. The CO2-climate hysteria in Germany is propagated by people who are in it for lots of money, attention and power.
factum: Is there really climate change?
Puls: Climate change is normal. There have always been phases of climate warming, many that even far exceeded the extent we see today. But there hasn’t been any warming since 1998. In fact the IPCC suppliers of data even show a slight cooling.
factum: The IPCC is projecting 0.2°C warming per decade, i.e. 2 to 4°C by the year 2100. What’s your view?
Puls: These are speculative model projections, so-called scenarios – and not prognoses. Because of climate’s high complexity, reliable prognoses just aren’t possible. Nature does what it wants, and not what the models present as prophesy. The entire CO2-debate is nonsense. Even if CO2 were doubled, the temperature would rise only 1°C. The remainder of the IPCC’s assumed warming is based purely on speculative amplification mechanisms. Even though CO2 has risen, there has been no warming in 13 years.
factum: How does sea level rise look?
Puls: Sea level rise has slowed down. Moreover, it has dropped a half centimeter over the last 2 years. It’s important to remember that mean sea level is a calculated magnitude, and not a measured one.  There are a great number of factors that influence sea level, e.g. tectonic processes, continental shifting, wind currents, passats, volcanoes. Climate change is only one of ten factors.
factum: What have we measured at the North Sea?
Puls: In the last 400 years, sea level at the North Sea coast has risen about 1.40 meters. That’s about 35 centimeters per century. In the last 100 years, the North Sea has risen only 25 centimeters.
factum: Does the sea level rise have anything to do with the melting North Pole?
Puls: That’s a misleading conclusion. Even if the entire North Pole melted, there would be no sea level rise because of the principles of buoyancy.
factum: Is the melting of the glaciers in the Alps caused by global warming?
Puls: There are many factors at play. As one climbs a mountain, the temperature drops about 0.65°C per 100 meters. Over the last 100 years it has gotten about 0.75°C warmer and so the temperature boundary has shifted up about 100 meters. But observations tell us that also ice 1000 meters up and higher has melted. Clearly there are other reasons for this, namely soot and dust. But soot and dust do not only have anthropogenic origins; they are also caused by nature via volcanoes, dust storms and wildfires. Advancing and retreating of glaciers have always taken place throughout the Earth’s history. Glaciology studies clearly show that glaciers over the last 10,0000 years were smaller on average than today.
factum: In your view, melting Antarctic sea ice and the fracture of a huge iceberg 3 years ago are nothing to worry about?

Puls: To the contrary, the Antarctic ice cap has grown both in area and volume over the last 30 years, and temperature has declined. This 30-year trend is clear to see. The Amundsen Scott Station of the USA shows that temperature has been declining there since 1957. 90% of the Earth’s ice is stored in Antarctica, which is one and half times larger than Europe.
factum: Then why do we always read it is getting warmer down there?
Puls: Here they are only talking about the West Antarctic peninsula, which is where the big chunk of ice broke off in 2008 – from the Wilkins-Shelf. This area is hardly 1% of the entire area of Antarctica, but it is exposed to Southern Hemisphere west wind drift and some of the strongest storms on the planet.
factum: What causes such massive chunks of ice to break off?
Puls: There are lots of factors, among them the intensity of the west wind fluctuations. These west winds have intensified over the last 20 years as part of natural ocean and atmospheric cycles, and so it has gotten warmer on the west coast of the Antarctic peninsula. A second factor are the larger waves associated with the stronger storms. The waves are more powerful and so they break off more ice. All these causes are meteorological and physical, and have nothing to do with a climate catastrophe.
factum: Then such ice breaks had to have occurred in the past too?
Puls: This has been going on for thousands of years, also in the 1970s, back when all the talk was about “global cooling”. Back then there were breaks with ice chunks hundreds of square kilometres in area. People were even discussing the possibilities of towing these huge ice chunks to dry countries like South Africa or Namibia in order to use them as a drinking water supply.
factum: What about all the media photos of polar bears losing their ice?
Puls: That is one of the worst myths used for generating climate hysteria. Polar bears don’t eat ice, they eat seals. Polar bears go hungry if we shoot their food supply of seals. The polar bear population has increased with moderately rising temperatures, from 5000 50 years ago to 25,000 today.
factum: But it is true that unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is melting?
Puls: It has been melting for 30 years. That also happened twice already in the last 150 years. The low point was reached in 2007 and the ice has since begun to recover. There have always been phases of Arctic melting. Between 900 and 1300 Greenland was green on the edges and the Vikings settled there.
factum: And what do you say about the alleged expanding deserts?
Puls: That doesn”t exist. For example the Sahara is shrinking and has lost in the north an area as large as Germany over the last 20 years. The same is true in the South Sahara. The famine that struck Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia was mainly caused by the leasing of large swaths of land to large international corporations so that they could grow crops for biofuels for Europe, and by war. But it is much easier for prosperous Europe to blame the world’s political failures on a fictional climate catastrophe instead.
factum: So we don’t need to do anything against climate change?
Puls: There’s nothing we can do to stop it. Scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob. Many confuse environmental protection with climate protection. it’s impossible to protect the climate, but we can protect the environment and our drinking water. On the debate concerning alternative energies, which is sensible, it is often driven by the irrational climate debate. One has nothing to do with the other.

Commissar Connie demands your data – or else face enforcement action.
EU Environment Commissar Connie Hedegaard, of tiny Denmark, is getting tough with economic and political behemoths like USA, China and Russia…to name a few.
Reuters writes:
A new stand-off looms after EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said the carriers would have until the end of this week to submit their data or face enforcement action.”

But at least China is not taking this lightly, as they are threatening to impound EU planes should Hedegaard and all the napoleonic enviro-bureaucrats in the EU not back down.
Wei Zhenzhong, secretary general of the China Air Transport Association, said:
We would not like to see a situation of ‘you hold up my planes and I hold yours’. The government will take at least the same kind of measures, and these anti-sanction moves will be lasting,”
But the EU enviro-bureaucrats think it’s okay to boss the rest of the world around. Reuters writes:
The EU says such action is needed to meet the bloc’s environmental targets and fill a vacuum left by international failure to deal with aviation emissions.”
China has already postponed orders for Airbus planes worth $14 billion. Those are orders Boeing surely has an eye on. Expect Hedegaard to come under lots of pressure from other EU pols more concerned about jobs and urgently work on a face-saving measure.

Alabama sends a message on sovereignty to UN.
And thanks to the great state of Alabama! I know where to move next.
==============================================

The State of Alabama and all political subdivisions may not adopt or implement policy recommendations that deliberately or inadvertently infringe or restrict private property rights without due process, as may be required by policy recommendations originating in, or traceable to ‘Agenda 21,’ “
[…] Public support for the Alabama law was overwhelming and bipartisan […] the law points out, the UN has enlisted a broad array of non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations in its effort to foist Agenda 21 on the world — most notably a Germany-based group called ICLEI […] Meanwhile, local governments across America — under intense pressure from citizens and activist groups — are slowly awakening to what critics call the “dangers” of the UN scheme. Dozens of cities and counties have withdrawn from ICLEI in recent years, and as awareness continues to grow, that trend is expected to accelerate.”

"“The greatest insult to a sitting US president ever.” It’s not often that I turn to the words of Nigel Farage to seek confirmation I might be involved in doing something right, but last July was different. It was a few days before Donald Trump was due to touch down for his first visit to British shores since his election to office. And things weren’t quite going to plan. Britain was in thrall to the story of whether a 20ft-high bright orange helium balloon would be given permission to soar above Parliament Square in central London: Trump Baby had arrived.  The baby was lovingly crafted to pierce the force field of wilful ignorance and moral vacuity that guards Trump’s fragile ego – it seemed to capture in one adept symbol the public’s disdain for a man who might be beyond reason but, as it turned out, was not beyond mockery. It was suddenly everywhere: Farage talked about it on LBC; journalists asked the American ambassador about it; and even Trump himself mentioned it in an interview with the Sun, saying, “I guess when they put out blimps … to make me feel unwelcome, [there’s] no reason for me to go to London.” Between that and the tens of thousands of diverse people who poured on to London’s streets – on a working day – in one of the biggest demonstrations since 2003’s Stop the War march, you’d be forgiven for wondering if the sexual predator-in-chief might just have got the message. But it seems he hasn’t. In a fortnight’s time Trump will be returning to the UK to take up the official invitation of a full state visit. With political fatigue reigning over the general public – and with so many progressive organisers exhausted by the relentless campaigning demanded by a social and ecological reality that threatens the lives and wellbeing of almost everyone – the task of standing up once again to Trump and his politics might feel overwhelming. But it is not optional. There is no one who signifies the trashing of morals and the abuse of every power to hand, in service of a blindingly arrogant, deceitful and cowardly self-interest, more than Trump. But he is more than a signal. For the communities thrown under the bus by Trumpism and its supporters, his policies mean separation from family, climate breakdown, lives cut short by gun violence and a lack of healthcare. That is why we are asking the public to help Trump Baby fly once again. But first (somewhat ironically), we need to do a deal. Flying an inflatable was only ever meant to cut the president down to size, we always knew that it needed to form part of a more active resistance to Trump’s policies. So while Trump Baby may well lay claim to being the most politically impactful inflatable of all time, we recognise that is limited, and we can do so much more with it. That’s where you come in. We’ve identified six organisations working across Islamophobia, misogyny, the climate crisis, abortion rights and migrants’ rights which need that support. Groups such as the Sunrise Movement in the USA which is pushing for a Green New Deal, Jawaab which is building a movement against Islamophobia, and reproductive rights group Planned Parenthood. We’re asking everyone to help meet a £30,000 fund-raising target to channel real resources in to protecting the people in Trump’s sights. Trump Baby started as a bit of fun, but we are deadly serious about supporting communities and campaigns in need of our solidarity, assistance and love. If we hit that target by 3 June – the day of Trump’s arrival – then the very next day Trump Baby will fly. And Trump Baby must fly. • Nona Hurkmans is a spokeswoman for the Trump Baby team"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s early September, mornings are cooling down, days are getting shorter and the kids are back in school. What are fall and winter going to be like? The following National Weather Service chart shows the following:

Indications a cold winter lies ahead for Europe.
Axel Bojanowski of Der Spiegel here also writes that two climate scientists, Hans Graf of the University of Cambridge and Davide Zanchettin of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, have developed a rule of thumb for predicting if it’s going to be cold or mild for the entire winter. How is this possible? Spiegel writes:
Graf and Zanchettin have discovered a weather kitchen that is mainly responsible for cooking up the winter for Central Europe. That kitchen is located on the other side of the planet in the Pacific the two climatologists report in a study in the “Journal of Geophysical Research”, which they submitted in the summer of 2011.”
They say it depends on the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which impacts weather globally.
According to Graf und Zanchettin: “After an El Niño over the Central Pacific, there’s a frosty winter in Europe – temperatures are on average 3 to 4°C lower than during other winters. Winters after El Niños are the coldest in Germany.”

Spiegel summarizes the rule of thumb the scientists use:
In Germany there’s a frosty, snowy winter when the following three conditions are fulfilled:
1.) For months there’s been an El Niño, meaning the ocean water surface is markedly warmer than usual.
2.) If the warm water spreads eastwards all the way to the coast of South America, then the chances for a cold winter in Central Europe drop off.
3.) There’s been no major volcano eruption – which would disrupt weather patterns.”
Leading climatologists Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel and Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center for Coastal Research, both in Germany, found the study to be of great interest. So once again Mr. Co2 warming Latif agrees that other factors drive the climate. An alarmist one day, and a scientist the next.
We’ll find out soon enough if Graf’s and Zanchettin’s rule will work for this coming winter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal climate, we are told, was more or less constant before man began emitting greenhouse gases. This is what a number of IPCC scientists tried (and are still trying) to tell us with their fabricated hockey sticks.

A  new 9170-year paleohydrologic reconstruction by Kirby et al is out. The team of scientists have examined deposits from Lower Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains, in southwest United States. These mountains are the source region for the Mojave River.
The authors write in the abstract that “the new multi-proxy record is characterized by alternating organic-rich/carbonate-rich sediment units”, which they say can be interpreted “to reflect hydrologically-forced changes in the lake’s depositional environment”.
What result did they find? (My emphasis):
Our interpretation of the proxy data indicates nine decadal-to-multi-centennial pluvial episodes [periods of heavy precipitation] over the past 9170 cal yr BP. Of these nine inferred pluvials, five are interpreted as more pronounced based on their combined proxy interpretations: (PE-V) 9170?–8250, (PE-IV) 7000–6400, (PE-III) 3350–3000, (PE-II) 850–700, and (PE-I) 500–476 (top of core) cal yr BP.”

This tells us that precipitation amounts were high in the region of the San Bernardino mountains during those periods. Moreover, the authors add that this was not a locally isolated phenomenon, but was widespread over the general region:
Our comparison extends north also to Tulare Lake, which drains the southcentral-western Sierra Nevada Mountains. This temporally and spatially coherent signal indicates that a similar climate forcing acted to increase regional wetness at various times during the past 9170 cal yr BP. […] Holocene pluvial episodes are associated with changing the frequency of large winter storms that track across a broad region at decadal-to-multi-centennial timescales.”
Centennial time scale? This would indicate something more at work than ocean cycles, which are internal within the climate system, and suggests that other natural, external cycles are at work. However, IPCC scientists like to suggest that these natural factors no longer play a role today, that they stopped working a hundred years ago, and so leave them out of their climate models.
According to the German-language Wikipedia, in paleoclimatology pluvials are usually in connection with unusually strong precipitation – geologically shown to have occurred mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Good examples are areas that are deserts today, e.g. the mudpans of the Sahara, Lake Bonneville in western Utah, Lake Moeris Faiyum, Egypt, and Lake Chad.
Overall the cold periods on the Earth were less wet than the warm periods.
All that is left to do is to compare the results of the new study to solar activity over the last ten thousand years. Maybe we’ll find that there was cyclic volcanic activity driving it all!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Hans H.J. Labohm has written an overview, soon to appear in Energy and Environment Journal titled: Climate Scepticism in Europe.

Dr. Hans Labohm says climate science scepticism is “very much alive and kicking” in Europe.
The opening sentences set the tone in no uncertain terms. He calls the notion of dangerous manmade global warming a “delusion”, a science that has been plagued by “cherry–picking, spin-doctoring and scare–mongering by the United Nations’ IPCC and other climate alarmists.”
In his analysis, Dr. Labohm analyzes the sceptic movement in various European countries and believes that “the tide seems to be turning” and that it has “gained considerable ground”. But the obstacles in Europe are still huge, as almost “all political parties are toeing the global warming line”.  Labohm writes that “sceptical views – even from well-known scientists with impeccable credentials – tend to be ignored and/or actively suppressed by governments, academia and the media.” However, it appears that the obstacles can be overcome. Labohm adds, citing a variety of recent public opinion surveys:
Over the last few years a disconnect has been growing between public opinion and official climate policy. Despite massive climate change propaganda, less and less people seem to be concerned about the putative threat of an imminent climate catastrophe.”
Labohm begins his look at Europe by first focusing on Russia, where he says Russian scientists aren’t at all timid about expressing their scepticism. Some Russian scientists openly say that a little ice age is imminent in the coming decades, and adds that “it was no surprise that the Russians have announced to drop out of Kyoto”.
Sweden also has a small but very vocal group of sceptics including: Göran Ahlgren, Jonny Fagerström, Per Welander, Tage Andersson, Per-Olof, Eriksson, Sten Kaijser, Wibjörn Karlén, Ingemar Nordin, Åke Ortmark, Carl-Gustaf Ribbing, Peter Stilbs, Maggie Thauersköld and Fred Goldberg. Another harsh critic of global warming science is Axel Mörner. In Denmark there are renowned researchers Bjørn Lomborg, Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen.
Labohm then looks at the German speaking part of Europe, where he writes that in Switzerland two associations are active in opposing AGW. One association is the Swiss branch of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, NIPCC Suisse, which makes use of the research work of the NIPCC and its associates under Fred Singer.” Other influential associations in the German speaking area include the Initiative Against the Climate Scam, IKLIS.8, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), which “plays a central role” and “runs an excellent website and has organised successful climate conferences”.

//-->




Labohm’s report also looks at the development of Germany’s two most prominent and visible sceptics: Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt (green activist) and Dr. Sebastian Lüning (geologist) who published their “bombshell book ‘Die Kalte Sonne’ (The Cold Sun’)”, which was extensively covered by renowned media such as Bild, Die Welt, and Der Spiegel.
Moreover, the warmists recently took one to the chin, as Stefan Rahmstorf, who lavishly uses “ad hominem attacks and insinuations that his opponents lack qualifications and/or are being paid by industry”, lost a court case against science journalist Irene Meichsner, who had sued Rahmstorf “for spreading false accusations of inaccurate reporting”.
France also has vocal skeptics with Claude Allègre (former minister of education), Vincent Courtillot and Jean-Louis Le Mouël. Labohm also writes that in Great Britain “climate scepticism is very much alive and kicking”, thanks to the massive efforts of Lord Monckton, Benny Peiser, Martin Durkin and Andrew Montford, to name a few.
Fortunately, the climate science debate is not hopelessly polarized everywhere. Take the Netherlands for example. Labohm writes:
In my own country, The Netherlands, the relationship between protagonists and antagonists of the AGW hypothesis has markedly improved over the last few years. In line with the Dutch tradition of consensus-seeking (‘polder culture’), it has been possible to establish something close to a real dialogue between the two camps, which is pretty unique in the world. Climate scepticism has even received official recognition, thus undermining the information monopoly of climate alarmists.”
At the end of the analysis, Labohm tells us why European diplomacy is creating “a convenient alibi to pull out of the Kyoto process at some point in the future, without losing face”. You’ll have to read his overview when it is published to find out why. So don’t expect much out of Doha.
Finally, Labohm also calls Europe’s emissions trading system (ETS) a failure: “Europe’s experience with ETS is dismal. The system is expensive and prone to massive fraud. Moreover it did not stop the increase in Europe’s CO2 emissions”.
Overall, the Energy and Environment report by Labohm is 7 pages chock-full with analyses of the skeptic movement in Europe. Best of all, it provides vast encouragement and motivation to those seeking to continue pushing the debate on climate science. The battle is definitely downhill.

"Tomorrow, schoolchildren and students will be out on the streets again, in huge numbers, in 150 countries, at over 4,000 events, demanding that governments immediately provide a safe pathway to stay within 1.5C of global heating. We spent weeks and months preparing for this day. We spent uncountable hours organising and mobilising when we could have just hung out with our friends or studied for school.  We don’t feel like we have a choice: it’s been years of talking, countless negotiations, empty deals on climate change and fossil fuel companies being given free rides to drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit. Politicians have known about climate change for decades. They have willingly handed over their responsibility for our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence. We have learned that if we don’t start acting for our future, nobody else will make the first move. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. Once again our voices are being heard on the streets, but it is not just up to us. We feel a lot of adults haven’t quite understood that we young people won’t hold off the climate crisis ourselves. Sorry if this is inconvenient for you. But this is not a single-generation job. It’s humanity’s job. We young people can contribute to a larger fight and that can make a huge difference. So this is our invitation. Starting on Friday 20 September we will kickstart a week of climate action with a worldwide strike for the climate. We’re asking adults to step up alongside us. There are many different plans under way in different parts of the world for adults to join together and step up and out of your comfort zone for our climate. Let’s all join together, with your neighbours, co-workers, friends, family and go out on to the streets to make your voices heard and make this a turning point in our history. This is about crossing lines – it’s about rebelling wherever one can rebel. It’s not about saying “Yeah, what the kids do is great, if I was young I would have totally joined in.” It doesn’t help, but everyone can and must help. During the French revolution mothers flooded the streets for their children. Today we children are fighting for ourselves, but so many of our parents are busy discussing whether our grades are good, or a new diet or what happened in the Game of Thrones finale – while the planet burns. This moment has to happen. Last year’s UN intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on global warming was clear about the unprecedented dangers of going beyond 1.5C of global heating. Emissions must drop rapidly – so that by the time we are in our mid- and late-20s we are living in a completely transformed world. But to change everything, we need everyone. It is time for all of us to unleash mass resistance – we have shown that collective action does work. We need to escalate the pressure to make sure that change happens, and we must escalate together. So this is our chance – join us on climate strike this September. People have risen up before to demand action and make change; if we do so in numbers we have a chance. If we care, we must do more than say we do. We must act. This won’t be the last day we need to take to the streets, but it will be a new beginning. We’re counting on you. • Greta Thunberg, Kyra Gantois, Luisa Neubauer, Eslem Demirel, Vanessa Nakate, Noga Levy-Rappoport, Isra Hirsi, Zhang Tingwei, Angela Valenzuela, Martial Breton, Nurul Fitrah Marican, Asees Kandhari, Jessica Dewhurst, Alexandria Villasenor, Jonas Kampus, George Bond, Lena Bühler, Kallan Benson, Linus Dolder, Beth Irving, Zel Whiting, Marenthe Middelhoff, Lubna Wasim, Radhika Castle, Parvez Patel, Wu Chun-Hei, Anjali Pant, Tristan Vanoni, Luca Salis, Brian Wallang, Anisha George, Hiroto Inoue, Haven Coleman, Maddy Fernands, Bhavreen Malhotra Kandhari, Feliquan Charlemagne, Salomée Levy, Karla Stephan, Anya Sastry, Claudio Ramirez Betancourt, Vicente Gamboa Soto, Julia Weder, Lilly Platt, Balder Claassen, Kassel Hingee, Maria Astefanoaei and Pavol Mulinka are youth activists for Fridays for Future"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow often do we hear screams “head for the hills, sea levels are rising fast!” from alarmists like James Extreme Hansen of GISS and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)?
Yet, study after study show that there is no evidence of accelerating sea level rise. All sea level fluctuations are within the normal range of variation. Nothing unusual is happening.
The latest study is by Albrecht et al 2011, Determining sea level change in the German Bight appearing in the journal Ocean Dynamics 61: 2037-2050. Hat-tip: http://www.co2science.org.
The study focused on regional mean sea level (RMSL) in the German Bight of the North Sea. Albrecht et al based their work on homogenized annual mean sea level data for the period 1843-2008 acquired by 15 tide gauges.
According to CO2 Science, the authors determined that “regional mean sea level increased at rates between 1.64 and 1.74 mm/year with a 90% confidence range of 0.28 mm/year in each case.”  As for an acceleration in RMSL rise within the past few decades, CO2 Science writes:
…they note that in terms of 20-year trends, the most recent rates are ‘relatively high.’  However, they report that these rates “are not unusual and that similar rates could also be identified earlier in the record.”

I don’t recall seeing anything about this in the papers on on TV. The authors also note:
…the same conclusion concerning a possible acceleration in the recent past was drawn by Haigh et al. (2009) for the North Sea region of the English Channel.”
A press release by the Institute of Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht, Germany also said the same 2 months ago, based on the same data I assume (emphasis added):
A group of Geesthacht coastal researchers, together with engineers from the University of Siegen, has recently carried out an analysis of the rise in sea levels in the German Bight. All reliable water level measurements were evaluated for the first time, in order to determine how the mean sea level of the German Bight has changed. According to this evaluation, the sea level rose by approx. 20 centimetres in the last century, in recent times higher than in the years around 1960. However, similarly high increases in levels also occurred in the first half of the 20th century. They are, therefore, not unusual.”
There seem to be natural cycles at work here.
And strange on how all the models show acceleration, but the real data do not.

"An inadequate public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in the UK is forcing drivers to take risks by opting for highly dangerous alternatives at home, an electrical safety charity has warned. Three-quarters of those who resort to charging from their home mains supply using a domestic extension lead even admit to risky “daisy-chaining” – using multiple extension leads plugged into one another – to reach their car, according to a survey by Electrical Safety First.  It is urging the government to expand the national network of public charging points as its findings reveal the growth rate of licensed plug-in vehicles is outstripping the number of charging points available. Analysis of data from the Department for Transport (DfT) and Zap-Map has revealed the growth rate of licensed plug-in vehicles to be almost six times faster over the last five years than that of public charging-point locations in the UK. In its survey of 1,500 electric vehicle owners – including both all-electric and hybrids – 74% of respondents said the shortage of public charging points near their home had led them to use domestic multi-socket extension leads, not suitable for outdoor use, to charge from the mains in their home. This is despite almost nine out of 10 respondents admitting they were aware these should not be used outdoors. Over half of electric vehicle users who charge using an extension lead, meanwhile, said they had left cables running to their vehicle in the rain. In addition, 75% of those who charge with a domestic extension lead admit daisy-chaining to reach their vehicle, despite it being advised against in all circumstances due to the risk of electrocution and fire. The latest figures reveal the number of charging point locations ranges from 147 per 100km2 in London (and 2.6 per 10,000 residents) to 1.55 per 100km2 (1.03 per 10,000 residents) in Wales. Electric vehicles are seen as key to government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. It says it wants all cars to be effectively zero emission by 2040. Electrical Safety First urges consumers to take advantage of government grants to help fund the cost of a specially designed home charging point, which is safer than charging from the mains. Councils play an important role in providing charging infrastructure, while other charging points are provided by supermarkets or shopping centres. But earlier this year the Guardian revealed at least a quarter of local authorities in England and Wales had put a brake on the expansion of charging networks for electric vehicles, largely because of budget cuts. A DfT spokesperson said: “Drivers should be able to charge their electric vehicles on a network that is accessible, reliable, affordable and safe, and almost 1,000 public connectors have been installed in the last 30 days alone. “Nearly 120,000 charge points have been installed across the UK to date and we are continuing to accelerate the growth of infrastructure through a range of initiatives, including up to £500 off the upfront cost of residential installations.”"
"New York prides itself on being a green city. It is often ranked as the most sustainable city in the US: as a result of its density and its admirable (if financially challenged) public transit system, New Yorkers have extremely low carbon emissions per capita. Adding to its green laurels, the city council’s recent Climate Mobilization Act requires pollution-cutting retrofits on big dirty buildings – which are responsible for nearly 70% of the city’s carbon emissions. But NYC could be doing a lot more to go green – and fight extreme economic inequality at the same time. Room for progress is most evident in the energy sector. NYC’s electric grid is polluting and inefficient, relying heavily on fossil fuels and ageing infrastructure. With the state’s oldest and dirtiest power plants concentrated in New York City’s low-income communities and communities of color, it is no surprise that each year more New Yorkers are killed by pollution from electricity generation than in any other major city in America. The system is also economically unjust: with some of the highest electricity rates in the nation, New York City saw more than two million shut-off notices in 2018 alone, and almost half a million families pay more than they can afford in energy costs.  Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced an energy plan that would potentially move New York City a big step in the wrong direction. In a little-discussed provision of the city’s latest OneNYC sustainability plan, Mayor de Blasio commits to powering 100% of City government operations with “clean” hydroelectric power from Canadian state company Hydro-Québec. According to the mayor, this would help the city move away from coal and gas, in the process cutting emissions by 40% over the next decade. What’s not to like? The mayor’s proposal calls for construction of a 330-mile-long underground high-voltage transmission cable, called the Champlain-Hudson Power Express (CHPE), to bring power from Canada down to NYC. The project, which is slated to cost nearly $20bn, would lock NYC into dependence on Canadian hydropower long-term, while diminishing the ability for local offshore wind, solar and other renewable industries to thrive. Furthermore, there is nothing “clean” about hydropower. Building the CHPE would require excavating a trench down the spine of the Hudson Valley, a costly and environmentally disruptive enterprise. Construction could potentially stir up long-buried carcinogenic PCBs in the Hudson River, the nation’s largest superfund site, threatening a recovery process championed by advocates for decades. And the dams that would generate power for NYC have flooded hundreds of miles of boreal forest, annihilating watershed ecosystems and agricultural potential across the north-eastern US. There are also serious questions about how affordable and reliable the CHPE project will be. In April Hydro-Québec’s own managing director admitted to millions in losses from power failures attributed to climate change. With the inevitability of more extreme weather events, city government operations in America’s largest metropolis should not be powered by imported electricity from vulnerable sources hundreds of miles away. Politically, Hydro-Québec’s projects undermine First Nations sovereignty in Canada. Members of the Pessamit Innu First Nation have accused Hydro-Québec of “cultural genocide” for the damage to rivers that have been vital to their economy and cultural traditions for generations. Although Hydro-Québec has promised to supply NYC’s municipal energy needs without building new dams, the city will nonetheless be investing long-term in a company that has been building a series of new dams since the late 2000s. Ninety percent of proposed Canadian hydroelectric projects threaten to expose indigenous communities to poisonous methylmercury directly resulting from damming rivers and flooding forests. This is not the first time Mayor de Blasio squandered a chance to command bold leadership on climate change. The New York Power Authority (NYPA), a public-benefit corporation, supplies power to city government. NYPA recently coordinated the largest procurement of renewable energy in US history, and the city was not an active participant. The mayor could have used the procurement to request a truly renewable energy product that includes provisions for economic opportunities developed in partnership with historically burdened communities. He would have made strides in the city’s climate targets while establishing NYC as a hub for the clean energy industry, benefiting communities bearing the brunt of rising inequality and environmental pollution. There are still paths for New York City to transition to renewable energy. The mayor can still request a renewable energy product that requires local economic development commitments and does not depend on foreign hydropower. While technologies like offshore wind currently cost more, evidence shows that upfront government support for nascent renewable industries leads to competitive pricing long-term. Additionally, the city could democratize the energy system by devoting more resources to grassroots-led and locally owned clean energy projects in underserved communities, and facilitate direct community investment in new infrastructure. Such initiatives would guarantee far reaching economic returns and reduced energy bills, offsetting regressive impacts from rising living costs and the steep hike proposed for energy consumers. The stakes have never been higher for America’s largest city to transition to renewable energy. With the limited time we have left, the mayor needs to rethink his commitment to Canadian hydropower, instead investing in energy initiatives that truly empower New Yorkers in an era of growing inequality and climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMake no mistake about it – they’re coming for it – the world’s private pension money. The greens used to tell us that green energy could be profitable and would not burden our economy – in fact they even claimed it would lead to an economic boom and prosperity.
But now that the first building blocks of the green energy grid are in place, they too realize this is going to cost a lot of money – HUGE MONEY! Reports say it’s going to cost $1 trillion dollars a year for the rest of the century. Where should this kind of money come from?
Prof. Hans Joachim Schellhnhuber, Director of the ultra-climate-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Chairman of the anti-democratic WBGU (German Advisory Council on Global Change) has the answer: Raid the global private pension and retirement funds…and steal the money we worked our entire lives for.
WBGU BLUEPRINT TO THE GREAT PRIVATE PENSION HEIST HERE
And let’s not kid ourselves about who is going to make out on this. The leftist online DIE ZEIT daily here reports:
In the fight against global warming, the top environmental advisers of the German government, according to information from Die Zeit, want to tap a new source of funding – the private pensions of savers.”
Some thieving bastards will stop at nothing, won’t they? Now governments are using science to legitimize the widescale plunder of private pension funds. “Sorry people, but we have to steal your savings to save the planet.”
Globally, there’s lots of hard-earned “private” money tucked away for the retirement years of many citizens. But the greens are now thinking: “You didn’t save that.” They’re salivating over it, scheming to get there sticky, grubby hands on it. Die Zeit writes:

Insurances and pension funds alone have 50,000 trillion dollars at their disposal, which has to be securely invested over the long-term, says an expert report of the scientific advisory council of the German government for global environmental issues (WBGU). This capital could be mobilized for the Energiewende (energy transformation), like for revamping the power grid.”
The WBGU just released that “expert” report on how the greatest heist of all-time is to be executed, and it will be submitted today to Germany’s Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier. For example on page 20 it states:

Despite the fact that private capital is, in principle, available, general willingness to invest in or finance the transformation of energy systems towards sustainability falls short of what is required.”

Now we know the sad state of green energy’s ability to compete or to be profitable. The energy only becomes viable (and that only over the midterm) if there’s a state-ordered mass-scale plunder of the world’s private retirement accounts. It cannot survive with anything less. This is unprecedented in scale when it comes to a lack of feasibility.
Personally, my wife and I, are looking at retirement in about 10 years. I’d say it would be wise to start making plans to take “our money” and running fast and far.
Finally, I don’t know where the “intellectual” Die Zeit or the WBGU got this “50,000 trillion” figure. That’s over 3000 times the US debt -or $7 million per person globally! That’s way out of the park and obviously wrong. It shows that lefties have no idea when it comes to scales of money.
The world needs Paul Ryan, fast!

"Europe’s Greens, big winners in Sunday’s European elections, will use their newfound leverage in a fractured parliament to push an agenda of urgent climate action, social justice and civil liberties, the movement’s leaders say. “This was a great outcome for us – but we now also have a great responsibility, because voters have given us their trust,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch MEP and the Greens’ co-lead candidate for commission president, told the Guardian.  “Our voters, especially the younger generation, for many of whom we are now their first choice, are deeply concerned about the climate crisis, and they are pro-European – but they feel the EU is not delivering. They want us to change the course of Europe.” Riding a surge of public concern over the climate crisis, Greens achieved double-digit scores in several countries, finishing second in Germany – where they doubled their previous score – and Finland and third in Luxembourg and France. With their tally of MEPs surging to 70 from 51 in the last parliament, the Greens group will have roughly the same clout in the 751-seat assembly as the far-right populists led by Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini – and a much better chance of using it. The parliament’s shrinking centre-right and centre-left groups lost their longstanding joint majority in the election, meaning that along with liberal MEPs, Greens could prove critical to achieving broad pro-EU majorities to pass European legislation. The big parties are certainly ready to talk. Manfred Weber, the conservative European People’s party’s lead candidate for commission president, said on Monday that the Greens were clearly “a possible partner. We should sit down together and draft a mandate for the next five years.” But the Greens will have a price. “We will need to see much more serious climate action, a real change of attitude: a price on C02, properly tackling aviation, the greening of agriculture,” Eickhout said. Under the 2015 Paris deal to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, the 28-nation EU has pledged by 2030 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below the levels in 1990. But scientists and activists say Europe and all other major economies must sharply raise their ambitions. The UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change warned in October that warming is currently on track towards a catastrophic 3C or 4C rise. “We will also want real progress on social protection and reducing inequality in Europe,” Eickhout added. “And we will demand far more vigorous action on the rule of law – no more playing politics. So those are the topics. We’ll talk to all who are interested in addressing them.” Sven Giegold, a senior German MEP, confirmed the party would “insist on negotiating substance first. We aim to negotiate a pro-EU agenda in which climate change policy is front and centre – and no longer just symbolic, but concrete.” Any cross-party agreement with Green backing would also need to include an EU policy on investment and social cohesion, Giegold said, plus an absolute commitment to tackling civil rights backsliding in EU states including Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Malta. “We think these election results give us a higher legitimacy to make these demands,” Giegold said. “Parliament now needs to have the time to sit down and discuss all this. We need to see more EU democracy come from this, not less.” Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP and leader of the Greens’ group in the European parliament, also warned that the party would not enter into alliances unless the contain concrete measures. “Without verifiable change for EU citizens, we will not go there,” he said. The Green’s strong performance on Sunday has already prompted centre-right and centre-left parties around Europe to promise they have heard the call for more urgent climate action and would heed it. France’s prime minister, Édouard Philippe, acknowledged the “message about the ecological emergency”, Markus Söder, who heads Merkel’s Bavarian sister-party, the CSU, said the Greens were now its main competitor, and Udo Bullmann, leader of the centre-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (SPD) in the European parliament, said it had underestimated climate change as an issue. “It’s a very clear message from the public that they want us to do more,” said Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, where a Green party candidate finished first in Dublin with 17.5% of the vote. National Green leaders were delighted. “Voters have sent a clear signal that they want the environment at the heart of politics,” said Yannick Jadot, leader of the Europe Ecologie-Les Verts party in France. “The environment cannot just be a promise you make before elections,” he said. Britain’s Greens, boosted partly by their clear-anti-Brexit stance, beat the ruling Conservatives into fifth place with a score of 12.5%. The party’s sole Westminster MP, Caroline Lucas, welcomed a “response to the accelerating climate crisis that was the same in the UK and right across Europe.” Giegold described the German party’s performance as “a Sunday for Future” – a nod to the Fridays for Future school strikes led by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The Green wave was not Europe-wide, however. Green parties won only a couple of seats in central Europe and none in eastern Europe, where there are few strong green parties and environmental concerns are usually taken up by other liberal parties. In southern Europe, Portugal’s People-Animals-Nature (Pan) party won its first European parliament seat, but the breakthrough was not replicated across the border in Spain, where Green parties have struggled to make headway on their own."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn this American Thinker piece by Clarice Feldman, the parallels to Steve McIntyre just jumped right out at me.
The German press is trying to make it look like the Democrats are thrilled about Ryan being the running mate, (predictably) painting Ryan as a “huge target” and a “radical conservative”, just because he believes in responsible spending (a concept that is foreign to many in Europe, e.g. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, France – to name a few).
But Europe’s reaction reminds me of Michael Mann’s initial reaction to the first enquiries he received from a once obscure mining consultant and statistical expert from Toronto. Today we know that Michael Mann and his hockey stick team ended up learning respect for the power of mathematics and the scientific method – the hard way. McIntyre dissected, organ by organ, the suspiciously flawed curve and left the hockey team forever humiliated.
While climatologist cheats tried to fabricate a statistical hockey stick from tree-ring data, the DC finance hockey league (yes, it is an entire corrupt league) is trying to do the opposite: they are trying to take a grotesque hockey stick and make it look flat by using tricks – thus postponing the towering blade onto the next generation. Like McIntyre, Paul Ryan is poised to dissect the phony straight line curves DC is trying to fool us with.
First, Feldman quotes the Iowahawk:
“Paul Ryan represent[s] Obama’s most horrifying nightmare: math.”
And then adds:

Let me remind you how nightmarish Ryan is to Obama. Here’s a six-minute take down of Obamacare by Congressman Ryan.
Watch the vacant look in Obama’s eyes as it becomes clear he has no idea how to respond to the facts Ryan raises, to the math which demonstrates the utter  unsustainability of Obama’s legislative scheme.”
We can all recall the climate hockey team’s similar reaction. Andrew Montford wrote a whole book on it. First they tried to hide the numbers, claiming they were lost. Then they said the numbers were out there and anyone could see them. When the numbers were exposed, they had other “experts” bogusly confirm that they were right. And when these were shown to be flawed, they made up new phony curves. In the end, it was all about hiding an ugly truth. Today, except for the fabricators themselves, nobody believes the climate hockey stick curves anymore.
Paul Ryan is poised to be the floodlight that is about to illuminate Washington corrupt practices, which are taking the USA to Greece in a hand-basket.
Romney’s message is clear: We’re going to expose the mathematics (truth) of the numbers. Irresponsible spending and the looming debt crisis are going to be in the spotlight over the remainder of the campaign. You can run from Ryan all you want, but you won’t be able to hide from him.
Just ask Michael Mann.

"I am a great admirer of Greta Thunberg and a committed participant in Extinction Rebellion (XR), but I have doubts about her call for adults to join a worldwide strike for the climate in September (Young people are fighting for our future. But we need help, 24 May). UK law protects participants in industrial action against dismissal by their employers only if they are members of unions complying with strict procedures and taking the action as part of a trade dispute with employers. Climate strikers will not be protected, which is likely to deter (quite reasonably) many otherwise supportive workers and skew the demographic profile of participants in favour of those in secure, flexible employment and the self-employed.  This risks encouraging the impression that action on climate change is both less widely supported than it really is, and in any case only a liberal, middle-class concern rather than a non-party-political global emergency. Such impressions play into the hands of climate sceptics and the powerful interests behind them. XR’s international rebellion in April was sustained by participants who came when they were able, using annual leave and turning out in the biggest numbers during the weekends and bank holidays. We were discouraged from risking arrest unless we could afford the consequences; most participants could not and so contributed in other ways. By contrast, calling a general climate strike creates a dilemma for many workers between showing their support for climate action and risking jobs that they can ill afford to lose. The youth strikers are principled and courageous, but their strikes are not likely to cost them their livelihoods. The urgency of the need for action on climate change and ecosystem collapse calls for desperate measures. But I fear that calling a general strike in September will weaken the cause, not strengthen it.Tom SinclairOxford • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"All state schools in England should offer pupils a compulsory plant-based menu one day a week, under new recommendations to the government that aim to make school meals more environmentally friendly and reflect changing dietary advice. Given wide acceptance that diets need to change to address the climate crisis – including by eating less meat and more beans and pulses – the Soil Association is urging the Department for Education to replace a non-mandatory recommendation for a weekly meat-free day with a statutory menu once a week offering only plant-based proteins and foods.  The relatively few schools that already offer a meat-free day are often serving up less healthy lunches such as cheese-laden pizza, the organic food and farming group says, underlining the need for kitchens to be given support to provide more imaginative, healthier meals. The DfE has started reviewing school food standards in light of the latest evidence on reducing meat and sugar consumption and boosting fibre in Britons’ diets. The UK Committee on Climate Change report released earlier this month recommended a 20% decrease in meat consumption and an increase in the consumption of plant-based proteins, while a recent study from EAT-Lancet also recommended a shift from meat to plant proteins on climate grounds. “The update of the school food standards provides an ideal opportunity to make school meals healthier and more climate-friendly,” said the SA’s policy officer, Rob Percival. “We know that children would benefit nutritionally from eating more beans, pulses, and plant-based proteins. The climate would also benefit – we should all be eating less and better meat. Some schools are showing that its possible to serve children healthy plant-based meals, alongside higher welfare meat. It’s time the government caught up – the updated school food standards should require that schools serve a plant-based protein day each week.” With increasing numbers of pupils now striking over climate change, the SA is highlighting food and diet as an issue of growing importance to young people. The current standards were introduced in 2015, replacing the original nutritional regulations launched in 2008 following TV chef Jamie Oliver’s personal crusade to improve the standard of school meals – and remove junk food such as the notorious “turkey twizzlers”. Adherence is mandatory for all state-funded schools, except for academies established between 2010 and 2014. The DfE has convened an expert panel to review the school food standards update, which includes representatives from Public Health England. A DfE spokesperson said: “Our school food standards ensure that school meals are healthy and nutritious. They do not require meat to be served every day, and schools have the freedom to introduce a meat-free day each week.”"

Seth Borenstein’s recent article in the Associated Press claims that recent weather events are a result of global warming. They are not; they are clearly weather, local in nature and short-lived. Borenstein is another “Chicken Little”, a calamitologist, crying “Wolf”. Here are the facts.
If recent weather events were because of a global increase in temperature, we should be able to see a global increase in temperature. We don’t. We see quite normal local variations, but on a global basis, nothing… a slight cooling.

Figure 1: GHCN/GISS temperature trend from November 2011 to April 2012 (the most recent figures). In the upper right corner is the global trend, 0.03°C cooling.
The previous six months shows a quite different pattern of local trends, but, again, the global trend is cooling.

Figure 2: Trend for May to October 2011. In this six month period, the globe cooled by 0.07°C. The local trend pattern is completely different than in Figure 1.
Six months does not establish any kind of climate trend. Six month trends are Weather. Others have said that it takes 17, 30, or 60 years to establish a climate trend. These longer periods are simply climate cycles. What we experience from year to year is simply weather. We are now into 14 years of cooling according to satellite measurements.

Figure 3: RSS satellite global temperature anomaly. Where’s the warming?
In Figure 3, temperatures before 1998 were affected by the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo volcanic cooling events. 1998 was affected by a strong El Niño event, as was 2010. But the global trend over that last 14 years is cooling by about 0.1°C. But please note that I am not using that trend to claim a coming ice age.
There is another meme used in Mr. Borenstein’s story, that global warming is causing more wildfires.
Others have claimed that global warming is causing the Pine Bark Beetles to wildly expand, killing vast stretches of forest. One of the fires in Colorado was in a forest with 70% beetle-killed trees. The truth is that before the white man arrived, the forests were managed by nature using fire. The natural condition was that fires thinned out the forests keeping the tree population to about 100 per acre of mostly mature trees. The Forest Service has suppressed the natural fires, does not allow thinning, and now the tree density is up to 1000 per acre. The Pine Bark Beetles no longer need fly from tree to tree, they can walk,… without touching the ground.
Mr. Borenstein, you need to get over your fits of hysteria.

"The rural electorate of Indi will make history next week when Independent Dr Helen Haines is officially elected to replace fellow independent Cathy McGowan. Part of the reason she won was a climate platform founded on energy democracy. Indi is a regional electorate in Victoria. It stretches all the way from the peri urban fringes of Melbourne to the Murray River. It is an electorate of mountains, valleys and plains. Until Cathy McGowan won in 2013, Indi had been a safe Liberal seat, delivering some of the largest margins in the country for conservative members.  Back to back independents have never been elected in Australian history. Popular independent MPs, like Tony Windsor or Rob Oakeshott have both seen their seats revert back to the Coalition. There is a good reason for that. Once elected, independent members are popular, but most are elected on a protest vote from the former sitting member. It is very hard to run as an independent and win against a popular or at least “not-unpopular” major party candidate. Indi is home to Australia’s most vibrant community energy network and this built the foundation for Helen Haines’ victory. The network includes 13 groups across the electorate, from the major population centres of Wodonga and Wangaratta in the north all the way to the smaller towns of Euroa and Alexandra in the south. This has changed the politics of this regional seat and allowed a candidate like Helen to put forward a winning bold vision for tackling climate change. Community energy is a powerful way for regional communities to take control of their energy future. It also helps revitalise regional communities by ensuring that the energy dollars spent in the region stay in the region. Of course, community energy is not unique to Indi. Across Australia there are now more than 100 communities developing community-owned clean energy projects and working to transition their communities to 100% renewables. About 80% of these groups are located across regional Australia. Helen’s success can be attributed to working with these groups and putting communities at the front of climate solutions. The strong community energy movement in Indi, meant people were already seeing and feeling the local benefits of clean energy. At the forefront of this transition in Indi is the town of Yackandandah, which is committed to being powered by 100% renewable energy by 2022. Thanks to the work of community group Totally Renewable Yackandandah (TRY), 55% of all households already have solar on their roofs, way above the Victorian average. TRY assisted the local hospital to install solar – with money saved on electricity redirected to employ more doctors and nurses. The town’s next target is to have solar panels on all community buildings. This year TRY has installed solar panels and a battery on the local CFA shed, ensuring that during bushfires or natural disasters it will still have power. Yackandandah is also leading the country with new energy solutions, including “micro-grids”, which allow householders with solar panels to share electricity with other households. Yackandandah is not alone, with 12 other groups also working on climate solutions in their respective communities. Because community energy groups work in their local communities, their solutions are targeted to deal with on the ground issues. In Wodonga, which has the highest electricity disconnection rate in the state due to rising power prices, the local community energy group is installing solar on low-income households to help with power prices. To help these communities reach their renewable energy goals and keep money circling locally, a locally owned community energy retailer called Indigo Power has recently been set up. Indigo Power will work with the local community energy groups – like TRY – to help them reach their 100% renewable energy targets. Helen Haines was a founding board member of Indigo Power and brought her knowledge of community energy to her successful election campaign. From Tallangatta to Tunamah and Yackandandah to Yea, community energy groups are part of the fabric of the electorate. It can work in other electorates. Projects such as a community-owned solar or wind farm activates latent support for the broader transition to clean energy and, in-turn, for those parties putting forward policies for ambitious climate action. There is also a growing recognition that renewable energy can bring significant economic benefits. From generating jobs on community-owned wind or solar farms to saving money on electricity prices. Modelling shows that for every government dollar spent in community energy, it unlocks $15 of local investment. Renewables are booming across Australia, including in Queensland. That means much-needed money and jobs flowing to the regions. Community energy projects, rooted in local action, show that regions can take action on climate change and see real benefits at the same time. Across Indi our focus has been on energy democracy. This means people coming together to use new energy technology, like solar panels, to build stronger communities and create tangible benefits. We can do the same across the country and create mass grassroots support for locally-driven climate solutions that put people front and centre.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Gergis Australian Hockey Stick folly has been dominating climate science news. Won’t they ever learn?

New hockey stick, but with the same problems.
Geologist Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt comment on the story. I’ve translated their comment in English to give readers an idea of what the German skeptic viewpoint is. Parts have been edited for brevity.
=========================================
Controversy surrounds new Australian Hockey Stick: authors withdraw paper
Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Most of you know about the Hockey Stick saga. Late in the 1990s Michael Mann in his doctorate thesis flattened the pre-industrial temperature history by using a “suitable statistical process” along with faulty data so that the warming occurring since the end of the Little Ice Age could be shown as an unprecedented event (see The Hockey Stick Illusion by Andrew Montford). Today this Hockey Stick curve is deemed as refuted. Even Michael Mann’s team bit their lips and corrected it in 2008. Suddenly the Medieval Warm Period and ther Little Ice Age reappeared.
Even so, it seems some IPCC scientists just can’t to break their addiction to the good ol Hockey Stick days. They’d like nothing more than to turn back time. With this in mind, one can surely understand the short-lived euphoria that swept over IPCC fanclub website “Real Climate”.
Real Climate erupted in jubilation when the new Australian hockey stick by Gergis et al appeared. In the new reconstruction they had found their long lost son. The warming of the last 100 years was once again something special, and not because of natural cycles.
The Australian authors interpreted their new curve as evidence of an unusual warming in the late 20th century. Once again this impressed the IPCC so much that the paper was promptly integrated into the recently drafted AR5. The draft boasted of “completely new datasets” that made up the reconstructions.

However, hockey stick sleuth and statistics ace Steve McIntyre (prompted by a tip  from Jean S) could not resist the temptation of taking a good look at the curve. Here he found unexpected things (see his report at Climate Audit).
Firstly the “new” datasets turned out not to be as new as claimed in the AR5 draft. Moreover, the data had been used in the report from 5 years earlier.
In addition, Joelle Gergis and her colleagues committed capital methodological and calculation errors, as McIntyre together with Jean S were able to show. McIntyre began to correpsond with Gergis by e-mail, but instead of thanking McIntyre for the important information, Gergis curtly wrote back saying she wanted no further E-mail contact. Also Gergis refused to provide further data for the purpose of checking.
That’s a strange communication strategy in such as scientific crisis situation – batten down the hatches and close your eyes. Also Gergis’s website appeared to go offline. Andrew Montford then reported that Joelle Gergis is apparently an active member of the environmental movement. Her blog related to this also suddenly disappeared. But the Internet has a memory and a copy of the blog can be found at at webcitation.org.
By mixing activism and science, Joelle Gergis has apparently lost all critical distance research results, which invariably leads to such errors. A science open to results is impossible with that attitude. This is not only true for Gergis. Inconvenient results are suppressed, interpretations constantly distorted in one direction, and alternatives are ignored or swept aside. Gergis’s refusal to admit to errors and to have a fruitful dialogue with opposing views can only be explained by her ideological fixation.
Luckily a co-author of the Australian paper jumped in and controlled the damage. David Karoly wrote McIntyre an Email, thanked McIntyre for the information and confirmed that there had been large errors which the team will look into. The published paper was withdrawn. At the Journal of Climate site, the paper is no longer available:

 
In summary, the comeback attempt of the Hockey Stick turned into a complete folly. The IPCC are certainly the ones who will be the most annoyed by the incident, as the already integrated paper will have to be removed from the 5AR draft. According to a press release press releaseg about the paper put out by the University of Melbourne dated 17 May 2012, it is clear that the it had been written especially for the IPCC 5th assessment report. Does the blunder indicate that peer-reviewers of many journals are simply too uncritical when it comes to works by authors close to the IPCC?
How could peer-reviewers have missed it? Similarly slipshod was the work of Notz & Marotzke (2012) (see our blog article ”Hamburger Max-Planck-Institut uses dubious data on Arctic sea ice“). It is absolutely mind-boggling how such papers are able to survive the peer-review process. The grievances are obvious already at first glance.
At Realclimate blog the team has shifted its focus over to determining who actually first discovered the error in the Australian paper. The last thing they want is to do is to concede the victory to McIntyre.

"The death of thousands of tufted puffins in the Bering Sea may have been partly caused by the climate breakdown, according to a study. Between 3,150 and 8,500 seabirds died over a four-month period from October 2016, with hundreds of severely emaciated carcasses washed up on the beaches of the Pribilofs Islands in the southern Bering Sea, 300 miles (480km) west of the Alaskan mainland. Researchers believe the birds died of starvation partly caused by a loss of energy-rich prey species, which was triggered by increased sea and atmospheric temperatures, as well as reductions in winter sea ice recorded since 2014. Tufted puffins breeding in the Bering Sea feed on fish and other marine invertebrates, which in turn feed on plankton. The loss of nutritious prey species caused by the climate crisis is also affecting populations of the Atlantic puffin around Britain and Iceland. Researchers in the journal Plos One documented the Bering Sea “wreck”, or mass die-off, with the help of a citizen science programme in which tribal and community members on St Paul Island recovered more than 350 carcasses of adult birds in the process of moulting, a vulnerable moment in the bird’s lifecycle when they require plentiful food. According to the study, by Timothy Jones of the citizen science Coasst programme, at the University of Washington, and Lauren Divine, from the Aleut community of St Paul Island’s ecosystem conservation office, puffins typically made up fewer than 1% of recovered carcasses in the region in previous years. In this die-off, 87% of carcasses were puffins, with the remainder being the crested auklet, another North American seabird. Increased sea temperatures have reduced food resources for puffins in the southern Bering Sea, as some marine species shift further north. Puffins spend much of their lives at sea, only returning to land to breed each spring. Similar reductions in food supplies close to traditional breeding grounds are also pushing Atlantic puffins further north. It is predicted Atlantic puffins are unlikely to be seen south of the northernmost islands of Scotland by the second half of this century. A seabird wreck along the Atlantic coasts of Britain, Ireland and Spain after the storms of 2013-14 resulted in the deaths of at least 54,000 birds, of which 55% were Atlantic puffins. The long-term impact of such events is not well understood but fewer than 60% of 2013’s breeding adults returned to the small Welsh island of Skomer the following year. Divine said the documentation of the Bering Sea die-off would not have been possible without the carcasses and observations collected by the citizen science group, which has been surveying seabirds for 17 years. “Island residents collected high-quality data in real time and provided Coasst with a detailed context for their analysis,” she said. “Without the positive and mutually beneficial relationship built over years of collaboration, this massive die-off of tufted puffins would have gone unreported in the scientific community.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems that parts of the German mainstream media are becoming more cautious with the information warmist scientists feed them.
For example Axel Bojanowski of Der Spiegel here writes a report about Richard Muller’s “CALL me a converted skeptic” opinion piece that appeared in the “New York Times”, which the German and international warmist media gleefully pounced upon.

But Bojanowski took a deeper look at Muller and discovered that all is not well with the “converted skeptic”, writing:
However, looking more closely, the showstopper turned out to be a fake: Namely, with Muller, it turns out he is not in any way a former skeptic who just changed his mind. Already in 2003 he wrote in ‘Technology Review’, that his opinion was that ‘carbon dioxide as a gas emitted from fossil fuels is the biggest polluter in the history of man.’ It is likely that CO2 will ‘have severe and detrimental effects on global climate’.”
Bojanowski then brings up Muller’s BEST study and his claims that global surface temperatures have risen 1°C over the last 50 years and that if CO2 continues to rise in China unhindered, the climate could warm another 1°C in the next 20 years. To this Bojanowski adds:
Climate scientist Judith Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA however wanted nothing to do with this conclusion and refused to have her name as one of the authors of the Best-Project. Curry has made a name for herself as a ‘climate realist’ – she is fighting against the polarization of climate science by ‘skeptics’ and ‘alarmists’.
When influential media outlets like Spiegel start taking a second look, you can pretty much guess what’s in the pipeline for the months and years ahead. Indeed the global warming scare has its best days behind it.
In a way, this is Der Spiegel indirectly slapping down the New York Times.

(Translation / editing by P Gosselin)
The IPCC thinks the sun plays nary a role on climate and that anthropogenic factors explain almost the entire warming since 1850.
It’s been completely ignored that Gerard Bond was able to show more than 10 years ago that the last 10,000 years have been characterized by a global temperature roller coaster that runs up and down in sync with solar activity (Bond et al. 2001).

Figure 1: Comparison of solar activity (blue curve) and the Asian climate development (green curve, delta 18O of a stalagmite in a Chinese cave) for the last 9000 years (both curves normalized). One clearly sees a good agreement between the two curves, which stgrongly suggests a significant climate impact by the sun. Figure from Steinhilber et al. (2012).
In our book “The Forgotten Sun“ (p. 68-75) we were able to show the close relationship between the climate and the sun in multiple studies from all parts of the globe and that the warming of the last 150 years also closely follows the pattern.
Now a new paper by the international team of scientists led by Friedhelm Steinhilber of the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Sciences and technology (Eawag) has just produced yet more important evidence of the sun’s impact on the Holocene climate development. The group, which also includes glaciologist Hans Oerter of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, published the results last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Using multiple Antarctic and Greenland ice cores and global tree-ring data, the scientists reconstructed solar activity over the last 9000 years. They also used the so-called cosmogenic beryllium and carbon isotopes 10Be and 14C, whose frequency on Earth is controlled by the strength of the sun’s magnetic field, and thus by solar activity.

The group carried out a spectral analysis of the new solar activity curves and found, as expected, the usual characteristic solar cycles, among them also the 210-year Suess-de Vries cycle, the 1000-year Eddy-cycle and the 2300-year Hallstatt-cycle. The Grand Solar Minima coincided mostly with the minima of the Suess-de Vries cycles.
The cycles are superimposed by the longterm rising and falling signal of orbital changes associated with the Milankovitch cycles. The Milankovitch cycle is in part responsible for the warm temperatures of the Holocene Optimum 6000 years ago, when it was considerably warmer than today. Steinhilber and his colleagues removed these orbital signals from the data in order to filter out the primary solar activity.
They then compared the new solar activity reconstruction with a climate dataset earlier obtained by colleagues in a Chinese cave covering the last 9000 years. The fluctuations in the 18O-oxygen isotope concentrations show the precipitation fluctuations and the intensity of the Asian monsoons. What resulted was a surprising agreement between solar activity and the Asian climate development (see Figure 1 above).
In times of low solar activity, Asian monsoons were less pronounced in general. Also the most important solar cycles could be found in the frequency analysis of the Asian climate signal. One can only conclude that solar activity cycles are the main driver of the last 10,000 years and that they continue to be so today as we continue to remain in the now well-documented pattern.
In the 9000-year time period investigated by Florian Steinhilber and his colleagues, there are however some phases where the correlation between solar activity and climate is missing. For these periods, the scientists assume that other geological factors, like large volcanic eruptions and associated atmospheric aerosols, or other natural factors influenced and overrode the solar signal. In general these factors must always be taken into account when conducting statistical analyses.
The new results from the Steinhilber Group once again shows the significant importance of the sun on the Earth’s climate development.
We can only hope that the authors of the current, new IPCC report will add it and all the other important studiesn in its synthesis report and finally add the sun’s major impact in the models. However, this only hopeful thinking. In contradiction to the growing body of scientific evidence, the IPCC has already made it clear that it will ignore the sun’s major impact even more (see our blog article “Der neue IPCC-Klimabericht: Sonne noch weiter degradiert!“).
This needs to be seriously looked into.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChris Horner made a great presentation at the European Institute For Climate and Energy’s (EIKE) 4th Climate Conference, Munich, in November, 2011. A must-watch, recently posted video!

Hat-tip: Reader DirkH
Horner starts by focusing on the real aim of the green movement, which is to make energy expensive, and so we have to expect fuel poverty in the future to go up. Horner says, “Green jobs will mean pink slips, red ink, and dark times.”
At the 6:40 mark, Horner zooms in on the IPCC, transparency, and the FOIA.
Horner reminds us that the FOIA is an act designed to allow the taxpayer “to know what the government is up to”. But for the IPCC and climate scientists, it represents a real problem that obstructs “the cause”. So the IPCC proceeded to exempt itself from FOIA law and even acted criminally to skirt it, “organising a campaign to obstruct and to delete records” and “creating safehouses to evade FOIA laws,” Horner says.
First (10:10 mark) they used excuses for not disclosing the records, claiming they were “personal, lost, deleted“. In the UK, the excuses were even “getting absurd”. They “organised an effort to delete e-mails”, in a “very deliberate, very thoughtful” way. It “wasn’t rash”. “They really didn’t want these things out.”
At the 21:00 minute mark, Horner sums up the scientists reluctance to release documents, and their scheme to destroy records.
There was an admitted, agreed, written campaign to delete e-mails, to get around, to circumvent FOIA. So that is legally, deliberately and lawyerly drafted.”
Horner said, “The e-mails exposed the Team for the reasons pointed out. They were politicising, they were perverting peer-review. They were perverting the IPCC process. And they were creating falsely tidy stories.” For what? “For the Kyoto cause.”
The inquiries conducted to exonerate the Climategate scientists were whitewashes. They were designed not to find any wrongdoing.
At the 24-minute mark, Horner tells how the IPCC records are public records and how the IPCC was actively dodging FOIA obligations.

FOIA has always been a thorn for the IPCC scientists, who, as Horner shows, had plenty to hide. Much effort was expended to circumvent FOIA requirements.
Horner explains the more recent tactics at the 33.50 mark. For example senior officials were given “handles” to conceal their identities. They ran third party activist websites to make it appear they had support. They set up safehouses at non-governmental websites to circumvent FOIA laws and to keep taxpayers from gaining access to documents.
John Holdren took control of the IPCC process after the president had been innaugurated. Horner shows an IPCC letter from IPCC official Thomas Stocker, who wrote that FOIA problems “require urgent attention in order to meet the challenges of modern methods of working and communication and given the experiences during and since AR4.” He then suggests establishing a “closed electronic discussion fora”.
By October 8, 2010, Horner shows in a slide that “IPCC’s Stocker had in fact already established a ‘closed electronic fora’ for WG1 evading e-mails and national FOI”.
Horner then says the IPCC enlisted to Obama Administration to create offline, non-governmental electronic fora, while stonewalling requests for records. He says:
So the White House Office of Science and Technology policy led a government-wide effort to enable the UN to pull this off, expressly to frustrate national FOIA laws.”
Horner concludes that “there will be fallout, there will be a price to pay. It is the institutions of science that are going to suffer the most.”
By now the readers will ask: “For what?” The answer is: “the cause”.
What is “the cause”?
Recall what Horner said at the beginning of his presentation. As societies get richer, they become more focused on keeping things clean and orderly.
I’ll expand on Horner’s assertion, and add that once a certain level of affluence is reached, the advanced society begins to get individuals who turn radical and intolerant, and eventually view the poor masses as excess population and as a threat to the planet. Think of Holdren, Ehrlich and Schellnhuber who have in one way or another expressed that the ideal human population on the planet is around a mere billion, or less.
Is this “the cause” that these individuals are really alluding to? Indeed some do view the green movement as the latest final solution.

Share this...FacebookTwitter If you ever wondered why people in the Green Movement often seem to take on an air of arrogance, condescending superiority, to be masterful at propaganda, spiteful of human population, preoccupied with lebensraum, intolerant of other views and just plain bossy, journalists Michael Miersch and David Harnasch tell us what is probably behind it.
It turns out that National Socialism is the biological father of modern environmentalism. As you shall read, green naturally appeals to brown, and vice versa in many respects. This is so because much of green ideology was inherited from the browns to begin with.
Miersch and Harnasch write how this is so in the latest print edition of news magazine FOCUS, in an article they’ve reprinted at their website here: Ökonationalsozial.
What follows are FOCUS excerpts I’ve translated in English.
The National Socialist Party has a long green tradition, it turns out. Today Germany’s brownish NPD Party, for example, marches against nuclear power and gene technology. It demonstrates for organic food and bio-farming. The word “nature” appears everywhere in its party literature. “Man is part of nature. That’s why nature is simply not only the environment around man. Materialism of the last decades has driven the destruction of the natural life’s base in an irresponsible way.“ This is not a quote from Greenpeace literature, but from the party program of Germany’s brownish NPD party.
During Green Week at the end of January in Berlin, thousands of animal activists, gene-technology opponents and organic farmers protested. Many among them were “Autonomous Nationalists“ who held signs that read “Against plant food patents“ and “Against capitalist slavery“. The browns are infiltrating the greens.
Michael Miersch
Because Neonazis are hanging out increasingly within the Green scene, non-brown greens have become alarmed. One state official went through the trouble of authoring a 36-page information guide titled “Nature Protection Against Rightwing Extremism“ in order to curb the growing brown flood within the Green Movement.
Brownish organisation Midgard not long ago distributed a green-brown propaganda magazine in South Germany. The magazine called “Environment and Active“ has the motto: “National policy is environmental policy.“ In the 1930s the Nazis shared the green ideology, and had the Weltanschauung “blood and soil”, which revered healthy eating, idealized rural agrarian life and German forest romanticism.
For the Nazis in the 1930s, sustainable living was a primary aim of the regime. There was a huge interest in renewable raw materials and alternative energies. Back then wind turbines were called Reichskrafttürme (Reich’s power towers). Later in 1959 Germany published a novel that warned of man-made climate change: Der Tanz mit dem Teufel (Dance with the demon). The book’s author was Austrian Günther Schwab, a Nazi SA stormtrooper. He went on to be viewed as a “green visionary“.
Former Nazis were active in environmental groups and went on to become the grandfathers of the Germany’s modern greens. They became very much involved in Germany’s early Green Party, thus exposing the myth that the Green Party was “a new movement”. Green Party honcho Jürgen Trittin warns at his website of “the many commonalities“ between brown and green.
August Haußleiter in 1980 was one of the German Green Party’s first leaders. It was discovered that the concerned environmentalist was also an anti-Semite. He resigned and in 1986 joined the Bavarian Greens.

Joseph Beuys, a green leader in the 1980s, was involved with the Volks National Revolutionaries. Baldur Springmann was connected to the SA, SS and NSDAP. In 1982 he left the Green Party and joined the new Ecology-Democratic Party.
In 1983 Werner Vogel was one of the first Green Party parliamentarians. He happened to be an SA Sturmführer and NSDAP member as well.
In 1984 Luise Rinser wrote poetry about Hitler, and in 1981 vaunted over dictator Kim Il-sung.
Alfred Mechtersheimer was at first a prominent green, but then left and became a brown.
It is not only the Green Party that had brown streaks, so did many of Germany’s earlier environmental groups, which later transformed into groups known today as NABU or BUND. Lina Hähnle, Chairman of what today is NABU, once pledged allegiance to Hitler.
Also the Association for Nature Protection in Bavaria sympathized with Nazi causes. From 1958 to 1963, Alwin Seifert was National Director of the Association For Nature Protection. Seifert in 1940 had a high level position in the Nazi regime as Reichslandschaftsanwalt (Reich’s Counsel For Landscape). Here he occupied himself with such matters as planning the future of the conquered lebensraum in Eastern Europe. He was instructed by Heinich Himmler to make it so that “the German folk could feel at home there”. Twenty five years later Seifert authored the book: Gärtner, Ackern – ohne Gift (Gardens, Meadows – Without Toxins), which today is still a bestseller and, according to Amazon, ‘a Bible of the Green Movement’.”
————
My comments: To me this is astonishing. But when you think about it, so many parallels jump out at you. Think for a minute about the 10:10 No Pressure fiim. Think about Schellnhuber’s “Great Transformation masterplan” or Michael Mann’s “the cause”. Think about how environmentalists feel about 7 billion people on the planet. Think about all the science and media manipulation going on to fool the public to promote the obvious lie of CO2 dominating the climate. Think about those who want to change the planet so that “they can feel at home there”. Recall what Hansen said about China’s regime. The list goes on and on. These people are not brown, but they really ought ot think about what they look like. Actions speak volumes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother peer-reviewed paper, another smashed hockey stick.
The latest paper is one by Mathias Trachsel et al, titled: Multi-archive summer temperature reconstruction for the European Alps, AD 1053–1996. Moberg and Esper are among its authors.
They present a multi-archive, multi-proxy summer temperature reconstruction for the European Alps for the period AD 1053–1996 using tree-ring and lake sediment data. The results show that summer temperatures of the last millennium are characterized by two warm periods (AD 1053–1171 and 1823–1996) and two cold phases (AD 1172–1379 and 1573–1822).
But get this. The abstract states (my emphasis):
Highest pre-industrial summer temperatures of the 12th century were 0.3 °C warmer than the 20th century mean but 0.35 °C colder than proxy derived temperatures at the end of the 20th century. The lowest temperatures at the end of the 16th century were ∼1 °C lower than the 20th century mean.”

Now let’s assume the end of the 20th century proxy-derived temperatures are reliable. That would mean all the CO2 added by man over the last 1000 years (approx. 110 ppm) has led to a whole third of a degree Celsius of warming when compared to the Medieval Warm Period.
That’s it? This is a crisis?
Skepticalscience.com couldn’t find anything alarming either. All they could conclude was that the end of the 20th century in the Alps was a wee bit warmer than the Medieval Warm Period, that according to proxy data.
The added late 20th century tree-ring growth was probably due mostly to the CO2 enrichment.
That really should tell us and especially the IPCC something about the magnitude of feedbacks involving CO2 and water vapor.

Yet, thanks to science reporter Axel Bojanowski, Spiegel at least mentions that the South Pole did set a sea ice record last month, and even presented the following NSIDC chart:

September sea ice extent at the South Pole keeps growing. Chart source: National Snow and Ice Data Center, USA
Spiegel reports:
While sea ice at the north pole this summer disappeared like never before since satellite measurements began in the 1970s, sea ice at the south pole set a counter record: Never has so much ice surrounding Antarctica covered such a large area at this time of the year since satellite measurements began in the late 1970s.”
Isn’t it nice pushing it right back into the faces of warmists?
Of course, we are told that the loss of the north polar sea ice is due to warming. So would it not be logical to blame the sea ice increase at the south pole on cooling? No! says the NSIDC. Spiegel writes:

For the Arctic, it’s global warming. But for the Antarctic, it’s local phenomena! And if we hold our horses for just little while longer, surely the spinsters at the NSIDC will even find a scientific explanation blaming the southern sea ice increase on global warming.
1700 record lows set last week in USA
Meanwhile yesterday Joe Bastardi informed us at Twitter that a huge number of cold temperature records were set last week in the USA. Isn’t the media silence deafening here as well? Joe writes:
Wasn’t kidding around about 3rd major cold shot into summers  heart of hot.  From Hamweather, record lows, and low maxes http://mapcenter.hamweather.com/records/7day/us.html?c=mintemp,lowmax,snow …

"Madrid may be about to become the first European city to scrap a major urban low-emissions zone after regional polls left a rightwing politician who views 3am traffic jams as part of the city’s cultural identity on the cusp of power. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, who is expected to become the new Popular party (PP) president of the Madrid region, believes night-time congestion makes the city special and has pledged to reverse a project known as Madrid Central, which has dramatically cut urban pollution. The PP’s mayor-in-waiting, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, under whose remit the scheme falls, vowed that his first action would be to “address” Madrid Central. “It was one of the pillars of our campaign,” he said. The PP would instead prioritise street cleanliness and conservation, he added. During the election campaign, Ayuso told El Pais: “I do not think [traffic jams] are a reason for enjoyment but it is a sign [of the] identity of our city, that the street is always alive.” Congestion is “part of the life in Madrid”, she said, adding that the city’s nightlife “goes hand in hand with traffic jams”. A reversal of the popular Madrid Central system would mark the first time a major European city had turned the clock back on clean air reform. The scheme has attracted the ire of conservatives as a totem of the outgoing Mas Madrid movement and its leftwing leader, Manuela Carmena.  Greeting the election result on Sunday, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary-general of Vox, the PP’s prospective far-right coalition partner, said: “Starting tomorrow, Madrid Central is over.” An estimated 30,000 Spaniards die each year due to air pollution, according to the European Environment Agency. Within a month of its launch last November, Madrid Central had cut urban traffic by up to 24% and nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels by 38%. CO2 emissions also fell by 14%. Pollution tests around the city’s central Plaza del Carmen station last month found that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels had plunged by almost 50% compared to 2018, reaching their lowest point since 2012. Nuria Blázquez-Sánchez, a spokeswoman for the Ecologists in Action campaign group, said: “Madrid Central has improved air quality even more than expected. City centre residents are happy with the LEZ [low-emissions zone] and voted massively for Manuela Carmena. “Reversing such a successful project will have severe consequences for public health, particularly the health of vulnerable people like children, pregnant women and the elderly.” Carmena is a popular figure and Mas Madrid emerged the largest single party from the polls, but without a governing majority. The centre-right Ciudadanos says it will not talk to Vox, but is thought likely to join a de facto coalition if an accommodation between the extreme right party and the PP emerges from post-election haggling. Even then, dismantling Madrid Central may be a complicated affair, with environmentalists mounting a rearguard defence of the pollution measure in the city council and courts of law. The LEZ was introduced after the European commission threatened Spain with legal action unless it complied with the air quality directive."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a new paper out called A model-data comparison of the Holocene global sea surface temperature evolution by G. Lohmann, M. Pfeiffer, T. Laepple, G. Leduc, and J.-H. Kim. Hat-tip: a reader.
This is an important study because scientists need a way to check the reliability of their models. If the models can recreate the past, then there’s a chance they can be used for the future.
We have about 150 years worth of reliable instrumental records that can be used to check models. Beyond that, scientists have had to reconstruct temperatures using proxy data. That’s the only way to check models that go way back. But we also know that using proxies as thermometers is not an exact science. Yet, with enough of them, you can get a pretty good idea of how climate behaved in the past. So it should be possible to use them to test models.
In the paper’s introduction we find:
Information beyond the instrumental record covering the last 5150 yr can be obtained mainly from two strategies: on the one hand by deriving from proxies which record past climate and environmental conditions, and on the other hand by simulating climate, using comprehensive models of the climate system under appropriate external forcing.”
Relying on models to tell us what the past climate was? Sounds rather dubious. So, according to the abstract, the authors compared the ocean temperature evolution of the Holocene as simulated by climate models and reconstructed from marine temperature proxies.

The proxy dataset comprised a global compilation of marine alkenone and Mg/Ca-derived sea surface temperature (SST) estimates. The authors write what they observed (emphasis added):
Independently of the choice of the climate model, we observe significant mismatches between modelled and estimated SST amplitudes in the trends for the last 6000 years. Alkenone-based SST records show a similar pattern as the simulated annual mean SSTs, but the simulated SST trends underestimate the alkenone-based SST trends by a factor of two to five. For Mg/Ca, no significant relationship between model simulations and proxy reconstructions can be detected.”
The authors later in the abstract add:
…when modeled temperature trends are set up to allow drastic shifts in the ecological behavior of planktonic organisms, they do not capture the full range of reconstructed SST trends. These findings challenge the quantitative comparability of climate model sensitivity and reconstructed temperature trends from proxy data.”
Most of us know that determining the “appropriate external forcings” (mentioned above) has been elusive in climate science, and has involved many dubious assumptions and downright hanky panky – all to make CO2 appear as the dominant driver.
Proxies will always be the superior way of determining how climate behaved in the past. Eventually models will be able to reproduce the past, but that will not mean they will be capable of predicting the future. One can use many different combinations of forcings in models to reproduce the past climate. But finding out which one was in fact correct, if any, will remain quite the challenge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp has written an essay on the false alarmism surrounding a warming Antarctica. What follows is the English version:
============================================
Every Year The Same Story – Ice Melt in Antarctica
By Rudolf Kipp
The topic of this article ought to handled in short order. When you take a look at the data from Antarctica, it is plainly visible that the ice around the 7th continent has been more or less growing since satellite measurements began in 1979.

No sign of melting here.
However, you’d never know it from the news we get from this corner of the planet. After all, any report about steadily growing ice simply doesn’t fit the narrative of the growing threat of global warming and the related melting ice caps.
Indeed the media never send us reports about the continent as a whole. Rather, they prefer to focus on what is happening on a very small area at the fringes of the South Pole, a northern area of about 0.5 million square km², which represents about 4% of the entire Antarctic surface.

For climate science and our media, the Antarctic Peninsula is of decisive importance, as ultimately it is the only place at the entire South Pole where “something is happening”. This region has huge ice sheets, which float on the sea and are mostly connected to the ice on land. Common for these ice sheets is that their tips break off time and again in a natural process known as calving.
And it just happens that the ice sheets on the West Antarctic Peninsula are everything but static. Since the dynamics of these ice fields have been measured by satellites with increasing precision, it has been observed that these sheets break up and get released into the sea as huge icebergs.
According to prevailing dogma, all this can only be blamed on the human impact on climate. Thus year after year we’ve been receiving reports about the imminent collapse of the Antarctic ice sheets. Here are just a few from the German press: 2002, 2003,  2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.
This tradition of yearly alarms continues this year as well, this time from the European Space Agency (ESA), which appears in a report at Spiegel. The evaluation of satellite photos over the last 10 years shows that the Larsen-B-Ice Shelf has lost three quarters of its area. According to ESA, the blame for this is (man-made) global warming. After all, northern West Antarctica has warmed 2.5°C over the last 50 years.

So with such claims, it is truly worth taking a look at the measurement stations in this region. Let’s take a look at the results from measurements taken at the Larsen Ice Shelf. We see immediately that the trend is relatively constant, if not slightly downward, since measurements began in 1985.

Temperature development Larsen Ice Shelf (NASA GISS)
However, the measurements at the Larsen Ice Shelf go back only to 1985, and the ESA press release expressly states a temperature development going back 50 years. So let’s look at the next stations closest to the Larsen Ice Shelf with sufficiently long measurement histories. They are (see charts below) Faraday (since 1944), Rothera Point (since 1946), Bernado O’Higgins (since 1963), Base Esperanz (since 1945) and Base Arturo P (since 1966).
All these stations have one thing in common: A “warming of 2.5°C over the last 50 years” is nowhere to be found. And any warming that did occur, did so without exception before 1980. Taking this into account, attributing the break-up of the Larsen Ice Shelf to global warming is already quite adventurous, to put it mildly.

So, how long before James Hansen tampers with this data?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) provides a statement on the senselessness of renewable energy in Germany and features a video by skeptic EU Parliamentarian Herbert Reul (Germany).
EU Parliamentarian Herbert Reul of Germany’s conservative CDU Party has produced a video about energy policy in Germany and put it up at Youtube and the Internet. His primary message: The isolated energy policy of the German government will cost Germans €2.3 trillion €. In numbers that’s €2,300,000,000,000. And for what? To brake a computer-simulated increase in global temperature a whole 0.003 °C. It is claimed that it serves to ‘protect the climate’.
That some German Parliamentarians are finally beginning to address the failed and destructive German energy policy is very welcome. However, they’re are few in number. We suppose that there is a lack of courage and knowledge among them to articulate themselves to the mainstream ideologues of the eco-industrial complex. Perhaps a video is the right approach to take for now.
As European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer reported at the Climate Conference of the Free Democrat Party (FDP) of Saxony on 30 June 2012, the European Parliament recently took up the the proposals of the Commission and ratified the so-called Energy Efficiency Directivese (also see here). In it there’s very little about energy efficiency, but much more about rationing energy. The directives obligate member countries to make sure that energy providers sell their customers 1.5% less energy every year. Thus energy shall be – with no need to do so – rationed.
That’s a scandal of the first order and a socialistic assault on the free market economy that will have far-reaching repercussions. Even “if all of Germany switched off all its power overnight, hardly anyone would notice globally,“ said Krahmer. And Professor Bodo Sturm of the HTWK Leipzig confirmed in his presentation at this conference: ‘Germany’s total share of global emissions of greenhouse gases is less than 3%. That alone shows how senseless many mini-actions for reducing CO2 are in Germany, for example the symbolic turning off of lights for one hour.'”

====================================================
And here’s the video of Parliamentarian Herbert Reul:

The main points:
0:25: Energy policy in Germany is driven solely by climate – cost has been thrown overboard.

0.50: Go-it-alone policy would be irresponsible. A large consulting company concluded: “Going-it-alone will cost Germany €2,300,000,000,000.00 (2.3 trillion euros).
1.30: Wind energy costs an enormous sum of money and its supply is unreliable. The massive infrastructure for delivering it to markets just isn’t there.
2.20: Just the solar systems installed through 2010 are going to cost Germans 80 – 100 billion euros.
3.00: Renewable energies need generation systems, transmission infrastructure and back-up systems. It’s going to be extremely expensive, so expensive that a significant part of the citizenry is not going to be able to afford it and industry is going to leave.
4.00: It’s going to cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. People claim that renewable energies will create 300,000 jobs, but it’s also going to cost billions and over a million traditional jobs.
4.50: Renewable energies are a major assault on the environment and wildlife.
5.20: The supply of fossil fuels is vastly larger than what we once believed. Coal for 300 years…America shale gas is revolutionizing the energy market. Spreading fear that energy is running out is pure nonsense.
6.00: The solution is a mix of energy sources. Energy politics must be honest and informed.
Unfortunately Herbert Reul is only one of very few within the German conservative CDU party. But he at least represents a start.

"An influx of climate-denying far-right MEPs could pose a “toxic” threat to EU climate policy after the European elections, according to senior MEPs and academics. Populist parties are expected to take up to a third of the parliamentary seats in Thursday’s vote, with Matteo Salvini’s League in contention to be the largest single party, and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) overtaking Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche in some polls.  Cooperation among the fractious far-right forces is far from assured, but those at the centre of an alliance Salvini is trying to craft with Le Pen, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice party (PiS) in Poland view climate action as a potential barrier to fossil fuel-led growth. With key decisions looming on EU emissions targets, fears are growing that rightwingers could block or water down EU climate action. Alexander Carius, the director of the Berlin-based Adelphi Institute thinktank, said: “Climate policy is going to be the new battleground between the democratic centre and rightwing populists attacking institutions and questioning the scientific foundation of decision-making. The challenge for democratic parties will be to find an answer to that.” The UK Labour party’s environment spokesman in the EU parliament, Seb Dance, said: “They [populists] will seek to be disruptors and saboteurs. If they return in sufficient numbers, my fear is that they will act as a magnet moving the political centre to the right.” A strong populist vote could also “lead to nasty nominations from member states for European commission posts”, he added. “That combination could be quite toxic.” A bigger number of populist MEPs would win greater visibility and access to resources. They would also have more leverage in battles to select commission officials, committee members, rapporteurs and legislative amendments. “The tone in discussions is going to change,” Carius warned. “EU climate policy and debate on the level of ambition in the next European parliament will be significantly lowered.” An Adelphi study in February found populist groups were using the electoral campaign trail to raise tropes of scientific dissent, sovereignty, economic loss and a multilateral global elite to oppose the Paris climate agreement. The extreme-right Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) bloc had the most negative voting record of any grouping in the last parliament on 22 climate proposals analysed in the study. Salvini’s League voted against almost all key climate proposals in the last parliament, while RN rejects the United Nations framework convention on climate change as a “communist project”. Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, like Ukip in the UK, denies climate change, arguing that “CO2 is not a pollutant, but an indispensable component of all life”. The RN has adopted a green patriotism stance, prioritising a localism vision of Europe as “the first ecological civilisation” over emissions reductions. The party strongly opposes wind energy. Last week, French politicians demanded an inquiry into links between Le Pen’s RN and Donald Trump’s electoral strategist, Steve Bannon, who has described wind turbines as “bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes”. The backdrop to the EU poll has been one of escalating school climate strikes and protests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion. Surveys show more than three-quarters of Europeans want politicians to prioritise the climate crisis. But populists have profited from the backlash created when such action has targeted poorer constituencies. Many environmental NGOs believe the greater threat to climate policy comes from centrist and traditional hard-right parties, which have a weak climate record. The Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout said that although the climate crisis would become a more polarised debate in the next parliament, “the real challenge will be with the Christian Democratic right”. “The European People’s party usually does deals with the Socialists and Democrats but that will likely not be possible this time, as those two blocs won’t have a majority. That’s a good element. I think that the increase in right populists will more and more force the EPP to turn to us for a serious conversation on policy.” However, Stella Schaller, who co-authored the Adelphi study, said any realignment would take place in the context of far-right groups “trying to create a new culture war and line of conflict on climate change”. Greece’s neo-fascist Golden Dawn party views the environment as “the cradle of our race, it mirrors our culture and civilisation, and it is therefore our duty to protect it”. Orbán’s Fidesz party has also raised ecological issues, such as the threat posed by invasive species. Far-right strains in ecological thinking can arguably be traced back to Hitler’s Nazi party, which passed conservation laws and fetishised a natural order connecting blood and soil. Carius said: “Nature conservation and the protection of cultural landscapes that is rooted in the romanticism of the 19th century seems to be very appealing to far-right parties as a way of putting an ideological cloud around the countryside and nation.”"
"Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, is introducing a second portion of his climate change plan as most Democratic contenders for president have yet to officially roll out their own big-picture proposals. Inslee’s 38-page document is focused on creating jobs. It outlines a $9tn investment over 10 years and seeks to create 8m jobs aimed at decarbonizing the economy. In an earlier plan, he vowed to make the US carbon neutral by 2045.  Inslee wants to upgrade buildings, replace water and transit infrastructure, clean up manufacturing and quintuple spending on clean energy and climate research. Many of those efforts would require congressional legislation. The blueprint echoes progressives’ Green New Deal, but with far more details and fewer commitments to social programs. Inslee told the Guardian: “You think of the Green New Deal as saying, ‘We should go to the moon’ – but in my plan is how to build the rocket ship. They both have their value.” He suggested other candidates might not have the “spine” to take the bold action needed. The first paragraphs of his plan evoke the New Deal, noting that Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid out the details of that program 86 years ago this month. Inslee quoted Roosevelt and said: “We are working toward a definite goal, which is to prevent the return of conditions which came very close to destroying what we call modern civilization.” He added, in his own words: “Today, America faces a new threat to our modern civilization: climate change. This challenge also presents an unprecedented economic opportunity, to lead the world in building a clean energy future.” The campaign so far has focused mostly on climate change, but Inslee insists he is not a one-issue candidate. “This is not a single issue, it’s all the issues,” he said, adding that rising temperatures and extreme weather threaten the economy, public health and national security. He said his jobs plan could also fix wage stagnation. Inslee also touted his Washington track record on clean energy, a public health insurance option, teacher pay increases and legalized marijuana. Six senators running for president have endorsed the Green New Deal, and many frequently highlight the urgency of climate change. But only Inslee and the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke have debuted their own specific plans with goals and deadlines. O’Rourke would invest $5tn in the effort and seek carbon neutrality by 2050. Inslee says his “Evergreen Economy Plan” would ensure “high-paying, high-skilled jobs building a stronger, healthier, more just, inclusive and sustainable future”, featuring more collective bargaining power for unions, jobs for fossil fuel workers and gender pay equity. Daniel Kammen, a University of California professor and contributor to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, called Inslee’s plan “just what we need”. Kammen, a former science envoy for the state department, said: “It is not only vital for our environment, but it is a recipe for more affordable housing and vibrant communities, good-paying jobs, corporate and municipal accountability, and global leadership for the United States.” Other candidates have endorsed specific policies in the past or discussed narrower proposals they would support. The former vice-president Joe Biden has come under criticism after an adviser suggested he would take a “middle ground” approach to tackling climate change, allowing the continued use of natural gas, which warms the planet. Biden has since defended his record and said his plan will come out soon. Another expected frontrunner, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, has heralded the Green New Deal, including at a Washington DC event this week with the youth-led Sunrise Movement and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders has previously drafted ambitious climate plans but has not expanded on them this election season. “You know and I know that the scientific community has been very clear,” Sanders said at the event. “If we do not act boldly and aggressively to transform our global energy system away from fossil fuels within the next few years – a very short period of time – there will be irreparable harm done to our planet.” Sanders said the US must lead the world with an approach emphasizing the Green New Deal, but he did not elaborate. The Green New Deal advocates a “10-year mobilization” to reduce emissions but does not specify an end date to make the country carbon-neutral. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren this week called for the military to help fight climate change. Warren also advocates for banning new fossil fuel drilling and mining on public lands."

"On the hottest days, Leitu Frank feels like she can’t breathe any more. The housewife and mother of five decamps from her airless concrete home to catch the breeze in a simple wooden shack by the water’s edge. She folds washing and stares out at the unsettled turquoise sea, its moods and rhythms increasingly unpredictable, as its rising proximity threatens to strangle her family. “The sea is eating all the sand,” says Frank, 32, dressed in a pink stretchy T-shirt and faded sarong. “Before, the sand used to stretch out far, and when we swam we could see the sea floor, and the coral. Now, it is cloudy all the time, and the coral is dead. Tuvalu is sinking.” “Tuvalu is sinking” is the local catch-all phrase for the effects of climate change on this tiny island archipelago on the frontline of global warming. A Polynesian country situated in Oceania, Tuvalu is no more than a speck in the Pacific ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. The fourth smallest nation in the world, Tuvalu is home to just 11,000 people, most of whom live on the largest island of Fongafale, where they are packed in and fighting for space. Tuvalu’s total land area accounts for less than 26 sq km. Already, two of Tuvalu’s nine islands are on the verge of going under, the government says, swallowed by sea-rise and coastal erosion. Most of the islands sit barely three metres above sea level, and at its narrowest point, Fongafale stretches just 20m across. During storms, waves batter the island from the east and the west, “swallowing” the country, in the words of the locals. Many say they have nightmares that the sea will soon gobble them up for good, and not just as a distant fear in their slumber – but by the next generation. Scientists predict Tuvalu could become uninhabitable in the next 50 to 100 years. Locals say they feel it could be much sooner. Nausaleta Setani, Frank’s aunt, sleeps beside the lagoon at night in the wooden shack, using a float buoy as a pillow. Initially a non-believer in climate change, like many older people on the island, Setani has slowly become convinced of the science as her daily life becomes tougher with every erratic movement of the sea. Nausaleta Setani with her nephew in a makeshift structure they use for sleeping, near the Funafuti lagoon “The weather is changing very quickly, day to day, hour to hour,” says Setani, 54, paradoxically soothed and disturbed by the ocean lapping metres away from her hut. “I have been learning the things that are happening are the result of man, especially [from] other countries. It makes me sad. But I understand other countries do what is best for their people. I am from a small country. All I want is for the bigger countries to respect us, and think of our lives.” The United Nations Development Programme classifies Tuvalu as a resource poor, “least-developed country”, that is “extremely vulnerable” to the effects of climate change. Porous, salty soil has made the ground almost totally useless for planting, destroying staple pulaka crops and decreasing the yields of various fruits and vegetables. Starchy Pacific Island staples such as taro and cassava now have to be imported at great expense, along with most other food. Since the rising ocean contaminated underwater ground supplies, Tuvalu is now totally reliant on rainwater, and droughts are occurring with alarming frequency. Even if the locals could plant successfully, there is now not enough rain to keep even simple kitchen gardens alive. Scenes of Funafuti: a typical home, and freshly caught fish The Frank family spend around AU$200 (£105) a fortnight on groceries, a bill that keeps rising as the fruit on the trees that ring their modest home – breadfruit, bananas and pandanus – fail to ripen, and fall to the sandy ground, inedible and rotten. The fish too, the stuff of life here, have become suspect. Ciguatera poisoning affects reef fish who have ingested micro-algaes expelled by bleached coral. When fish infected with these ciguatera toxins are consumed by humans, it causes an immediate and sometimes severe illness: vomiting, fevers and diarrhoea. At the local hospital, a specialist department has been set up to study and manage climate change-related illnesses. Around ten Tuvaluans present with ciguatera poisoning every week, accounting for about 10% of the weekly case-load of climate-related illnesses. Suria Eusala Paufolau (left, or above on mobile), acting chief of public health, says cases of fish poisoning began to climb a decade ago; around the same time the weather really started to go haywire. Climate-related illnesses that have increased on par with the changing weather include influenza, fungal diseases, conjunctivitis, and dengue fever, according to the hospital’s research. Higher daily temperatures are also putting people at daily risk of dehydration, heatstroke and heat rashes, Paufolau says. “Generally the local population does not see the link between climate change and health. But there is always a sense of fear about what is happening to our home.” Tuvalu is heavily reliant on foreign aid, with most of its GDP made up from donations from the UN and neighbouring countries. Education and employment prospects on the island are limited, and the majority of young people whose families can afford it leave to study in Fiji, Australia or New Zealand – a “brain drain” that has been extensively documented. But as climate change batters the seashore, a trickle of young Tuvaluans are returning, even if coming home can feel claustrophobic after the freedoms of life beyond the islands. Tapua Pasuna, 24, was crowned Miss Tuvalu last year, and used her platform to campaign for women’s rights and education. The daughter of the country’s third female MP, Pasuna describes herself as “floating” since she returned from university studies in New Zealand, and says she was drawn back to the island by extensive family obligations, and a sense of responsibility to do what she could for the archipelago. Tapua Pasuna, 24, crowned Miss Tuvalu 2018 “I left in 2010. When I came back I immediately noticed the difference. The heat is sometimes unbearable now, and the erosion is also dramatic. Some of my favourite spots have disappeared,” says Pasuna, sitting in a stiff-backed wooden chair in her tropical garden, the barely constructed seawall just metres from her home. “I feel like this is a part of who I am and I shouldn’t just run away from it, even though it’s disappearing. To just abandon it at such a time as this, when it is hurting – I don’t feel comfortable. I don’t feel like I can do that.” If this sounds like a tidal wave of despair, the mood on the ground is far less acute. When planes aren’t expected, children ride their bikes and play volleyball on the country’s airstrip, while young courting couples take lazy laps on their motorbikes. In the afternoons, people snooze in hammocks for hours, and light campfires on the beaches to fry fish and keep the mosquitoes away. A sleepy, sanguine air permeates day-to-day life, as locals watch the lapping of the waves move ever closer. “Come what may,” locals say again and again, quoting the prime minister, “God will save us.” The largest building in the capital, Funafuti, is Government House, a three-storey white monolith that houses the offices of the country’s MPs. Tuvalu’s official government policy is to stay on the island – “come what may”. Plans for adapting to climate change include the ongoing – and much delayed – construction of a sea wall to protect the administrative centre of the capital, funded by  the UNDP. The local town council has a plan to dredge and reclaim land at the south of Fongafale, raise the land 10 metres above sea level, and build high-density housing. It is a plan that would cost US$300m (£233m), and that so far has no funding. Fongafale island, home to the Tuvaluan capital, Funafuti Other options – such as constructing a floating island – are also being explored, as is importing refuse from Australian mines to construct an energy wall to ring the atolls, breaking up the power of the sea as it smashes towards the islands. How the reef ecosystem would survive such a wall has not been explained. Evacuating the islands is the last resort, says Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, despite frequent talk from Pacific neighbours that Tuvaluans will become the world’s first climate-change refugees. Enele Sopoaga, prime minister of Tuvalu Many government officials openly express anger at the election of Donald Trump, saying his climate change scepticism has precipitated a huge step back for global cooperation on climate issues, and made Tuvalu’s small voice on the world stage even smaller. “I think they hate us,” says Soseala Tinilau (below), the director of the Environment ministry. Tinilau is referring to the cheerful burning of coal by the US and Australia, among others, despite a recent report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changewarning that global warming must be kept to a maximum of 1.5C over the next 12 years to avoid catastrophic climate affects. “During COP [climate] negotiations we had to stay up till 7am to ensure we were listened too,” says Tinilau. “The world want to ignore us. They want to keep behaving as if we don’t exist, as if what’s happening here isn’t true. We can’t let them.” Fiji has repeatedly offered land to the Tuvaluan government to relocate their population 1,200km south, an offer the Sopoaga government has not accepted. In a recent essay, former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd suggested Tuvalu’s citizens could be offered full citizenship in exchange for their country’s maritime and fisheries rights; a proposal rejected by Sopoaga as “imperial thinking”. “Moving outside of Tuvalu will not solve any climate change issues … If you put these people in the middle of industrialised countries it will simply boost their consumptions and increase greenhouse gas emissions,” says Sopoaga, a fierce advocate for global cooperation on climate change issues. “I am very worried about this very self-defeatist approach to suggest that people from low-lying, at-risk countries could be relocated. Because it fails to understand the implications of this issue for the entire world.” Sopoaga says there is “no plan B” for Tuvalu, and every government effort is concentrated on adapting to the changing weather patterns – and staying put. “We cannot just say, ‘Kick these people out.’ It is too simplistic and defeatist an approach,” says Sopoaga. “I think it would be a great shame for the world to allow that to happen. I believe we still have time to make this island very attractive, very beautiful, and continue to be inhabited by generations of Tuvaluans to come.” Seen from the air, Tuvalu looks like paradise: a slim scar of sand densely planted with coconut palms, and ringed by shallow emerald waters. But up close, the fragility of the land reveals itself. Beside the runway, golden sand spills on to the concrete, and scraggly green grass struggles to survive. The horizon is flat, and dominated by sea; sea that presses at you from every side. The air – ripe, over-cooked – pushes people into the dark interiors of their homes in the middle of the day, sticky and cloying. At Tuvalu’s Bureau of Meteorology, situated on the edge of the runway – with pig pens to its left and the country’s prison to its right (home to just six inmates) – Nikotemo Iona and his small team are working overtime as they crunch the latest rainfall measurements. They are hours away from declaring another drought. Nikotemo Iona at the Bureau of Meteorology According to local climate data, Iona says the biggest impacts of climate change on Tuvalu have been rising air temperatures, more intense and frequent storm surges and decreasing rainfall, as well as the total inundation of low-lying coastal parts of Funafuti – including, sometimes, the country’s lifeline, its runway. “Many people intend to migrate in response to climate change,” says Iona, sitting inside his squat, concrete office, designed to stay upright and continue broadcasting during cyclone season, which is intensifying year on year. “However, most of the older generation do not want to move as they believe the will lose their identity, culture, lifestyle and traditions. But I believe that younger generations intend to migrate for the sake of the future generations.” During storm surges or the highest tides, the Pacific Ocean bubbles up from the sandy soil under Enna Sione’s small yellow house. Fifty metres away, palm trees lie scattered across a rocky, coral strewn beach, turning grey in the hot sun, their twisted, decaying root systems facing skywards. Enna Sione, next to the ocean that frequently floods her home Sitting on a slayed coconut tree, Sione’s eyes are troubled as she stares at the ocean, beating its relentless path against her home. Sione, her husband and four children are planning to migrate to New Zealand in the next two years – to join more than 2,000 of fellow Tuvaluans already resident in the country; a migrant population that doubles every five years. “The weather has really, extremely changed. Sometimes I feel scared of the ocean,” says Sione, who adds that she is leaving for the sake of her kids. “Maybe one time Tuvalu will disappear. From what I can see a lot is already gone. I think one day we will disappear.”"
"A radical Green New Deal has the potential to unite progressives across Europe in the same way as nationalist and rightwing movements are mobilising around immigration and xenophobia, according to the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Varoufakis, a co-founder of the Democracy in Europe Movement (DiEM25), which is standing candidates in Germany and Greece in Thursday’s European elections, told the Guardian a radical green agenda could act as the “glue and cement” for an alliance of leftists, greens and liberals. “I think this a very optimistic moment,” said Varoufakis, who is standing for DiEM25 in Germany. “The ultra right, the xenophobic right have a rallying call, they have glue and cement holding them together and that is racism, xenophobia, migration and narratives of gloom about Islamists coming to Europe and taking over.” Progressives, however, have lacked a similar “rallying cry”, according to Varoufakis, who has become one of the leading figures on the European left in the last decade. He argued that a Green New Deal, financed by green investment bonds issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB), could transform the economy, creating sustainable, secure jobs, and help tackle the unfolding environmental crisis while uniting young and old, socialists, Greens and liberals across the continent. “This is a great opportunity for progressives across Europe to unite around a doable, radical but at the same time moderate agenda,” he said. “It can be for progressives what immigration and racism is to the rightists.” The idea of a Green New Deal has gained traction in both the US and Europe in recent months. The European Greens have endorsed a version of it, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, recently set out his vision for a similar programme. DiEM25 said that since the launch of its campaign for a Green New Deal for Europe this month, hundreds of politicians, MEP candidates and civil society leaders – including leading figures in the Labour and Green parties in the UK – had pledged their support. Varoufakis said he had been working closely with the UK Labour party, which has already committed to implementing a transformative “green industrial revolution”. The Labour grassroots groups Momentum and Labour for a Green New Deal are pushing the party to go further and commit to a comprehensive plan for the UK hit zero emissions by 2030 and create hundreds of thousands of well-paid, secure jobs. The growing awareness of a climate crisis is reflected in a surge of support for the Greens across Europe, who are on course for their strongest showing to date in the European elections and could find themselves kingmakers in a newly fragmented EU parliament. Varoufakis said he had been working on his plans since 2003, and the challenge now was to implement a coordinated, pan-European proposal that could be scaled up. “A Green New Deal for Europe will slingshot us out of this morass of under-investment, unemployment, and climate destruction and toward a future of sustainable, shared prosperity,” he said. DiEM25 is urging people across the continent to vote for MEPs who are committed to a radical Green New Deal – especially in light of the threat posed by the resurgent populist right to action on the environment. Under the DiEM25 proposals, 5% of Europe’s GDP would be invested in a green transition, financed via bonds issued by the EIB. Varoufakis said there was currently around €3tn “sloshing around” in the financial sector – held in bank accounts, being used by companies to buy back their own shares and in the insurance and derivatives sectors. He said the plan, which has already won the support of some bureaucrats, could be implemented “tomorrow without changing any of the existing European treaties”. “Think of the GND as a sponge that can soak up the excess liquidity in the financial sector that is currently doing a lot of damage,” he said. The momentum behind a Green New Deal follows protests by Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes movement, which have helped to push the climate crisis higher up the political agenda. Varoufakis said the protests were inspirational and he called on politicians and voters to take their cue from the younger generation. “This election is not a beauty contest. The future of Europe and the future of humanity rest on its outcome,” he said. “We stand with the climate strikers, because when the adults in the room fail to respond to the greatest threat that our species has ever faced, it is time for us to follow the children who have the courage to show the way.”"
"In the three years since Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement berated literature for its failure to rise to the challenge of climate breakdown, fiction writers have made up for lost time. Indeed cli-fi, once a subset of science fiction, has been so quickly subsumed by realism that its days as a self-contained genre may be numbered. The mass extinction of species has taken longer to percolate. While threatened ecosystems have sparked an explosion of powerful, elegiac non-fiction by Helen Macdonald, George Monbiot, Kathleen Jamie, Robert Macfarlane, Katharine Norbury and others, novels about wildlife have stuck largely to their traditional habitat of the children’s and young adult shelves.  But here, too, change is afoot. Polly Clark was already a prize-winning poet when she published her 2017 debut novel Larchfield. Its successor, the unsettling, immersive Tiger, joins a small vanguard of novels – including Laline Paull’s The Bees, Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy and Richard Powers’s tree epic The Overstory - which approach non-human life in diverting new ways. Evoking non-human minds demands a great deal of a fiction writer: the imagination to grasp and convey the instincts, habitats and characteristics of other species; the time, money, humility and charm to conduct deep research; and the restraint to avoid obvious pitfalls of anthropomorphism, zoological pedantry and romanticisation. Undaunted, Clark cut her teeth as a zookeeper in Edinburgh, then travelled to the forests of Siberia to track Amur tigers. The resulting novel is a startling, gore-splattered, nerve-racking exploration of how human and animal territories – both physical and psychic – collide. Here she is on a pregnant tiger, “always a tail tip away from catastrophe”, hunting: If the creature was breathing, in range, the Countess would see it. If it dared to lick its lips, if it thought to raise its snout, she would see it.  She oriented her right ear towards the shift in air pressure. She heard, some ten lengths away, a breath. Not a creature’s breath: it was the breath of the atmosphere when it sets a creature down. Bird. Coming in to land. Clark’s human protagonists are also fierce, wary, endangered creatures, either by nature or circumstance. Frieda Bloom is a British primatologist struggling to function in her research job in the wake of a mugging that has left her with a dented skull and at permanent risk of cranial haemorrhage. She pilfers morphine to relieve the sense of vulnerability that has heightened her attunement to non-human signals. “Lately I had become possessed of a prey animal’s radar and was unable to resist the assault of fine emotional details. These were mostly unprovable, rendering me more like a dazed pilgrim recounting a vision than a scientist.” This almost hallucinatory bewitchment prevails in Frieda’s animal encounters, first with bonobos and then - after her addiction betrays her and she loses her job - with the Siberian tiger acquired by the ramshackle zoo that offers her a shot at redemption. So compellingly does Clark summon the precariousness of Frieda’s hold on her professionalism and sanity that it is a wrench when the story shifts its focus to Tomas, a Russian conservationist battling personal and political demons. That she succeeds is partly due to her evocation of the Siberian wilderness as a character in its own right. “The winter forest creaks but does not sigh … Here, trees shoulder time like a burden. There is no fight, only labour.” Burning, it becomes a “great gobble” of flame, “the wind crying and the trunks screaming … Heat scowled through the snow.” It was Vladimir Putin who created the reserves that protect Siberia’s vanishingly rare tigers from poachers supplying the Chinese market with “remedies” for erectile dysfunction. But now the president’s envoy is to visit the vast territory that Tomas polices, and if he’s not impressed, the project itself is at stake. Having ratcheted up the tension with the discovery of a mutilated human body, in the third section Clark depicts the isolated, stubborn survivalism of Edit, an indigenous woman determined to reanimate the lost legacy of her tribe for the sake of her daughter. This sets the stage for a finale that is both satisfying and impossible to second-guess. Combining the propulsiveness of a thriller with the raw yet meditative tone of a memoir, Clark writes with a poet’s ear and a naturalist’s eye, and has a deep grasp of the profound contract between indigenous peoples and the beasts they revere. She never loses sight of the endangered creature that forms the beating heart of a passionate, remarkable and uplifting novel. • Liz Jensen’s The Uninvited is published by Bloomsbury.

"As the Australian election approached, the UK parliament declared a national climate emergency. Perhaps, with a different electoral outcome, Australia would have followed suit. Instead, at least for the next three years, we will ignore the emergency while chasing the mirage of coalmines promising to create thousands of jobs. That mirage began to fade almost immediately with the announcement that the China Stone project, right next to Adani’s Carmichael mine project in the Galilee Basin, had suspended its bid for mining leases. Other projects in the basin have been on hold for years. The prospects for the Carmichael mine are not much better, at least in the absence of a large injection of public money (which may now be on the cards). Adani announced in November that it would provide $2bn of its own money to fund the project. Gautam Adani could afford to spend this much if he chose to do so, but has so far shown no sign of willingness to pour such a large proportion of his personal wealth into an obvious dud. Such announcements have been made before and nothing has happened. The coal boom of the last decade will fade away, whatever Australian governments do. By contrast, the climate emergency is not going away and will force itself on our attention sooner or later. When it does, we will face the need to reduce our emissions rapidly and to levels well below the very soft target the current government has set itself. To match the commitments of comparable countries, Australia would need to cut emissions in 2030 by at least 40% relative to 2005. Moreover, a central point of the Paris agreement in 2015 was recognition that these initial commitments were inadequate and would need to be ratcheted up over subsequent rounds of negotiation. By the time we return our attention to the climate crisis, we will be facing a policy emergency. Emergencies are costly. Problems that could have been addressed efficiently at low cost over a number of years turn into crises that must be addressed immediately with whatever measures are available. A few examples illustrate the point. The first step in any serious program of emissions reduction is the transition away from coal-fired electricity generation. If we had implemented Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2012, or maintained the Gillard government’s carbon price, or even adopted the clean energy target proposed by the Finkel review in 2017 we would, like other developed countries, be on the road to coal-free electricity. The UK, which relied on coal for 50% of its electricity in the early 1990s, introduced emissions trading in 2002, and is now within a few years of eliminating coal-fired power altogether. As things stand, however, Australia will be faced with the necessity of making the same transition over a period of perhaps five to 10 years. That will entail massive investment in solar PV, storage and wind, totalling perhaps $100bn. Given the uncertain environment created by decades of policy reversals, governments will need either to undertake this investment directly or provide long-term guarantees. At the same time, the existing coal fleet will need to be closed down as rapidly as possible. Any investment in new or refurbished plants financed by the current government will be entirely wasted. The story is similar with respect to transport. In 2014 the Climate Change Authority (of which I was then a member) proposed a light vehicle fuel-efficiency standards which would have saved motorists money over the life of a vehicle, while substantially reducing emissions. More recently, the emergence of electric vehicles has provided new opportunities for decarbonisation. The current government rejected the fuel-efficiency scheme and has derided electric vehicles – supposedly it might have an electric vehicles policy by mid-2020. The result of this delay is that when we get serious about the climate emergency, we will have a large fleet of some of the world’s most fuel-inefficient cars, many of them nearly new. The efficient option of providing subsidies for electric vehicles, as Norway has done, will be too slow to achieve the necessary reduction in emissions. So we will be forced to adopt some form of “cash for clunkers” scheme, in which people are paid to scrap old, inefficient vehicles. This was a terrible idea when it was proposed by Julia Gillard as an alternative to the carbon price she had promised would never be introduced and was promptly scrapped once the 2010 election produced such a price. But by the time we start taking action, it will be one of the few options capable of producing the rapid shift we will need. Extending this analysis across the economy, it’s clear that emergency measures to reduce emissions will be very costly, compared with the efficient measures we could have adopted with a bipartisan commitment. That’s the bad news. The good news is that the cost of an emergency response, while large compared with an efficient policy, will be very small in relation to an economy with an annual output, by 2030, of $2tn a year or more. To see this, we can turn to the estimates prepared for the government’s election campaign by Brian Fisher of BAEconomics. These worst-case numbers, higher than the costs of the most radical emergency measures, amount to around $50bn a year, or 2.5% to 3% of national income. That’s a lot of money – like adding a new program on the scale of the NBN or the submarine contract every year for five to 10 years. At the same time, it’s small enough that it would barely be noticed against the background of the general fluctuations in the economy. The average household has lost far more from the wage stagnation of the last decade. As far as the government budget is concerned, the likely impact is comparable to that of increasing health expenditures arising from our increased life expectancy and the development of new treatments. More importantly, the cost of an emergency response to climate change is trivial compared with the benefits of stabilising the global climate at a level that is livable for humans and the natural environment. We are currently shirking our contribution to this global public good, and free riding on the efforts of others. But sooner or later we will have to pay our share. • John Quiggin is professor of economics at the University of Queensland.

"The shadow environment minister, Tony Burke, has declared Labor can no longer pursue a climate policy based on a market mechanism to reduce emissions. But he insists there can be no retreat from what the science says needs to happen to avoid dangerous warming.  In a significant piece of post-election positioning, Burke told Guardian Australia Labor needs to adopt new policies of regulation and spending – like the Green New Deal model pursued by some Democrats in the United States, or like the existing Australian Direct Action model – because that is the only way a majority of Australian voters will sign on to climate action. While Labor can compromise on the mechanism, Burke says there can be absolutely no compromise on the science. “The reason we can’t compromise on the science is this: there’s a limited time for the nations of the world to act to keep us within 2C. “There is a chance the tipping points are reached before you hit 2C, but if we work on the basis that we’ve at least got until 2C warming before the whole planet takes on its own spiralling cycle of heating up, then compromise on the science is completely unacceptable, perverse and no go,” Burke said in an interview with Guardian Australia. Burke said he was not sure where Labor’s revised climate policy framework would land after internal discussion once the new party leadership had been confirmed, but he said the model he had in mind would be part regulation, and part “direct government investment in different parts of industry, particularly storage technology”. “If a market mechanism is off the table, there are only two choices – you get into territory that in terms of policy purity you haven’t wanted to go to, or you give up, and if we are being true to being a Labor party, we can’t give up. “This issue is as much core business for Labor as anything we do in welfare or redistribution of taxation. This is about making sure we are looking after the disadvantaged, except the disadvantaged here isn’t between rich and poor, it’s between present and future.” The shadow environment minister said a market mechanism, like a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme, remained optimal policy, because it was an efficient way to deal with the challenge of reducing pollution. But he said Labor had to accept that after successive election losses, the voting public didn’t concur. “We’ve now spent 11 years using market mechanisms to deal with climate change, and for 11 years, the Australian public have been saying no. “Effectively we’ve based our policies on two principles, both of which are rock solid. The first is follow the science to set emissions targets, and the second is to provide a framework and allow businesses to make decisions within that.” Burke noted Labor had championed a market model for more than a decade in part because that’s what stakeholders, including major business groups, said they wanted, but he noted the same stakeholders never turned up to champion the reform when the fight got difficult politically. “They have never come to our defence when we have been under attack.” He said a market mechanism was efficient, but it left Labor politically exposed. “It leads you inevitably to a set of circumstances where you can’t answer questions about the costs to the economy, because the answer will always be it all depends [on market behaviour]. “The hard right went first to a Direct Action model and in a number of ways, so did the environment movement that wanted very specific measures, sometimes even calling for very specific decisions to be made in terms of environmental approvals.” He said Labor’s approach in this term should be looking at climate policy as an industry policy that would protect blue-collar jobs during the inevitable transition from emissions intensity to decarbonisation. “There may well be a pathway for us to shift to a more traditional industry policy but focused on those aspects of industry that help us meet the targets we need to be able to meet. “This may end up being particularly pertinent in Queensland, given a whole lot of the minerals required for renewables come from the Mt Isa region.” Burke said he wasn’t sure whether a 45% emissions reduction target would be the correct threshold at the next election. “Forty-five per cent reduction has been the threshold. I don’t know what that will mean by the time of the next election – whether the 2030 date shifts and the percentage shifts with it – I don’t know because the science will need to be updated. “It will be updated and the information that comes in – unless we get a massive surprise – will continue to be worse. For a long time climate scientists have projected a range of outcomes from modest shifts to more alarming outcomes, and consistently the lived experience has been at the more alarming end of those outcomes.” A number of senior figures have signalled Labor will go back to the drawing board on all major policies after losing the weekend election to the Coalition, including climate policy. While there will be solid internal support for continuing to pursue an ambitious policy within Labor ranks, there will also be a push in the opposite direction from regional MPs concerned about the party’s ability to hold coal regions when local communities are concerned about unemployment. Burke’s early positioning is an effort to swim across that rip and direct the internal recriminations towards a result that can square the two imperatives. Burke, from the New South Wales right faction, is backing leftwinger Anthony Albanese to replace Bill Shorten as the federal Labor leader."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you wonder why more and more among us are becoming skeptical of the claims made by the climate institutes, with some of us even believing they’ve long become crackpots and charlatans, then the following German ZDF public television video (in German) demonstrates why. H/t: kaltesonne.de/

When the Arctic set a record minimum sea ice extent this year, the media exploded with end-of-the world headlines claiming that man-made CO2 was driving the planet to the brink. But as the above video shows, the science changes completely when cold records are set. In the clip, ZDF television interviews scientists from the government-funded Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) to explain the Arctic record minimum and the Antarctic record maximum.
To ZDF’s credit they do say at the 1:40 mark that the 2007 Arctic minimum was due to a weeks-long high pressure system that pumped warm winds up into the Arctic, thus accelerating the melt. However, they then say that man had a hand in it. To support that, they interview Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke of the Alfred Wegener Institute at the 2:00 min mark.
There is no explanation for this other than the increase in man-made CO2.”
I’m not a professional reader of facial expressions, but to me he really does seem to have a hard time keeping a straight saying this, and it reminds me of an old great classic song by the Eagles.
At the 2:17 mark, Dr. Marcel Nicolaus describes this summer’s expedition to the Arctic with ice-breaking research ship Polarstern, saying:
We would have liked to have gone to the North Pole, but the ice was so thick that even the Polarstern could not manage it.”
The ZDF report then turns its attention to the Antarctic, saying at the 2:26 mark (my emphasis):
On the other side of the globe at the Antarctic, satellites have measured this the greatest ice extent since the start of observations. For the science, this is nothing unusual because the sea ice surrounding the South Pole has little to do with with climate events, and have much more to do with wind and weather.”
Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke explains how this all works:



<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




When the wind gets stronger in the Antarctic, then the ice gets spread out, meaning the sea ice area expands, and in the spaces between the ice chunks it is cold enough for new ice to form.”
Like we are all going to buy that. Lemke doesn’t offer any words on increased albedo leading to more cooling, like the reverse is at play in the Arctic, or why the wind explanation works for the Antarctic, but not the Arctic.
At the 3:16 mark, the ZDF reports then warns us in a grave tone:
But global warming will soon make it’s mark also over the South Pole. Most scientists agree on that.”
Lemke then adds that Antarctica was once ice-free and sea levels 70 meters higher. But this time:
Now we are helping the sea level to rise 70 meters; it will of course take several thousand years before that happens. But then we will have to move all the coastal cities that we have built and move them.”
The ZDF adds one final, comical warning with more grave tones at the 3:53 mark:
Global warming is not only threatening nature, but also human civilization. At least as we know it.”
Oh brother.
My conclusion is borrowed from that Eagles song: “I’d thought you’d realize by now. There aint no way to hide your lying eyes.”
The science is just getting worse and worse, and is turning into a freak sideshow. Nobody can take this nonsense seriously anymore.

"The environmental movement drew first blood on election night by helping independent Zali Steggall oust Tony Abbott but, in the end, the Coalition – which rated a miserable 4% on the Australian Conservation Foundation’s climate change scorecard – won. After the unexpected result environmentalists have questioned whether their campaign tactics need revision or whether the progressive side of politics was let down by other factors.   The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, told Guardian Australia climate “was definitely a top issue in the election … but it didn’t convert to votes in all the places it needed to”. The Wilderness Society national campaigns director, Lyndon Schneiders, said its campaign got swings in eight out of its nine target seats, despite Labor falling short in Reid, Flinders, Kooyong and likely Boothby. “I remember the 2004 forestry election, I know the feeling of ‘oh my god our issue sunk a party’ – I’m not feeling like that today,” Schneiders said. “I’m surprisingly optimistic – the last six months is the most we’ve talked about the environment for a generation.” But in Queensland, Nationals MPs including Michelle Landry and George Christensen are prepared to heap the blame – or more accurately, the credit for the conservatives’ strong vote in central Queensland – on campaigns like Stop Adani and particularly the convoy organised by the Bob Brown Foundation. “I never expected numbers like this,” Landry  told the ABC. “Thank you Bob Brown is all I can say. He came up here trying to tell Queenslanders what we should and shouldn’t be doing, and it actually drew together the agriculture and mining sectors – I’ve never seen anything like it.” Peter McCallum, the coordinator of the Mackay Conservation Group, rejects the suggestion, noting the LNP had made gains in places with no stake in coalmining, like Tasmania and Western Australia. But he said the “lie” that Labor would shut down the coal industry pushed by Clive Palmer and News Corp had hurt. O’Shanassy said the “myth” that there is a binary choice between jobs and the economy is persistent and was “a very strong part of the Coalition campaign”. But there were “too many moving parts” in the campaign to say that high-profile tactics like the Stop Adani convoy may have contributed to the disappointing result. O’Shanassy cites the Coalition’s negative campaign on tax, Bill Shorten’s unpopularity and Palmer injecting “millions and millions of dollars” into the campaign as other possible causes. “Outside those central Queensland seats, Australians don’t support the Adani coalmine. “So [the Stop Adani convoy in Queensland] doesn’t explain this election result – some people might want to spin it that way – but we need to look at what really happened rather than look for scapegoats.” Schneiders said the Wilderness Society will hold a review of its first national campaign in a decade but – far from the environment losing the election for Labor – it “in many respects was one of the real positives for them”. GetUp’s exit polling found climate change was the voters’ top issue in Warringah, where Tony Abbott lost to Zali Steggall, in Josh Frydenberg’s seat of Kooyong and in Menzies. Independents including Steggall and Helen Haines in Indi and the Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie in Mayo all want a better climate policy and there were swings to Labor in inner-city Melbourne. Paul Oosting, the national director of GetUp, said “the leading climate denier Tony Abbott was unseated”. “It’s clear the Coalition aren’t meeting the public’s expectations and need to change their approach or face more Warringahs.” Schneiders said it would be “unwise for the prime minister not to recognise his government is very vulnerable on the environment”. The Coalition may feel “they’ve had a happy day now – but the job just gets harder again as soon as they get sworn in”. “It’s a tactical win – the problem hasn’t gone away.” O’Shanassy said concern about climate change “goes across political lines”. During door-knocking in the electorate of Chisholm, eight out of 10 voters committed to consider the climate, including Liberal voters. So while the Liberal party retained most of its blue-ribbon seats, like Higgins and Kooyong, O’Shanassy said there is “rising concern from Liberal voters” that the party will need to take seriously – in the same way the state election drubbing in Victoria sparked a flurry of environmental policy announcements from Scott Morrison. “There’s no doubt the Morrison government needs to deal with climate and energy – and they won’t be able to continue to put it in the too-hard basket.” While the ACF and others rate the Coalition’s emissions reduction fund as poor environmental policy, part of the problem may be that one-third of the electorate still can’t say which major party has a better policy. “Climate change is complex issue and people are confused by it and where the parties stand – it’s up to the ACF to help Australians understand that better,” O’Shanassy said. O’Shanassy said the ACF will also need to “learn and adapt” and “seriously consider our strategies” but she believes rising concern about climate, particularly among the young, makes action inevitable. “We must continue to build people power – there’s no way we’re going to move politics unless people demand it.”"
"Scale it up and it’s revolution; scale it down and it’s individual non-cooperation that may be seen as nothing more than obstinacy or malingering or not seen at all. What we call protest identifies one aspect of popular power and resistance, a force so woven into history and everyday life that you miss a lot of its impact if you focus only on groups of people taking stands in public places. But people taking such stands have changed the world over and over, toppled regimes, won rights, terrified tyrants, stopped pipelines and deforestation and dams. They go far further back than the Peterloo protests and massacre 200 years ago, to the great revolutions of France and then of Haiti against France and back before that to peasant uprisings and indigenous resistance in Africa and the Americas to colonisation and enslavement and to countless acts of resistance on all scales that were never recorded. They will go far forward from this moment. And at this moment, with organisations addressing the climate crisis, reinvigorated feminism in many parts of the world, antiracist and human rights campaigns focused on specific groups and issues, protest is a force running through everything – and running against a lot of things, since this is also an age of authoritarianism and a consolidation of wealth among a global superelite.  Right now, for example, Florida’s Coalition of Immokalee Workers is forming another alliance with students to pursue rights for farmworkers by targeting nationwide US burger chain Wendy’s. They can stand as one of the great examples of the power of the supposedly powerless, which could be more fruitfully thought of as exercisers of other kinds of power than institutional, military, or financial power, the kind less seldom recognised, cultivated, studied or valued. This alliance of labour organisers and immigrant farm workers from the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico began co-ordinating human rights and workers’ rights campaigns almost two decades ago, from a base in the tomato-growing region around the town of Immokalee in Florida. It would be easy to call immigrant farm workers powerless, and indeed modern-day slavery was one of the issues they addressed. But they understood the nature of power: to get a living wage, they needed to get a few cents more per box of tomatoes, and pressuring the farmers wasn’t going to work, so they went after the buyers, the big supermarkets and fast-food chains, targeting one at a time, building coalitions, media campaigns, holding marches and other public events. And winning. They conquered Taco Bell in 2005. Then McDonald’s. Then Burger King, Whole Foods Market, and Subway by 2008, and they kept going. They fought modern-day slavery, sent the enslaving farmers to jail and established workplace standards that recently expanded to address the epidemic of sexual harassment and abuse in the fields. “Todos somos líderes” (We are all leaders) is one of their sayings, insisting that power is everywhere and everyone can exercise it as they do. The people who first and last resist slavery, then and now, are the enslaved, and the history of 18th-century England and Scotland includes lawsuits and other tactics to free individual slaves. Olaudah Equiano, who was kidnapped from his Igbo village in what is now south-eastern Nigeria and sold into slavery, purchased his own freedom and became an anti-slavery activist in England. In 1789 he published a widely read autobiography that deepened and broadened knowledge of the brutalities of slavery. Part of the danger of imagining change as a process forced by violence and brute power is that it overlooks the great power of nonviolent uprisings and those other moments when individuals become a civil society on its feet. It also ignores how the most important battle is often in the collective imagination, and it is won in part by books, ideas, songs, speeches, even new words and frameworks for old evils. The second US president, John Adams, said the American Revolution took place “in the minds and hearts of the people” before hostilities commenced. What makes something long tolerated intolerable, what makes people not directly affected care, what sways public opinion, what tips the balance, what makes politicians recognise that the dangers of not acting have come to outweigh those of acting? Another thing to remember about the great public moments, whether it’s the uprisings against the World Trade Organization in Seattle and elsewhere in 1999, or the global protest against the Iraq war in 2003, or the 2017 women’s marches in hundreds of places across the globe, is that they are not the planting but the harvest of a change in public imagination. People cared; something made them care; people were ready to act; something made them ready; people joined; someone or many someones issued the call and orchestrated the action. One metaphor that has worked for me is: the mushrooms that spring up after rain are only the fruiting body of a far larger underground fungus we do not see; the rain causes the mushrooms to rise out of the earth, but the fungus was alive and well (and invisible) beforehand; the rain can be an event. Think of Donald Trump’s immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries that caused Americans to go to airports all over the country in January 2017, or how the lack of adequate action on the climate crisis prompted Extinction Rebellion to take over key sites in London in April. And then these public actions often have consequences of their own; that the UK parliament declared a climate emergency at the beginning of last month is undoubtedly in part a response to this action, but of course the official powers – let’s call them the aboveground powers – do not like to acknowledge the underground powers, and so they generally dismiss, ignore, or demonise them. But we do not have to. In these great collective moments people showed up because they cared; when they showed up they often found a new sense of solidarity and power, which generated yet more possibilities. The seeds of a great public anti-slavery campaign in the western world were planted on 22 May 1787. That day, a group of 12 Quaker men gathered in a printing shop in London to launch a campaign that, as Adam Hochschild relates in his magnificent book Bury the Chains, would take almost 50 years to succeed, and only one of them would survive to see the end of, a campaign to end slavery throughout the British empire. Among the tactics the movement deployed, as the years passed, were a sugar boycott, the now famous engraving of how Africans were packed into the hulls of slave ships, letter writing and lobbying parliament, engaging the public in the campaign. These are now common tactics for social change. In 1807, buying and selling slaves became illegal across the empire; owning slaves became illegal by a process beginning in 1833. It was a process more considerate of slave owners than slaves, compensating the former rather than the latter, but it freed slaves and outlawed slavery. Liberation is contagious, as an idea and as a process. One of the most extraordinary chains of events of the 19th century was the response of American women active in the US abolitionist movement, who were excluded from even being seated, let alone speaking, at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, in June 1840. It prompted women already involved in trying to end slavery to begin looking at their own lack of rights, freedoms and equalities. The result was the suffrage movement, which made the antislavery movement look speedy; it took 80 years to ratify the 19th amendment to the US constitution, declaring no one would be denied the right to vote “on account of sex” (and we’re still fighting in the US for the right to vote regardless of race). It prompted suffrage movements in other countries around the world. I don’t know exactly how the black civil rights movement triggered the other racial justice movements around the US for Latinx, Asian American and Native American rights, but I know that 50 years ago the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island had a huge impact. As with the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline three years ago, the campaign went far beyond its boundaries and official goals. I described these great public actions as harvests of the seeds planted before them; the ripe crop generates more seeds. The great gathering of resistance at Standing Rock inspired Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for office, and her success and subsequent actions have been extraordinary in their dedication to tackling the climate crisis, notably with the Green New Deal. Standing Rock, I have been told, inculcated pride and hope and a sense of power, as well as bringing about new alliances and healing old conflicts, for many Native American participants. It also raised awareness of indigenous rights and land issues for a lot of non-native people. Like the long campaign against the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska in the midwest, it served as an education for people around the continent and beyond about the role of pipelines in making fossil fuel extraction profitable, the dangers and impacts and politics. There is nothing more direct than an encampment of several hundred people or a march of tens of thousands, but that does not mean the consequences will be direct, or that only the direct and measurable ones matter. Every action shifts the world’s balance, sometimes those shifts will never be noted or will have their impact long after or far away. At Peterloo, unarmed people were massacred by armed cavalry; it’s easy to portray this as a defeat, but it is said to have shifted the balance in such a way that the issue of universal male suffrage became urgent and led 13 years later to the Reform Act of 1832. This newspaper was established in the aftermath of Peterloo, to “warmly advocate the cause of Reform”, and so this publication is an unforeseen consequence of that massacre. Violence did not win, if it meant doing more than killing, dispersing and terrifying protesters; it did not kill an idea of justice and it may have hastened its advancement. At Standing Rock, hired thugs and government agents attacked protesters, often brutally, but they did not stop the beliefs, the hopes, the ideas, or the awareness. Violence can intimidate more than it can convert. “You can cut all the flowers, but you can’t stop the spring,” Pablo Neruda once wrote. That was a beautiful expression that perhaps the climate emergency has sabotaged as a literal truth. Spring this year came as devastating floods across Mozambique and the central US, as freak late snowstorms, as record heat in the Arctic, as cherry blossoms blooming early in Japan. We didn’t stop the spring, but we warped it. The future of the Earth and all living things on it now depends on whether we do enough in response to the climate crisis to limit its impact by radically transforming our energy production and consumption, our agriculture and forestry, our priorities and perceptions. This too has been led largely from underneath, by grassroots climate activists from the Philippines to Alaska, and they have accomplished astonishing things in the past dozen years, shutting down coal plants, stopping coal and natural gas terminals, pipelines, fracking (with outright bans in some US states, notably New York, and some countries, including France, Germany and Ireland). A technological revolution in wind and solar power will allow us to enter a post-fossil fuel age, but to do that means countering the great powers of the fossil fuel corporations, profiteers and the governments that serve them better than their citizens. This is a conflict that pits the young, some of whom are likely to live to see the 22nd century, against the old; it pits the poor and the people of the global south, who are feeling the impact most now, against the rich and the people of the north, who are largely responsible for the climate crisis. It has been, and will be, a conflict of the apparently powerless against the apparently powerful. We will need to remember our past victories, the powers of protest, but also of art, of transformations of imagination, of widespread non-cooperation. It is more than a conflict, though. The response to the climate crisis must be a transformation of everything from transportation systems to imaginations. Some already recognise an Earth in which everything is beautifully and terrifyingly interconnected, in which the coal we burn now, or don’t, has everything to do with the climate of the future, in which forests are the most elegant technology to sequester carbon – and in which the young now lead us. Greta Thunberg is the most famous of the new generation of climate activists, but the youth plaintiffs in the Oregon-based youth climate lawsuit and the young leaders of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion count. I name them because they are visible to me in western America, but I know that extraordinary young people are at work in every part of the world – including 25 activists, ranging in age from seven to 25, who have just won a lawsuit in Colombia to stop Amazon deforestation, and the poet Aka Niviana who has raised awareness of the accelerating ice melt across Greenland. And I know that the power they have, and we have, could be adequate to this greatest of crises if we can understand it, imagine a different world, and make it happen with the tools we have always had but not always recognised.

"Hundreds of thousands of children and young people are walking out of lessons around the world on Friday as the school strike movement continues to snowball. Climate strikes were planned in more than 1,400 cities in more than 110 countries. Organisers say the number of young people taking part is set to top the 1.4 million people who participated in the global day of strikes in March.  The global campaign – inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg – comes amid increasing concern about the unfolding climate crisis, especially among young people. Last year, the UN’s leading scientists warned that there were just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Earlier this month, another UN report warned that the widespread collapse of ecosystems was putting humanity itself at risk. And just last week it emerged that the Antarctic ice is melting much faster than previously feared and global atmospheric CO2 emissions reached a record level of 415ppm. The school strike movement started in August when Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Since then hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have taken part in strikes each week around the world from Australia to Canada, Ghana to Germany. In the UK, more than 100 school climate demonstrations have been planned and organisers say they will focus on the need for radical reform of the education system to address the ecological crisis. Noga Levy-Rapoport, of the UK Student Climate Network which helped organise the events, said climate breakdown posed “a grave threat to life on Earth”. “In order to properly address the crisis, we need our educational institutions to be hubs of sustainability that provide a space for learning and teaching to prepare today’s students to not only be those that lead a just transition, but to prepare for a changing world,” she said. Last month UK youth strikers and Thunberg met Westminster party leaders to highlight the scale and scope of the unfolding crisis. They have now written an open letter to the UK’s trade union movement asking it to get behind a transformative green new deal and support the climate strikes. In a piece in Friday’s Guardian, Thunberg and other strikers from around the world call on adults to join them in a general strike in September. Bhavreen Malhotra Kandhari, a school pupil who is due to take part in strikes in India, said: “We have learned that if we don’t start acting for our future, nobody else will make the first move. Once again our voices will be heard on the streets, but this is not just up to us.” In Australia Eloise Kieler, a school striker from Sydney, said she felt she had no choice but to walk out of lessons. “Despite watching the climate crisis unfold, despite knowing the facts, politicians don’t act, the fossil fuel industry keeps making huge profits,” she said. “This is our future: so we will walk out of school, quit our college lessons, and take to the streets to say enough is enough. Wouldn’t you go on strike too, if you thought doing so could help protect your own future?”"

"When I see a bee buzzing around my garden or in the park in early spring, I get a real thrill from being able to identify her. If she is black and darting among small, white tubular flowers with her long tongue protruding and her legs tucked under her furry, round body, I know she is a hairy-footed flower bee. A few years ago I wouldn’t have noticed her because, like most people, I thought all bees were striped. I also assumed they made honey, stung, and lived in a hive with a queen bee and her workers. But only honeybees fit this description, and they account for just a handful or so of the astonishing 25,000 bee species worldwide. Bumblebees – the plump, stripy garden visitors that have been voted the UK’s favourite insect – make up about 1%. The vast majority, like the hairy-footed flower bee, come in many different colours, don’t make honey, and live alone. These solitary bees are often named according to how they construct their nests: from plasterer bees, which line their nest with a waterproof substance, to mining bees, which excavate elaborate underground burrows, and leafcutter bees, which plug the entrance with small discs of leaves cut from rose bushes.  This month a landmark UN global assessment report warned that a million wildlife species were facing extinction, and at an unprecedented rate. Thousands of bee species will be among them. In Europe, 37% of them have experienced a recent decline in populations, and 9% face extinction; almost a quarter of those in North America are at increasing risk of becoming extinct. In other parts of the world, where data is limited, they all face similar threats from intensive farming, climate breakdown and invasive species. And their demise is potentially catastrophic for nature and humankind. A bee visiting a flower is an act of nature that has been playing out for more than 100m years. Flowering plants evolved with bees, developing rich perfumes, colourful petals and nectar to entice them to visit. As the bee moves from flower to flower, collecting nectar to fuel her flight and pollen to feed her family, she moves pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, allowing the plant to produce seeds and reproduce. The poet Kahlil Gibran beautifully described this symbiotic relationship. “To a bee a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower the bee is a messenger of love.” It makes bees a linchpin in nature and of modern agriculture. Not only do they pollinate trees, whose oxygen we breathe, and which mitigate the climate crisis, they also pollinate the flora that feed other insects, birds and mammals in the food chain and one in three mouthfuls that we eat. Bees boost the yield of 90 commercially produced crops. These include most fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and spices that we eat, as well as coffee, and fodder for livestock. The annual contribution of pollination services to the global economy has been estimated at $577bn (£453bn).  But there is a contradiction at the heart of our farming system. In the last five decades there has been a threefold increase in the volume of production of those 90 bee-dependent crops. This has turned farms into industrial food producers. As a result, wild-flower meadows that provided food and nesting sites for solitary bees and bumblebees have been wiped out. Europe’s largest bumblebee, the endangered Bombus fragrans, is just one example of a species seriously threatened by intensive farming, which is destroying its native habitat on the steppes of Ukraine and Russia.  Without food and habitat to sustain wild pollinators, modern farming has become reliant on trucking in managed honeybee hives when crops are in bloom, and flying in factory-bred bumblebees to pollinate tomatoes and other crops grown in greenhouses. This can spread lethal parasites and disease to wild bees, including the giant golden bumblebee of Patagonia, which is now threatened with extinction. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been linked to bee deaths, and a successful campaign to ban these toxic chemicals was orchestrated across Europe, leading to the EU introducing a total ban on the outdoor use of the most common ones last year.  But that alone won’t save bees. Now we need a similar campaign to ban herbicides and bring back wild flowers and wild bees. Research shows that the greater the diversity of bees attracted to a field of crops by the presence of wild flowers, the better pollinated those crops will be. In some trials, harvests doubled or even tripled, because solitary bees can pollinate some flowering plants 100 times more effectively than honeybees.  Yet subsidies over the past 70 years have encouraged farmers to use chemicals and fertilisers that destroy ecosystems and degrade the soil, and bring in managed honeybees where wild bees once flourished. We urgently need to bring nature back into the way we produce food. As taxpayers, voters and consumers, we can help make that change. The German state of Bavaria is leading the way. The state’s governor, Markus Söder, announced recently that a “save the bees” petition signed by 1.75 million people would be passed into law. The petition demanded 20% of farming land to be made bee-friendly within six years and 30% by 2030, to reverse the decline in flora and fauna. And Söder made it clear that farmers would be financially supported to carry out the transformation. In the UK, a farm that used to receive substantial subsidies to produce crops using conventional practices now uses £250,000 of taxpayers’ money to allow nature to do the work. A decade on, 62 species of bee have been recorded on the Knepp estate in West Sussex, including rare species such as the red bartsia bee, which feeds on the wild flower after which it is named. What if we demanded all farms were financially encouraged to rewild pockets of their land, and we ate only food that was grown using bee-friendly methods? Cities are also crucial to the future of bees. Not only can we make our gardens and roof terraces bee-friendly, we can lobby councils to make green spaces better for bees, and for all buildings to have bee-friendly roofs, which would also mitigate against flooding and improve air quality. Cities are also where people will learn to recognise and value bees. Monday is UN World Bee Day. If we all took a moment to stop and look at the small insect buzzing in our garden or park – as well as it being good for our wellbeing to reconnect with nature as an antidote to the stresses of city life – it might just help us to understand the bigger picture: that by saving bees, we are saving ourselves. • Alison Benjamin is a Guardian editor and co-author of The Good Bee: A Celebration of Bees and How to Save Them"
"One of the Liberals’ leading conservatives and Australia’s 28th prime minister, Tony Abbott, has lost his blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Warringah after moderate Liberal voters abandoned him in protest at the role he played in opposing climate change action. Abbott lost to the independent candidate and Olympian Zali Steggall, with thecount showing she was likely to win almost 60% of the vote on a two-party-preferred basis. But Abbott’s loss appeared to be the only black spot on a night when it appeared the Coalition would hold on to government. “I want to say to you: there is good news and bad news. There is every chance that the Liberal-National Coalition has won the election,” Abbott said in his concession speech, to chants of “Tony, Tony!” “This – this is a really extraordinary result. It is a stupendous result. It is a great result for Scott Morrison and the rest of the wider Liberal team, and Scott Morrison will now, quite rightly, enter the Liberal pantheon forever,” he said. “So its disappointing for us in Warringah. I can’t say it doesn’t hurt to lose. But I would rather be a loser than a quitter,” he said to wild applause. He said the Liberals had become the party who believed that “the most important thing is to raise people up.” “I think we can see that there is something of a realignment of politics going on right around this country. It’s clear that in what might be described as ‘working seats’, we are doing so much better. “It’s also clear that in at least some of what might be described as ‘wealthy seats’, we are doing it tough, and the green-left is doing better,” he said. Abbott said he had feared the worst after the result in the Wentworth byelection last year. Backed by a number of local community groups, Steggall was drafted as a candidate to advocate for more action on the climate crisis. She had run on a platform that was almost entirely focused on taking meaningful action to counter it, including adopting much tougher targets than the Coalition has embraced – a message that resonated with the middle-class voters of Warringah. Her support was especially strong in Mosman and Manly. The loss of one the most outspoken members of the conservative wing would normally send deep shockwaves through the Liberal party, but given the other results on Saturday night it seems less certain that Abbott’s defeat will prompt internal debate about the party’s positioning on the climate crisis. The survival of Peter Dutton in the seat of Dickson will also boost the conservative wing of the party. Abbott said the result showed that where climate change was a “moral issue, we do it tough. But where it’s an economic issue, we do very, very well.” Steggall’s campaign was supported by a number of grassroots groups which had formed out of disillusion with the Liberal party’s policy on the climate emergency. In her acceptance speech she paid tribute to Abbott as “a dedicated and long-serving local member”. “Nobody can doubt his community spirit, his work ethic, and his contribution to this community. And I wish him well.” But she said Warringah had “voted for the future”. “This is a win for moderates with a heart,” she said. “I will be a climate leader for you. And I will keep the new government to account, and make sure we take action on climate change. The Warringah result is certain to be analysed in terms of what a grassroots campaign can do against a seemingly invulnerable politician. Several high-profile former Liberal members from Mosman were behind the push to find a candidate to run against Abbott and the vote shows they were successful in their strategy to get family and friends to persuade other Liberal-leaning voters to lodge a protest vote. There is also likely to be a heated discussion, particularly from the News Corp publications, about the role of left-leaning and progressive organisations in the political process, with conservatives warning that progressive groups represent a threat to democracy because of their deep pockets. The seat was a hot spot for activism by GetUp, which door-knocked more than 20,000 households in the north shore and northern beaches seat, and Stop Adani, which was also active. Abbott had held Warringah for 25 years, having won it 1994 in a byelection. The former journalist and political adviser to John Howard became a public figure as the director of Australians for a Constitional Monarchy in 1992, a position he held until he ran for the seat. As an MP Abbott rose quickly in the Howard government and was appointed minister for employment services in 1998 after Howard won a second term. He later became minister for health, where he sought to prosecute a conservative agenda, including seeking to ban the abortion drug RU486, a move Howard ultimately did not embrace. After Howard lost in 2007, Abbott served in the shadow cabinets of Brendan Nelson and Malcolm Turnbull but he resigned from the frontbench in November 2009 in protest against Turnbull’s support for the Rudd government’s proposed emissions trading scheme. That set the stage for a decade-long battle within the Liberal party over climate . Abbott once branded the science of climate change “crap” and led the opposition internally to wipe out subsidies for renewables and any policy that attempted to put a price on carbon. After forcing a leadership ballot on the subject in 2009, Abbott defeated Turnbull by 42 votes to 41, to become the party’s leader and leader of the opposition. He led the Coalition at the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament but Labor, led by Julia Gillard, formed government, with the support of one Greens MP and three independents. Regarded as fearsome campaigner, Abbott was re-elected as Liberal leader unopposed. He went on to lead the Coalition to victory in the 2013 election. But just two years later, on 14 September 2015, Abbott was defeated as Liberal party leader 54 votes to 44 by Malcolm Turnbull, who replaced him as prime minister the following day. Abbott was widely seen as a driving force behind the destabilisation of Turnbull’s leadership and the thwarting of the national energy guarantee, Turnbull’s policy to tackle global heating. In 2018 Turnbull was in turn challenged and replaced by Scott Morrison. Abbott appeared to leave open the door for a possible comeback, saying his public life was not over."
"Bob Hawke was the environmental prime minister of Australia. His legacy includes Landcare and the listing of the Queensland’s Daintree wet tropics, Shark Bay in Western Australia, Uluru-Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory, the Gondwana rainforests of the New South Wales-Queensland border region and large extensions to both the Northern Territory’s Kakadu and the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage areas. The latter was in contention in 1989 after the “Whispering Bulldozer”, the Tasmanian Liberal premier Robin Gray, lost office to Labor’s Michael Field and myself, leading the five Greens holding the balance of power. We Greens negotiated the expansion of the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area by more than 600,000 hectares to include such iconic wilderness as the Walls of Jerusalem, Central Plateau, Denison River Valley. At the end, Field had had enough and called a press conference to announce the outcome. I did not go. Instead, I was on the phone to Hawke’s office arguing that the eastern end of Macquarie Harbour – some 40,000 hectares – should also be included. Hawke agreed so that most magnificent part of the harbour, including Kellys Basin, the mouth of the Gordon River and the convict ruins on Sarah Island, is, these days, a natural delight free of otherwise inevitable industrial fish farming, for hundreds of thousands of people catching cruises out of Strahan. After taking over leadership of the Labor party before the election in 1983, Hawke committed to saving the Franklin River. The Wilderness Society’s peaceful blockade of Gray’s dam works threatening the river had seen thousands of people come to Strahan and more than 500 go to Risdon jail. In Melbourne, at a rally of 15,000 people, Hazel Hawke famously put on “No Dams” earrings and Bob made an ironclad commitment to stop the dam. On election night, 5 March, he made just one specific commitment: the dam would not go ahead but those affected would be duly compensated. He carried through on both promises. One US outdoors company recently put the Franklin at the top of the world’s 10 most desirable whitewater rafting adventures. Had Hawke and Labor not won that election the river would now, instead, be a series of dead impoundments. Hawke’s next masterstroke for the environment was to replace Barry Cohen, his first minister for the environment, with Graham Richardson. Never before or since has such a powerful figure on Australia’s political landscape held this portfolio. There could not be a greater contrast with the present minister, who has been absent from the 2019 election campaign. Richardson told environmentalists that if he was going to take action he needed to “hear the crowd roar”. So the late 1980s and early 1990s were perhaps the greatest period of public involvement and environmental advance in Australia. This was not without contention. Richardson faced a jeering anti-environmental mob at Ravenshoe in northern Queensland on the way to the Hawke government having the rainforests given world heritage status and protection. In Tasmania, Richardson, working with Hawke’s office, made repeated visits to back that 1989 extension of the Tasmania wilderness world heritage area against mounting opposition from loggers and miners and the state government. They stopped the polluting Wesley Vale pulp mill project after a huge campaign led by a farmers’ daughter, Christine Milne. Of course, Hawke did not please us all the time. He backed uranium mining and flirted with Ronald Reagan’s proposal to test MX missiles over the Pacific Ocean. He backed off on a treaty with Australia’s First Nations when the proposal came under fire from the Western Australia Labor premier Brian Burke. A Hawke masterstroke was to accept the proposal of the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Phillip Toyne and the National Farmers’ Federation’s Rick Farley to set up Landcare. This became a beacon of global interest in government-funded repair of rural lands and rivers. That Landcare and general environment spending has been gutted in recent years highlights the loss of vision in Canberra since the great environmental innovation era Hawke ushered in. Key to Hawke’s environmental success was his listening ear. He knew the Australian public was keen on protecting nature and he made himself open to direct liaison with environmental leaders. He was a tough negotiator but he and his staff opened an ear to the environment, which has been finally closed altogether by the Morrison government. Richardson was the first environment minister to alert cabinet to the onrush of climate change. Decades later, at the 25th anniversary of the saving of the Franklin in Hobart in 2008, Hawke lambasted the Coalition’s lack of concern for the heating planet: And as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The conservatives: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can’t do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost economic growth. You can’t do it, you mustn’t do it. Hawke did it and, were he prime minster in 2019, I reckon the very unpopular Adani coalmine proposal would be headed for the bin. With Paul Keating in the fray, Hawke joined the French government in leading the world – against Bush administration misgivings – to formulating the Madrid protocol which protects Antarctica from mining industrialisation. Perhaps Thursday night’s Southern Aurora, visible across southern Tasmania, was nature’s accolade for the life of a natural champion."

"Today marks the official launch of Covering Climate Now, a project co-sponsored by The Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation. Joined by The Guardian and others partners to be announced, Covering Climate Now will bring journalists and news outlets together to dramatically improve how the media as a whole covers the climate crisis and its solutions.  The following is an abridged version of the conference keynote speech by iconic TV newsman Bill Moyers, as prepared for delivery. A video version of the speech is available here. See here for more about the Covering Climate Now project.  * I have been asked to bring this gathering to a close by summing up how we can do better at covering the possible “collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world,” to quote the noted environmentalist David Attenborough, speaking at the recent United Nations climate summit in Poland.I don’t come with a silver bullet. And I’m no expert on the topic. Like you, I am just a journalist whose craft calls for us to explain things we don’t understand. There’s so much I don’t understand that journalism became my continuing course in adult education. The subjects were so fascinating, and the work so fulfilling, that I kept at it “full speed ahead” for half a century, until two years ago, at the age of 83, I yielded finally to the side effects of a long life and retired (more or less). This is the first opportunity I have had since then to be with so many kindred spirits of journalism, and the camaraderie reminds me how much I have missed your company.Many of us have recognized that our coverage of global warming has fallen short. There’s been some excellent reporting by independent journalists and by enterprising reporters and photographers from legacy newspapers and other news outlets. But the Goliaths of the US news media, those with the biggest amplifiers—the corporate broadcast networks—have been shamelessly AWOL, despite their extraordinary profits. The combined coverage of climate change by the three major networks and Fox fell from just 260 minutes in 2017 to a mere 142 minutes in 2018—a drop of 45%, reported the watchdog group Media Matters.Meanwhile, about 1,300 communities across the United States have totally lost news coverage, many from newspaper mergers and closures, according to the University of North Carolina School of Media and Journalism. Hundreds of others are still standing only as “ghost newspapers.” They no longer have resources for even local reporting, much less for climate change. “Online news sites, as well as some TV newsrooms, are working hard to keep local reporting alive, but these are taking root far more slowly than newspapers are dying,” observes Tom Stites of Poynter in a report about the study. And, alas, many of the news outlets that are still around have ignored or misreported the climate story and failed to counter the tsunami of deceptive propaganda unleashed by fossil-fuel companies and the mercenaries, ideologues, and politicians who do their bidding.But events educate, experience instructs, and so much destructive behavior has been caused by climate disruption that more Americans today than ever seem hungry to know what’s causing it, what’s coming and what can be done about it. We journalists have perhaps our last chance to help people grasp the magnitude of the threat. My friend and journalist-turned-citizen-activist Bill McKibben told me last week that because of the looming possibility of extinction, and in response to it from the emerging leadership among young people, we have reached a ‘climate moment’ with real momentum, and our challenge as we go forward is to dramatically change the zeitgeist—“to lock in and consolidate public opinion that’s finally beginning to come into focus.”So, while I did not come with a silver bullet—there’s no such thing—I do want to share a couple of stories that might help us respond to this daunting task.I’ll begin with how I first heard of global warming—before many of you in this room were born. It was 54 years ago, early in 1965, at the White House. Before I became President Lyndon Johnson’s press secretary (“over my dead body,” I might add,) I was his special assistant coordinating domestic policy. One day, two members of the president’s science-advisory committee came by the office. One of them was the famous oceanographer, Roger Revelle. Famous because only a few years earlier he had shaken up the prevailing consensus that the oceans were massive enough to soak up any amount of excess of carbon released on earth. Not so, Revelle discovered; the peculiar chemistry of sea water actually prevents this from happening.Now, he said, humans have begun a “vast geophysical experiment.” We were about to burn, within a few generations, the fossil fuels that had slowly accumulated in the earth over the past 500 million years. Burning so much oil, gas, and coal would release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where it would trap heat that otherwise would escape into space. Earth’s temperature could rise, causing polar ice to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the earth’s coastal regions.President Johnson took scientists seriously; as vice president, he had been chosen by President Kennedy to chair the intergovernmental committee overseeing NASA’s charge to put a man on the moon. So Revelle and his colleagues got the green light, and by the fall of 1965 they produced the first official report to any government anywhere on the possible threat to humanity from rising CO2 levels. On November 6, Lyndon Johnson became the first president to mention the threat in a message to Congress.President Johnson urged us to circulate the report widely throughout the government and to the public, despite its controversial emphasis on the need for “economic incentives” to discourage pollution, including—shudder!—taxes levied against polluters. (You can go online to Restoring the Quality of Our Environment—1965 and read the entire 23-page section, headlined Appendix Y4—Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide.)This was in 1965! Nearly six decades ago! The future in plain sight.But we failed the moment. One year later, largely preoccupied with the war in Vietnam, the president grew distracted, budgets for other priorities were squeezed, and the nation was fast polarizing. We flunked that first chance to confront global warming. Our failure to act—and the failure of administrations that followed us—metastasized into the crisis of today, the crisis journalists must figure out how to cover as if life on earth depends on it, which it does.Which brings me to the second story I hope will be helpful in confronting this daunting challenge.It’s about the Murrow Boys: Edward R. Murrow and the young men, none of them yet famous, Murrow hired to staff CBS Radio in Europe on the eve of the Second World War.I was a kid of about six in Marshall, Texas, when my parents bought a used console radio so they could listen to Franklin Roosevelt’s speeches and I could follow the Saturday serials—especially “The Green Hornet,” my favorite masked vigilante. That’s how we discovered the Murrow Boys, by listening to the news every evening on CBS. Although I didn’t yet know what to make of the events being reported, I showed up faithfully to sit on the floor between my parents in their chairs, all of us listening together.I can still hear the voices coming from that stained brown console in the corner of our living room; still see the pictures their words painted in my mind’s eye. Their names, hardly known when they started, became hallowed in the annals of journalism. Murrow of course, Eric Sevareid, William L Shirer, Larry LeSeuer, Charles Collingwood, Howard K Smith, William Randall Downs, Richard C. Hottelet, Winston Burdett, Cecil Brown, Thomas Grandin, and the one woman among them, Mary Marvin Breckinridge. You can read about them in The Murrow Boys: Pioneers on the Front Lines of Broadcast Journalism, a superb book by Stanley Cloud and Lynne Olson.These reporters spread across Europe as the “phony war” of 1939–40 played out, much like the slow-motion catastrophe of global warming plays out in our time. They saw the threat posed by the Nazis, and they struggled to get the attention of an American public back home exhausted and drained by the Great Depression.In September of 1939, with Europe hours away from going up in flames, the powers at CBS in New York ordered Murrow and Shirer to feature an entertainment broadcast spotlighting dance music from nightspots in London, Paris, and Hamburg. Here’s the account from Cloud and Olson: “‘They say there’s so much bad news out of Europe, they want some good news,’ Murrow [in London] snapped to Shirer [in Berlin] over the phone. The show, scheduled to be broadcast just as Germany was about to rape Poland, would be called ‘Europe Dances’ … Finally, Murrow decreed, ‘The hell with those bastards in New York. It may cost us our jobs, but we’re just not going to do it’.” And they didn’t. They defied the bosses—and gave CBS one of the biggest stories of the 20th century, the invasion of Poland.And still the powers in New York resisted. Through the rest of 1939 and into the spring of 1940, Hitler hunched on the borders of France and the Low Countries, his Panzers idling, poised to strike. Shirer fumed, “My God! Here was the old continent on the brink of war…and the network was most reluctant to provide five minutes a day from here to report it.” Just as the networks and cable channels provide practically no coverage today of global warming.In time I would meet Ed Murrow and follow him as senior correspondent for the documentary series he created after the war with Fred Friendly. Eric Sevareid became a mentor, before and after I succeeded him as commentator on The CBS Evening News. Howard K. Smith and I frequently corresponded and traded books. And I had casual conversations with Charles Collingwood at the little French café he frequented near our office on West 57th street. These men rarely talked details of the past. But I will never forget my debt as a journalist to their work, or what they did for our country.Never in my own long career have I been as tested as they were. Or as you will be. Our own global warming “phony war” is over. The hot war is here.My colleague and co-writer, Glenn Scherer, compares global disruption to a repeat hit-and-run driver: anonymous, deadly, and requiring tireless investigation to identify the perpetrator. There are long stretches of nothing, then suddenly Houston is inundated and Paradise burns. San Juan blows away and salt water creeps into the subways of New York. The networks put their reporters out in raincoats or standing behind police barriers as flames consume far hills. Yet we rarely hear the words “global warming” or “climate disruption” in their reports. The big backstory of rising CO2 levels, escalating drought, collateral damage, cause and effect, and politicians on the take from fossil-fuel companies? Forget all that. Not good for ratings, say network executives.But last October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientifically conservative body, gave us 12 years to make massive changes to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions 45 percent below 2010 levels and to net zero by 2050. On his indispensable site, TomDispatch.com, Tom Engelhardt writes that humanity is now on a suicide watch.Soon, some of you will be traveling to the ends of the earth to report on this Great Disruption. To Indonesia, where oil-palm growers and commodities companies are stripping away forests vital to carbon storage. To the Amazon, where President Bolsonaro’s government plans to open indigenous reserves to industrial exploitation, threatening the lungs of the Earth. To India, where President Modi pretends to be an environmentalist even as he embraces destructive development. To China, where President Xi’s Belt and Road initiative, the biggest transportation-infrastructure program in the history of the world, threatens disaster for earth systems. You will go to the Arctic and the Antarctic to report on melting ice, and to the shores of African cities, Pacific atolls, and poor Miami neighborhoods being swallowed by rising oceans. And to Nebraska, and Iowa, and Kansas, and Missouri, where this spring’s crop is despair as farmers and their families grieve their losses.And some of you will go to Washington, to report on the madness—yes, I said madness—of a US government that scorns reality as fake news, denies the truths of nature, and embraces a theocratic theology that welcomes catastrophe as a sign of the returning Messiah.Madness! Superstition! Destruction and death.Can we get this story right? Can we tell it whole? Can we connect the dots and inspire people with the possibility of change?What’s journalism for? Really, in the war, what was journalism for, except to awaken the world to the catastrophe looming ahead of it? Here’s the good news: While describing David Wallace-Wells’s stunning new book The Uninhabitable Earth as a remorseless, near-unbearable account of what we are doing to our planet, The New York Times reports it also offers hope. Wallace-Wells says that “We have all the tools we need…to aggressively phase out dirty energy…”; [cut] global emissions…[and] scrub carbon from the atmosphere…. [There are] ‘obvious’ and ‘available,’ [if costly,] solutions.”What we need, he adds, is the “acceptance of responsibility.”Our responsibility as journalists is to tell the story so people get it. I wish I could go there with you to tell it. This is a very exciting time for journalism, despite our beleaguered newsrooms, our diminished ranks, and the power arrayed against truth. And I really do think this project – Covering Climate Now – could be the beginning of our redemption.Over my long life I’ve seen things change quickly. After the Birmingham bombing. After Selma. Vietnam. Nixon and Watergate. The Berlin Wall. The pendulum can swing suddenly. The public can change its mind.Which brings us back to the Murrow Boys. Late 1940. The start of the Blitz, with bombs blasting London to bits. A Gallup poll that September found that a mere 16% of Americans supported sending US aid to beleaguered Britain. Olson and Cloud tell us that, “One month later, as bombs fell on London, and Murrow and the Boys brought the reality of it into American living rooms, 52% thought more aid should be sent.”Americans had taken one step toward defeating fascism, and the Murrow Boys helped us take it. Of course, the journalists were only part of the cast, and I don’t want to overrate their importance. But they were there. On the right side. At the right time. In the right way—reporting on the biggest story of all, the fight for freedom. For life itself.Reporting the truth is always the basis for any moral authority we can claim as journalists. Reporting the truth about climate disruption, and its solutions, could be contagious. Our gathering today could be a turning point for American journalism.With no silver bullet, what do we do? We cooperate as kindred spirits on a mission of public service. We create partnerships to share resources. We challenge media owners and investors to act in the public interest. We keep the whole picture in our heads—how melting ice sheets in the Arctic can create devastation in the Midwest—and connect the dots for our readers, viewers, and listeners. We look every day at photographs of our children and grandchildren, to be reminded of the stakes. And we tell the liars, deniers, and do-nothings to shove off: There’s no future in naysaying.As some of you know, I am president of the Schumann Media Center, a small nonprofit devoted to the support of independent journalism. The Center is the progeny of the Florence and John Schumann Foundation, founded in Montclair, NJ, in l961 by a civic-minded couple whose offspring were brought up with a strong commitment to democratic values. Their support of my journalism on public television led us to join forces, which is how I became president of the foundation and now of the center. The family resolved to give away their wealth in their lifetime, and we are just about there; our resources are modest now, and we’re almost done.One of our last major gifts will be a million dollars to launch the Covering Climate Now project of The Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation and to get the project through the first year. Other foundations and individual philanthropists will then have to step up to the challenge, and I believe they will.This has been a good day of talking and thinking—now must come action. My colleagues at the Schumann Media Center wish all of you and all of those you represent—in newspapers, radio stations, local news, and major corporations—we wish all of you, because it will take all of you, every success. Bill Moyers is a broadcast journalist. He has earned 37 Emmys, nine Peabodys, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television. He is president of the Schumann Media Center Bill Moyers is grateful to the veteran environmental journalist Glenn Scherer for the research and ideas he contributed to this speech.

Study by Diodato and Bellocchi show that Little Ice Age was not restricted to North Atlantic region (Painting by Hendrick Barentsz)
The climate of the last 10,000 years has been everything except stable, and global mean temperatures fluctuated by more than 1°C. Today’s “Modern Warm Period” was preceded by the Little Ice Age (LIA), which lasted from 1300 to 1850.
The high point of the Little Ice Age occurred during a period of weak solar activity from 1645-1715, called the Maunder Minimum. During this time, Central Europe turned bitter cold, glaciers grew and the Thames River even froze over in the wintertime. During the cold winter of 1683/1684, the ground froze more than a meter deep in Southern England.
The Little Ice Age is widely known for the North Atlantic region of Northern Europe, and for this reason some scientists falsely assumed that it had been a regional phenomenon and it was balanced out by other areas on the planet being warmer. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed as a growing body of scientific literature shows that all continents were hit by the LIA.

In the Mediterranean region there have been no reliable temperature reconstructions from during this period. The existing tree-ring temperature reconstructions for the last 500 years have been regarded as riddled with problems as tree rings in some cases in the Alps and upper northern latitudes are turning out to be an unsuitable method for climate reconstructions.
An Italian team of scientists led by Nazzareno Diodato and Gianni Bellocchi of the Met European Research Observatory has analyzed historical climate records from the Mediterranean region of Italy to see how temperatures developed in southern Europe during the Little Ice Age. In their study they reconstructed the temperatures for the winter months December-February . The Moio and Susanna Manuscript as well as the Corradi-Annals made up the core of their study. The chronicles of Giovanni Battista Moio and Gregorio Susanna contained a list of extreme weather events and famine in the region of Calabria. The Corradi-Annals consist of a collection of reports on climate extremes and their impacts on the environment from 5 AD to 1850. In addition the researchers used other data sources such as a catalogue of the Italian Agency for New technologies on environmental events. Indices were calculated based on historical information and were converted into temperatures.
In their study, the Italian scientists discovered that the winters in the Mediterranean area of study were several degrees colder than what had been earlier assumed by coarser simulations for Europe. The scientists were able to show that the known cold phase of the Maunder Minimums was also prevalent in the Mediterranean region.
Extreme cold with snow occurred in 16 of 25 winters between 1675 and 1700. Especially the years 1665, 1677, 1684, 1687 and 1692 temperatures fell sharply and rivers on the Italian peninsula froze. From 1682 to 1707 a number of flooding catastrophes occurred in Northern Italy. Extremely cold winters struck between 1684 and 1694 and an especially cold winter in 1709. The Venetian Lagoon froze over in 1684 and 1709. The lowest temperature was measured in 1684. In Sicily a series of catastrophic harvests hit in the 1690s. For the cold of the 1683/1684 winter, a statistical period of repetition of 1000 years was calculated.
The study’s authors say that the cold at the peak of the Little Ice Age was mainly due to the low solar activity of the Maunder Minimum. However they do point out that there was large regional variability for climate development during this phase of solar inactivity in the Mediterranean region due to below average atmospheric air pressure. An important atmospheric element during this period was a high pressure zone over Northern Europe while low pressure dominated the Central Mediterranean region. This resulted in protracted weather blocking in the winter and associated cold snaps striking Central and Southern Europe.
The study impressively shows that the Little Ice Age was much more than an event restricted to the North Atlantic region. The Holocene.

Renewable energy boom leaves Germans in the dark.
It’s one way of reducing carbon emissions – just catapult your population back to the Stone Age. Online German flagship daily Die Welt has an article on how skyrocketing electricity prices are making electricity unaffordable for a large number of Germans.
Many people in Germany are no longer able to pay their electricity bills. And energy prices continue to climb – rapidly. The president of the VdK social association Ulrike Masche, accuses the German federal government “of having neglected the social dimension of the energy transformation”.
Over 10 years ago Germany enacted the Renewable Energy Feed-In Act (EEG) which requires power companies to pay small producers of renewable energy exorbitant rates for their green power. The power companies in turn simply pass the higher prices on to their customers. Electricity prices rose 10% in 2011 alone!
So far Germany has committed over 100 billion euros to renewable energy, all to be paid for by the consumer. Little wonder that today almost a seventh of Germany’s population is now living in “energy poverty”.
The high costs are hitting the poor and retirees especially hard. Die Welt writes:
Klaus Müller, Chairman of the Consumer Office in North Rhine Westphalia estimates: ‘Ten to fifteen percent of the population are struggling to finance the constantly rising energy costs.” Every year 600,000 households are getting their power cut off.’

‘Earlier energy poverty was a fringe problem. However in the meantime it has become an every day problem,’ said Müller.
According to a survey by the consumer protection group, 600,000 households per year are getting their power cut off because of unpaid electricity bills. Foremost the rapid expansion of renewable energies has led to a 10% rise in electricity prices.”
As utilities are forced to buy the exorbitantly expensive renewable energy, even when they don’t need it, they are forced to increase the prices they charge consumers.
Die Welt writes that the prices are expected to rise unabated and that they likely will even accelerate. The feed-in tariffs will add up to 5.2 cents to the price of each kilowatt-hour.
The greens, the architects of the energy feed-in act, deny they are responsible for the disaster, and blame Germany’s current conservative, liberal-democrat coalition government for the skyrocketing prices. The truth is that all the politicians zealously supported the feed-in tariffs, especially the conservative CDU led by Angela Merkel, who was duped and spurred on by crackpot scientists in Potsdam.
Some leading politicians are beginning to return to their senses, however, and are calling for more coal and gas power plants.
Well, they’d better hurry up. Otherwise expect the pubs and beerhalls to come alive with angry political talk – and soon.
Happy May Day everybody!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA sudden blast of cold polar air accompanied by heavy precipitation led to heavy snowfall in the Alps at levels below 1600 meters. Read here (in German).

Snow falls in August under 1600 meters elevation in southern Germany.
Up to 35 cm of snow fell at some locations. Wetter.24 reports:
Low pressure system “Christine” delivered heavy rains in southern Germany and even the first snow in the Alps. Some passes in the Alps had to be closed. After steady snowfall, several Swiss Alp passes had to be closed for traffic on Friday evening. Streets around the Gotthard range were hit especially hard by the snowfall.”
Imagine the surprise of German vacationers returning from Italy over the Alps and being told to turn back because of snow in the summertime! Wetter.24 continues:
The snow line dropped from the northwest and then a cold polar air mass was fed down to the Alps region (see Figure 3).

Snow line at times at 1600 meters. On Friday it was already snowing at 2000 meters and during the past night the snow line dropped to 1600 meters, and even less at some localities, thus many peaks are now covered with a blanket of snow.
A total of 21 cm of snow fell on Säntis from Friday morning to Saturday morning. On the Zugspitze 45 cm was reported, of which 35 cm fell during the last 24 hours. The rest fell during the night of Thursday to Friday (see Fig. 4). In the figure it can be seen that especially the north side is hit by the first snowfall. It is however not unusual that winter shows up for the first time in the Alps at the end of August.”
Oh, now I get it: snowfalls and skiing are “rare and a thing of the past” only in the dead of winter. But snows in August, on the other hand, are completely normal?
Gee, climate science is making more and more sense with every passing day.
Finally, I was just sent the following chart depicting Germany’s summertime temperatures for the last 16 years.

Runaway warming? Looks like it ran away for good 10 years ago – and it’s not coming back. (Chart from Josef Kowatsch).

"When my daughter was two years old, I found myself struggling to finish any article relating to the dire state of our environment. I would get halfway through the piece, then disengage and move on to something else. I assumed I wasn’t the only parent to feel this way. Curious to understand why I seemed incapable of persisting, I reached out to the environmental psychologist Renee Lertzman. She explained that when we receive information charged with fear, dread or anxiety, the limbic system in our brain can be activated, which can override the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with creative thinking and problem solving. These days our news feeds are filled with images and stories of a bleak future. This is what we bombard our consciousness with, the images we expose our children to and they may also be why many of us feel paralysed when it comes to taking action on solutions to save our planet. The diagnosis and acceptance of our problems is crucial but – much like when visiting a doctor –along with wanting a clear, detailed diagnosis, we also want to know what we can do to improve or even cure our condition. This is what I wanted to offer up to my now five-year-old daughter. A story that focuses on the solutions to our environmental dilemmas and reveals a different version of the future. Because as the neurologist Viktor Frankl explained in his Auschwitz memoir, Man’s Search for Meaning, if hope or faith in a better future becomes absent, the human spirit rapidly deteriorates. Over the last three years I’ve been making a film called 2040. It’s a visual letter to my daughter showing her what the world could look like that year if we put into practice some of the best solutions that exist today. I call it an exercise in “fact-based dreaming”, as everything I show her in the future has to already exist today. In three years of research and interviews, what emerged were solutions that improve health, income inequality, security and communities with the bonus of drastically reducing emissions and regenerating ecosystems. These solutions include decentralised solar micro-grids in remote villages that allow the buying and selling of energy between homes and keep money in the local economy. They include regenerative agriculture practices which takes carbon from the atmosphere and returns it to the soil with the cascading benefits of water retention and nutrient-dense food. And also the turbocharged sequestering power of seaweed, which can grow up to half a metre a day while restoring marine habitats and providing communities with food, fibre, fertilisers and biofuels. But perhaps the most poignant solution I came across was the wide-reaching impact the education and empowerment of girls and women would have. It is clear we have everything we need right now to create a better 2040. In this solution-based approach, I had to be careful to avoid a Pollyanna offering. The realities of intensified weather events by 2040, blocks to progress by vested interests, lack of leadership, trade treaties that favour profit over environment and our addiction to endless growth all had to be navigated. But, although these are extremely important issues, they are not the provinces of the story I wanted to tell. This is a film highlighting what we can fight for rather than fight against. Determination and passion are the most important renewable energy resources we have. People working together with a common goal will shift vested interests and make implementing the solutions possible. A friend rang me on the morning the UN released its global assessment report which found that 1 million species now face extinction due to our activities. His 12-year-old son was in tears at the breakfast table, asking what could be done – and my friend wanted to know what to say to him. My first response was to tell his son that it is OK to feel very upset and important to express those feelings – perhaps not enough of us do. But it was also important to let him know that there are millions, likely billions, of people who care deeply about his future and are becoming galvanised to invent, share and implement the solutions to this crisis. They are the “hope in the dark” that Rebecca Solnit writes about in her book of the same title. The flurry of inspirational activity that is taking place right now in the shadows, largely unreported. The world is facing its shadow in a variety of ways – and we can remind ourselves, and our children, that a shadow cannot exist without a source of light always being present. The Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan described the way we move forward in society as being like driving a motor car using only the rearview mirror. We use our past experiences to inform us. It is here that we can also find legitimate hope for future generations. Just decades before the abolitionists achieved their goal, they were labelled “utopian” and mocked for imagining the economy could survive without slaves. The suffragettes were repeatedly derided for taking to the streets: “Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote,” said the former US president Grover Cleveland. It is hard not to look at the inspirational Greta Thunberg and all the student climate strikers today, plus the impacts of Extinction Rebellion in the UK, and not feel that we’re in the middle of another historical moment. I made this film for my daughter and for her generation. I made it for parents and for anyone feeling overwhelmed or losing hope. It offers up a reframing of our ecological predicament as an opportunity to draw on our ingenuity and to rise to the challenge with creativity and empathy. It is a call to all to share our visions and dreams of a better world. If we don’t, we are likely to become a part of someone else’s vision. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost of you may have seen this already, but it is always good as a reminder. Friedman schooling the hopeless ideologue Phil Donahue.

If you want to know where the masses are worse off, it is exactly in the kinds of societies where they depart from that. The record of history is absolutely crystal clear that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system.”
He comments futher on Donahue’s naiveness:
You know I think you’re taking a lot of things for granted. And just tell me where in the world do you find these angels who are going to organize society for us? I don’t even trust you to do that.”
Brilliant.

There are plenty of gullible Donahues and drones out there who think Boy Wonder Obama, with all his candy-coated utopian promises, can organize society for us, along with the EPA, or the WBGU, or the European Commission, or the UN, or…
Four years later, 6 trillion dollars more debt and 9 million unemployed people more should tell you everything you need to know. “The record of history is absolutely crystal clear.”
That’s why you must go out and vote.
PS: And here’s Friedman on socialized medicine:

Little wonder that the US lawmakers made themselves exempt from the very system they now are planning to impose on the rest of the country.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the Arctic set a record sea ice minimum back in August, the European mainstream media and government funded climate institutes howled in a deafening, days-long chorus of “global” climate Armageddon.

In late September, Antarctic sea ice hit an all-time high, reaching the highest level since modern data-recording began. Chart source: National Snow and Ice Data Center.
Now fast forward one month to late September 2012 with the sea ice peaking at the opposite end of the planet, i.e. Antarctica. Knowing that the media has grown particularly sensitive to weather extremes, you’d think this current weather extreme around Antarctica would have set off a similar reaction. Any extreme, we are told, is proof of global warming.
All that extra ice beyond the 70°S latitude will reflect the sun’s precious heat back out into space, thus cooling the water even further, which means more ice will eventually develop, and thus there’s a real risk of reaching a dangerous and irreversible tipping point into unstoppable warming-induced cooling.
So why haven’t the media reacted? Well, there’s a limit to just how far the public and politicians, as gullible as they are, can be fooled. The media know where that line is: in Antarctica. When a cold, bitter and snowy winter strikes, only absolute morons actually believe that it is induced by global warming, and the media know that there are enough of them making up their readership. But when it comes to believing that global warming causes 19.5 million sq km of ice to form around Antarctica, even the media do not expect its dimwit readers to believe that. So they are keeping completely deaf and dumb about it. Informed readers, after all, are the last thing they want.

So not a peep of this has been mentioned anywhere in the German mainstream media.
If we google “Rekordeis” and limit the search to the last 7 days, we get thousands of reports of the Arctic melting, although it’s old news, but no reports of Antarctic sea ice setting a new all-time maximum.
Except for stories at German skeptic blogs EIKE and Science Skeptical, there’s nothing about this extraordinary event occurring at the South Pole in the major media outlets like German public television and radio, Spiegel, Bild, and at the major dailies. Also the main German climate institutes like the PIK, AWI and MPI are completely silent about it. They have no way of explaining this one.
So what can we conclude from this? The media saying absolutely nothing about this says a lot!
This is one genie they are not going to be able to keep bottled up.
ANTARCTIC SEA ICE HITS ALLTIME RECORD HIGH!
Get used to it.

"It was February 2000 and the Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen was sitting in a meeting room in Cuernavaca, Mexico, stewing quietly. Five years earlier, Crutzen and two colleagues had been awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for proving that the ozone layer, which shields the planet from ultraviolet light, was thinning at the poles because of rising concentrations of industrial gas. Now he was attending a meeting of scientists who studied the planet’s oceans, land surfaces and atmosphere. As the scientists presented their findings, most of which described dramatic planetary changes, Crutzen shifted in his seat. “You could see he was getting agitated. He wasn’t happy,” Will Steffen, a chemist who organised the meeting, told me recently. What finally tipped Crutzen over the edge was a presentation by a group of scientists that focused on the Holocene, the geological epoch that began around 11,700 years ago and continues to the present day. After Crutzen heard the word Holocene for the umpteenth time, he lost it. “He stopped everybody and said: ‘Stop saying the Holocene! We’re not in the Holocene any more,’” Steffen recalled. But then Crutzen stalled. The outburst had not been premeditated, but now all eyes were on him. So he blurted out a name for a new epoch. A combination of anthropos, the Greek for “human”, and “-cene”, the suffix used in names of geological epochs, “Anthropocene” at least sounded academic. Steffen made a note.  A few months after the meeting, Crutzen and an American biologist, Eugene Stoermer, expanded on the idea in an article on the “Anthropocene”. We were entering an entirely new phase of planetary history, they argued, in which human beings had become the driving force. And without a major catastrophe, such as an asteroid impact or nuclear war, humankind would remain a major geological force for many millennia. The article appeared on page 17 of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme’s newsletter. At this point it did not seem likely the term would ever travel beyond the abstruse literature produced by institutions preoccupied with things like the nitrogen cycle. But the concept took flight. Environmental scientists latched on to what they saw as a useful catch-all term for the changes to the natural world – retreating sea ice, accelerating species extinction, bleached coral reefs – that they were already attributing to human activity. Academic articles began to appear with “Anthropocene” in the title, followed by entire journals dedicated to the topic. Soon the idea jumped to the humanities, then newspapers and magazines, and then to the arts, becoming a subject of photography, poetry, opera and a song by Nick Cave. “The proliferation of this concept can mainly be traced back to the fact that, under the guise of scientific neutrality, it conveys a message of almost unparalleled moral-political urgency,” wrote the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. There was just one place where the Anthropocene seemed not to be catching on: among the geologists who actually define these terms. Geologists are the guardians of the Earth’s timeline. By studying the Earth’s crust, they have carved up the planet’s 4.6bn years of history into phases and placed them in chronological order on a timescale called the International Chronostratigraphic Chart. That timescale is the backbone of geology. Modifying it is a slow and tortuous process, overseen by an official body, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). You can’t just make up a new epoch and give it a convincing name; the care taken over the timescale’s construction is precisely what gives it authority. To many geologists, accustomed to working with rocks that are hundreds of millions of years old, the notion that a species that has been around for the blink of an eye was now a genuine geological force seemed absurd. Few would deny we are in a period of climatic turmoil, but many feel that, compared with some of the truly apocalyptic events of the deep past – such as the period, 252m years ago, when temperatures rose 10C and 96% of marine species died – the change so far has not been especially severe. “Many geologists would say: it’s just a blip,” Philip Gibbard, the secretary-general of the ICS, told me. But as the idea of the Anthropocene spread, it became harder for geologists to ignore. At a meeting of the Geological Society of London, in 2006, a stratigrapher named Jan Zalasiewicz argued that it was time to look at the concept seriously. Stratigraphy is the branch of geology that studies rock layers, or strata, and it is stratigraphers who work on the timescale directly. To Zalasiewicz’s surprise, his colleagues agreed. In 2008, Gibbard asked if Zalasiewicz would be prepared to assemble and lead a team of experts to investigate the matter more deeply. If the group found evidence that the Anthropocene was “stratigraphically real”, they would need to submit a proposal to the ICS. If the proposal was approved, the result would be literally epoch-changing. A new chapter of Earth’s history would need to be written. With a mounting sense of apprehension, Zalasiewicz agreed to take on the task. He knew the undertaking would not only be difficult but divisive, risking the ire of colleagues who felt that all the chatter around the Anthropocene had more to do with politics and media hype than actual science. “All the things the Anthropocene implies that are beyond geology, particularly the social-political stuff, is new terrain for many geologists,” Zalasiewicz told me. “To have this word used by climate commissions and environmental organisations is unfamiliar and may feel dangerous.” What’s more, he had no funding, which meant he would have to find dozens of experts for the working group who would be willing to help him for free. Having spent much of his career absorbed in the classification of 400m-year-old fossils called graptolites, Zalasiewicz did not consider himself a natural people manager. “I found myself landed in this position,” he said. “My reaction was: goodness me, where do we go from here?” Working out the age of the planet has always been a fraught business. The Bible stated that God created everything in six days, but it wasn’t until the 17th century that scholars made a concerted effort to work out precisely when that week might have been. For some time, the estimate of one scholar, an Irish archbishop named James Ussher, held sway: the world began on 23 October 4004 BC. Then, in the late 18th century, a different theory emerged, one based on the close observation of the natural world. By studying the near-imperceptibly slow process of the weathering and forming of rocks, thinkers such as the Scottish landowner James Hutton argued that the Earth must be far, far older than previously thought. The invention of geology would go on to transform our sense of our place in existence, a revolution in self-perception similar to the discovery that the Earth is not at the centre of the universe. Human beings were suddenly an astonishingly recent phenomenon, a “parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity”, as James Joyce once wrote. During the almost inconceivable expanse of pre-human time, successive worlds had risen and collapsed. Each world had its own peculiar history, which was written in rock and waiting to be discovered. In the early 19th century, geologists began naming and organising different rock formations in a bid to impose some order on the endless discoveries they were making. They used clues within the rock layers, such as fossils, minerals, texture and colour, to tell when formations in different locations dated to the same time period. For instance, if two bands of limestone contained the same type of fossilised mollusc, alongside a certain quartz, it was likely they had been laid down at the same point in time, even if they were discovered miles apart. Geologists called the spans of time that the rock formations represented “units”. On the timescale today, units vary in size, from eons, which last for billions of years, to ages, which last for mere thousands. Units nestle inside each other, like Russian dolls. Officially, we live in the Meghalayan age (which began 4,200 years ago) of the Holocene epoch. The Holocene falls in the Quaternary period (2.6m years ago) of the Cenozoic era (66m) in the Phanerozoic eon (541m). Certain units attract more fanfare than others. Most people recognise the Jurassic. As geologists began dividing deep time into units, they came up against the difficult question of boundaries – defining precisely where one phase of history transitions into the next. In the late 19th century, it was recognised that if the field was to advance, global cooperation and coordination would be necessary. The International Commission on Nomenclature, the forerunner of the present-day ICS, was established during a congress in Bologna in 1881 with the mandate of creating an international language of geology, one that was to be enshrined in the timescale. The task of interpreting and classifying 4.6bn years of Earth history continues today. Geologists have barely begun to describe the Precambrian eon, which spans Earth’s first 4bn years. Meanwhile, well-studied units are revised as new evidence unsettles old assumptions. In 2004, the Quaternary period was unceremoniously jettisoned and the preceding period, the Neogene, extended to cover its 1.8m years. The move came as a surprise to many Quaternary geologists, who mounted an aggressive campaign to redeem their period. Eventually, in 2009, the ICS brought the Quaternary back and moved its boundary down by 800,000 years to the beginning of an ice age, a point considered more geologically significant. Having now “lost” millions of years, Neogene scientists were incandescent. “You might ask: who wasn’t upset by it?” Gibbard told me. Modifying the geological timescale is a bit like trying to pass a constitutional amendment, with rounds of proposal and scrutiny overseen by the ICS. “We have to be relatively conservative,” said Gibbard, “because anything we do is going to have a longer-term implication in terms of the science and literature.” First, a working group drafts a proposal which is submitted to an expert subcommission for review and vote. From the subcommission, the proposal advances to the voting members of the ICS (composed of the chairs of the subcommissions, plus the chair, vice-chair and general-secretary of the ICS). Once the ICS has voted in its favour, it passes to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), geology’s highest body, to be ratified. Whether or not a new proposal successfully passes through all these rounds comes down to the quality of evidence that the working group can amass, as well as the individual predilections of the 50-or-so seasoned geologists who constitute the senior committees. This did not bode well for Zalasiewicz as he began to put together the Anthropocene working group. In fundamental ways, the idea of the Anthropocene is unlike anything geologists have considered before. The planet’s timekeepers have built their timescale from the physical records laid down in rocks long ago. Without due time to form, the “rocks” of the Anthropocene were little more than “two centimetres of unconsolidated organic matter”, as one geologist put it to me. “If we think about the Anthropocene in purely geological terms – and that’s the trouble, because we’re looking at it with that perspective – it’s an instant,” said Gibbard. Zalasiewicz grew up in the foothills of the Pennines in a house that contained his parents, sister and a growing collection of rocks. When he was 12, his sister brought home a nestful of starlings, which his mother, who loved animals, nursed to health. Soon neighbours started calling round with all manner of injured birds, and for several years Zalasiewicz shared his bedroom with a little owl and a kestrel. (Kestrels, he came to know, are “rather thick creatures”.) He started volunteering at the local museum in Ludlow in the summer, where he met people who were expert in the things he cared most about, such as where to find trilobites. By his mid-teens, he told me, “geology was it”. Now 64, Zalasiewicz is small and slight, with silver hair that sticks out like a scarecrow’s. He has worked in Leicester University’s geology department for 20 years, and presents himself as a quintessential geologist, a wearer of leather elbow patches and lover of graptolites. Yet among geologists, he is a known provocateur. His reputation stems from one of his papers, published in 2004, in which he argued that stratigraphy should throw out some of the terminology that has been in use since the discipline’s earliest days in favour of more modern terms. It was, to some, an audacious suggestion. When I emailed David Fastovsky, the former editor of the journal Geology, who had published the paper 15 years ago, he remembered it well. “The general feeling at the time,” he wrote, “was that it might be possible, but who would dare to take the first shot?” Over the years, Zalasiewicz has indulged in thought experiments that are, among geologists, peculiar. In 1998, he wrote an article for New Scientist in which he imagined what mark humans might leave on the Earth long after we are extinct. His ideas became a book, published 10 years later, called The Earth After Us. Geologists tend to have their minds trained on the deep past, and Zalasiewicz’s forward-thinking approach marked him out. When, in 2006, Zalasiewicz broached the subject of the Anthropocene at the Geological Society meeting, Gibbard recalled thinking: “Well, these two go together very well.” After he was appointed chair of the Anthropocene working group, Zalasiewicz needed to assemble his team. “At the time, it was simply a hypothetical and interesting question: can this thing be for real geologically?” Zalasiewicz told me when I visited him in Leicester last year. “It was arm-waving with very little specific detail. The diagrams were back-of-the-beer-mat things.” Stratigraphic working groups are, not surprisingly, usually composed of stratigraphers. But Zalasiewicz took a different approach. Alongside traditional geologists, he brought in Earth systems scientists, who study planet-wide processes such as the carbon cycle, as well as an archeologist and an environmental historian. Soon the group numbered 35. It was international in character, if overwhelmingly male and white, and included experts with specialisms in paleoecology, radiocarbon isotopes and the law of the sea. If the Anthropocene was, in fact, already upon us, the group would need to prove that the Holocene – an unusually stable epoch in which temperature, sea level and carbon dioxide levels have stayed relatively constant for nearly 12 millenia – had come to an end. They began by looking at the atmosphere. During the Holocene, the amount of CO2 in the air, measured in parts per million (ppm), was between 260 and 280. Data from 2005, the most recent year recorded when the working group started out, showed levels had climbed to 379 ppm. Since then, it has risen to 405 ppm. The group calculated that the last time there was this much CO2 in the air was during the Pliocene epoch 3m years ago. (Because the burning of fossil fuels in pursuit of the accumulation of capital in the west has been the predominant source of these emissions, some suggest “Capitalocene” is the more appropriate name.) Next they looked at what had happened to animals and plants. Past shifts in geological time have often been accompanied by mass extinctions, as species struggle to adapt to new environments. In 2011, research by Anthony Barnosky, a member of the group, suggested something similar was underway once again. Others investigated the ways humans have scrambled the biosphere, removing species from their natural habitat and releasing them into new ones. As humans have multiplied, we have also made the natural world more homogenous. The world’s most common vertebrate, the broiler chicken, of which there are 23bn alive at any one time, was created by humans to be eaten by humans. Then there was also the matter of all our stuff. Not only have humans modified the Earth’s surface by building mines, roads, towns and cities, we have created increasingly sophisticated materials and tools, from smartphones to ballpoint pens, fragments of which will become buried in sediment, forming part of the rocks of the future. One estimate puts the weight of everything humans have ever built and manufactured at 30tn tonnes. The working group argued that the remnants of our stuff, which they called “technofossils”, will survive in the rock record for millions of years, distinguishing our time from what came before. By 2016, most of the group was persuaded that what they were seeing amounted to more than a simple fluctuation. “All these changes are either complete novelties or they are just off the scale when it comes to anything Holocene,” Zalasiewicz told me. That year, 24 working group members co-authored an article, published in the journal Science, announcing that the Anthropocene was “functionally and stratigraphically distinct” from the Holocene. But the details were far from settled. The group needed to agree a start-date for the Anthropocene, yet there was nothing as clean as a colossal volcanic eruption or an asteroid strike to mark the point where it began. “From a geological point of view, that makes life very difficult,” said Gibbard, who is also a member of the working group. The group was split into opposed camps, largely according to their academic specialisation. Initially, when he first proposed the notion of the Anthropocene, Paul Crutzen, who is an atmospheric chemist, had suggested the industrial revolution as the start-date because that was when concentrations of CO2 and methane began accumulating significantly in the air. Lately the Earth system scientists had come to prefer the start of the so-called “great acceleration”, the years following the second world war when the collective actions of humans suddenly began to put much more strain on the natural world than ever before. Most stratigraphers were now siding with them – they believe that the activity of the 1950s will leave a sharper indentation on the geological record. This concerned the archaeologists, who felt that privileging a 1950 start-date dismissed the thousands of years of human impact that they study, from our early use of fire to the emergence of agriculture. “There is a feeling among the archaeologists that because the word ‘anthropo’ is in there, their science should be central,” one geologist complained to me privately. Agreeing the start-date, Gibbard warned, could be the Anthropocene’s “stumbling block”. At the tail end of last summer, members of the working group boarded flights to Frankfurt and then took a 45-minute train west, to Mainz. Over two days, they gathered at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry for the group’s annual meeting. Crutzen, now in his mid-80s, spent much of his career at the institute, and he was present both as a spectator and in the form of a bronze bust in the foyer. I asked him what he made of the progress of his idea. “It started with a few people and then it exploded,” he said. Under the glow of a projector in a darkened classroom, two dozen researchers shared their latest findings on topics such as organic isotope geochemistry and peat deposits. Things proceeded without a wrinkle until the second day, when a debate broke out about the start date, which then turned into a debate about whether it was OK for different intellectual communities to use the term “Anthropocene” to mean different things. Someone at the back suggested adding the word “epoch” for the strictly geological definition, so “Anthropocene” by itself could be used generally. “It’s just a personal view, but I think it would be confusing to have the same term having different meanings,” said a stratigrapher. “I don’t think it would be that confusing,” an environmental scientist countered. In the front row, Zalasiewicz watched with the air of an adjudicator. Eventually, he chimed in. “Certainly, in terms of our remit, we can only work from the geological term. We can’t police the word ‘Anthropocene’ beyond that,” he said. Throughout the meeting, Zalasiewicz seemed at pains to emphasise the Anthropocene’s geological legitimacy. He was aware that a number of influential geologists had taken against the idea, and he was worried about what might happen if the working group was seen to be straying too far from the discipline’s norms. One of the loudest critics of the Anthropocene is Stanley Finney, who as the secretary-general of the IUGS, the body that ratifies changes to the timescale, is perhaps the most powerful stratigrapher in the world. During the meeting in Mainz, I was told that Finney was both a “big phallus of the discipline” and “really vehemently anti-Anthropocene”. Zalasiewicz told me that Finney was an accomplished geologist, but one of a different temperament. “He sees me as someone who tries to bring in these crazy ideas by the backdoor,” he said. “I guess if you’re a geologist who spends your time in the past where you have these enormous vistas of time – the human-free zone, if you like – then to have something as fast, busy, crowded, as science-fiction-like, come into the steady, formalised, bureaucratised array of geological time, I can see it as something you might naturally take against.” When Finney first came across the term “Anthropocene”, in a paper written by Zalasiewicz in 2008, he thought little of it. To him, it just seemed like a big fuss over the human junk on the surface of the planet. Finney, who is 71 and a professor of geological sciences at California State University, Long Beach, has spent much of his career trying to picture what the planet was like 450m years ago, during the Ordovician period, when the continents were bunched together in the southern hemisphere and plants first colonised land. Over the years, he has worked his way up through stratigraphy’s hierarchy. By the time Zalasiewicz was appointed chair of the working group, Finney was chair of the ICS. The two scientists knew each other professionally. Zalasiewicz’s favourite fossils, graptolites, are found in Ordovician strata. But for some time the pair had not seen eye to eye. When Zalasiewicz published his 2004 paper arguing that stratigraphers should cast off their long-established terminology, Finney was affronted by this lack of respect for the discipline’s traditions. In an attempt to find a middle ground, the pair worked on a “compromise paper”. As the writing got underway, things turned sour. Finney began to feel that Zalasiewicz was not treating his suggested revisions seriously. “He would take my comments and he would make tiny little changes but still keep the whole thing,” Finney told me. “When I saw the final draft that was ready to be accepted [by a journal], I said: ‘Take my name off, I’m not happy with this. Just take my name off.’” From then on, their relations assumed a cool distance. Finney only decided to look at the Anthropocene in detail after he began getting comments from people who thought it was now an official part of the geological timescale. The more he looked, the less he liked the idea. “You can make the ‘big global changes’ issue out of it if you want, but as geologists we work with rocks, you know?” he told me. To Finney, a negligible amount of “stratigraphic content” has amassed since the 1950s. Geologists are used to working with strata several inches deep, and Finney thought it was excessively speculative to presume that humans’ impact will one day be legible in rock. As the Anthropocene working group gained momentum, he grew concerned that the ICS was being pressured into issuing a statement that at its heart had little to do with advancing stratigraphy, and more to do with politics. Academics both inside and outside geology have noted the Anthropocene’s political implications. In After Nature, the law professor Jedediah Purdy writes that using the term “Anthropocene” to describe a wide array of human-caused geological and ecological change is “an effort to meld them into a single situation, gathered under a single name”. To Purdy, the Anthropocene is an attempt to do what the concept of “the environment” did in the 1960s and 70s. It is pragmatic, a way to name the problem – and thus begin the process of solving it. Yet if a term becomes too broad, its meaning can become unhelpfully vague. “There is an impulse to want to put things in capital letters, in formal definitions, just to make them look like they’re nicely organised so you can put them on a shelf and they’ll behave,” said Bill Ruddiman, professor emeritus at the University of Virginia. A seasoned geologist, Ruddiman has written papers arguing against the stratigraphic definition of the Anthropocene on the grounds that any single start-date would be meaningless since humans have been gradually shaping the planet for at least 50,000 years. “What the working group is trying to say is everything pre-1950 is pre-Anthropocene, and that’s just absurd,” he told me. Ruddiman’s arguments have found wide support, even from a handful of members of the working group. Gibbard told me he had started out “agnostic” about the Anthropocene but lately he had decided it was too soon to tell whether or not it really was a new epoch. “As geologists, we’re used to looking backwards,” he said. “Things that we’re living through at the moment – we don’t know how significant they are. [The Anthropocene] appears significant but it would be far easier if we were 200 to 300, possibly 2,000 to 3,000, years in the future and then we could look back and say: yes, that was the right thing to do.” Yet for the majority of the working group, the stratigraphic evidence for the Anthropocene is compelling. “We realise the Anthropocene goes against the grain of geology in one sense, and other kinds of science, archaeology and anthropology, in another sense,” Zalasiewicz told me. “We try and deal honestly with their arguments. If they were to put out something that we couldn’t jump over, then we’d hold up our hands and say: OK, that’s a killer blow for the Anthropocene. But we haven’t seen one yet.” The day after the Mainz conference came to a close, a small number of working group members met at the central station and took a train to Frankfurt airport. As the train left the city it crossed the Rhine, a wide river the colour of tepid tea. Buildings became sparse, giving way to flat fields crossed by pylons and wires. For all the years of discussion, research and debate, after the meeting it was obvious that the Anthropocene working group was still a long way off submitting its proposal to the ICS. Zalasiewicz’s favourite joke, that geologists “work in geological time”, was starting to wear thin. Proposals to amend the timescale require evidence in the form of cores of sediment that have been extracted from the ground. Within the core there must be a clear sign of major environmental change marked by a chemical or biological trace in the strata, which acts as the physical evidence of where one unit stops and another begins. (This marker is often called the “golden spike” after the ceremonial gold spike that was used to join two railway tracks when they met in the middle of the US in 1869, forming the transcontinental railroad.) The core extraction and analysis process takes years and costs hundreds of thousands of pounds – money that, at that point, and despite grant applications, the group did not have. They discussed the problem on the train. “Beg, borrow and steal. That is the working group motto,” Zalasiewicz said, a little bitterly. But in the months that followed the meeting, their fortunes changed. First, they received €800,000 in funding from an unexpected source, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, a state-funded cultural institute in Berlin that has been holding exhibitions about the Anthropocene for several years. The money would finally allow the group to begin the core-extraction work, moving the proposal beyond theoretical discussion and into a more hands-on, evidence-gathering stage. Then, in late April, the group decided to hold a vote that would settle, once and for all, the matter of the start-date. Working group members had one month to cast their votes; a supermajority of at least 60% would be needed for the vote to be binding. The results, announced on 21 May, were unequivocal. Twenty-nine members of the group, representing 88%, voted for the start of the Anthropocene to be in the mid-20th century. For Zalasiewicz, it was a step forward. “What we’ll do now is the technical work. We’ve now moved beyond the general, almost existential question of ‘is the Anthropocene geological?’” he said, when I called him. The important votes at the ICS were still to come, but he felt optimistic. In Mainz, after the train pulled into the airport, the group made for the departure zone. Among the chaos of wheelie suitcases and people hurrying about, suddenly a voice cried out: “Fossils!” Zalasiewicz was off to one side, eyes fixed on the polished limestone floor. “That’s a fossil, these are fossil shells,” he said, pointing to what looked like dark scratches. One was the shape of a horseshoe, and another looked like a wishbone. Zalasiewicz identified them as rudists, a type of mollusc that had thrived during the Cretaceous, the last period of the dinosaurs. Rudists were a hardy species, the main reef-builders of their time. One rudist reef ran the length of the North American coast from Mexico to Canada. Staring at the rudists encased in limestone slabs that had been dug out of the ground and transported many miles across land, it was strange to think of the unlikeliness of their arrival in the airport floor. The rudists beneath our feet had died out 66m years ago, in the same mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. Scientists generally believe that the impact of an asteroid in Yucatan, Mexico, plunged the planet into a new phase of climatic instability in which many species perished. Geologists can see the moment of the impact in rocks as a thin layer of iridium, a metal that occurs in very low concentrations on Earth and was likely expelled by the asteroid and dispersed across the world in a cloud of pulverised rock that blotted out the sun. To stratigraphers, the iridium forms the “golden spike” between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. Now that the working group has decided roughly when the Anthropocene began, their main task is picking the golden spike of our time. They are keeping their options open, assessing candidates from microplastics and heavy metals to fly ash. Even so, a favourite has emerged. From the pragmatic stratigraphic perspective, no marker is as distinct, or more globally synchronous, than the radioactive fallout from the use of nuclear weapons that began with the US army’s Trinity test in 1945. Since the early 1950s, this memento of humankind’s darkest self-destructive impulses has settled on the Earth’s surface like icing sugar on a sponge cake. Plotted on a graph, the radioactive fallout leaps up like an explosion. Zalasiewicz has taken to calling it the “bomb spike”. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 30 May 2019.

Floods in the region in 2009 and 2015 – the latter the result of Storm Desmond – grabbed the headlines at the time, but are increasingly being linked to evidence of the UK’s vulnerability to the climate emergency. The new analysis shows that the most recent floods were unprecedented in key respects. In 2015, more than 50,000 homes in Cumbria were flooded or had severe impacts from flooding. While the loss of life was relatively small, the damage to local people is still being felt in many areas. Similarly, floods in 2009 left thousands of people displaced from their homes, which took years to be resolved. Richard Chiverrell, a professor of physical geography at the University of Liverpool, and the lead scientist conducting the research, said: “The convergence of information suggests a link with a warmer world and recent extreme flooding is likely.” He said factors such as the way land is managed and changing farming practices were likely to have only a small effect, compared with the overriding force of changing weather. He added: “The unprecedented nature of the recent phase of extreme floods accords with statements from the Environment Agency that climate changes and associated impacts on the frequency and magnitude of extreme events are one of the greatest challenges facing our society.” This is believed to be the first time such an analysis has been used to gauge recent flooding against historic norms in the UK, and the same technique could be used elsewhere to form a wider picture of flooding in Britain in recent years. The researchers studied Bassenthwaite Lake in Cumbria, where each flooding event leaves a distinct layer of sediment at the bottom. Flooding leaves much coarser sediment than normal deposits, because it washes in large amounts of material from the surrounding hills and streams. That left researchers with a much easier task in sorting out which layers came from particular events. In their paper, published in the journal Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, the team of researchers led by the universities of Liverpool and Southampton compared the evidence of lake sediment from the floods of 2009 and 2015 with the 558-year record from the sediment at the bottom of the Bassenthwaite lake. David Sear, a professor at the University of Southampton, said: “For the first time, we have been able to take sedimentary records from lake beds and convert them into the kind of data used by flood risk managers. These are the events that cause most damage and cost to society, so improving our ability to estimate their chance of occurring is important.”"
"A quarter of the UK’s land could be restored to nature, making a significant contribution towards cutting the nation’s carbon emissions to zero, under a new rewilding proposal. The plan, published by Rewilding Britain, calls for billions of pounds in farm subsidies to be redirected towards creating native woodlands and meadows and protecting peat bogs and salt marshes. The group says wildlife would benefit, farmers would not lose money and food production need not fall. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is in favour of natural solutions to the climate crisis and huge losses of wildlife, and the government has pledged it will ensure “public money is spent on public goods” after the UK leaves the EU’s subsidy regime. Currently these subsidies total £3bn a year, with 13% going to environmental schemes. The new plan anticipates £1.9bn being used to support action on global heating and wildlife. The scheme would create 2m hectares (4.94m acres) of new woodland and 2m hectares of species-rich meadows, and ensure full protection of the UK’s 2m hectares of peat bogs and heaths. These ecosystems would absorb and store carbon dioxide equivalent to 10% of the UK’s annual emissions. The government’s official climate advisers reported this month that UK emissions must fall to zero by 2050. But the Committee on Climate Change said some activities, such as flying, would still cause emissions, meaning tree growing and other measures to suck CO2 from the air are vital. Rebecca Wrigley, the chief executive of Rewilding Britain, said 85,000 people had already signed a parliamentary petition backing natural solutions to the climate emergency, with support strongest in rural areas. She said being paid to plant woodlands and meadows or protect peat bogs could be important fresh sources of income for farmers. “Farmers will certainly not be worse off – it is about diversifying and providing alternatives,” she said. “No one is going to be required to do anything on their land that they do not choose to do.” The proposals would revive wildlife in the UK, one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. “The beauty of rewilding is that it could also benefit biodiversity,” Wrigley said. “People have forgotten what native habitats [such as forests] really look like, and how abundant they once were.” Wrigley said rewilding such a large proportion of the UK did not have to involve an overall reduction in food production. She pointed to examples such as the Knepp estate in Sussex and to millions of hectares of low-grade agricultural land, much of it in the uplands. There are 1.8m hectares of deer stalking estates and 1.3m hectares of grouse moor estates, the report notes. The report suggests rates of subsidy based on how many tonnes of CO2 are captured, multiplied by an indicative carbon price of £40 per tonne (about double the UK’s current price). This would make new woodlands the most valuable at £512 per hectare per year. Enhancing and restoring peat bogs, heaths and salt marshes would all earn about £300 per hectare per year. These rates are lower than current EU subsidies for planting winter food for seed-eating birds (£640) and a nectar flower mix for pollinators (£524). Rewilding Britain said more ambitious and expensive schemes for restoring habitats could be paid for with a nationwide carbon tax on emissions. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges we face today.” He said tackling the climate crisis was one of the “public goods” for which farmers would be rewarded in the future, and was also a key part of a long-term vision for a more productive, low-carbon farming sector. The National Farmers Union wants agriculture to reach net zero emissions by 2040. Guy Smith, the NFU’s deputy president, said this month: “Acting to tackle damaging climate change is vital. However, we will not halt climate change by curbing British production and exporting it to countries which may not have the same environmental conscience.” Wrigley said ministers were moving in the right direction but current schemes were far too small in scale. “The UK parliament has declared a climate emergency, [so] the response has to be decisive and rapid,” she said."
"Even without missiles being test-fired into the sky by a hostile regime 35 miles to the north, airline executives might be a little tense next weekend. More than 1,000 of them will gather in the South Korean capital, Seoul, for the big event in the industry’s calendar, the International Air Transport Association’s general meeting.  Many Iata members have a degree of protection from turbulence thanks to deep pockets, airline alliances, sheer size, or national loyalty. But the big issues to be discussed in Seoul may still keep some jet-lagged executives awake at night.  Globally, the industry is still turning a profit. It is on course for a 10th straight year of positive returns, after racking up losses in the financial crisis. Jet fuel is still far cheaper than the $120-plus per barrel airlines had to pay until 2013 but, bar a sharp plunge in late 2018, the price is heading upwards. European carriers in particular are looking shaky, with a combined loss in early 2019 ten times worse than last year’s first quarter – although the collapse of smaller airlines may allow survivors to increase fares. Behind the low yield from passengers is another statistic that might spook the industry: a tailing-off in demand for air freight. If the Trump trade war escalates, storm clouds could appear. More than once this decade, Iata has proudly reported the safest year on record for aviation. Drilling down into the statistics to separate out old turboprops from international commercial flights, the organisation has spoken of “zero western-built passenger jet hull losses”. These modern planes, conventional wisdom had it, did not fall out of the skies. Now the two Boeing 737 Max crashes, with 346 fatalities, have shaken that complacency. The repercussions for an industry that has ordered hundreds more 737 Max aircraft, expecting to retire its older planes and fly further and cheaper, are not clear. Some fear passengers will refuse to fly on 737 Max planes if and when regulatory approval is restored, with a breakdown in trust in the whole process of certification. Back in the days when Britain was a key part of Europe, even international airlines were clamouring for access to Heathrow: tearing down the opposition to a third runway became a key objective. With that one in the bag, the discussion has largely moved on from airports – although Mexico’s decision to scrap plans for a new international hub at the capital has provoked some airline consternation. The new “infrastructure” issue is airspace: airlines see the highways in the skies, in Europe in particular, getting clogged, and the traffic lights malfunctioning due to a lack of staff and strike-happy controllers. Plans for an efficient, pan-European traffic control system, which could both straighten flight paths to save fuel and dampen the impact of local industrial action, have stagnated. As growing protests declare a climate emergency, and other sectors clean up their act, transport looks ever more the problem. And within the sector, aviation has yet to identify even the potential solutions that land-based transport can envisage. “Only a highly [greenhouse gas] emitting volatile fuel has the weight-to-power density that allows you to fly,” says aviation consultant Andrew Charlton. Airlines have clung to a “sustainable roadmap” that looks an ever weaker response to the climate emergency, largely reliant on carbon offsetting. The main plank of that, the Corsia scheme agreed in 2018 via the UN, whereby international airlines will voluntarily report and offset emissions above current levels, has started but not been secured. And, says Charlton, “what seemed like a clever idea is now … looking a pretty relaxed timetable. The airlines think it’s a fantastic win, so you can guess from that it’s not very demanding.” A technological breakthrough will be sorely needed for aviation to continue as is. But schemes to produce clean fuels or electric planes for the mass market are, at best, in their infancy. An eyecatching conference highlight is the presentation of Iata’s diversity and inclusion awards – sponsored by Qatar Airways. Rather than a satirical attempt to rival Henry Kissinger’s Nobel peace prize, insiders stress that this is a serious attempt at redemption after Qatar’s colourful chief executive, Akbar al-Baker, last year stole conference headlines by insisting that only a man could do his job. Only two women, including Flybe’s Christine Ourmières-Widener, sit on the Iata governing board of 31 – but even that figure is better than the ratio of female chief executives, or even pilots, at major airlines."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following video makes it clear why Peter Elliott Shumlin is one of the dumbest, if not the dumbest, governors in America. That’s a pretty tough accomplishment with states like Oregon, California and Maryland in the field.

Video of what the wind industry is doing to my home state. Sheffield and Lowell Mountain are only a few miles from my hometown. Climate activists in Vermont, once big proponents of wind, are now shocked and aghast. Video source: http://vermontenergyoptions.org/
Shumlin thinks that reducing Vermont’s fossil energy consumption (which is not even measurable on a global scale) by a couple of percentage points will lead to a gentle climate for his state and prevent flooding there (2:25). Watch the video! I don’t know if he’s a swindler, or a complete moron.
So radical Shumlin is when it comes to protecting the climate with windmills that he has become an environmental Jim Jones who is ready to lead the state to commit mass environmental suicide.
And like the followers of Jim Jones, many Vermonters believed, and they all lined up behind the Jim Jones Shumlin’s wind energy movement – cheering on the army of wind turbine builders that would soon invade the state and disfigure it permanently – thinking it would bring them salvation. Today they are shocked and horrified. They now realise the punch is spiked with death.
The video above interviews an entire series of opponents, many are kooky environmentalists, some openly admitting they had been duped by the windpower pipe-dream (e.g. see 7:45 mark). They were all conned by Al Gore’s AIT film. They were all suckered by the “consensus” science that never was. They were manipulated by the media and politicians. And in a state of panic, they all thought something had to be done quickly.

Although many have since woken up to the true horror of the wind energy punch brewed by Shumlin, most are still convinced of man-made climate change. This is because they have been too lazy (or too damn stupid) to actually take a look at the hard data of historical climate.
How can people get so nutty? That’s the question that we often ask about Nazi Germany, isn’t it? It has to do with group-think reaching a certain tipping point. Eventually madness loses its brakes and turns into a runaway train that can’t be stopped. That’s what happened in Vermont.
Let’s recall that Vermont gave Obama something like 68% of the vote in 2008 (the greatest of all 50 states). So when that level of political onesidedness (cluelessness) grips a state, it’s little wonder that really dumb things like Shumlin can happen. The state lost its brakes. The state didn’t used to be that way. Things started to get especially bad after I left 30+ years ago.
Today the tiny state of Vermont is busy permanently altering and industrialising 200 miles of mountain ridgelines with 500-foot wind turbines – thinking this will rescue the planet. This, if allowed to continue, will turn the state into an environmental catastrophe of Soviet dimensions. What will Vermonters gain from it all the sacrifice? A theoretical cooling of the global climate by 0.0000000000041°C over the next 100 years. They’ll still have to buy flood insurance.
Fortunately, it is not only in Vermont that people are sobering up from their drugged green stupor and are starting to focus on the consequences of their runaway collective madness: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9597461/Soviet-style-wind-farm-subsidies-to-face-the-axe.html

It’s another unusually cold winter striking the continent. Last year, hundreds froze to death. The same occurred in the winter of 2010.

Cold 7-day forecast for South America. Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp8.html
The English-language I Love Chile news site has a report on the cold now gripping vast parts of South America. At least 14 people have died in Chile due to cold over the past few days. According to I Love Chile:

Overall, eight people have died due to cold weather in Santiago, in addition to six others who perished in other the Central and Southern regions of the country. The cold front has caused temperatures throughout Chile to drop well below freezing. Some parts of Santiago reported temperatures as low as -4 degrees Celsius, causing homeless residents throughout the capital to face the cold without proper accommodations.”
According to www.news.de here, the cold is also gripping Bolivia and Peru, where the mercury has dropped to -23°C.
The low temperatures will continue in the days ahead as cold is expected to grip much of South America for the next week, see chart above.
Last week in Argentina, serious frosts led to a declaration of an agricultural emergency and disaster, read here.
The extreme cold is not isolated to South America. In Tasmania night-time temperatures in the South and Liawenee posted the coldest June day in almost 30 years. “Temperatures in some areas fell to almost 10 degrees below average between June 20 and June 28. Fingal and Ross had their coldest June night in 15 years on June 27 with bone-chilling lows of -6.7C and -6.5C recorded respectively.” Hat-tip: http://globalfreeze.wordpress.com/.

"Javier Larragoiti was 18 when his father was diagnosed with diabetes. The teenager had just started a degree in chemical engineering in Mexico City. So he dedicated his studies to a side project: creating an acceptable alternative to help his father and millions of Mexicans like him avoid sugar. “It’s only when you know someone with this sickness that you realise how common it is and how sugar intake plays a huge role,” he says. “My dad tried to use stevia and sucralose, just hated the taste, and kept cheating on his diet.” The young chemist started dabbling with xylitol, a sweet-tasting alcohol commonly extracted from birch wood and used in products such as chewing gum. “It has so many good properties for human health, and the same flavour as sugar, but the problem was that producing it was so expensive,” he says. “So I decided to start working on a cheaper process to make it accessible to everyone.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com Ten years later, Larragoiti has patented a fermentation-based process to turn wasted corn cobs from Mexico’s 27.5m-tonne annual crop into xylitol. It is thereby solving a second problem: what to do with all that agricultural waste that otherwise might be burned, adding greenhouse gases to the overladen atmosphere. His business, Xilinat (pronounced Hill-Ee-Natt), buys waste from 13 local farmers, producing 1 tonne of the product a year. This month his invention was awarded a prestigious $310,000 Chivas Venture prize award, which will enable him to industrialise production and scale up production tenfold. Obesity is one of the fastest-growing global health problems. One in seven people are obese and about 10% have type 2 diabetes. Since 1980 the rate of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries. Larragoiti says that sugary diets are a real problem in Coca-Cola-loving Mexico, which has the world’s second-highest rate of obesity and has successfully taxed sugary drinks to try to combat a main source of the issue. Paradoxically, another corn byproduct – fructose – is part of the problem, used to make corn syrup that has been linked to increasing obesity in the US. “It’s kind of ironic,” Larragoiti says. “High fructose corn syrup is just a bomb of carbs and concentrated sugar that makes a high peak of insulin. It’s many times sweeter than regular glucose. Companies use and pay less and that’s the issue.” Reusing agricultural waste is rapidly emerging as a promising sector for social entrepreneurs keen to tackle global heating and make useful things at the same time. “One corn stalk has 70% to 80% waste by weight when you get down to it,” says Stefan Mühlbauer, of Cormo USA Inc. His company has a pilot plant in Alsace, France, and is building another in Indiana, US, to turn corn waste into a peat moss substitute and a super-absorbent foam for filters or soil. “Farmers are excited as it gives them something that extends their harvest season and they see another source of revenue,” he adds. In Mexico, agricultural waste is often burned, releasing greenhouse gases and creating one of the country’s highest sources of dioxin emissions. “Burning the residue is cheap and quick and may suppress pests and diseases,” says Dr Wolter Elbersen, a crop production expert at Wageningen University & Research. “The disadvantages such as air pollution, loss of organic matter and nutrients are less appreciated apparently. Removing the material for feed or compost, or added value products such as paper pulp or fuels is often not cost-effective, or no labour is available to do all the work in a short window of time.” But thinking in a different way about “waste products” is essential if we are going to conserve scarce resources and feed a growing population, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “We need to think about the principles in the past, where we had to do much with little, and at the same time apply the technology we have at hand nowadays to succeed in the challenge of feeding the world,” says Clementine Schouteden, who leads the global initiative on the circular economy for food at the campaigning organisation. “There’s definitely a sense of urgency in making sure that we farm in a way that is regenerative, preventing waste but also [creating value from] the waste that is currently not edible, with a food industry making the right options for consumers and for the planet.” Xilinat’s idea has huge potential, according to Sonal Shah, the founding executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact + Innovation at Georgetown University, and a Chivas Venture judge. “It’s not just that he’s building a sugar substitute that tastes like sugar but that it’s going to become scalable so every company that uses sugar in its food has the opportunity to rethink what kind of substitute they use,” she said. Ebersen added, though, that “you do, however, need a solution for using the leftovers after the xylose has been extracted and the demand for xylitol is small [currently] compared with the amount of residue”. Meanwhile, what about Javier’s father? “My dad is super-happy,” Larragoiti says. “He uses my product every day and he’s willing not to cheat on his diet any more!” • Readers have pointed out that xylitol is highly toxic for dogs and even small amounts can be fatal. Use with care"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis summer in Germany is yet another wet one. Everywhere the media are moaning about the ongoing rains, lack of sunshine, flooded basements, etc. It was the same story last year. German scientists are stumped, their models have been exposed as being completely wrong – again.
For years Germany’s “climate scientists” kept warning the German public and governments they had to prepare for drier summers with periods of drought – because of galloping climate change. That’s what the climate models of renown institutes like the Max Planck Institute and the Potsdam Institute showed. That cannot be denied.
For example the online Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung here warned “Climate change, according to the German Weather Service, will result in very rainy low pressure areas during the wintertime and more dryness with periods of drought in the summertime. The source of this projection is DWD Vice President Paul Becker, early May.
Not long ago, the online Der Tagesspiegel warned its readers of the same: “Wet winters, dry summers, less water, high temperatures, more hail, more storm damage.” Here they were using model projections from the Potsdam Institute of Bedwetters and Climate Neurotics (PIK).
In September, 2008, Der Spiegel here wrote: “More heat waves, no snow in the winter: After years of calculation work, the climate prognoses of the German government are complete. With unprecedented accuracy they predict how the climate will change by the year 2100 – region by region.” Unfortunately the “unprecedented accuracy” they’ve seen up to now is not what they had in mind.
Der Spiegel here also wrote: “Calculation made by Max Planck Institute scientists show that temperatures over Germany could be on average 1°C higher beginning already in 2021.” For sure we’ll be checking up on that in just a few more years.
Der Spiegel continues: “‘Every few years there will be heat waves like 2003,’ said climate scientists of the Max Planck Institute.”
Well, we’re still waiting for it. If anything, the summers in Germany have been getting rainier and cooler – not resembling anything at all the summer of 2003.
Not only have the summers been misprdicted with astounding failure, but so have the recent winters. Here Der Spiegel predicted increasingly snowless winters. By 2031, much of Germany could expect never to see snow again. However, the last winters have seen a large number of days with snow cover. Indeed the red-colored Germany needs to be repainted green or even blue!
Looking back at the much ballyhooed climate models, we see that they’ve made a complete string of major mispredictions:

1. Not a single model predicted the stagnant temperatures the globe has seen for the last 15 years.
2. Not a single model projected the recent slowdown in sea level rise.
3. Not a single model predicted harsh winters of the type many parts of the world have experienced.
4. Not a single model projected the disappearance of hurricanes striking the US. Not a single model prjected fewer cyclones globally.
5. Not a single model projected increasing sea ice at the South Pole.
Just to name a few.
Germany’s once highly renowned, prestigious and respected science institutes are slowly but surely turning themselves into laughing stocks with their pseudo-science. All thanks to a small group of closed-minded activist scientists.
Finally, here’s the 7-day forecast near where I live, from www.wetter24.de:

No barbecue days in sight…middle of July with high temps in the low 60s…unbelievable warming!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch’s Klimazwiebel here posted an insightful essay by University of Bielefeld sociologist Prof. Peter Weingart titled (roughly translated): “The Limits of Science Advising Policy – Forget About the Opportunities“. Weingart cautions us against allowing an elite class of scientists to shape our public policy.The essay first appeared in Gegenworte – Hefte für den Disput über Wissen (Counterword – Magazine for the Dispute over Science).
What role should scientists have in setting policy for societies? Weingart reminds us that if “2 heads are better than one” then millions of heads are certainly better than a small group of heads. The will of the masses may not produce optimum results, but history shows us, profoundly, that societies run by a few elitists are far worse.
Today, worldwide, and especially in Germany, a handful of cocksure climate scientists, believing to be all-knowing, are attempting to tell society what behaviour is acceptable and insist their recommendations are “without alternative, that there are no other choices”. We’ve heard that before in history, too – and with tragic consequences.
“The democratic system has to do what it is told, and if it doesn’t, then the people are too stupid or just not educated enough,” Weingart sums up the attitude of these climate scientists, who purport to have a “masterplan” that will lead us to paradise-like conditions.
In Weingart’s view, climate science has abused its position in going far beyond policy advising. They now insist that the rest of the world dance to its tune. Weingart cites examples of humans already being forced to alter their behaviour: carbon trading, changing light bulbs, basing purchasing decisions on climate impact, to name a few.
If you can read German, then the essay is worth reading. I’ve translated HIS SUMMARY:
The lesson is quite clear. Science-based politics, or ‘society advising’ is ambivalent. Premature claims of absolute knowledge or political consequences that are without alternative, stemming from scientific insights and findings, are not scientifically justifiable and belong in the category of political propaganda. Scientists cannot be denied their civic right to be politically active, but when they do it in the name of science, then they abuse their credibility and the authority that it is based on. The credibility of science is neither based on exaggerated catastrophe warnings, nor on the promises of paradise-like futures. Rather it is based more on the demonstration of the difficulty of acquiring knowledge, the discussion of conflicting theories, and the interpretation of observations and the disclosure of uncertainties. Therein lie the possibilities, as well as the limitations of their power to convince society and politicians. Above all in democratic societies, scientists are especially challenged not to succumb to the temptation of assuming that their special knowledge sufficiently legitimises them exercising political influence.”
And my summary: Prof. Weingart should be advising politicians.
Quite entertaining is the hissy reaction of a warmist (Georg Hoffmann) in the reader comments, who unwittingly confirms why it is not a good idea to allow scientists (like himself) to have a disproportionate say in shaping public society.

"A favourite sport of the anti-green lobby is hunting out the climate hypocrites. It’s Emma Thompson’s lifestyle that has most recently been the subject of frenzied scrutiny after the actress addressed the Extinction Rebellion protest in London a few weeks ago. “Emma Thompson the first-class hypocrite!” blared one tabloid headline last month after she was spotted dining on beef carpaccio while flying first class to New York. So before I say any more about the lifestyle changes required to avoid catastrophic climate change, I’m going to hold my hands up. I’m a climate hypocrite. I care about the climate emergency. When I decided I couldn’t support Labour in the European elections, because of its Brexit position, I voted Green instead. But I’m ashamed to say I’m not great at applying my ballot-box behaviour to other areas of my life. The last time I ate red meat was last night. I’m heading to Gatwick to catch a flight after writing this.  There are those admirable saints who really do practise what they preach, but I’d bet most of those who profess to care about the planet are just as hypocritical as me. I don’t think it makes us bad people, just typically, fallibly human, lacking the willpower to do the stuff we know we ought, such as shedding a few pounds or putting away more in our pension. In the UK, we’ve already done the (relatively) painless stuff – closing coal power stations – when it comes to reducing emissions. The next frontier is stuff that is either expensive – ditching gas boilers and switching to electric cars – or requires us to change the way we live. That will certainly involve eating less meat, the production of which accounts for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all the world’s cars, ships, trains and planes put together. Beef is by far the worst culprit: one study recommended cutting global consumption by 90%. It’s naive to think that we can achieve these sorts of lifestyle shifts by imploring people to do more. I already know we’re fast approaching a catastrophic climate tipping point and yet I’m just not very good at forgoing a steak, particularly when I know plenty of others won’t be either. The power of nudge is also limited here: shoving the steak further down the menu isn’t going to make me less likely to order it. So public policy inevitably ends up with sin taxes as the go-to policy lever for trying to get us to switch away from the bad stuff. Sure enough, a meat tax has been mooted. But the big problem with green taxes is that they hit the least affluent hardest. It’s people on low incomes who are most sensitive to marginal increases in the cost of their food and flights and who might decide they can’t afford their one holiday a year as a result. But it’s the very well-off who can much more easily absorb the cost of green taxes who do the bulk of the polluting: the richest 10% of households in the UK produce four times as many emissions as those in the bottom 50. That’s one reason why a jury set up by the Food Ethics Council rejected the idea of a meat tax last week. But, perhaps counterintuitively, I think the inevitable rise of the climate hypocrite – as awareness grows of just how much destruction we are set to wreak on the planet, but people still can’t quite bring themselves to pass up a Sunday roast or the holiday at the end of that budget flight – is a cause for optimism. I want to do more, but I know I need someone to force me to take my carbon footprint more seriously. And perhaps that means people will become more willing to countenance something more radical, but fairer, than sin taxes: saying there’s only a certain amount of meat or air miles we’re going to consume as a population every year and once it’s gone, it’s gone. Rationing is evocative of wartime Britain, when the amount of everything from petrol to sugar to eggs that each person was allowed to consume was tightly controlled. It commanded public support as part of the collective war effort. That support might be much harder to win when we’re not at war, but along with microbial resistance (a whole other disaster-movie plotline) the climate crisis is the biggest existential threat facing mankind. Maybe the Blitz spirit does have some contemporary relevance. Rationing to tackle the climate crisis could be given a modern-day makeover. People could be allocated polluting credits to cover activities such as meat eating and flying that they can sell and buy in an online marketplace. If you’re short of cash, or not that bothered about eating meat or flying abroad, you can feel smug as you sell your credits to someone who is, which makes this far more equitable than green taxes. And setting a population-level limit on something such as meat consumption would create huge incentives for companies to invest more in the production of things such as environmentally friendly, lab-grown meat. It’s not a new idea; in fact, in the mid 2000s, David Miliband waxed lyrical about personal carbon “credit cards” when he was environment secretary. But the government later distanced itself from the idea, coyly calling it an idea “ahead of its time”, to strident criticism from a group of cross-party MPs. A decade on, it’s surely an idea whose time has come. The climate school strikes show the next generation is hungry for more radical action. Sure, the hypocrite-hunters will balk at the prospect of rationing to save the planet. But I’m optimistic that more of us will come to see that it’s going to take something more drastic than trying to persuade people to voluntarily scale back to whip us into shape. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterCornelis De Jager of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Silvia Duhau of the Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ingenieria, Universidad de Buenos Aires have published a new paper in the Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate titled: Sudden transitions and grand variations in the solar dynamo, past and future.

I’m not sure if other bloggers have written about this. If so, here it is again. The paper forecasts solar activity for the current Solar cycle 24, which they expect will peak in May, 2013 with a maximum sunspot number Rmax of 62 ± 12.
More importantly, the authors write (emphasis added):
The subsequent analysis, based on a phase diagram, which is a diagram showing the relation between maximum sunspot numbers and minimum geomagnetic aa index values leads to the conclusion that a new Grand Episode in solar activity has started in 2008.”
and
…we predict that this Grand Episode will be of the Regular Oscillations type, which is the kind of oscillations that also occurred between 1724 and 1924. Previous expectations of a Grand (Maunder-type) Minimum of solar activity cannot be supported. We stress the significance of the Hallstatt periodicity for determining the character of the forthcoming Grand Episodes.  No Grand Minimum is expected to occur during the millennium that has just started.”
That of course is good news, as the world can ill-afford climate conditions like the ones we saw during the Maunder Minimum – especially with governments racing to prepare for the exact opposite.
The full paper is available here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German mainstream media has always acted as Obama’s lawyers, carefully sanitizing and grooming the message to the public to ensure it delivers the right effect.
UPDATE: europe-us-debate4
But I guess there’s no way of spinning what went down yesterday, and so the major dailies have declared victory for Romney.

Before the debate, the German public for the most part had been fooled into thinking that Obama had done a great job so far, and that his re-election should be a shoe-in.
But they also knew that Romney is within striking distance and were told by the media that with Americans you just don’t know what stupid things can happen. And plus they are told there’s a lot of racism in primitive America. If Obama loses, then it’ll probably be because of angry, male, gun-toting racists turning out at the polls.
I haven’t seen the debate yet, but have just scanned a few German headlines:

Der Spiegel’s headline: Romney scores points in duel against Obama
DIE WELT: First Round goes to Romney
The FAZ: Romney scores in TV duel, but Election is still not decided.
FOCUS: Disaster for the President – Obama was way off his role.
Other leftwing dailies like the TAZ and DIE ZEIT have nothing so far, which leads us to believe they haven’t been able to bring themselves to write about it, or they still haven’t figured out how to spin the event.
It’ll be interesting what they’ll blame his poor performance on. My guess is that they they’ll blame…yes, you know who.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an e-mail from reader Thomas L. with a link to an opinion piece at Vermont Tiger titled “Fire On The Mountain“, written by Vermont state Senator Joe Benning.

Vermont disfigures, self-mutilates its scenic ridgelines and mountains for the sake of a blind obsession. Source: lowellmountainsnews.com/
It shows how public opinion on the issue of “green” energy is evolving in Vermont, and that (some) people are finally coming to their senses. Also read big-wind-moratorium/.
German readers will quickly see that Vermont is not leading the world in renewable energy, but is in fact now just a monkey imitating the failed energy policies we’ve already seen here in Europe and Germany. Vermont’s leaders are not visionaries; they have blindly hitched their wagon to a European train whose locomotive has already gone over the edge of a cliff. It’s time to unhitch.
=============================================
Fire On The Mountain
by Joe Benning
Recently I hiked up to the top of Lowell Ridge to see where twenty-one, four hundred foot wind towers will be placed. As I crested the mountain I came face to face with an energy policy that is at war with itself. The environmental destruction taking place there pits those seeking to reverse climate change against those who wish to preserve Vermont’s pristine natural resources. While that battle rages, the economic cost to Vermont has been pushed aside as irrelevant.

Our new energy policy calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. Targeting our entire energy spectrum (including transportation), it relies on instate renewables to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. At the same time we’re eliminating Hydro Quebec, nuclear power, fracked natural gas and less efficient biomass electricity as acceptable “renewables.” Industrial wind, currently the darling of the present administration, has become the power that now drives our legislative policy.
What price are we willing to pay for this new policy? Vermont currently does a better job than most states at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so self-imposed mandates are not even necessary. And to those who believe Vermont will “lead the way” in reversing climate change, any hope that Vermont alone can cause a world-wide domino effect to achieve this lofty goal should be carefully balanced against the very real environmental destruction taking place right now in the cherished natural solitude of the Northeast Kingdom.
And more wind farms are coming as corporate investors, motivated by tax incentives and artificially inflated electric rates, seduce small towns with infusions of cash. Since wind is intermittent and has no storage capacity, our policy alone will require more wind farms and many miles of transmission lines to achieve our energy goal. If regulatory authorities fall short insisting on decommissioning plans, our ridgelines will end up littered with forty story rusting hulks when this technology becomes obsolete. These new wind farms are encroaching on our wildlife corridors, destroying pristine mountain environments and radically changing the aesthetics of our state. They pit citizens of towns against each other, and towns against towns in a given region.
In the meantime, we in the legislature have not been living up to the responsibility that comes with guarding Vermont’s Constitution. Article 18 urges us to be moderate and frugal when enacting only such legislation as is necessary for the good government of this state. At a time when Vermont already has more power than it can use, our new policy is not moderate, not frugal, and certainly not necessary. We haven’t even taken the time to ask ourselves what these policy goals will mean to our economy in the absence of similar goals in surrounding states.
I cannot support the raping of a pristine environment in exchange for intermittent power that has to be subsidized by both the taxpayer and the ratepayer. At a time when Vermont already has an ample power supply, this is no energy plan, it is a blind obsession. It’s time for Vermonters of every political stripe to join together in defense of ‘These Green Hills and Silver Waters.'”

"Paul Brown is spot-on in his criticism of how weather forecasts and presenters ignore the continuing drought (Weatherwatch, 28 May). It is as if they are in a parallel universe where the climate emergency does not exist. Wildlife, gardeners, farmers and all who care about the environment are desperate for proper rainfall, especially in central and southern England. Having complained about this on numerous occasions to the BBC, I have given up as nothing changes. Presenters continue to welcome hot and dry weather, and often refer disparagingly to “the risk of rain”. Most forecasts give the impression that broadcasters do not understand the climate emergency, or they don’t care. How about taking on board messages from experts like David Attenborough in their own programmes and reflecting the reality of drought conditions in many parts of England? Presenters cannot change the weather, but their lack of coverage of the urgent need for rainfall goes beyond irritating – it is a dereliction of duty.Linda LennardSt Albans  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Augusto Mangini of the University of Heidelberg in Germany is an expert for temperature reconstructions using stalactites and stalagmites.
He was allowed to speak a whole 15 minutes at the World Extreme Weather Congress in Hamburg last moth, where he presented some sobering results. These in turn were reported by the print edition of a leading German science news magazine Bild der Wissenschaft.Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne website.
His presentation was called: “Climate Curves in Comparison– Why There Are Such Large Differences“.
In the current April 2012 issue of Bild der Wissenschaft, Klaus Jacob has a report “Klima in Kalk“ (Climate in Limestone) where he describes the method and climatological relationships of stalactites that Mangini uses. Jacob writes:
[Mangini] has been working with stalactites and stalagmites for 15 years – and has come to an amazing conclusion: The natural climate fluctuations are greater than what the science has previously assumed. This has consequences for the future as the fluctuations will superimpose the human impacts. Thus the continents will not necessarily always become warmer, rather the trend could take a break, or even a temporary cooling is possible.“
Don’t you love how the main stream media, after years of being stuck on CO2, are finally waking up to REAL SCIENCE. Jacob continues:

[Using stalactites and stalagmites] Mangini has reconstructed the central European climate over the last 9000 years. Clear to see are the stark ups and downs with differences of about 2°C. […] Already on multiple occasions over the last 8000 years the temperature shot up 1°C within just 200 years. The temperature appears to fluctuate naturally more starkly than what the IPCC shows in its reports […] Mangini’s curves now show […] the start of a cooling phase.“
Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne site writes that Jacob’s article addressed some important points, which other German journalists are unfortunately too spineless to write about:
(1)  The pre-industrial, post Ice Age period was characterized by natural climate fluctuations without the involvement of CO2.
(2)  These natural fluctuations today still play a major role on our climate, which up to now has been played down.
(3)  The IPCC models are thus not as perfect as they are often claimed to be.
(4)  The warming stop since 2000 could continue, and even bring a modest cooling with it.
(5)  Ocean cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) will suppress the temperatures over the coming decades.
Die kalte Sonne site then expresses some disappointment that Jacob did not mention the likely cause of these past, stark climate fluctuations – cyclic solar activity. Here skeptics will have to be patient with the mainstream media. We cannot expect them to change overnight. Rome, after all, was not built in a day.
Prof. Mangini’s presentation coincides with a recently released study that adds yet another straw to the camel’s back. The study Holocene climate variability in North-Eastern Italy: potential influence of the NAO and solar activity recorded by speleothem data, authored by Scholz et al (co-authored by Mangini) concludes from the data:
This suggests that climate variability in Northern Italy was influenced by both solar activity and the NAO during the Holocene.”
There we are once again: the sun and oceans dominate.

"The former Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Ed Davey launched his bid for the party leadership on Thursday, pledging to fight a no-deal Brexit by working with remainers in parliament to make revoking article 50 the legal default if no agreement on leaving the EU is reached by October. Davey, the former secretary of state for energy and climate change, said he would make stopping Brexit the cornerstone of his leadership, but also said the party must broaden its appeal and that he would do so by focusing on the environment. The MP, who regained his Kingston and Surbiton seat at the 2017 general election, is likely to be in a two-horse race with the party’s deputy leader, Jo Swinson, to replace Vince Cable when he steps down in mid-July. Swinson is expected to announce her candidacy later this week. Davey said he would not wait for the results of the leadership contest to begin work with other remain MPs on finding a legal route to stopping no-deal – a prospect boosted by comments made by the Speaker, John Bercow, who made it clear on Wednesday he did not believe no-deal could occur without MPs’ consent. “We want to pass a law that if you got to the cliff edge that the default would be revocation, not crashing out,” Davey said. “People who realise no-deal is a disaster ought to vote for that legislation – I include people in the current cabinet.” The MP said he saw another radical route to stopping no-deal – a vote of no confidence in the government and the formation of a unity government to deliver a second referendum. “I would not go for a general election immediately – the Queen has to first determine if anyone else can form a government,” he said. “She would probably go to Jeremy Corbyn first but I can see MPs across parties, like Tom Watson, Hilary Benn, the SNP, Plaid [Cymru] and Tory remainers, possibly even Tory cabinet ministers, could make it clear publicly that they would form a temporary government with the sole purpose to allow a people’s vote. In those circumstances, we should do that. We have to stop no-deal.” Davey said he could not envisage any future formal coalitions with the Conservatives or Labour in their current forms, because of the Tory position on delivering Brexit and because it would be “deeply unattractive” for the Lib Dems to enter a formal coalition with Jeremy Corbyn. “He has no credibility on this issue,” Davey said. That does not mean the Lib Dems are afraid of entering government again, he said: “I just look at the current bunch and I don’t want to go anywhere near them.” The Liberal Democrat leader is chosen by party members in a postal ballot. To become a candidate, an MP must secure nominations from at least 10% of the Liberal Democrat MPs in parliament, and from at least 200 members from more than 20 local parties. The ballot is usually carried out using the single transferable vote system. Voters rank their choice of leader in preference. After the first preference votes are counted, if no candidate has over 50% of the vote, then the second preference votes of those who cast their vote for the least popular candidate are reallocated, and so on, until somebody has a majority. In the 2019 race however, only Jo Swinson and Ed Davey are running, so the ballot will be a straight head-to-head contest. The leadership contenders are likely to face intense questioning from party members who saw botched attempts to form pacts with other remain parties such as Change UK and the Greens fail. Davey said he felt the successes for the party in the most recent elections put it “in a very different place” now in those discussions, hinting that he could prefer defections from Change UK MPs rather than pacts. “I can understand why a year ago they thought we were not doing well,” he said. “Change UK may have had that view, but they have been proven totally wrong. I would like to see now big players from the major parties having the courage to leave, but not to come to Change but to come to us.” Swinson has previously said the Lib Dems must “own the failures” of coalition, citing some deep cuts to public services, the introduction of the hostile environment and the bedroom tax. However, Davey said he will “never say the coalition was a bad thing” and that the Lib Dems’ difficult reputation in coalition had only been down to their PR. “We played the politics wrong, but we did look after the people who needed looking after and we stopped the Tories cutting far deeper and more dramatically,” he said. “We got the blame for the bad things and no credit for the good things.” Davey intends to draw on his former climate brief to give the Lib Dems another key policy to champion. “Why we haven’t prospered for quite a period, in my view, is that people forgot what the Lib Dems stand for – apart from stopping Brexit. We’ve had success on the back of ‘events, dear boy’, like the Iraq war and Brexit, but that comes and goes – and then what?” Davey said the climate crisis was “the issue” of the next generation. “The science is showing it far worse than we thought when I was in government,” he said. He intends to launch a policy putting tighter restrictions on investment in fossil fuels in the City of London."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJuliet Eilperin sees the “climate change” issue slipping away. It is no longer the number one environmental concern among Americans. When climate change is ranked among all problems that concern Americans, most polls show it as a mere asterisk, or bundled in with “other” or “misc.”
Eilperin starts her commentary:
Just 18 percent of those polled name it as their top environmental concern. That compares with 33 percent who said so in 2007, amid publicity about a major U.N. climate report and Al Gore’s Oscar-winning documentary about global warming. Today, 29 percent identify water and air pollution as the world’s most pressing environmental issue.”
That means the number of people who view climate change as a problem has been almost cut in half in just 5 years. Now about 60% more people are concerned about water and air pollution in the world – that’s good!
Clearly education on the issue of climate is spreading. People are becoming aware that climate change is natural and that the globe has not warmed in 15 years.
Eilperin writes that “the findings indicate that Washington’s decision to shelve action on climate policy means that the issue has receded” and that some “who feel passionately about the issue say they have noticed that President Obama is no longer pushing a bill that would limit greenhouse gas emissions.”
Don’t expect any politicians to make climate change a central issue in this year’s elections.

"Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, has accused police of stepping out of line by announcing plans to push for the prosecution of more than 1,100 Extinction Rebellion protesters. Deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said on Friday that the Metropolitan police had a team of 30 officers preparing cases against those arrested during the protests over Easter, and that he anticipated putting “all of those [cases] to the Crown Prosecution Service for decisions”. Chakrabarti said: “The deputy assistant commissioner would be wise to remember his constitutional role, which is not that of prosecutor, judge or commentator. “The police perform a vital role in preserving the law and keeping the peace, which includes safeguarding the rights of peaceful protesters. The next Labour government will review the statute book to ensure that the right to peaceful protest is robustly protected.” During the protests last month, Extinction Rebellion’s tactics included causing maximum disruption with roadblocks at Parliament Square, Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch held by hundreds of activists willing to get arrested for blocking the streets. Others glued themselves to trains and buildings in a campaign of civil disobedience aimed at raising awareness of the climate and biodiversity crisis that scientists say will have disastrous implications for life on Earth. They managed to block the four key locations for almost a week before police officers began opening roads again. The Olympic gold medal-winning canoeist Etienne Stott was among the 1,130 people arrested. So far, more than 70 activists have been charged over the demonstrations, which police say cost £7.5m and forced them to deploy 10,000 officers on the streets of London. Scotland Yard’s hardline approach comes after Cressida Dick, the Met commissioner, was questioned by representatives on the London assembly’s police and crime committee last week over why her force was not able to clear the streets more quickly. She said the Met had been caught off guard by the scale and tactics of the protest. Protesters’ passivity and non-violence had meant commanders could not send in riot police to clear the streets by force, she said. An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said that any hardline approach by police could play into the hands of the campaign, which seeks to highlight the sacrifices its activists are willing to make for their cause in order to inspire others. “We have seen doctors, we have seen XR youth – kids with their parents’ permission – doing civil disobedience,” Ronan McNern said. “If the Met plan is to take those people and put them through the court system, in a way it serves the purpose of Extinction Rebellion. More people will know who these people are protesting. Either way, we win. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam “If the Met decide to do this it’s them who are going to be adding to legal time, and that’s their decision. On the one hand, they seem to be arguing we are wasting lots of police time. But if they are going to put more costs on the legal system, then that’s their choice.” Further environmental protests, along with US president Donald Trump’s visit in June and demonstrations over the ongoing Brexit debate, are likely to stretch police resources over the summer. Taylor said the Met was equipped to deal with any upcoming actions and said officers from other forces would be called into action if needed. He said Scotland Yard was in discussions with the Home Office to review the current public order legislation – amid fears Extinction Rebellion’s tactics could be adopted by other groups – and called for a stronger punishment of those who break the law."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe EU is clearly frustrated by the lack of progress in advancing the (bogus) climate change issue.

Prof Hans von Storch on EU climate issue: “more as an opportunity to do social experiments”. (Photo source: wikimedia.org/wikipedia)
Rainer Grundmann writes about it at Prof. Hans von Storch’s klimazwiebel blog here and quotes the BBC:
The European Commission believes that policies to cut greenhouse gases will only work if individuals share the vision of a low-carbon society. ‘It’s perhaps been a bit too much doom and gloom in the past on climate,’ one official told the BBC at the launch in London. ‘We are now emphasising the need to inspire people.'”
Too much gloom and doom? Well then they ought to revamp the IPCC 5th Assessment Report so that it inpires readers, and not send them off scurrying under the bed pretrified of Mother Nature’s wrath. All indications are that it will be gloomier and doomier than ever.

Indeed, the issue has been so misused against the public that it has actually backfired in places like Great Britain. According to the BBC:

One of her officials admitted that the UK was suffering from something of a media backlash against climate policies because previously there had been media “overkill” on climate.”

Interestingly, Hans von Storch has an unkind assessment of the EU’s approach. In a reader comment he writes:
If this report is accurate, it describes a sad inability of European elites to take climate change seriously. The issue seems more as an opportunity to do social experiments – such as mass mobilization, steps towards a truly global governance – than dealing with efficiently limiting climate change and protecting society against ‘non-mitigatable’ climate change.”
Moreover, von Storch doubts that fixing the”gloom and doom” practice by using the educational approach of “‘inspiring people’ – without recognizing that the gloom & doom practice caused damage in the trust in policymakers, media and science…” will work at all. He suspects: “…it seems that the EU officials consider the media as culprits.”
It’s the media’s fault! Climate science and EU policy – what a circus.

How many German readers here at NTZ will disagree? Not many I suspect. Hat-tip Science Skeptical.
Germany — Insane Or Just Plain Stupid?
We usually give the Germans credit for being rational, but this coal plant will emit over one million times more carbon this year than all of their nuclear plants would have over the next 20 years, and cost over twice as much to run as any one of the them. Germany’s present strategy will absolutely not allow them to reduce their carbon emissions anywhere near their goal of 40% by 2020.
Unless the German people give up the nice parts of their lifestyle and become insanely efficient, they most likely will not reduce their emissions at all by 2020.

No one thought Germany would be insane enough to shut down their nuclear plants, without a reason and without backup….” Continue reading…
That’s because nobody knew how drugged-up-on-green the Germans have become over the last 20 years. Even the conservatives are marching to the beat of fundamentalist green – in a zombie state, all thinking they are going to get 70 virgins in climate paradise later on.
To James Conca: never under-estimate Germany’s power of collective thinking, and it’s potential to send the entire nation through a phase of insanity.
Yes, I’m sorry to say, and likely violating the rules of being a good guest here, the German leadership did indeed become scientifically, collectively insane – all led on and duped by an elitist class of crackpot scientists, journalists and activists. The proof is in the reality, as so vividly exposed by James Conca.
Now, finally, the conservatives, it seems, prodded along by the Free Democrats, are beginning to recognize their folly and are quietly going back to what really works.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore on Sulfur Dioxide
By Ed Caryl
Nearly all of the literature about SO2 claims that it is not a greenhouse gas. This “consensus” opinion is based on the belief that SO2 residence time in the atmosphere is too short for the gas to have an effect.
In my last article on this subject it was asserted that the severe pollution from Norilsk in Siberian Russia moves out over the Arctic Ocean on the prevailing winds, preventing cooling, slowing the freeze-up. This is seen on the anomaly maps as warming. (It is now warmer than the 1998-2006 average.) As can be seen in Figure 1, the same thing happens in Arctic Canada, due to the SO2 from Canadian oil and gas fields that produce similar amounts of SO2.
There have been several estimates for the residence time of SO2 in the atmosphere. Keep in mind that residence time is the half-life of the substance in the air, that is, the time it takes for half of the material to disappear. If the residence time of SO2 is ten days, this means that, ignoring dilution, the 50,000 parts per million present at Norilsk, will be 25,000 parts per million 10 days later as the wind pushes that parcel of air over the Arctic Ocean, 12,500 parts per million after 20 days, 6,250 after a month, about 750 ppm after two months, etc. Because of inversions over the Arctic Ocean, there isn’t much vertical mixing to dilute the gas, so most of the mixing is horizontal in about a 100 meter altitude layer.
But, (and it is a big but) the residence time increases with a reduction in temperature. In the Arctic, at temperatures way below zero centigrade, the residence time may be more than 30 days, so multiply the time intervals above by three. That covers a whole season. And the SO2 is continuously being replenished. We are not describing an impulse in time like a volcanic eruption. Concentrations over the Arctic Ocean may build up and approach the concentrations at the source, if the wind blows steadily from south to north for an extended time. The residence time increases if there is nothing to remove the SO2.
Here are the things that remove SO2 from the atmosphere (read here).
1. Direct photo-oxidation (in the presence of oxygen and water).
But in the Arctic in the winter there is no sunlight, so that doesn’t function. The water vapor concentration is also very low. Below freezing, water vapor partial pressure is below 5 mbar; at -20°C it is below 1.5 mbar (below 0.5% and 0.15% of the atmosphere).
2. Indirect photo-oxidation (with O2, NOx, OH, organic oxidants).
Same problem as 1, no sunlight. And no sunlight to produce OH radicals.
3. Oxidation in liquid droplets (in the presence of liquid water).
There is no liquid water remember? The temperatures are way below zero.
4. Homogeneous aqueous phase oxidation.

//-->




Same problem as 3.
5, Catalyzed oxidation in liquid droplets (requires metal ions as well as water droplets).
This one might work, as there are lots of metal ions in the pollution from Norilsk, if there are super-cooled water droplets. But as in 1, the water vapor availability is very low because of the cold. What acid production that does occur happens in the smelter smokestacks where water vapor and temperatures allow 3, 4, or 5 to operate. Once the SO2 gets into the cold, dry, arctic air, all that stops.
6. Catalyzed oxidation on dry surfaces.
No joy here. Once it reaches the coast, the stuff is over open ocean or ice.
So, in winter, once SO2 leaves the smelter smokestacks, there is no mechanism to get rid of it. No wonder the Arctic is warming!
Is this what happens? Is the Arctic warming in winter? The climate scientists say it is, and in this regard they are correct.

Figure 2: Monthly maps of Arctic temperature anomaly for the last 7+ years. Source: Climate4You.
Note in Figure 2 the amount of red and orange (warm) areas in the October through April months. December and January have the most red in several of the years above. Most of the warm areas are right over Norilsk in Arctic Siberia. The warming happens only in the cold months. In Arctic summer there are mostly cool colors. In Arctic summer the humidity rises, sunlight produces OH radicals, and all the mechanisms 1 through 6 above begin operating, removing the SO2.
According to one source, 93.5% of the SO2 emissions in 1998 were in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere is where most of the measured warming is taking place. Circumstantial evidence would seem to point to SO2 as the culprit. Can SO2 act as a greenhouse gas? It has an infrared spectrum with two peaks at 7.27 and 7.345 µm. This is on the shoulder of one of water vapor’s absorbance peaks. In the absence of water vapor, in the Arctic cold, it can replace it as a greenhouse gas. In that role it can produce back radiation just as water vapor, CO2, and methane do. In past periods of high volcanism high volcanic emissions of SO2 have overwhelmed natural reduction mechanisms and have produced warming periods (see here).
The study of SO2, especially how it acts in the polar regions, has been neglected in favor of pushing CO2 as the ONLY cause of global warming. As is easily seen by looking at anomaly maps, the warming is not global. It is concentrated in the Arctic at certain locations, and to a lesser degree, the Antarctic, again, in the Southern Hemisphere winter. In the Antarctic, warming seems to be concentrated around the large research stations. All the stations in the Antarctic burn oil for heat, power, and transport. Is SO2 and the Antarctic winter the problem there?

"It is an almost perfect spring day. The sky is milky blue and there is barely a ripple on the mirror-flat expanse of Barmouth Bay. The sunshine is warm and the mountains are beginning to turn from slate-grey to luscious green. Bev Wilkins, a former businesswoman, launches a ball down the beach for her beloved German shepherd rescue dog, Lottie. In a blur of legs and black fur, the dog dashes into the frothy surf. “It is a lovely spot when the sun comes out,” she says, welcoming her dripping pet back with an affectionate rub. “Horrible when it rains.”  This is how Wilkins, 67, expected to spend her retirement when she sold her family home in Warwick and moved to Fairbourne, in north Wales, in 2002. For many years it was blissful: she spent her summers swimming in the sea and drying off in the back garden. Winters were harder, although she always had the views of Snowdonia’s rugged slopes to lift her spirits. But if Wilkins lasts nearly as long as her mother, who is 98 and also lives in the village, she could be among the first residents to be moved out: Gwynedd council has decided it can no longer defend her home from rising sea levels driven by increasing global temperatures. “This is a wake-up call for the country,” she says, making her way up the steep shingle bank to the wall that protects her white bungalow from the waves. “This is going to happen elsewhere. Sometimes you have to see someone else go through it – we just happen to be the first.” In 26 years – or sooner, if forecasts worsen or a storm breaches the sea defences – a taskforce led by Gwynedd council will begin to move the 850 residents of Fairbourne out of their homes. The whole village – houses, shops, roads, sewers, gas pipes and electricity pylons – will then be dismantled, turning the site back into a tidal salt marsh. It will become the first community in the UK to be decommissioned as a result of climate change; while other villages along England’s crumbling east coast have lost houses to accelerating erosion, none have been abandoned. It may also create hundreds of British climate refugees: the residents of Fairbourne are not expected to receive any compensation for the loss of their homes, and resettlement plans are unclear. It will not be the last village to meet this fate. Sea levels around the UK have risen by 15.4cm since 1900, and the Met Office expects them to rise by as much as 1.12m from modern levels by 2100, putting at risk communities in coastal floodplains and on sea cliffs, which are found around much of the east and south coast of England. The west of Wales and north-west England are also vulnerable. Even if the world’s governments succeed in reversing increasing emissions in line with their Paris climate commitments, sea levels are set to rise for centuries, as the impact of higher global temperature and warmer oceans takes effect. *** Fairbourne rises, somewhat improbably, from reedy mudflats that slide into the Irish Sea. A straggle of white bungalows, holiday cottages and Victorian apartments, the village spreads out between the brackish waters of the Mawddach estuary mouth and the pale uplands of the Snowdonia national park. On a bright day, with birdsong carrying on the warm breeze, it is easy to understand why the Victorian flour merchant Arthur McDougall chose this spot to build his ideal seaside resort in the late 1890s. Since then, it has developed sporadically into a thriving and joyously eccentric English-speaking village of about 410 homes, with a shop, deli, chippy, butchers, campsite and a popular model railway. Many retired couples moved here from industrial towns and cities in the Midlands, inspired by vivid memories of childhood holidays in north Wales. Others were attracted by the spectacular landscape and the uncrowded beaches – along with relatively affordable house prices. Gwynedd council decided it could not afford to defend the village indefinitely in 2013. But the first time most local people heard about the new shoreline management plan was the following year, when BBC Wales’s investigative television series, Week In Week Out, highlighted parts of it in the wake of ferocious storms. The village, which is barely above sea level, is protected by a sea wall, earth banks and a network of drainage channels. These defences were recently improved as part of a £6.8m scheme to extend the life of the village; but from the middle of the century, increasingly regular flooding could render Fairbourne unhabitable. A breach of the wall during a storm surge could sweep away houses and drown villagers. As word of the council’s decision spread, house sales fell through and prices collapsed. Some residents simply stopped maintaining their homes and gardens. Others formed a campaign group, claiming that the reporting of the plan was misleading, and that the village had been unfairly singled out by Gwynedd. They argued that flooding was much worse in Aberystwyth, Barmouth and Borth in 2014. The campaign petered out when key members moved away, but much of the bitterness remains. Wilkins, one of the original campaigners, feels the village has been badly treated. “There are hundreds of residents in Fairbourne,” she says, as we talk in her living room. “We’ve got the little railway. We’ve got the shops. We’ve got a post office. We are a thriving community, and that’s all going to be wiped out. I don’t like to think about it.” Houses have started to sell again, but only to cash buyers looking for bargains; some calculate they can make a profit from rental income in the time Fairbourne has left. However, many of the villagers cannot drop their asking prices £40,000 or £50,000 below the already depressed market rate for the area, because they could not afford to buy anywhere else. Halfway along a quiet, sun-dappled cul-de-sac, Cathy Bowen, 83, and George Bowen, 76, are struggling to sell their two-bedroom bungalow for £125,000. The couple moved to the village from Staffordshire 18 years ago after falling in love with the area on family caravan holidays. But they want to sell because George, a cancer survivor who has type 2 diabetes, needs to be near a hospital. “We want to move because George is not very well and I’m 83,” says Cathy, perched on a stool in their cosy lounge. “I won’t be able to look after him for long.” There has been no interest so far. “It’s been on for three months and not a soul has been here to see it,” she says, glumly. For Mike Thrussell, 64, a well-known angling journalist, this is the untold story of Fairbourne. Thrussell lives in one of the older, McDougall-era properties just below the sea wall, and claims the council has abandoned the villagers without any solutions. “There are a lot of people in my position. I’ve been here 38 years. My house is paid for. I’m two and half years away from retirement,” he says. “And then this comes along.” Thrussell, who used to co-present BBC Five Live’s Fish on Five, says houses in Fairbourne have lost a good 40% of their value – and are bound to drop further as the decommissioning date approaches. “People who want to sell are taking very cheap cash deals. I can’t do that. Where am I going to go? I wouldn’t get enough money to get another house,” he says, slamming his kitchen table in frustration. Many villagers, he explains, had been planning to use their homes to pay for their care. “How the authorities can sit there and push this forward with no solutions beggars belief,” he says. Elsewhere in the village there is a mixture of sadness, denial and confusion about the long-term threat. Standing at the bow of his boat, Barmouth’s former harbourmaster, Julian Kirkham, is adamant that he will not leave his home and says even scientists can’t agree on sea-level rises. “It is just panic,” he says. “There has been so much waffle that nobody knows what will happen.” Younger residents will almost certainly experience the decommissioning of the village – although many question the likelihood of flooding. Julia Walker, 32, who is buying groceries in the local shop, tells me she cannot move out. “Our house is nice, but the thought that you might be in negative equity isn’t great when you have a young family starting out.” She has three children, and is pregnant with a fourth. The villagers feel powerless, she says. “We don’t have options. We are just pawns.” Shane Healy, 27, is leaning on a post outside the shop. His mother moved to the village from Sutton Coldfield in the Midlands shortly before he was born. “It will be a shame to lose everything. It has been built up from scratch and to watch it go under water would be heartbreaking for a lot of people,” he says. Benjamin Winfer, 18, is walking his two dogs along the beach. He works in a nearby chocolate factory. He would like to buy, but banks refuse to lend in Fairbourne. “I love it here,” he says, over the crackle of the tide dragging the shingle back and forth. “I want to live here for the rest of my life, but I can’t get a mortgage.” Despite the uncertain future, some people are moving into Fairbourne. One of the new arrivals is Angie Brown, a retired tax officer. She parks outside the shop and dashes in to pick up some beer for an impromptu barbecue. “This is la-la land – flooding is not going to happen,” she says. “Yes, the prices will continue to drop, but we will get the pleasure of living here in the meantime.” Next day, the weather turns. The sea is wild and frothy. A bitter wind blasts the village and hailstones the size of boiled sweets pound the beach. The engineer responsible for maintaining Fairbourne’s flood defences, Gareth Evens, is sensibly waiting in his Natural Resources Wales van. He knows better than anyone the multiple risks the village faces. “At high tide you can see how vulnerable Fairbourne is,” he says. “There are not many places where the houses are almost lower than the level of sea. If the sea defence fails then people are at risk straightaway. It would be catastrophic.” Evens says that, while other areas along the coast might appear to have a worse history of flooding, rising sea levels make it hard to defend Fairbourne in the long run. “It is a low-lying area. It is kept dry by sea defences, tidal defences and a network of ditches,” he says. The tide is predicted to reach ever higher up the beach as the century progresses. This makes it more likely that waves could come over the top or break the concrete sea wall, which sits on a single bank that is steadily being swept away. “If the defence is breached, there would be an immediate torrent of water. We are talking about loss of life, because the houses are built just behind,” Evens says. The threat doesn’t just come from the sea. Rainwater pours off the mountains and water surges up and down the estuary. Higher tides mean the water cannot always drain away through tidal flaps and backs up in the village. “You have almost got a basin in Fairbourne. All the runoff water naturally wants to come here,” he says. Would Evens buy a house here? “Knowing what I know, I probably would not,” he says. As hail drums on roofs and wind rakes the beach, the council officer tasked with the decommissioning, Lisa Goodier, arrives in her car. She has grown to know the area well since she was appointed to work with the community in 2014, and is greeted warmly by a few brave dog walkers. “It is sad to think this will all be gone,” she remarks after taking cover in a seafront cafe. “But I hope it will be a big moment in this country for taking climate change seriously.” Goodier has been drawing up a masterplan covering the timetable for decommissioning the village. “Based on the current rates of sea-level rise, we are planning to start in 2045,” she says. This will involve removing all trace of human existence. “It means we would eventually return this land to the sea,” Goodier says. “We would have to move everybody out, and then every ounce of infrastructure to return it to a salt marsh over time.” However, the plan is on “a piece of elastic”: the process may have to be brought forward immediately if the sea wall is breached and inundated. “If we have an early breach in the next two years then we need to be able to condense that very quickly,” she says, cradling a cup of takeaway tea. Goodier says the villagers are “unlikely” to get any compensation but will receive help to resettle. “The idea is to work with the community to gradually move them out and provide solutions that we can all live with. They will not be great solutions, given where we are financially,” she says. Gwynedd council has been cutting spending for more than a decade and is facing a shortfall of £13m in 2019/20. Goodier is aware that the stakes are high for residents who may end up with no assets. “What we don’t want to do is create a bunch of climate refugees, because Fairbourne is at risk of that,” she warns. There are no plans to rebuild the village elsewhere, not least because there is no land available in the Snowdonia national park. Instead, residents are likely to be placed in existing towns and villages in north Wales. Goodier admits that this will be challenging: “Are those places capable of absorbing that number of people?” Added to this is the risk that Welsh-speaking communities may not accept them. “Do people want to go there, and do people want to receive people from Fairbourne? Fairbourne is unusual because it is an English-speaking community in the most Welsh county in the whole of Wales,” Goodier says. This is uncharted territory for local authorities. There has never been a similar decommissioning project in the UK, and there is no fund to manage the impact of climate change, Goodier says. She has searched in vain for international precedents, but found only a flood-prone Alaskan village that was voluntarily relocated in 2016. The Welsh minister responsible for flooding, Lesley Griffiths, is sympathetic to the villagers’ plight but says the government is under no legal obligation to provide compensation. “I know that sounds hard, but we don’t want to raise expectations that financial support could be available,” she says. Griffiths admits that rising sea levels could mean that other Welsh communities are given up to the sea. “There may come a time when it is not sustainable or safe to try to continue to defend low-lying areas, if our seas rise as predicted,” she says. Talk of decommissioning angers the Arthog community council, the equivalent of an English parish council. Stuart Eves, the council’s vice-chair, lives in a rambling stone farmhouse on the outskirts of Fairbourne. He arrived from Buckinghamshire 40 years ago and runs the 30-pitch caravan park, which fills up every weekend throughout the summer. “Goodier is wrong to say she is going to decommission the village. You decommission a factory or something like that. We are not a factory – the village is full of humans who have spent their life’s money to come and live here because it is such a beautiful place,” he says in his living room, which is infused with the rich tang of wood smoke. The community council is opposed to Gwynedd’s plans for Fairbourne. “We are going to object strongly to this masterplan. There are no hard facts,” he says, leaning forward in his chair. “Nobody can really say if the sea level is going to increase or decrease.” Other communities are likely to face similar battles in the coming decades. While cities and areas with important industries are likely to be defended, smaller coastal communities are most at risk. Norfolk villages such as Happisburgh, which has lost 35 homes to the sea, and Hemsby, which has lost 18 homes, are on the frontline of accelerating coastal erosion. But these are not facing decommissioning because only the outskirts are threatened at present; in a few cases, demolished homes have been relocated further inland. There’s no such option in Fairbourne, caught between the sea and the mountains. A report for the government Committee on Climate Change (CCC) last year found nearly 530,000 properties at risk along the English coast. By the 2080s, up to 1.5m homes will be at risk of flooding, with more than 100,000 homes at risk from coastal erosion. In Wales, 104,000 properties are at risk of coastal flooding. The lead author of the CCC report, Jim Hall, says existing plans to protect the coast are unfunded and unrealistic, and that the public are being kept in the dark about the real risks. “The situation on the coast is a timebomb,” he says down the line from Oxford University, where he is professor of climate and environmental risk. “About half the coast of England is protected with sea walls, promenades and other coastal defences. But many of these are reaching the end of their lives. It is just not going to be affordable to continue to protect large stretches of coastline.” Hall argues that the chancellor will have to foot the bill to defend densely populated areas with important industries; he says the CCC’s analysis shows councils are claiming wrongly that they can afford to protect at least 185km of England’s coastline. “Some coastal communities are being told by councils that they can hold the line for part or all of the century,” he says. “But funding for these locations is unlikely.” Hall would like local authorities to lead difficult conversations in these threatened communities, which could include the relocation of existing homes and limiting the approval of new properties. “We need to start making hard choices now,” he says. “This needs to be an inclusive process with some accompanying funding because communities need to be supported if they are going to adapt.” Instead of making impossible promises to build bigger defences, authorities should allow a new coastline to form, to protect communities further inland. “Coastlines are naturally resilient. They roll backwards. Beaches, wetlands, mudflats provide a natural buffer against storms and waves,” Hall says. The Environment Agency’s new flood and coastal erosion strategy for England, published earlier this month, admits its engineers cannot win a war against water and accepts some coastal communities will have to be moved. But it doesn’t propose any funding streams. While rising sea levels will be far more devastating for the millions living in low-lying regions in the developing world, British coastal communities still need help to adapt. “Poor, densely populated, coastal mega-cities like Lagos [in Nigeria] are less able to invest in defences and cope with flooding,” Hall says. “But climate change will create many victims in the UK, too – and we do not have those excuses.” The residents of Fairbourne never expected to be test cases for the capacity of climate change to tear a community apart, but in 26 years’ time they will witness the end of a village that has existed for more than a century. Mike Thrussell, the angling writer, takes a walk along the top of the darkening sea wall. The wind is searing, turning his skin red. He scans the line of homes below and searches for the right way to encapsulate the mood of the village. “It gives you an inner feeling of doom. It is despondency. Everything you do is futile,” he eventually says. “I cannot pass my home on to my son – it is lost. What have I worked for?” But Thrussell knows their pain will soon be felt by others on Britain’s rapidly changing coastline. “It is not just a Fairbourne problem. You’ve got all these other communities in Wales and England – where the hell are they going to go?” • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the science and consensus were solid, then we wouldn’t be having the endless string of failed climate conferences we’ve seen year after year over the last 2 decades. Obviously policymakers have stopped viewing the science as being credible enough on which to base policy.
Clearly policymakers no longer view climate change as threatening. The real threats are indeed economic and financial.
Today Spiegel here writes that there is “little hope of a global worldwide climate treaty” being reached in Doha, Qatar, three weeks from now and that “the chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Ottmar Edenhofer, sees negotiations at a dead-end“.
Over the years there have been plenty of non-binding declarations and empty commitments, and Ottmar Edenhofer doesn’t see anything different happening in Doha: “It looks as if not much is going to come out of Doha. The outlook for a climate treaty at the moment is unfortuately not especially good”.
Spiegel adds:
Economics and climate scientists are especially placing their hopes on ‘linking the emissions trading systems’ in the short term between Europe and Australia, and over long term probably also with China.”
That’s it? Only Europe and Australia are willing to “tackle climate change”? Already Doha is dead even before arrival.
According to Spiegel, Edenhofer also adds that “a reform of the German Feed-in Act is necessary”. “The Energy Feed-In Act cost transfer to consumers is not sustainable over the long-term,” said Edenhofer, and that the current system offers “too little competition to lower the prices and to find the best locations.”
In summary, Edenhofer admits that the German Feed-in Act has been a failure. Finally a step in the right direction.

"A major UK consumer loyalty programme has been criticised by environmental campaigners for making Esso – whose parent company ExxonMobil has been under fire for its track record on climate change – its new fuel partner. Petrol company BP has axed its 16-year partnership with the Nectar loyalty card, which means that from Saturday the 20 million holders of the card – owned by Sainsbury’s – will no longer be able to earn points with BP and will instead pick up Nectar points at Esso-branded sites when filling up their tank. In the biggest single shake-up yet of petrol station loyalty schemes that reflects the turmoil and environmental pressures on the sector, Esso has terminated its partnership with Tesco Clubcard to set up the Esso Nectar scheme. Environmental campaigners have warned that loyalty cards stimulate consumption of damaging fossil fuels, despite a looming government ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2040 and a push to encourage take-up of low-emission electric vehicles. “We have a climate emergency on our hands,” said Rachel Kennerley, a Friends of the Earth climate campaigner. “It’s a completely out-of-touch and backwards step for Nectar to be partnering with some of the world’s biggest polluters.” Paul Morozzo, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “Promoting fossil fuels is always deeply irresponsible. If someone poured bleach on your cornflakes, would you care whether it’s Cif or Domestos?” The world’s biggest international oil company, ExxonMobil is best known in the UK for its Esso and Mobil brands. It is one of the UK’s largest petrol retailers, serving about 800,000 customers every day through a network of 1,100 Esso-branded filling stations. David Chilton, the global loyalty programmes manager at ExxonMobil, said: “Our customers are our number one priority, so we’re very excited to be launching the Esso Nectar partnership.” However, in the US the company has been investigated over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global heating for decades but deceived the public over the risks. The firm has rejected the charge. Its alleged role in spreading misinformation about the climate crisis is being investigated by the European Union. James Moir, the managing director of Nectar Loyalty, said: “We’re always looking for new ways to reward our customers and are thrilled to be offering them the chance to turn their fuel into money off their weekly shop, as well as hundreds of other personalised rewards.” In a raft of other changes in the sector, BP will shortly launch a new loyalty programme for its UK retail business, a network of more than 300 filling stations in the UK and 900 more BP-branded forecourts owned and run by independent dealers. The Shell Drivers’ Club offered cash discounts on fuel or Avios points or Waitrose vouchers. But as of this month, it has launched a new customer loyalty card, Shell Go+, which no longer allows its members to direct their points value towards carbon offset schemes. The two major surviving schemes are Morrisons More and Texaco. “There is a huge shift under way in petrol station loyalty and by the summer the whole landscape will have been changed,” said Anika Newjoto, editor of supermarket rewards website Shopper Points. “This seems to be happening because, frankly, the schemes were not working. Petrol is a very low profit margin business and it seems that the cost of the loyalty points was not proving worthwhile.”"

Eventually the sham is going to give, and the latest letter signed by 50 NASA experts, with more than 1000 years of combined professional experience, is a sure sign the gig’s about over.
…..unproven remarks…..not substantiated…..hundreds of well-known climate scientists…..tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief…..science is NOT settled…..unbecoming of NASA’s history…..advocacy of an extreme position…..damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA…..even the reputation of science itself…”
Letters to the top don’t get any more blunt than that.
And how many tens of billions have these crackpots at GISS cost the taxpayers?
Here’s the letter:
March 28, 2012
The Honorable Charles Bolden, Jr.
NASA Administrator
NASA Headquarters
Washington, D.C. 20546-0001
Dear Charlie,
We, the undersigned, respectfully request that NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) refrain from including unproven remarks in public releases and websites. We believe the claims by NASA and GISS, that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data. With hundreds of well-known climate scientists and tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief in the catastrophic forecasts, coming particularly from the GISS leadership, it is clear that the science is NOT settled.
The unbridled advocacy of CO2 being the major cause of climate change is unbecoming of NASA’s history of making an objective assessment of all available scientific data prior to making decisions or public statements.

As former NASA employees, we feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate. We request that NASA refrain from including unproven and unsupported remarks in its future releases and websites on this subject. At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself.
For additional information regarding the science behind our concern, we recommend that you contact Harrison Schmitt or Walter Cunningham, or others they can recommend to you.
Thank you for considering this request.
Sincerely,
(Attached signatures)

Now if this had been four years ago with the tables turned, I guarantee you the story would be plastered front page for days here in Germany. It’s no secret that the elitist MSM here are still very much in love with Barack Obama and blind to his every blunder.
Today the neo-eco-liberal German elitist media are shell-shocked, dazed, and have no idea what to make of it. It’s far worse than they thought.

And true to their tradition of if the news is inconvenient, then bury it, and if it’s really inconvenient, then ignore it altogether. This is what we are witnessing today. Under no circumstances is the German public to sense that Obama’s political Titanic has struck the dreaded iceberg. The election confirms the Tea Party is for real and is not going away; the political ground has shifted massively in USA and the Democrats are in huge trouble.
I listened to German NDR public radio this morning – not a peep about Walker’s landslide victory. Same goes for the online Die Welt, Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, FOCUS, TAZ, Bild, Süddeutsche, ARD, ZDF, and RTL.
I expect they’ll come out with something later today (It’s afternoon now), once they shrug off their stunned stupor and find a way to spin the story.
Flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), on the other hand, does have a story, half way down its site, titled: Erfolgreicher Stimmungstest für Romney (Successful test vote for Romney). The FAZ writes:
The outcome of the election was a national event, which is said to be of importance for the Presidential and Congressional elections on November 6. Scott Walker.”
And that is as far as the FAZ is going to take it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German daily Die Welt here published a surprisingly anti-alarmist article written by Prof Wolfgang Behringer, a science historian at the University of Saarbrücken.
His conclusion: climate change and ice cap melting (and freezing) are nothing new and that man ought to be grateful it’s warmer, and not be hysterical about it.
Indeed this is the first time in human history where some among us are cursing the warmth. He writes: “The ice at the poles is supposedly melting faster than ever before – but that has occurred many times before. That it’s getting warmer on the planet is good news for man.” (Actually, it hasn’t warmed in over 10 years, but we will go along with Behringer’s overall statement).
Behringer says that so many climate predictions have been shown to be wrong, e.g. more hurricanes because of warming, that climate scientists have adopted a new pattern of argumentation: “The prognosis was wrong, but we are still right.”
Behringer writes that all the horror stories about melting Arctic every August are convenient for journalists for filling in the slow news cycle that is typical during vacation month of August. Warm periods are hardly foreign to the planet. Behringer reminds us: “In the nomenclature of geology, a ‘warm period’ is defined by completely ice-free poles. According to this terminology, we’ve been living in an ice age for a few million years now.”

The warm period of the Holocene over the last 10,000 years (70% of which has been warmer than it is today) has been a blessing for mankind, facilitating the development of agriculture. Behringer cites numerous examples and reminds us that life during the Little Ice Age, let alone the ice age itself, is not anything we would want to go back to.
Behringer then says that the role of the Arctic is minor:

The entire Arctic plays hardly a role. 90 percent of the ice and 70 percent of the world’s fresh water are stockpiled in the Antarctic ice sheet, and it is disputed on whether or not it is growing. At 82.5°C below zero at the top of Antarctic, the risk of melting would appear to be relatively small for even the laymen among us.
As long as it keeps getting warmer, it’s good news. When the Holocene comes to an end, as it was once believed in the 1960s after a few cold years, then we could really be in for the blues. […] With all the consensus on global warming, we are obviously treading on thin ice when it comes to its interpretation.”

Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Behringer teaches at the University of Saarbrücken and is the author of A Cultural History of Climate.

Meteorologist, European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)
(Translated with permission, edited by P Gosselin)
Climate model trends have been providing prognoses (scenarios) for temperatures for the various atmospheric layers for about 2 decades: near the ground surface, troposphere and stratosphere.
According to the CO2 hypothesis, the atmosphere from ground level to the upper troposphere is supposed to warm up while the stratosphere is supposed to cool. However, meteorological measurements show that just opposite is occurring!
Institutes close to the IPCC have been conveying temperature prognoses (scenarios) in the media of spectacular and supposedly dramatic warming trends for surface temperatures for about three decades. However, the atmosphere can not be simply reduced to this relatively thin lower layer, and thus it has to be taken into account as a whole.
Figure 1, above, shows the levels of the atmosphere (image source K.E. Puls).
One atmospheric interaction is that when it gets warmer in the troposphere, it gets colder in the stratosphere – and vice versa.
For this reason there are also considerations and claims by the climate models on how the temperature at various altitudes is supposed to develop according to the AGW CO2 hypothesis.
These involve mainly:
– the lower troposphere
– the upper troposphere (hot spot)
– the stratosphere
1) The Lower Troposphere Model Failure
According to the climate models, global temperatures near the surface are supposed to increase about 3°C during the 21st century: “For the next two decades…a warming of 0.2°C per decade is projected” [1].
But since 1998 there’s been no trace of warming. There hasn’t been any warming in 14 years, despite steadily increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Yet, this did not prevent the IPCC from making the absurd claim:
Progress in modelling…has allowed the specification of very narrow ranges of uncertainty for projected warming….”
But the most recent evaluation of the HADLEY Institute (CRU) up to July 2012 shows that precisely the opposite is true. There’s been a slight cooling over the last 14 years, what many refer to as a temperature plateau:

Figure 2: Global temperature 1850-2012 (Source: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/nh+sh/)
The contradiction becomes even more stark when IPCC prognoses are directly compared to measured temperatures:

Figure 3: IPCC prognosis vs. NASA sat. data (Source: http://wattsupwiththat.com).
2) Upper Troposphere Model Failure
According to the climate models, the upper troposphere is supposed to show a distinct warming, a so-called “hot spot”:
“Theory states that the hot spot is supposed to be created by additional evaporation, and the additional evaporation transports warmer and wetter air to altitudes where cooler and drier air masses once prevailed.” (read here).
But weather balloons have been unable to confirm this, and in fact show that precisely the opposite has occurred!

This also means that all models with a temperature prognosis over 1°C or more because of the “sure” water vapour amplification are falsified. According to the Die kalte Sonne website (www.kaltesonne.de/?p=4803):
Only a few people in the climate discussion are aware that CO2 is not the main driver, and that most of the warming is assigned to the dubious amplification mechanism. CO2 by itself only has a warming potential of 1.1°C per atmospheric concentration doubling. It is only through the theoretical assumption of the up-to-now poorly understood amplification mechanism that the warming gets catapulted by the IPCC to  2.0-4.5°C per CO2 doubling, mainly through water vapour and clouds.”
And:
A coupling between CO2 and water vapour is at this time not detectable.”
3) The Stratosphere Model Failure
The developments and effects of ozone, CO2, and the temperature in the stratosphere have long since been well illustrated by the German Weather Service (DWD) in one of its ozone bulletins [2]. There it is stated:
In the stratosphere…the absorption of sunlight by the plentiful ozone trace gas is the main source of heat. …Naturally the absorbed radiative energy must be given off once again. In the stratosphere this occurs…for the most part through heat radiation into space by CO2 molecules. Therefore CO2 in the atmosphere has a cooling effect, ozone a warming effect!”
And also cited there:
While CO2 in in the atmosphere has increased over the last decades, and ozone in the upper stratosphere (40 km) has reduced by almost 20% since the 1970s, (see Bulletin No. 103), …therefore it has to be expected that the CO2-cooling in the stratosphere would have had to increase over the last years, while ozone warming should have reduced. That means the upper stratosphere should have gotten colder over the last decades! Indeed almost every chemical-climate model, e.g. within the scope of the CCMVAL project (http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/CCMVal/) foresaw a cooling of about 1°C per decade for the upper stratosphere at 40 km .”
The actual measurements in the stratosphere between 1980 and 2008 yield completely different results, and are shown in in Figure 5:

 
The German Weather Service explicitly writes:
While the models show a steady and gradual cooling, the measurements at all stations show an entirely different development: A cooling was indeed the case until the end of the 1980s. Over the last 20 years all the temperatures at practically all the stations have remained more or less steady (exception data from Table-Mountain Lidars).”
According to Figure 5) The DWD writes:
…the gradual cooling of the upper stratosphere computed by the models did not occur over the last 20 years…. Therefore there had to have been changes that have compensated for the expected cooling since 1985, and which were not reproduced by the models.”
Summary
The projected temperature changes forecast by the climate models for the various layers of the atmosphere are all wrong!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following is video of a CNN debate between Marc Morano and Bill Nye. I thought Bill Nye was supposed to be well-informed about science. Boy, was I wrong.

Marc Morano Exposes Bill Nye’s astonishing ignorance of climate science.
It started as soon as Nye opened his mouth at the 1:39 mark, he claimed the Medieval Warm Period and Roman Period were isolated incidents occurring only in Europe. He repeated it again at 2:55.
That claim was already refuted 10 years ago. Since then there have been dozens of studies from every corner of the globe where proxy data clearly show that the aforementioned optimums occurred in cycles WORLDWIDE. Incredibly, Bill Nye thinks that the global temperature was more or less constant before human CO2 emissions. Even Michael Mann no longer believes that.
At the 2:20 mark, Nye then says that the rate of CO2 rise is of great concern. False. What is of concern is CO2’s impact on global warming. All scientists agree that a doubling of CO2 will lead only to about 1 – 1.5°C of warming by itself. CO2’s impact is turning out to be far less than originally feared. In fact “the rapidly rising CO2” has resulted in no global warming in over 15 years!
Then at about the 3:35 Morgan and Nye seem to claim that the climate is directly related to the human population, i.e. when population rises, then temperature rises. Now we are getting a good idea of just how bad Nye and Morgan’s science truly is.

Throughout the debate, Nye and Morgan’s arguments are carried by fear and horror visions. You can’t help but to think they are a bit on the hysterical side.
At the 4:30 mark, Morgan then totally confuses weather with climate. “How do you explain the warm weather today? Why is it we have all this freakish weather just when we have so many people? That’s evidence isn’t it?” The CNN host has now ventured into comedy science. It’s again that psychological affliction of insisting that the world is coming to an end, and not being able to live without that.
At the 6:30 mark it’s the old “precautionary principle” line. It’s a wonder these people ever hop onto a plane or drive a car.
The rest of the debate is pretty much Bill Nye and Piers Morgan neurotically worrying about the phony computer-generated horror scenarios 100 years down the road, and confirm they believe that global temperatures are rising (they aren’t, they’re flat) and that sea level rise is accelerating (it isn’t, in fact it is decelerating).
Finally, I couldn’t help noticing that their primary worry is population growth – for them there are just too many people on the planet. They need more “Lebensraum“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou really have got to worry when the U.S. Secretary of Defense declares a major security threat that isn’t real. History shows that such declarations are often followed by the suspension of civil law to make way for martial law, rationing and curfews.
Casus belli refers to offenses or threats directly against a nation. It can be grounds for suspending elections and democracy until the crisis subsides and stability gets re-established.

Secretary Panetta has an imaginary enemy: developed human society.
Hat-tip: WUWT
Why is Panetta declaring Casus belli? According to Wikipedia’s definition:
Countries need a public justification for attacking another country. This justification is needed to galvanize internal support for the war, as well as gain the support of potential allies.

In the post World War Two era, the UN Charter prohibits signatory countries from engaging in war except 1) as a means of defending themselves against aggression, or 2) unless the UN as a body has given prior approval to the operation. The UN also reserves the right to ask member nations to intervene against non-signatory countries which embark on wars of aggression. In effect, this means that countries in the modern era must have a plausible casus belli for initiating military action, or risk UN sanctions or intervention.”
Human climate change is a national security threat says Secretary Panetta.
He apparently sees a climate Pearl Harbor and probably already has his generals in a war room making plans to seize control of the nation’s vast resources and direct them against the imagined enemy, which this time is domestic and is anyone who emits GHG without a permit or an offset. Martial law in this case would hardly be temporary – as the climate crisis is a long-term affair that will take decades and generations to fix, so we are told. That’s a long time to be under a state of emergency.
Yes, there’s a lot in it for the Secretary of Defense, and it is surely very tempting. Panetta is probably just itching by now to round up people deemed a threat (skeptics) and holding them in camps, like the US did with Japanese-Americans after the Pearl Harbor attack.
Panetta, the number one military man, is treading dangerous territory and anyone concerned about preserving democracy and the rule of law has got to be seriously worried by his paranoid view. It’s one thing to be concerned about climate change, but quite another to view it as casus belli. It’s time to question his psychological stability. When military leaders start fantasizing major threats and insist we mobilize to ward them off, it’s scary.
Clearly climate change is not the real threat to national security. The real threat are leaders who fantasize and have delusions of threats that aren’t real, and who react by publicly declaring a phony national emergency.
Folks, in most places it’s May, sunny, getting warm and the birds are singing and the flowers are blooming. People are outside enjoying themselves, sunbathing. Panetta, on the other hand, is obviously in a climate war room and thinks the sky is falling and the planet is imploding.
Congress needs to look into this.

"Few prospective MEPs will be in the middle of their first year undergraduate exams when hundreds of millions of people across Europe go to the polls later this week. But 19-year-old Londoner Daze Aghaji believes now is the time for her generation to make a stand. “We are at a turning point,” says Aghaji. “This generation can take leadership and make this change happen or we are facing a genuinely terrible future – so I am trying to do something, to be part of a new politics, part of the new world I want to see.”  Aghaji, who is studying history and politics at Goldsmiths University in south London, is standing as a Climate and Ecological Emergency Independent (CEEI) in Thursday’s European elections. The teenager – who has her sights set on breaking open the political system for the next generation, and maybe a new job as one of Europe’s youngest ever MEPs – is one of nine Extinction Rebellion activists who are standing as independents under the CEEI banner.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The teenager is a ball of energy, conviction and warmth as she discusses her campaign over a cup of tea in a south London cafe. “Obviously it would be super cool to win a seat and I would make sure I made it count if that happens,” she says. “But to be honest the likelihood of me winning is pretty small.” When asked how she is managing to combine studying for exams and campaigning, she shrugs: “It is pretty full on. The course is amazing and this – well, this is a lot of work and stress on top of that.” After a brief pause, she adds: “But if not now, then when? What am I going to tell future generations – ‘I knew but I had other things to do, I was a bit busy?’” Born in north London, Aghaji started life in a small one-bedroom flat in Tottenham that she shared with her parents and two siblings. Aged 11, she went away to boarding school after her mum’s Afro-Caribbean restaurant took off. There, she fell in love with nature – and developed a vague but persistent concern that the natural world was struggling. “We are facing the breakdown of everything that we take for granted,” says Aghaji, who is a veteran of the school climate strikes as well as the Extinction Rebellion protests. “This is a chance to help create something really amazing. How could I let that pass by? Aghaji believes there is much more at stake in this week’s elections beyond who wins. The evidence of the scale and severity of the climate emergency is growing. Last year, the UN’s leading scientists warned that there were just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Earlier this month, another UN report warned that the widespread collapse of ecosystems was putting humanity itself at risk. Just last week it emerged that the Antarctic ice is melting much faster than previously feared. “I am here as a young black woman because I want to open that space, I want to show other young people from different backgrounds that we can make a stand, that we can seize this moment and make a difference. It is our future that is on the line.” A recurring critique of Extinction Rebellion and other environment movements has focused on their lack of diversity, both in terms of race and class. Aghaji, who says that since her mother’s restaurant took off she became part of a “new middle class” acknowledges there is a problem. “There is such an image here of black people not being involved in environmental stuff but if you look more globally then not only are they involved, they have been leading on this stuff for decades … We need to break that stigma of it being so white [in the UK].” She says the climate crisis is “an issue of class, of race, of age”, with “the poorest being hit the worst”. To get that message across, the CEEI has been holding workshops and events on housing estates across London – where seven out of the nine candidates are standing. “We are really trying to get out there into communities … starting conversations with people … people you wouldn’t see as ordinary environmentalists, but the reaction has been amazing, people really do care.” Over the past few months Aghaji says there has been a breakthrough in public understanding of the climate emergency, helped by the success of Extinction Rebellion, the school strike movement and the BBC’s David Attenborough documentary Climate Change – The Facts. And she says the younger generation – many even younger than her – are a growing source of hope and inspiration. “You can feel the soul, the passion running through the young people that are involved. Looking at the school strikes, I am happy that they are the next generation because they get this and they are on it … you don’t need to tell them how bad it is because they already know.” However, she acknowledges the challenges are huge. The climate crisis is not, she says, simply an environmental issue, it will have devastating consequences if unchecked, from food shortages to resource wars, the collapse of political and social systems to mass movements of people. But as she finishes her tea she insists there is still time to act. “I am a hopeless romantic,” says Aghaji with a smile. “This is a huge moment for this generation. If we get this right we can look back in 20 or 30 years and say we did a good job. We still have the chance to create something exciting out of this moment but that window is closing.”"
"The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world. Instead of “climate change” the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”, although the original terms are not banned.  “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,” said the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” “Increasingly, climate scientists and organisations from the UN to the Met Office are changing their terminology, and using stronger language to describe the situation we’re in,” she said. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, talked of the “climate crisis” in September, adding: “We face a direct existential threat.” The climate scientist Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a former adviser to Angela Merkel, the EU and the pope, also uses “climate crisis”. In December, Prof Richard Betts, who leads the Met Office’s climate research, said “global heating” was a more accurate term than “global warming” to describe the changes taking place to the world’s climate. In the political world, UK MPs recently endorsed the Labour party’s declaration of a “climate emergency”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. Other terms that have been updated, including the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. In September, the BBC accepted it gets coverage of climate change “wrong too often” and told staff: “You do not need a ‘denier’ to balance the debate.” Earlier in May, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has inspired school strikes for climate around the globe, said: “It’s 2019. Can we all now call it what it is: climate breakdown, climate crisis, climate emergency, ecological breakdown, ecological crisis and ecological emergency?” The update to the Guardian’s style guide follows the addition of the global carbon dioxide level to the Guardian’s daily weather pages. “Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have risen so dramatically – including a measure of that in our daily weather report is symbolic of what human activity is doing to our climate,” said Viner in April. “People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.”"
"On 20 August 2018, Greta Thunberg, then aged 15, did not attend her first day back at school after the summer holidays. Instead, she made a sign that read “School strike for climate change” and stood in front of the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, demanding the government reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris climate agreement. Her protest sparked the international movement Fridays for Future, in which schoolchildren around the world skip class to insist their governments take urgent action to halt the ongoing climate crisis. Since then, Thunberg has given a TED talk on the subject, been named one of the world’s most influential teens by Time magazine, and been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. After she addressed the Houses of Parliament in April, MPs endorsed Jeremy Corbyn’s call to declare a climate emergency, aiming to “set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the globe”. Thunberg first became concerned with the climate crisis aged eight after learning about it in school. By the age of 11, she had fallen into a state of severe depression about the world, which led her to stop talking and eating. She has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism, and has said that being on the spectrum has been in some ways an advantage, “as almost everything is black or white”. Thunberg has taken part in protests around the world and to save on carbon emissions she does not travel by plane, doing most of her travelling by train; she is also a vegan. On 30 May, Penguin will publish No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference, the collected speeches of Thunberg, and later in the year will publish Scenes from the Heart, the story of the Thunberg family (all earnings will be donated to charity). On 7 July, the Observer New Review will publish an interview with Thunberg in which readers ask the questions.

The Climate Team has always claimed that a doubling of CO2 would add 3.7 Watts/m2 to the global climate budget and thus this would fry us all. This fate is their religion’s version of Hell, except we will all suffer this rather than just the “sinners,” thus giving them leverage to force us to do their will. Many bloggers, and some others, notably even BEST, have pointed out that there are many locations that are cooling rather than warming. The warmists would have us believe that these cooling stations are just due to local phenomenon, such as albedo change, land use, site moves, or other changes, and that the warming stations are not due to UHI.
Last year, Willis Eschenbach took a look at Modtran. Modtran is a program that was initially developed by the US Air Force in the late 1980’s that does a line-by-line analysis of the IR spectrum transmitted by the atmosphere. An on-line version is available at the University of Chicago, here. Willis noted that none of the latitude selections would give a CO2 doubling figure higher than 3.2 Watts/m2. He didn’t notice that the default settings in the program include a setting for water vapor at a pressure setting of 1. Any water vapor in the spectrum will lower the CO2 doubling figure.
Here is the result of calculating the outbound long-wave radiation (OLR) or as it is labeled in Modtran, I out. The settings used were: CH4 – 1.8 pmm, Tropical Ozone 800 ppb, Strat. Ozone 1, Ground T offset – 15°C, hold water vapor – Relative Humidity, Water Vapor Scale – at 0, 10, 50, and 90 percent, Locality – 1976 U. S. Standard Atmosphere, No Clouds or Rain, Sensor altitude 100 km, Looking Down. These values were the best available to represent a global average. This produced the following table and chart for various CO2 and water vapor values.
 
 Table 1 is TOA OLR for CO2 values from 0 to 1000 ppm and RH at 0, 10, 50, and 90%.
 
Figure 1 is a chart of Modtran output for 0, 10, 50, and 90% humidity, and CO2 from 0 to 1000 ppm. The radiation (vertical) scale has been inverted so that increasing greenhouse warming is upward. Note that both CO2 and water vapor forcing are logarithmic; increasing amounts have decreasing effect.

With humidity set to zero, the doubling of CO2 figure actually goes to 4.7 W/m2. Any reasonable humidity value drops that number drastically. At 50% humidity, and our current CO2 value, we get a tiny 0.188 W/m2, far, far below the IPCC favored value. Of course humidity doesn’t stay constant. In the tropics, 90% is more typical. In that case, doubling CO2 gets us 0.125 W/m2. This is all before the additional factors of clouds and rain, which will drop the value even further, into the negative territory that Willis noticed here. The blue triangle in the chart and the blue value in the table are the current values with today’s CO2 and global average humidity.
Given the data, Modtran can compute the real outbound radiation over time. The humidity at 600 mbars and the Mauna Loa CO2 values were applied through Modtran to result in Figure 2. This is a “zoom in” on the blue triangle in figure 1, adding the time dimension. The 600 mbar level for humidity seemed a good compromise, as only one humidity figure could be entered.

Figure 2 is a chart of the outbound radiation increase since 1948. There has been a more than 1 Watt/m2 increase in outbound radiation in that interval, despite rising CO2.
Humidity has been decreasing in the upper atmosphere over the last 60 years. That offsets the rising CO2. We saw the cooling in the 70’s but increased solar radiation along with ocean cycles held off the cooling over the last 20 years. That period has now come to an end.
Mother Earth has an excellent thermostat system. Even if somehow average humidity should increase to 50% and CO2 goes to 1000 ppm, only about 2 Watts/m2 will be added. This is unlikely in the extreme, and would add a small fraction of a degree to warming. No one would notice.
My question is: Why have the professional “climatologists” not done the simple work that I did on a lazy Saturday afternoon with my laptop? They must know that water vapor nearly wipes out CO2 in warming the Earth, and that clouds and albedo do the rest. What’s their excuse for this massive “oversight”?

"It’s safe to observe the 2019 election was not a good election for the climate. The basic facts speak for themselves. A government with a suboptimal policy was returned for another term, and Labor will now go through another, likely painful, round of recalibration of its climate offering. It’s unlikely Labor will stage a dramatic retreat from climate action, but there will certainly be an internal push to temper the current policy with an eye to regional sensibilities, and by regional sensibilities I mean the sensibilities of coal communities.  While Saturday night’s result isn’t what the country or the climate needs – a government, apparently without the will to tackle the problem, back in power for three years, and an opposition licking its wounds, wondering how long it can keep going to elections championing climate action, and losing – it would be a mistake to conclude the issue is now completely off the agenda. Climate change in Canberra remains a movable feast. Let’s examine the dynamics inside the government. It’s absolutely true that the pro-coal faction in Queensland will be emboldened, courtesy of Saturday’s positive election result, and will have zero interest in internal arguments in favour of strengthening the government’s existing climate policy framework. By some accounts, the north Queensland triumphalism currently extends to the resources minister, Matt Canavan, making a play to combine the energy and resources portfolios in Scott Morrison’s upcoming ministerial reshuffle, expected on Sunday. But Liberals in safe seats who suffered negative swings on Saturday night for two reasons – because of the government’s climate change policy, and because of concerns the party has pitched too far to the right – will want Morrison to use his authority to move the dial positively on climate change. We’ve heard a lot about the Queensland swing since Saturday night, but the fact is two things happened in the recent election campaign for the Coalition. The first is the government’s support for the Adani coalmine helped shore up the Liberal National party in central Queensland (even though if you look closely at the results, voters didn’t swing en masse to the incumbents, they parked a protest vote with One Nation and Clive Palmer that flowed back to the Coalition); and the second is voter concern about climate change forced the Liberal party to spend significant resources defending safe seats that could have been better directed to contests elsewhere. Morrison has to balance two political realities, not one, and some Liberals believe it would be a catastrophic mistake for the government post-election to imagine the whole of Australia possesses the resting sensibilities of coal communities in Queensland, when the campaign field evidence suggests otherwise. MPs who favour rebalancing believe Morrison has been handed a significant opportunity during this term in government to try to neutralise climate change as an electoral negative for the Coalition. The view is if Morrison can use his authority to execute the necessary pivot, that potentially sets the Coalition up for a long stint in government. Some colleagues say Morrison has the capacity to recalibrate not only because of his enhanced internal authority post-election but because he was not a frontline protagonist in the internal climate wars of the past decade. The spiritual leader of the internal opposition to climate action, Tony Abbott, is also out of the parliament, which improves the prospects of managing a shift; not immediately, but over the course of the coming term. Notwithstanding his explicit commitment on the hop during the campaign to keep Melissa Price in the environment portfolio post-election, Morrison would be smart to elevate a senior moderate to the portfolio who can carry the message – perhaps Simon Birmingham. It would also be smart to project more positivity about the transition to low emissions energy sources, the positivity the Coalition has been reluctant to project for fear of offending Alan Jones or the reactionary right rump. Some Liberals argue the government needs to reframe the transition to low emissions as an opportunity for Australia, not a cost – which was the negative territory Morrison prosecuted through much of the election in an effort to curb any momentum from the Labor campaign. Of course all of this is just talk at the present time. We are a distance short of any concrete action that would give anybody heart, and even if Morrison is inclined to see climate change as a frontline issue where the Liberal party can be seen to be pitching its tent in the political centre, or can be persuaded to that end – any movement on emissions reduction mechanisms would be heavily contested internally. When we move from the point of generalities to specifics, supporters of better policy in the government are completely candid. They don’t know what the new policy mechanism should be. It would be very hard to revive Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee, even though that would be sensible, given the implosion of 2017. It is also hard to propose more ambitious targets without all hell breaking loose internally. But it is possible, some think, to build in review structures over the coming term which point to a ratcheting up of ambition."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe all know that Romney is wishy-washy when it comes climate change science, and that us so-called skeptics were not at ease with that. Well, now you can cast your worries aside.
Over the last hours there’s been a lot of buzz out in the media that Paul Ryan has been chosen as Romney’s running mate. Confirmation of that is still pending. If true, that means we have a VP candidate who is a pretty solid skeptic when it comes to catastrophic manmade global warming. Romney is obviously comfortable with that and is using Ryan to reposition himself on the issue of global warming and energy.
What is Ryan’s position on climate science? Here’s what Paul Ryan wrote less than 3 years ago:
To the detriment of the American people, environmental issues have fallen victim to the hyper-politicization of science. The Journal Times editorial board sensibly cautioned both sides of the political divide against this unfortunate trend (“Science must trump spin,” The Journal Times, 12/3/09). At issue in the Journal Times’ recent editorial and on the minds of many Copenhagen observers are published e-mail exchanges from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU). These e-mails from leading climatologists make clear efforts to use statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change. The CRU e-mail scandal reveals a perversion of the scientific method, where data were manipulated to support a predetermined conclusion. The e-mail scandal has not only forced the resignation of a number of discredited scientists, but it also marks a major step back on the need to preserve the integrity of the scientific community. While interests on both sides of the issue will debate the relevance of the manipulated or otherwise omitted data, these revelations undermine confidence in the scientific data driving the climate change debates.”
Here’s a list of Ryan’s other climate and energy accomplishments:
– voted to eliminate EPA Limits On Greenhouse Gases. [Roll Call 249, 4/7/11].
– voted to block the USDA from implementing its climate raindance. [Roll Call 448, 6/16/11].

– voted to eliminate the ban of incandescent light bulbs. [Roll Call 563, 7/12/11]

– Paul Ryan’sFY 2013 budget resolution retained a decade’s worth of oil tax breaks worth $40 billion, while slashing subsidies in alternative energy research. The plan called for a $3 billion cut in energy programs in FY 2013 alone. [CAP, 3/20/12].

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf there ever was a sign that the issue of climate change is struggling with irrelevance in Europe, and thus has lost its global leadership force, it can be found in this candid (frustrated) view expressed in the Austrian STANDARD: “Disinterest in Climate Change” by Eric Frey.
“Despite Sandy, global warming is a fringe issue in the USA – unfortunately also for Europe.”
In the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, Europeans were quick to scorn America for its lack of interest in protecting the climate. Many blamed the storm on CO2 emissions. Europeans were angered by and indignant at the fact that the issue had not been worth mentioning once during the presidential campaign.
But as Eric Frey of the Austrian Standard writes: Europeans ought to first look at home before criticizing others abroad.
He writes:
Before Europeans express too much outrage over the Americans, they should look at what’s going on at their own doorstep instead. Also here interest in climate protection has gone lame. Euro-crisis, recession, unemployment – with such a terrible economic situation, n one is protesting on behalf of the environment. […]  Emissions trading has no teeth, as certificates cost next to nothing.
Climate protection has no lobby. Even the greens no longer consider it a core issue. […] Thus the upcoming climate conference in Qatar will achieve no progress. The price will be paid by millions of people on all continents – in New Jersey as in Africa. […] The only hope lies in a surprsing technological breakthrough. Ironically, the best news for climate protection comes from the USA: The increasing production of shale gas is replacing dirty coal and is allowing America’s CO2 emissions to fall. That may bring some relief, but it is certainly not a solution.”
There’s nothing else to add.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDear P Gosselin.
Thank you for your consideration.  I appreciate the opportunity to be heard. Due to the numbers of polar bears on land this season, I am busy with filming and away from the internet.  My reply is not as prompt as it otherwise could be.
When I read that zoos are to be considered the key to polar bears’ survival and at the same time find that there is no discussion of sanctuary, I have to seriously question the dollars, the funding and the intent behind the “zoo” message.
While polar bears that land on eastern Canadian shores are shot and killed, while the polar/grizzly hybrids are shot and killed as soon as they are discovered, while polar bears are hazed and harassed across the Alaskan coast (leading to extreme stress and mortality); in the absence of any sanctuary, alternative habitat, or effort to repopulate traditional polar bear-land habitats, I have to seriously question what kind of “conservation” is really happening.  Zoos?  If this is the present course and it remains unchecked, I have to think we all are in danger.
Just to be clear, my statement that polar bears can survive climate change but for man’s greed, does not translate to “… not threatened by climate change.”  Certainly, if not for the decline in sea ice, polar bears would have a better future.  The contraction of polar bear populations will indeed follow the loss of sea ice habitat.  The survival of a great many bears will be threatened.  This threat is a “clear and present danger” directly attributable to climate induced sea ice reduction.
Polar bear extinction, however, is not a climate issue but is electively driven by human, political, policy and government action.  If the true nature of polar bear ecology was acknowledged and pan-arctic land sanctuaries were established, polar bears would survive climate change and continue as a viable species on Earth.  As long as the current course of “drowning polar bears” and “sea ice or death” rhetoric preempts the truth, polar bears will have little to no chance for survival.
Re: Ed’s response
Nuclear Genomic Sequences Reveal that Polar Bears Are an Old and Distinct Bear Lineage , Hailer 2012 – is the most recent study of polar bear evolution. Polar bears are an older species, not of “recent origin”, and they are distinct from brown bears, not evolved from within the subset of brown bear genetics. While Hailer suggests a date range of 338,000 to 934,000 years ago for polar bear divergence, additional studies by Yu and Krause support a divergence date of 600,000 to 1.3 million years ago. The consensus resides in 600,000 to 1 million years ago.
What has confused some of the science and resulted in the “recent origin” theory, is the denial of hybrid events taking place between polar bears and brown bears.  I say “some”,  because not all scientists, as well myself, had discounted hybridization as the account for the “confusion”.  Coyne, in “Do Polar Bears Really Exist?”, stated the brown/polar bear mtDNA profile could likely be a result of hybridization and cautioned the interpretation of mtDNA as represented in Lindqvist.  The Lindqvist study of the Svalbard jaw bone fossil flat out refuted hybrid events as being relevant and incorrectly determined the answer to the mtDNA question to be resolved with polar bears to be of recent origin.  Well, five recently dead grizz/polar bear hybrids of various stages, speaks to a truth that Lindqvist would now have to consider.

The ABC brown bears of Alaska have yet to be addressed directly, but I believe they too are a population descended from the hybrid crossing of polar bears and browns as was the Irish brown bear population.  What we are seeing play out in real time, here in today’s Arctic, speaks to an insight into previous hybrid events and lends a credibility that far out weighs theory and speculation.  It is happening now, it happened in Ireland…
From Smith –  No Ice, No Choice   2012
“35,000 years ago, amidst the last great ice age, Ireland experienced a warming, an “interstadial,” that raised temperatures to within one degree of its modern day climate. Glaciers began to melt and the Irish Sea ice retreated. Polar bears came to land at 50ºN and survived a period nearly 20ºC warmer than today’s arctic. It was this warming, the Castlepook Interstadial, that forced the range of polar bears to overlap with that of Irish brown bears. Contrary to the notion that glacial periods represent a uniformly intact cryosphere, localized warming events can occur, leading to sea ice retreat, the “forced landing” of polar bears, and climate-induced species convergence.  In studying the fossil record of this period, researchers in Ireland recently confirmed that a 32,000-year old brown bear fossil was discovered to actually belong to a polar/grizzly hybrid.⁠  This hybridization challenges the idea that, during a glacial period, polar bears exist exclusive of land. The extent to which polar bears have experienced forced landings, and the extent to which this reflects upon their ability to cope with change, becomes directly related to their age as a species.”
More than one million years before the Castlepook Interstadial, the Mid Pleistocene Transition occurred, (700,000 to 1.2 million years ago).  This shift in glaciation periods from a 41,000 year to 100,000 year glacial-interglacial cycles, took place concurrent with the “polar bear emergence interval” of 600,000 to 1.2 million years ago.  CO2 records show that from +- 620,000 to 800,000 years ago, a glacial period of extreme cold and duration occurred, far exceeding any of the glacial periods that followed in the next 600,000 years.  It is the very nature of the Pleistocene cryosphere that led to the emergence of polar bears as a species.
While polar bears are here and have clearly survived, what may never be known is to what extent and frequency that “interstadials” took place within the glacial periods, similar to the Castlepook event in the British Isles.  When the cyrosphere occupied much of the northern hemisphere, arctic environments and polar bears existed in temperate latitudes, as did Ireland’s.  These bears and their environment were much more subject to localized and regional climate variation than an arctic confined to high latitudes as in today’s world (until now).  It is exactly the occurrence of these interstadials, along with interglacial periods that have repeatedly and continuously brought the polar bear to land and in contact with the brown bear.  This repeated contact and hybridization has led to the continued ability of the the two species to produce fertile offspring nearly 1 million years after divergence.  (This relationship does not preclude the polar bear from retaining its’ status as a distinct species.)
Despite the course of nature, natural selection and the process of evolution, polar/grizzly hybrids have been characterized as a threat to polar biodiversity, that species are “imperiled” by interbreeding.  Citing no studies, no facts, no “science” to support (an unnamed) science article, the significance of the hybrid genetic exchange between polar bears and browns seems to be less relegated to science than it is to personal opinion. (What would Darwin say?)  The forced landing of polar bears may lead to population “bottlenecks”, (referred to by Hailer).  But, the role polar bear/brown bear hybrids have played in the survival of polar bears as a species, and the answer to “bottlenecks” may never be known.  If the prevailing attitude is to replace science with opinion, and today’s polar/grizzly hybrids remain unprotected and shot on sight, then, maybe Zoos are the answer.
Thank you again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy takes a look at how Germany’s experimental taxpayer-paid “energy-efficient home” is doing.  The home is a project by the German Federal Ministry for Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (BMVBS). As you can see, it leaves little to be desired aesthetically.

The ugly-duckling energy self-sustainable home that isn’t. Erected in Berlin. Price tag: € 2.2 million
The home was opened by Chancellor Angela Merkel late last year amid much media pomp and ceremony and is intended to serve as a model for clean, environmentally responsible living. Strangely, Merkel has recently cut back solar subsidies specifically designed to achieve the aims of the house.
==========================================
The energy efficiency home – the latest act of foolery
by Michael Clemens for EIKE
In the story of the fools of Schilda, the citizen fools built a city hall but forgot the windows. So they put sunlight inside bags and carried it inside. Now a new episode of the fools of Schilda has been written in Berlin. Today’s fools are in a state of panic over the world’s energy reserves and dangerous atomic radiation. And so they’ve built a house that produces more energy than it can use and is supposed to fulfill the dream of “100% supplied by renewable energy”.
When it comes to transforming its energy supply, no cost is too high for the German government. As a flagship project, the shimmering blue “Efficiency Plus with Electromobility” was ceremoniously opened on 7 December 2011 by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Federal Minsiter, and has been recently occupied by a test family.
Federal Minister Peter Ramsauer said, “We want to show people that a completely renewable energy supply is already possible today and is an every-day thing. Our motto: ‘My home is my petrol station.’ The house should not and will not stay a prototype: What we are presenting here is the home of the future.“
In a brochure issued by the Federal Ministry for Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (BMVBS), we find the following technical information, data and claims:
The surplus energy the house produces is stored in a house battery and in an electric car, which acts both as a storage and user of energy. Both home and mobility are thus independent of the power grid.
The house is ecologically sustainable, fully recyclable and highly energy-efficient. No fossil fuels based energies are needed and no CO2 emissions are caused.”

The monthly energy need is given by the following chart:

But a check of the data yields a different picture
Misrepresented in the chart of energy demand given by the BMVBS is the monthly power generation of the photovoltaic system. In the wintertime when you have the highest demand for electricity and power, only 10% of the energy needed is generated. Using the monthly averages for PV generation in the region of Berlin in 2011, the following monthly energy budget results:

Thus the house is not energy independent and self-sufficient. By taking a close look at the daily amounts one sees that in the winter months the photovoltaic system delivers no energy. The planned batereries with a capacity of 40 kWh barely suffices to cover the night in the summertime. The necessary capacity for the wintertime would have to be more than 100 times greater, i.e. 4500 kWh (approx. 30% of the annual need). For this no technology is in sight.
The heat pump and electromobility increase the winter peak demand for electricity by a factor of 4 with respect to purely conventional power need. The niche technology of photovoltaics cannot replace a single kilowatt of power plant output.
The price tag for the”energy efficiency home” is pegged at 2.2 million EUR.
With this BMVBS project, the day-in and day-out supply of energy and independence from the power grid is an illusion. A layman cannot recognize that it merely exists in a worthless annual energy balance and that there often shortfalls at various times of the year.
Indeed the house proves the opposite: it is not energy independent. Despite the massive deployment of resources and technology, the laws of physics could not be ignored and the supply of renewable energy suffices only for a shed in the summertime.
The energy efficiency house is a symbol of a failed energy policy. It represents misguidance and deception of the citizens by ideologues, lobbyists, media and politicians, as well as a huge waste of resources.

"Emissions from fossil fuels and volcanoes can explain nearly all of the changes in Earth’s surface temperatures over the past 140 years, a new study has found. The research refutes the popular climate denial myth that recent global warming is merely a result of natural cycles.  Those arguments have always suffered a key physical flaw, namely that cycles are cyclical. For example, El Niño events, which temporarily raise global surface temperatures by bringing warm water up to the shallow ocean layer, are offset by La Niña events, which have the opposite effect. While a given decade might have more El Niño or La Niña events, resulting in a short-term surface warming or cooling, over the long term their effects cancel out. However, climate scientists have had a difficult time explaining exactly what caused a warming event in the early 20th century, between about 1910 and 1945. The average of the climate model runs incorporated in the last IPCC report only accounted for about half of the measured global surface warming trend during that period, and a study published last year suggested the other half could be due to natural cycles. Contrarian scientists like Judith Curry, who is frequently invited by Republicans to testify before US Congress, have often used this discrepancy to cast doubt on the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, arguing that “until we can explain the early 20th century warming, I have little confidence IPCC and [National Climate Assessment] attribution statements regarding the cause of the recent warming.” The new study, published in the Journal of Climate, tackles the discrepancy in part by addressing an issue with ocean temperature data during the second world war, when measurements were more often made from warmer engine room intakes than from buckets lowered over the side of ships. This has resulted in a bias, inflating estimated surface temperatures in the early-to-mid 1940s. The new study removed this bias by focusing on temperatures along continental and island coastlines. Arctic temperature data has also long been problematic. There are relatively few temperature monitoring stations in the region due to its remoteness, but due largely to disappearing sea ice decreasing the region’s reflectivity, the Arctic is the fastest-warming part of the planet. Two of the co-authors of the new study, Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way, previously made strides in addressing these coverage gaps by using improved statistical interpolation methods. The new study goes further, by incorporating Met Office Hadley Centre Arctic sea ice data.  Accounting for the area of Arctic ocean covered by sea ice is an important factor, as lead author Karsten Haustein explains: “If sea ice is treated as ocean, the temperature cannot go below zero (per definition). If it is treated as land, the temperature can fall as low as -50C in winter given there is virtually no interaction with the ocean water anymore. Since warming trends over the Arctic are higher than anywhere else, overall land warming trends will be higher too if sea ice is treated as land. This is by virtue of winter temperatures not falling as low as they used to anymore.” The authors then compared the improved global surface temperature data to climate model runs incorporating influences from human greenhouse gas and aerosol pollution, volcanic eruptions, and changes in solar activity. Overall they were able to explain more than 90% of the temperature variation over the 140-year record. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  They found that the 0.4C warming from 1910 to 1945 could be accounted for by 0.2C warming from human greenhouse gases offset by 0.08C cooling from human aerosol pollution, 0.2C warming from natural factors (mostly a quiet period for volcanic activity plus a small contribution from increased solar activity), and a bit of natural variability plus some remaining uncertainty in the data. Since 1950, the authors found that the 0.8C temperature rise is due to 1.2C warming from greenhouse gases offset by 0.3C cooling from human aerosol pollution and 0.1C cooling from volcanoes and the sun. These findings are important because they improve global surface temperature estimates, explain the causes of the early-20th century warming, and reaffirm that as the IPCC concluded in 2013, humans are responsible for all of the rapid global heating since 1950."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Dutch province of North Holland has realised that windparks are a complete and useless eyesore that blight the landscape, and they save very little CO2. Therefore, the province has decided to forbid their construction. Hat-tip Science Skeptical here.
The North Holland region would seem to be ideally situated to take advantage of the windy North Sea. Indeed it would be difficult to find a more suitable spot for windmills. So if windparks there don’t make sense, what does that tells us about other places? Read here (in Dutch).
As a result, 20 planned windparks have been recently forbidden. Only a single planned token windpark in the Wieringermeer may be built.
The senselessness of the wild construction of weather-dependent windparks is revealed by a Dutch study here. Science Skeptical writes that experts “found out that the real fuel savings, and thus the reduction in CO2 output, is a whole 1.6% of the windpark’s rated capacity.”
Adding it all up, one must conclude that under the present conditions in the Netherlands a 100 MW (Megawatt) ‘name plate’ capacity wind development produces on average 23 MW because of the capacity factor. 4,6 MW (20%) of this has to be subtracted from the final net result because of initial energy investments. From the actual Statline production figures we know that 27% of this 23 MW = 6,17 MW represents the actual fossil fuel and CO2 savings. But from this figure we need to subtract the amount of energy invested in the construction works: 4,6 MW. The net total of fuel saving electricity provided by our wind turbines therefore is 6.17 – 4.6 = 1.57 MW on average over the year. That is ~ 1.6% of the installed capacity. It makes wind developments a mega money pit with virtually no merit in terms of the intended goal of CO2 emission reduction or fossil fuel saving.
This conclusion needs to be made known to anyone thinking about installing a windpark.

"Saving bees and other insects is indeed a vital goal for the world (Journal, 18 May). Farming practices do need to change and there are many innovative farmers in the UK who are working hard to improve biodiversity as they provide food for the nation. We need to ensure that new policies encourage good practice and support farmers. Regenerative farming using diverse crop rotations, no-till planting, use of indigenous seeds and management of livestock grazing to reproduce natural landscape management can reduce or eliminate the need for pesticides and artificial fertilisers while restoring healthy soil. But the transition can take years before the farmers reap the benefits.  We must fight not only for funding set-aside land for wildlife, but for research into natural management of pests like flea beetle and black grass, valorising agricultural waste more effectively, financing training and infrastructure for farmers, and rewarding innovation. This also means the willingness for consumers to buy more local and seasonal food, eat less but higher-welfare meat, waste less and pay premium prices for higher-quality food rather than cheap imports. If we value farmers as custodians of our land, they will respond by making it a better place for all of us, insect and human.Dr Jean McKendreeStockholm Environment Institute,University of York • Congratulations on your article on how the Guardian is changing the way it talks about climate (Report, 18 May).

"Recycling steel could provide a much-needed lifeline for the UK’s troubled steel industry, a new study has found, and have the added benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two-thirds of the steel currently used is made from primary production, and most of the remainder comes from off-cuts of the steel-making process, rather than recycled goods. The UK does not currently use all the scrap steel produced in the country, but global stocks of recyclable steel are expected to rise sharply in the coming decades.  A new report predicts that the potential for recycling steel is such that the need for primary production could diminish to near zero in the next 30 years. That would save vast quantities of carbon, in part because electric arc furnaces – used for recycling steel – are much more energy efficient than blast furnaces, which produce new steel from iron ore. Prof Julian Allwood, professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge, and author of the report, said: “We must move our UK steel-making industry away from primary production towards recycled steel, made with sustainable power. “This green steel model is the only future compatible with our goals for zero emissions. The UK, with its strong climate policy, mature stocks of steel, and great history of innovation in materials science and processing, is perfectly placed to be world-leading with a sustainable steel industry.” Steel goods last an average of 35 to 40 years before they are scrapped, and the UK generates about 10m tonnes of scrap a year. Currently, about 80% of this is exported for processing to other countries, chiefly Turkey and China. The US, by contrast, meets about half of its demand for steel by recycling. Steel production in the UK is about 7m tonnes a year, or less than half of current demand. Recycling steel could make the UK self-sufficient in steel, as well as providing a new industry, the report says. It also calls for an export tariff on scrap steel to encourage the recycling of steel within the UK, as well as better waste management which would allow for improved collection rates and the separation and recycling of steel scrap products. Government support is likely to be needed, but the regenerated steel industry would soon pay for itself, the report found. The steel industry is responsible for about 5% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, making it one of the highest-emitting industrial sectors, alongside concrete. In the UK, emissions from steel were about 17m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available in the report. If steel imports were included, that figure would rise to about 26m tonnes of carbon dioxide. Those emissions could be reduced by about three-quarters by employing recycling technology, the report found, but the way in which the government accounts for carbon emissions currently means recyclers are penalised compared with primary steel producers. The report also calls for more research and development into steel recycling and scrap metal, which could help to ensure the metals are turned into high-value components rather than simply melted down into cheap ingots for export. Impurities in recycled steel can prevent this, but better manufacturing and recycling methods would allow for impurities to be removed, and the resulting steel put to higher-value uses. Allwood said such a restructuring would create long-term green jobs and lead to exportable skills and technology, as well as creating a new value for products that are currently undervalued or unvalued. “We can do this with less than half the emissions of making steel with iron ore, and with more renewable energy this could drop much further. This will not happen overnight, but the process has already begun. With private investment and government support, our steel-making industry can once again lead the world and thrive.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen scientists drift away from research and involve themselves with religious groups in order to focus on the mission of reshaping society, then you’ve got to wonder. Was that the original idea of our tax money?
Today, scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are claiming that the Green Economy has the potential of destroying the progress that has been made over the last 10 years, so writes alarmist site Klimaretter here. You read that right.
This does not mean the PIK has changed its mind. To the contrary, it simply views the current path to Green as being totally inadequate and that a much more radical one has to embarked on.
PIK chief economics scientist Ottmar Edenhofer has warned of failure for the upcoming Rio+20 conference, which is taking place in 2 weeks:
“We’ve got to start opposing the Green Economy.The Green Economy paradigm has the potential to destroy the progress of the last ten years. We’ve got to destroy the illusion that a few actions in energy efficiency and renewable energies at national levels will be enough to reduce the emissions to the necessary extent. We’ve got to oppose the ‘big proclamation’ of the Green Economy. What we need is a ‘big proclamation’ of Justice.”
For Edenhofer, the issue is not about climate change at all – it’s about social justice and redistribution. Edenhofer now demands:
The atmosphere must not be viewed as a free territory, but as a global common whose ownership and usage rights have to be negotiated. Distribution conflicts here are inevitable, and thus strong international agreements are needed.”
According to UNEP, global economic growth in the future must not be powered by fossil fuels fossil in order to stabilize the climate, protect the environment and to maintain species diversity.
But as Klimaretter writes, the opposite is now actually happening:
Indeed today we are experiencing a Renaissance in the use of fossil energies instead: The rising price of oil and gas has not only led to a Renaissance in coal, but is also making the tapping of unconventional oil and gas reserves lucrative. The international Energy Agency (IEA) is already celebrating the ‘Golden Age of gas supply’.”

So much for the shortage of energy we are always told about. The problem today is actually an oversupply of energy. Edenhofer criticizes:
Over the past years we have limited ourselves too much to the topics of energy efficiency and renewable energies. Here we have under-estimated the supply side of fossil energies.”
That energy surplus problem has to be dealt with. So Klimaretter chimes in:
With respect to the amounts of coal, oil and gas into consideration that are still in the ground, an effective restriction of their extraction is needed.”
For Edenhofer the whole climate issue gets down to one objective: justice. And to move to that target, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, an organisation that claims to be scientific, has taken an unusual step: working together with environmental NGOs and religious groups. Klimaretter reports that (my emphasis added):
…the PIK together with development aid organisation Misereor are asking that sustainability focus more on the questions of justice. Energy efficiency and renewable energies here are not enough. One thing is clear: If we are to take climate protection seriously, then the fossil fuel industry must lose.
To get the debate rolling, Edenhofer and his colleagues of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research have entered an unusual alliance. Over three years the scientists have been grappling with the relationship between climate change and development policy. To do this they brought NGO representatives on board – and also a partner of the Jesuit-founded Institute for Society Munich, Catholic development aid organisation Misereor and Munich Re reinsurer. The result of the cooperation: a book called “Climate Change, Justice, and Sustainability”. The book’s main message: The debate surrounding climate change must be carried out as a debate over global justice.”
The PIK charter has become religious. Edenhofer himself was  a member of the Jesuit Order from 1987 to 1994.
Obviously the PIK is not quite an organization of scientists, rather it is becoming one of religious zealots. What’s tomorrow? An alliance with jihad groups?
I don’t have anything against religious groups and faiths. But we do need to really worry when dogmatists start running institutes of science.

And so one really has to wonder about the sheer brilliance of Energy Secretary Chu’s latest idea – more electric cars for a country that can no longer provide its citizens with a steady supply of electricity.
I have a question for Secretary Chu: Even if electric cars were free, what purpose would they serve when your energy system cannot produce electricity for days and days? If people and emergency services had your electric cars, they would all be stranded by now with no means of getting around.
Secretary Chu, rather than calling for more electric cars, which very few people want, you need to focus on, well, energy. After all, you are the Energy Secretary, and not the Secretary of Golf Carts.
How about focusing on revamping the utterly dilapidated electricity grid, which has been allowed to go to hell over the years? The energy generation and distribution system has been so neglected that it can no longer withstand a summer storm or heat wave. What a joke.
It’s time for you to start focusing seriously on making the supply of electricity affordable and reliable. Why do you refuse to do that? As it now stands, Washington DC and surrounding area are looking like a banana republic.
It’s time to seriously invest in more coal, nuclear and gas power generation technology. These supplies are cheap and RELIABLE.
And only then can you start to think about electric cars.

The following report appeared at the “Die kalte Sonne” site a couple days back. It looks at two views of the IPCC from two renown scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK): Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Ottmar Edenhofer. Here it is in English:
===========================
Do we still need the IPCC? Hans Schellnhuber thinks we don’t
By Sebastian Lüning / Fritz Vahrenholt
Ottmar Edenhofer thinks the IPCC is just fine. For him it is completely okay that climate scientists are closely linked to policymakers and that the boundaries between science and politics are completely blurred away. For Edenhofer, the IPCC is absolutely essential.
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has a completely different opinion and expresses concrete criticism on the IPCC:
The IPCC has to rethink its reason for existence and possibly face serious consequences. The IPCC is a unique mixture of science and politics. For example, the global community of relevant scientists does not select the lead authors of the IPCC report. Rather this is ultimately done by the involved countries. In the end. it is not the lead authors who decide the wording of the summary report, rather it is the representatives of the governments. And it is only this summary that gets really considered by decision-makers worldwide. Therefore, politics crowds out the science. This is not because governments are malicious: They are (as a rule) not so,because it is purely their functional logic to assert short term national interests. […] Because the boundaries between politics and science are completely blurred in the structure of the IPCC, it makes itself unnecessarily vulnerable to attacks. As one possibility from many, why doesn’t the InterAcademy Council (IAC) select the lead authors, i.e. the alliance of national science academies? Up to now the cumbersome regional proportional representation in the composition of the team of authors, foremost the exaggerated demand for completeness concerning the content of the IPCC reports, has led to a watering down of scientific substance.”
In June 2012, Schellnhuber received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Berlin. Die Welt wrote:
In 1991, Schellnhuber founded the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and has led it since 1993. He is also professor ot theoretical physics at the University of Potsdam. The Bavarian-born climate scientist was also honored for his political advising.”
===================================
In summary, Edenhofer loves the IPCC just the way it is, but Schellnhuber thinks that politics has ruined it. Schellnhuber of course advocates scientists having the say on how society should be shaped.

Hans von Storch: Policymakers and society must decide, not science
Interestingly, Hans von Storch here thinks science should just lay out the facts, but stay out of politics and let the political process decide what to do next. Scientists should not be deciding policy. What follows is what he said in a recent interview with klimaretter.de. (Klimaretter questions are in bold print, von Storch’s answers in italics):
Is adaptation more a question for science or for politics?
The entire climate issue is a political question. In the past in a false manner, it has been suggested by publcity-loving scientists that certain political decisions should follow certain scientific results. This misunderstanding produced an infinite amount of conflict surrounding scientific details […] The job of science is not to say what the solutions are supposed to look like – it must show which consequences the solution options would have. This assures that in a democratic process a solution is chosen that corresponds to the mix of values of society.
Politicians seem to think its okay to shirk their responsibilities: When it comes to unpopular measures, they say that science forces certain things.
Science was stupid to give in to this temptation and to make itself more important than what is deserves to be…
Science only stakes out the framework conditions. What follows from that and what concrete actions are to be taken must be weighed by society based on its preferences and values.”
I agree with von Storch. Edenhofer is clearly disconnected from reality if he thinks the IPCC is fine the way it is. Schellnhuber thinking the scientific community has to run the show to me is appalling.
Whatever you may think, it’s clear there’s no consensus among the warmists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSheesh! This is like a Normandy invasion – this one by the climate science skeptics. The Americans have landed on one beach, and now the Canadians are following on another.
First it was Prof Fred Singer of the USA, then the evil Heartland Institute, and now it’s veteran investigative journalist Donna Laframboise of Toronto, Canada.
Donna’s hard-hitting, unflattering book exposing the corruption rampant within the IPCC has been translated in German and is now being launched in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg – i.e. the heart of the climate catastrophe regime in Europe.
Note that the skeptics only wish to openly talk about the subject of climate science and to have a little public debate. Why are the warmists so afraid of a little open dialogue? Is their science so weak? Fear is hardly a sign of confidence.
If the German alarmists thought Fred Singer and the Heartland Institute were trouble, wait until they see Donna’s book about the IPCC. Expect a massive smear campaign by the alarmists soon. Hope you’ve got a thick skin, Donna.
So Donna, tell us who is really funding you? What about your ties to Koch Industries and to Big Oil? Surely you’re hiding them. And who is paying you all that money? Are you a climate scientist? Why do you spend so much time hanging out with all those deniers and attending their climate conspiracy conferences? Vee hav vays of finding these things out!
You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, young lady.

And expect friendly e-mails from “investigative” journalists at Die Zeit, or German Public Radio, asking for cordial interviews.

Donna’s climate dissent now spreading in German in Europe.
Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne website here and the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here both have a small write-up on Donna’s book, The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert, now being launched in German. They write:
On December 5, 2012, Candian IPCC critic Donna Laframboise is making a presentation at 7 p.m. in Berlin. The topic: just exactly how objective is the IPCC, which was formed to act as a climate referee? The presentation is taking place at the Albrechtstr. 11 in the ‘Haus der Zukunft’ (1st floor). It’s open to the public and entrance is free. Space, however, is limited so it is best to be there early.
Donna Laframboise summarized her IPCC criticism in her book “The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert”, appearing in 2011. It is strongly recommended. The book is now available in German at a price of € 19.90 at TvR media publishers: buch@tvrgroup.de.“
Reaction to this book is not going to be pretty.

Some commenters on my previous articles using MODTRAN, here and here, have called into question the validity of using it to investigate the physics behind the CAGW theory. Of course in the 24 year history of MODTRAN, the US Air Force and many other organizations, including climate scientists, have validated the software for their own purposes. The best way to prove that it is valid for the purposes of my articles, is to show comparable spectra from other sources. One commenter claimed the humidity settings were not interpreted correctly. The interface labels do not appear the same in the version used as in his example. His advice was attempted, and the software would not run a fractional entry. The examples below illustrate that my interpretation is correct.
Infrared astronomers are quite familiar with the problem of atmospheric IR. IR astronomy is not easily done on the earth’s surface because the lower atmosphere is nearly opaque to IR. Consequently IR astronomy is done at high altitudes or at very dry locations, or both. The Atacama Desert in Chile, the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the south pole, airborne observatories, or satellites are the favored locations.
The web was searched for any image of the back radiation spectrum. None were found for any temperate or tropical zone. The only spectra found are from the Arctic at -10°C, and the south pole at -30°C. From the spectral shape, it appears that the Arctic data was taken at Summit Camp on the Greenland ice sheet. Those are the next figures with the MODTRAN version for comparison.

Figure 2a and b. The 2a is from Petty (2006), found at skepticalscience here. 2b is from MODTRAN. The scaling is slightly different, the resolution is not as high, the shape is very nearly the same.

Figure 3a and b. Figure 3a from South Pole station here. Figure 3b is from MODTRAN. At sea level, with a clear sky, temperature at 15°C, 50% humidity, and 400 ppm CO2, the spectrum of downward IR, the “back” radiation, looks like this.

"The Liberal MP Warren Entsch has launched a crusade against single-use plastics as part of his new role as special envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. Entsch told Guardian Australia he was inspired by the 10-year-old campaigner Molly Steer – who convinced Cairns to phase out single-use plastics – comparing her example favourably with activists who he accused of “frightening the living Jesus out of kids” to recruit school students to climate strikes.  Entsch said anti-Adani and Save the Reef activists had targeted his office for 18 months, accusing “the anti-fossil fuel brigade of throwing around a distorted and dishonest picture” of the reef’s health that has had a profoundly negative impact on the economy of his region. “We don’t need to save the reef – it’s still going – we need to manage it and manage it well and we’re the best reef managers in the world,” he said. Entsch represents the vast northern Queensland seat of Leichhardt, including Cairns, and has proved an influential backbencher – lobbying for the legislation of marriage equality in the Liberal party. Entsch said a white picket cricket ground fence in Port Douglas made from recycled plastics inspired him to go to re-elected prime minister Scott Morrison on 20 May to ask for a role in reducing plastic waste. Morrison “loved the idea”, he said. “I’m committed in my last term in government to develop a national policy on plastics, micro and nano plastics, to remove them from our beaches.” The policy should cover use, recovery and conversion of plastics and include consideration of a ban on single-use plastics. “I want to see single-use [plastics] out, but it’s much broader than that, and I’ll defer to experts on how we do it.” Entsch said reducing plastic waste is an example of “solutions not slogans” that can make a practical difference to the environment. Entsch suggested that student climate strikers had been “influenced by teachers, academics at university and activists” who presented “a distorted, one-sided” view of the reef’s health. Entsch recounted his experience inviting a group of climate striking students to attend his office to get an alternative view point from a marine biologist and a tourist operator. “What alarmed me when the kids came in – all they could do is talk in slogans: ‘save the reef’, ‘stop Adani’, ‘100% renewables by 2030’. “One young girl was so distraught – she thought the reef would disappear in 10 years. “These kids were well and truly brainwashed … that was disturbing to me.” In 2017, Unesco opted not to list the reef as in danger after reviewing the government’s Reef 2050 plan, a decision it will reassess in 2020. The Australian Institute of Marine Science reported in 2017-18 that trends in coral cover in the north, central and south reef showed steep decline that “has not been observed in the historical record”. The coral reef scientist Prof Terry Hughes’s most recent paper found that the production of baby coral on the reef had fallen by 89% after the climate change-induced mass bleaching of 2016 and 2017. Entsch suggested coral bleaching was primarily caused by warm currents from the northern hemisphere which Australia “can’t stop from coming down” and therefore needs to find “innovative ways to counter”. “It’s the same for plastics – the bulk of it on our seas comes down from our northern neighbours. If we can create world’s best practice and get them to clean up their own backyard then we will reduce the volumes that come down to us.” Entsch says education will be important to encourage people to “minimise the amount they throw out”. He will create a parliamentary friends of the Great Barrier Reef group, and has recruited Qantas, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Asked whether he will have input into the spending of $443m controversially given to the foundation in 2018, Entsch said he will express views but “leave it up to the scientists”. “I am not interested in having a chequebook, I am interested in developing legislation.” Entsch will work with Sussan Ley, the environment minister, and Trevor Evans, the assistant environment minister, who were also appointed in Sunday’s reshuffle."
"It’s no longer possible to deny or ignore: we are in a climate crisis. The truth of the emergency announces itself regularly in our papers, on our phones, tablets and TVs. A headline about the world’s leading scientists declares millions will suffer drought, floods and be plunged into deeper poverty if carbon emissions aren’t halved by 2030 and global heating remains within 1.5C. Another reports that climate breakdown will likely increase the destructive power of storms like Cyclone Idai, which devastated Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe earlier this year – 2 million people were affected by what, according to the UN, may be the southern hemisphere’s worst weather-related disaster. And yet another reveals the destruction of coral reefs while calculating that 1 million species already face extinction. The silver lining, however tarnished, is that now we can do away with the noxious denial that has brought us to the edge of this precipice.  This week the Labour party has announced that it will make the climate crisis a compulsory element of education from primary onwards. It is one example of how our leaders can be proactive in the face of catastrophe. It is the kind of forward thinking that acknowledges the energy young people have brought to our streets. A generation frustrated with umming and ahing from those who really should know better but refuse to accept the woods are burning around them (literally in some cases), have begun to act for themselves. They came to the conclusion that the adults running the show would continue to drag their feet. And who could blame them? In the same week the UK experienced its hottest ever winter day, only a handful of MPs bothered to attend a Commons debate on climate breakdown, one inspired by the thousands of schoolchildren who had gone on strike to protest about the climate crisis weeks earlier. Labour’s policy highlights how little credit we have given the young thus far. An emergency that threatens their futures is not as readily taught as the history of the Tudors. In the yawning silence, young people like the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, and an estimated 1.4 million students across 150 countries who lead the school strike movement, have created momentum. Their resilience and resourcefulness has made the argument a simple one: human activity is choking our planet. In place of the deep inertia that has lead us here, the young have created an inventive rebellion. By moving to make study of the climate crisis compulsory, Labour positions itself as a party invested in the young. It is a policy highlighting the empty paternalism of our current government, which assumes children haven’t the right to know the science of how we got here. Or, for that matter, what history and geography can teach about how the most vulnerable countries are those least responsible for our climate breakdown – countries that are disproportionately communities of colour. Why are our maths teachers not encouraged to relate the subject to this very real world problem? Students themselves have already worked out that the 12-year deadline for action is too late for many countries on the frontline of our emergency. A good education should provide students with the knowledge and skills to navigate a future they will become adults within. By proposing to make the crisis required teaching, Labour acknowledges that silence, thus far, pretends the young are unable to pay attention to the betrayal of their futures. Today I will be marching with my children as part of the #YouthStrike4Climate. I will be doing so because I know that it is a topic of which they are already aware. Maybe it is snatched references to air pollution, or snippets of dire warnings that arrive via news headlines, but it’s been impossible to shield them from the reality even if I wanted to. The young across the world, baffled by how to get attention, have chosen to strike in order to prove they have agency. Told for so long by parents and teachers alike to be responsible, they have, like the children in Toni Morrison’s 1993 Nobel prize lecture, turned around to ask: “What could that possibly mean in the catastrophe this world has become?” Going on to demand: “How dare you talk to us of duty when we stand waist-deep in the toxins of your past?” When, invariably, today’s protest will be dismissed as of far less importance than Theresa May’s resignation, it will be another sign that an older political class are simply blind to a catastrophe already with us. “Each generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfil it or betray it,” wrote Frantz Fanon, in his seminal work on the trauma of colonisation, The Wretched of the Earth. The irony is that the climate strikes, led by the young, display a conscientious respect for the planet, grounded in the sense of duty and responsibility their elders have been so desperate to abandon. • Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJournalist Michael Miersch at blogsite Die Achse des Guten reports on remarks made by Germany’s recently sworn-in President Joachim Gauck at Schloss Bellevue on Tuesday in a speech to open the Week of the Environment, where the elite of Germany’s environmental protection are meeting for two days.

The eco pow-wow includes Daimler, Deutsche Bank, Lufthansa and 197 other ecological companies who have pitched tents at the Schlossgarten to show how to rescue the planet.
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), President Gauck warned against forcing an energy supply transition through central planning measures:
‘We are not going to succeed with central planning regulations, and absolutely not with excessive subsidies,’ said Gauck .”
Moreover Gauck gave two thumbs up to free markets and competition, adding:
There’s no better way to solve problems than having a society with open markets and free competition.”
Miersch also adds Gauck delivered one of the most sensible speeches he has heard from a politician so far:

No apocalyptic scenarios, no tacky ecology prose, but a few sentences that got stuck in the throats of the audience. There was also a call to approach questions regarding the environment and climate reasonably and factually.”
Gauck also made another statement that surely irritated some in the audience:
Sustainability does not mean restriction or going without. Rather it means reason and responsibility.“
Gauck, who spent a large part of his life under the boot of Soviet/East German tyranny, ended with a call for “sustainable progress“. Surely he knows something about what that means, having seen little of that in the communist days.
Overall, a detectable shift in tone is taking place; alarmism is being ratcheted back. Gauck did not not cite a consensus of scientists. This year his speech mentioned only “leading scientists warn of a consequential global climate warming that can hardly be stopped.“
This is indeed a toning down compared to last year’s speech by then-President Christian Wulff who claimed that “THE climate scientists“ and even “THE climate research“ left “no doubt“ of an imminent huge warming.
Miersch writes:
Now its only ‘leading climate scientists’ who are ‘warning”. A diplomatic retreat from an all-party dogma.”
Let’s hope.

It’s time for a break from blogging.
I’ve gotten a hefty amount of work to do and the deadlines are really tight. There’s no way I will be able to blog regularly for the next two weeks. I may be able to post a short item or two here and there, but not more.
It’s a bit strange – in Europe normally business is slow in August. But not this year.
If readers would like to post as a guest, you are welcome to do so – just send in what you have by e-mail. Keep it short and not more than 3 graphics.
Comments will remain open, but I will not have time to go through the spam to rescue legitimate comments. So it’s possible that your comment may get thrown out now and then.
This is the first time in over 2 years that I have taken a break from blogging.
I should be back at it in about 15 days.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger at German blogsite Readers Edition uncovers how one of Stefan Rahmstorf’s scariest prophecies of climate doom has just been RESOUNDINGLY refuted by hard data from a new European study.

Gulf Stream is not weakening, a new European study says. Photo source: NASA (public domain image).
Krüger writes:
In 1999 German scientist Stefan Rahmstorf was awarded the one-million dollar “prize of the century” by the American James S McDonnel Foundation for his work on calculating climate change through changes in the Golf Stream. Rahmstorf had postulated that already a really small warming of global temperatures leads to an altered flow or even a tipping of the ‘Gulf Stream climate machine’.”
Rahmstorf was also quoted in the year 1999 by the Süddeutsche Zeitung:
The Atlantic current will likely weaken noticeably in the coming decades – here the computer models of various institutes broadly agree on this.”
And recently Rahmstorf reacted to a report appearing on the subject in science magazine mare. Rahmstorf reaffirms:
Summa summarum one can conclude from these very broadly supported estimations that the risk of a tipping of the North Atlantic stream is being increasingly  pessimistically assessed among experts. That also corresponds to my assessment, which also has grown more pessimistic over the course of my work on the subject. […] According to the latest, the risk appears to be greater than what we saw 10 or 15 years ago.”
Let’s recall that at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Rahmstorf’s employer, the only good science there are prophecies of the end-of-world. Anything else is considered heresy at the PIK. If it’s not laced with doom and gloom, then it isn’t acceptable science.
So how is the Gulf Stream really doing? Is it weakening noticeably as Rahmstorf and a consensus of computer models prophesied 13 years ago?
A recent report on ARD German public television (see clip below) now tells us the answer: No. No. No.

Youtube excerpt of the ARD public television Tagesschau and Tagesthemen news from 24 September 2012.
The ARD news anchor-lady tells her many viewers that the Gulf Stream “remains stable” and “has not weakened”, citing a team of scientists from 9 European countries. “New studies show that it is going strong, and is unaffected by climate change.” At the 1:22 mark according to Detlef Quadfasel of the University of Hamburg:
It shows that it remains stable and that we will have a relatively weak warming in Europe and in the North Atlantic and that no catastrophe will occur in the next 10 years.”
The news reporter then adds:
That’s a small sensation! And a reaction to a false warning from 7 years ago when a new cold period had been prophesied. Back then, measurements had been taken from only a few locations.”
The reporter then adds that over the last 5 years, measurements have been taken from 3000 measuring probes and they show no signs of any weakening.
There you have it. Obviously Prof. Rahmstorf (and the computer models from the other institutes he cites) were FOS with their prophecy of a weakening Gulf Stream and climate tipping point. Now it’s clear they had no idea what they were talking about.
Do you think Prof. Rahmstorf will come out and admit his error? Don’t hold your breath. The PIK sees itself as the Vatican of climate science, i.e. as infallible.
I challenge anyone to find one piece of good climate news coming out of the PIK. You won’t find any. Good news there gets strung up every morning at sun-up and never sees the light of day.
When is the government going to wake up and close that science nuthouse down?
 PS: Stefan Rahmstorf is also one of the outlier scientists claiming sea levels will rise more than a meter this century, even though all the tide gauges show no acceleration at all. Do we see a trend when it comes to Rahmstorfian science?

These low pressure weather systems draw upon warm water and atmospheric moisture to fuel their strength and will gather pace if not slowed by patches of dry air, crosswinds or landfall. “They are very tall towers of winds that move at the same speed, sometimes 60,000ft tall,” says Jim Kossin, a scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “If they are unmolested by wind shear or run over land they will continue on their merry way.” Storms are given names once they have sustained winds of more than 39mph. Hurricanes are gauged by something called the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, which runs from one to five and measures speed. Once a storm gets to category three it is classed as a major hurricane, with winds of at least 111mph and enough force to damage homes and snap trees. Category five storms, of at least 157mph, can raze dwellings, cause widespread power outages and result in scores of deaths. This strongest class of hurricanes includes Hurricane Katrina, which caused the inundation of New Orleans in 2005, and Hurricane Maria, which flattened much of Puerto Rico in 2017. Both hurricanes and typhoons are tropical cyclones – the only difference is the location where they occur. In the Atlantic, the term “hurricane” is used, while “typhoon” is used in the Pacific. In the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the term “tropical cyclone” is often deployed. Almost all hurricanes develop once the northern hemisphere approaches summer, with the hurricane season running from 1 June to 30 November. The season peaks between August and October. This is because wind shear, which can disrupt hurricanes, dies down during summer, while the temperature of the oceans rise and the amount of moisture in the atmosphere increases. These conditions are ideal for spawning hurricanes. The season isn’t strictly defined, however. “It can start earlier,” says Jennifer Collins, a hurricane expert at the University of South Florida. “Recall 2016, when Hurricane Alex (a storm that rattled Bermuda) formed in January.” It’s been a punishing past few years for people living in the path of hurricanes in the US and Caribbean. Last year there were an above-average 15 named storms, including Hurricane Florence, which brewed off the west African coast before barrelling into North Carolina, plunging much of the state into darkness and dumping up to 76cm (30 inches) of rain in places, resulting in flooding that killed dozens of people. This was followed by Hurricane Michael, the first storm to make landfall in the US as a category five event since 1992. The 160mph storm obliterated the town of Mexico Beach in Florida, caused more than 70 deaths and racked up an estimated $25bn (£19bn) in damage. These disasters came in the wake of the 2017 hurricane season, which caused a record $282bn in damage. Hurricane Harvey unloaded 33tn gallons of water on Texas, the astonishingly strong Hurricane Irma, which reached a top speed of 177mph, ravaged Florida and several thousand people died in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, another category five storm, tore across the island. The misery in Puerto Rico, in particular, is ongoing, with the US government strongly criticised by local elected officials for a sluggish and insufficient response to the catastrophe. While the overall number of hurricanes has remained roughly the same in recent decades, there is evidence they are intensifying more quickly, resulting in a greater number of the most severe category four and five storms. The proportion of tropical storms that rapidly strengthen into powerful hurricanes has tripled over the past 30 years, according to recent research. A swift increase in pace over a 24-hour period makes hurricanes less predictable, despite improving hurricane forecasting systems, and more likely to cause widespread damage. The devastation unleashed by recent hurricanes has led to warnings that premiums may rise as insurers face ballooning claims. A record $135bn was paid out by insurers in North America in 2017, mostly as a result of hurricane damages. “We have a new normal,” says Ernst Rauch, a senior executive at insurance company Munich Re. “We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.” A range of factors influence the number of hurricanes smashing into land, from localised weather to periodic climatic events such as El Niño. Prior to 2017, the US had experienced a hurricane “drought” that had stretched back to Hurricane Wilma in 2005. But there is growing evidence that the warming of the atmosphere and upper ocean, due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels, is making conditions ripe for fiercer, more destructive hurricanes. “The past few years have been highly unusual, such as Irma staying strong for so long, or the hurricane in Mozambique that dumped so much rain,” says Kossin. “All of these things are linked to a warming atmosphere. If you warm things up, over time you will get stronger storms.” Climate breakdown is tinkering with hurricanes in a variety of ways. More moisture in the air means more rain, while storms are intensifying more quickly but often stalling once they hit land, resulting in torrential downpours that cause horrendous flooding. Rising sea levels are aiding storm surge whipped up by hurricanes – one study found that Hurricane Sandy in 2012 probably wouldn’t have inundated lower Manhattan if it occurred a century previously because the sea was a foot lower then. According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the maximum intensity of hurricanes will increase by about 5% this century. The expanding band of warmth around the planet’s tropical midriff also means a larger area for hurricanes to develop, resulting in fierce storms further north than before, such as Florence. In the Pacific, this change means typhoons’ focal point is switching from the Philippines towards Japan. Researchers are currently attempting to ascertain if climatic changes will help bend the path of hurricanes enough that more will charge in the direction of the UK in the future. “This has implications for places that have historically been unaffected by tropical cyclones,” says Collins, who added these newly hit areas are likely to suffer a significantly higher risk of structural damage than traditional hurricane zones. “We are already seeing effects of climate change,” says Collins. “While there is not consensus on the frequency of hurricanes in a warmer world, there is a consensus that the hurricanes are becoming more intense, and hence their impact will be worse.” The forecasting of hurricanes has become a fine art, with scientists able to predict with sharp accuracy the anticipated path and ferocity of hurricanes. In the US, affected states have refined systems for warnings and evacuations and have a hefty federal agency, Fema, to plough billions of dollars into patching up shattered towns and lives. But planning is often haphazard, with flooded houses repeatedly rebuilt in the same locations despite the morphing risks posed by the climate crisis. The concreting of Houston’s green spaces removed key sponges for Harvey’s water, which sloshed into people’s homes. Meanwhile, natural buffers to hurricanes, such as mangroves and coral reefs, are being stripped away around the world as a result of coastal development, pollution and warming waters. There are more people in harm’s way, too – in the south-eastern US, for example, coastal populations grew by more than 50% from 1980 to 2003. Climate change adaptation rules have been scrapped by Donald Trump’s administration, making it easier to build critical infrastructure in risky coastal areas. “Coastal towns and cities are not currently prepared for the changes already occurring and will continue to occur,” says Collins. “We know that there are areas that are prone to flooding. We need to not rebuild on these areas, and build on higher ground. “Those who deny scientific findings in favour of magical thinking and other such fallacies will only leave the world a more unstable and dangerous place for future generations to come.” The situation is even starker for poorer Caribbean nations that will increasingly rely upon international help to deal with stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels. Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Dominica, leaving just 5% of the country’s buildings intact. Its prime minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, who lost his own roof in the storm, subsequently told the UN that he had come “straight from the frontline of the war on climate change”. “We as a country and as a region did not start this war against nature,” a visibly shaken Skerrit says. “We did not provoke it. The war has come to us.” Researchers have been poring over ocean temperatures and other data to ascertain what’s in store for the 2019 hurricane season, which starts on 1 June. US officials will unveil their best guess on Thursday in Washington. Meteorologists at Colorado State University have predicted there will be a slightly below-average Atlantic season of 13 named storms, five of which will become hurricanes. This prediction rests on the presence of a mild El Nino – a natural climatic event that periodically warms the Pacific Ocean, a process that tends to suppress the development of Atlantic hurricanes. There is still plenty of uncertainty in these early predictions. “Early forecasts can be a but sketchy,” says Kossin. “In general, it looks like it will be around average. But we will have to see.” Ninth Ward Jewell Parker RhodesEye of the Storm: a Book about Hurricanes Rick ThomasThirty-Eight: the Hurricane That Transformed New England Stephen LongTyphoon Joseph Conrad"
"All the raspy-voice myna birds have come here, to this old swamp, where the ghost swans now dance the yellow dust song cycles of drought. Around and around the dry swamp they go with their webbed feet stomping up the earth in a cloud of dust, and all the bits and pieces of the past unravelled from parched soil. The Swan Book, by Alexis Wright. A dense haze of smoke crawled over Melbourne and embraced us for a day in its lonely pilgrimage, inviting us to contemplate its mourning rite, its long prayer.  This smoke came from a cremation of the natural world - the bushfires from the Bunyip state forest that had begun during days of a major heatwave running across the country. The forest lies 65km east of Melbourne where mountain ash grow, prickly tea-trees, stringy barks and heathland swamps. In the Woiworung mythology of the Kulin nation, the Bunyip is a spirit that punishes bad people who disturb its home in the swamps of the Bunyip River, and according to the Parks Victoria information sheet on the park, local Aboriginal people avoided the area. Lightning strikes created the fires by igniting a tinder-dry forest that flared up into “insane” flames from out of control bushfires. The sky around the Bunyip bushfires quickly filled with ash-loaded clouds reaching up to 6km in height where it produced its own erratic weather system. This was another massive pyroconvection producing bushfire – a super cell thunderstorm that was perhaps similar to the cumulonimbus flammagenitus clouds associated with the 2003 Canberra bushfire, and the 2009 Victoria’s Black Saturday bushfires which created pyrocumulonimbus storms reaching heights of 15km and generated hundreds of lightning strokes. This is the new language of climate change. Words most of us have never heard before but we are now learning to understand from experiencing the extreme weather events affecting us more frequently. There were 2,000 firefighters risking their lives in fighting this “catastrophe” that had so far burnt 100,000 hectares of land. Homes were destroyed. The intensity of these forest fires was so great that many native animals perished, the beautiful birdlife including the lyrebird, and all the small animals – nothing caught in the way of the fires would have escaped. Most of these creatures were possibly still growing their populations after the 2009 bushfires where 40% of the Bunyip park was burnt. Nobody seemed to know when the fires would stop burning, and it was said it might continue burning for months. The Climate Council, Australia’s leading climate change communications organisation, called the 2018-19 continental-wide heatwaves and record-breaking hot days, as well as other destructive extreme weather events such as bushfires throughout Australia and heavy rainfall and flooding in northern Queensland, the Angry Summer, and the forecast is that we can expect this worsening extreme weather to continue. We have come to expect extreme weather events of the type that were previously considered as being a one in a hundred year event. We no longer think, Oh! that won’t happen again in a hurry, so there is nothing to worry about. There is not one among us in this country who is not feeling the heat of hotter and more extended summers. We smell the smoke of major environmental catastrophes and ask how safe we really feel in hotter summers, and we will become more anxious, as each extreme weather event comes by. *** When a slow-moving tropical low converged with a monsoon over the coast of north Queensland in February 2019, it dumped more than one metre of rain on Townsville within a week. So intense was the rain, it created horrendous flooding in this regional city, and it brought back memories of the 2011 flash flooding and lives lost in Toowoomba, Grantham and towns in the Queensland’s Lockyer Valley. In Townsville, it was said that some rainfall readings “were at levels probably recorded once every 2,000 years” and the rain created flood levels in the Ross River “that were greater than a one-in-500-years event”. Who knows if what happened will be a one-in-a-100-year flood, or 50 years, or less? How do we plan for the future? Many residents of Townsville thought that they lived in a flood-free area and were not insured for flooding. After this slow-moving extreme weather cell caused massive flooding in Townsville, it then moved further inland, almost travelling to the Northern Territory border before it petered out, as did Cyclone Yasi in 2011, which reached into the NT. There was so much rain dumped in this 12-day weather event in February 2019 that it created a vast inland sea stretching hundreds of kilometres over flat drought-stricken country stretching east of Cloncurry in north-west Queensland, and as far up north as Normanton in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The flooding was massive. Of approximately 5m head of cattle grazed in the region, nearly half a million head of cattle perished. The local people say it was the biggest flood ever seen in the Cloncurry River, that nobody remembers it flooding like this, where creeks became a 2km-wide torrent. Many of the pastoralists who run cattle on this land have spent their whole lives taking the risks of gambling with climate. They love the land, and show great bravery for taking these things on, and the back-breaking hard work they do. They risk everything by gambling on the climate in virtually a life or death situation, and suffer enormous consequences of loss and hardship when the weather turns, as it did this time. They see the consequences of climate change first-hand, and are the victims of it, and there is a shift of understanding going on – that manmade climate change and global warming is real, and that their lives on the land will only get harder if nothing is done about it. This was truly an unbelievable phenomenon that had horrific consequences. It looked like hell on earth. Among the media reports of the devastation, I saw a video clip of Brahman cattle standing in a sea of flooding waters almost up to their necks. Their eyes stared out to the world in horror, and I doubted that they would be saved. One life-long cattleman who lost over 80% of his cattle vividly described what happened in his heart-breaking words that, “There wasn’t much life stuff, you’d just see dead stuff lying everywhere. All the kangaroos, and bloody little marsupial mice and birds they couldn’t handle it.” There was nowhere to hide, so they were wiped out. This great north country was silenced by the flooding. I grew up in this country, and I learned to swim with all the other kids in this river when it flooded, at a time when Cloncurry held the record as the hottest place in Australia. We learned to wait for this fast-flowing brown water to flood the river a second time before swimming in it – after all the dead cattle and tree trunks and branches, etc had been carried away with the first flush. If you were a child who was afraid of drowning, or being carried downstream, you were considered by the other kids as not strong enough to run with them. You learned by swimming out into the deeper, fast-moving waters until you caught hold of the slippery second or third pylon of the bridge, and I do remember fearing that I would never reach it, of being unable to see where it was, and of being sucked under the water. Before my father died in the 1950s, he owned a cattle property that was around Mackinley, east of Cloncurry, and I know he struggled on this drought stricken property he loved until he died when I was a small child. I will never know, but it is quite possible that his cattle station was under water in this flood, part of the inland sea. Perhaps this land is now starting to bound with new life – all the grasses and pretty flowers bringing butterflies and birds on the breeze, something that he would never have seen in the droughts of the 1950s. I never saw his property. It is only a place of my imagining and did not give a lot of meaning to our childhood, but now, strangely, an imagining of its life under water, is similar to many of my dreams of marvellous watery wonderlands. I imagine the land green as far as the eye can see, and the flood water pouring into the Lake Eyre basin in another inland sea for the pelicans and other birds that will flock to the area. There are thousands of ghost butterflies with pastel coloured iridescent wings that each span the size of a human hand now swarming in my dreams. They are being flown through a dry wind circling around decimated drought stricken fruit trees languishing in red earth dust. Was this an extinction flight? The last doomed emergence of an ancient butterfly from wetter times in this country thousands of years ago, before the climate changed? *** How do you find the words to tell the story of the environmental emergency of our times? No one in this country escapes the realities of this manmade global warming catastrophe that is creating before our eyes unprecedented heatwaves, out-of-control fires, immense slow-moving rain systems, freakish cyclones, floods creating inland seas, warming seas, coral bleaching, and the fast pace of losing necessary ecosystems through the demise of native flora and fauna that cannot keep up with the changing environmental conditions. All in one year? But it is not only Australia. This environmental catastrophe is global. The UN’s intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services has just released a frightening 1,500-page official report on the state of biodiversity on Earth. The report, the UN’s first global assessment of the natural world in 15 years, was written by 145 authors from 50 countries and it sums up 15,000 scientific papers on the threats against life in the age of humans. It is a chilling report warning us that as many as one million of Earth’s 8m species of all kind – mammals, birds, amphibians, insects, plants, marine life and terrestrial life – are at risk of extinction within decades, and will be disappearing at a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past. The report lists five major threats to biodiversity, including conversion of forests and grasslands into farms and plantations where half a million species on land now have “insufficient habitat for long-term survival”. A third of the world’s fish stocks overfished, and the dumping of extreme amounts of waste into the world’s oceans and rivers and killing many parts of these water systems. Add this to the damage caused by climate change, pollution and the spread of invasive species. The risk of an “annihilation” of one eighth of the world’s biodiversity is due to human activity that risks putting the planet on the “tipping point” of no return. All the governments of the world need to act now and act urgently to turn this planetary nightmare around before it is too late, because this warning of the magnitude and acceleration of biodiversity loss is a global crisis with dangerous implications not only for one million species but for human health and long-term survival. *** In this country there are sacred places holding enormous powers throughout this continent and reaching far out in the seas. But most non-Aboriginal people do not understand the powerful nature of this country and the forces of nature, or how the ancient law stories associated with each of these sacred places contain vital knowledge about the deep history of this land and caring for it. The Aboriginal caretakers of their traditional country have always understood its power, and why it is so important to care for the land through developing an important system of laws that created great responsibility for caring for the stories and powers of the ancestors. These narratives of great and old wisdom are the true constitution for this country, and urgently need to be upfront in the national narrative in understanding how to care for it. After the manmade catastrophe of a million dead fish in the Darling River – which was all about horse-trading at the expense of the environment – the elders came from different parts of the river system to the Walgalu high country, the birth place of Australia’s major rivers high in the Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales. There, they performed a water ceremony, a Narjong, “to invoke the sacred duty of caring for the river systems, a tribal responsibility for thousands of years”. Perhaps this ceremony has existed for more than 120,000 years since there is new scientific evidence in southern Victoria suggesting that we have existed in our country for as long as we have always known, since time immemorial. The elders called the rivers – their relative, their relation – by their traditional names. Dear broken rivers that may respond to their caretakers calling them, and speaking to them gently. Just as we see our people work hard to take great care of country on our traditional lands, and much good work being done by people in this country, there are people across the world who are taking great ethical steps to care for their relatives - the rivers and mountains, the animals, birds and the natural world. In China, crops will be grown in the south-western province of Yunnan in a habitat area of Menghai county to feed the elephants, so that these animals might stop raiding the crops of local farmers. In Thailand and Cambodia, the monks find the oldest and largest trees in the forest to ordain and wrap in the traditional orange robes of a monk to save the trees from loggers who will not commit the taboo of harming a monk, even if that monk is a tree. India’s courts in 2017 ruled “that the Ganges and Yamuna rivers have rights to exist, thrive, and evolve”. In New Zealand, the government granted the same legal rights as a living person in 2017 to the sacred Mount Taranaki, as it also did in 2018 for the sacred Whanganui River, and as well, in the 2014 granting of legal personhood to the Te Urewera forest, and giving the local Māori tribes shared guardianship with the government. In America, the people of Toledo recently granted the same rights as a person to Lake Erie, to recognize the rights of the lake and its watershed to have the right to a healthy environment. All of these ideas begun with Ecuador’s 2008 constitutional acknowledgment of the Rights of Nature to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles. And we – the people – have the legal authority to enforce these rights on behalf of ecosystems. These are all special acts to protect holy places and creatures. This is the only planet we know that supports life. We would do well to see the world as a sacred site that is holy, speak to our planet with kindness, and protect it as such."

Sure Christie is not responsible for this disaster result, but he’ll do for starters. He represents what’s wrong with the GOP. No way I’m voting for that Benedict Arnold in 2016 (he’ll run). The GOP base needs to make it very clear to him on that.
If there ever was a lesson in polling, this is it. I just got up and looked at Fox News.
Hell, it’s not even close as far as EV are concerned. Looks like many of the polls underestimated Obama. I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t back in 2008.
What is it about candidates from Massachusetts being complete losers? Dukakis, Kerry and now Romney.
The European press (and I suspect Chavez, the idiot in Iran, Putin, etc.) are elated.
4 more years…
I guess the path to sanity will have to go through Greece after all.

"In 1791, a tall, good-looking ex-naval officer called Richard Brothers claimed to hear the voice of an angel predicting God’s imminent destruction of London. In the same year, William Bryan – a Bristolian with mellifluous voice and “clear and gentle” eyes – prophesied the overturn of global monarchies, followed a few years later by the “fall” of Bristol, and an earthquake in which London would “burn like an oven”. Their critics accused Brothers and Bryan of “enthusiasm”, of falsely believing they were acting under divine inspiration. Satirists aligned them with the bloodiest of French revolutionaries. They seemed to exhibit the same disrespect for established social hierarchies, the same untamed emotions, the same wild eyes, torn clothes and dangerously unkempt appearance. Judging by the criticism levelled at Greta Thunberg – the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who launched a Skolstrejk för klimatet (School strike for the climate) in August 2018 – many fear her as the Brothers or Bryan of our times. She has been accused of alarmism and fearmongering, with a “doomsday” prophecy of climate catastrophe, necessitating changes that will crash the global economy. Jeremy Corbyn’s brother Piers Corbyn has dismissed Thunberg as a “brainwashed child”, an inspired puppet of cynical adults. Spiked magazine’s Ella Whelan sees Thunberg’s school strike as an encapsulation of her entire method: a rejection of rationalism and education for “kneejerk, panicky responses” and wild, self-indulgent emotion. Thunberg is painfully aware that “people tell me that I’m retarded, a bitch and a terrorist, and many other things”. But her speeches – now collected and published under the title of her refrain, “no one is too small to make a difference” – give the lie to these caricatures. Yes, she reiterates, “I want you to panic … I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.” But this is offset by dispassionate emphasis on bullet-pointed facts and figures, and the defence that emotion – even panic – is completely rational. Perhaps Thunberg is a prophet after all. Brothers and Bryan leaped to fame in the 1790s, when their visions of toppling hierarchies and ravaged cities gave shape to people’s inchoate hopes and fears about change and corruption after the French Revolution. Their prophecies confirmed the widespread sense that to live in 1790s Britain was to live in a time of profound, unsettling and not necessarily optimistic change. Thunberg speaks to a people acutely aware of living in a time of transition, on a knife-edge between possible futures Thunberg’s appeal to us now is slightly different. Her simple emotion and “black-and-white” rationalism suggest authenticity and trust to her audience, many of whom are wary of adult experts suspected of harbouring hidden agendas. But most of all, whereas Brothers and Bryan’s prophecies gave shape to public fears of catastrophe and collapse, Thunberg speaks to a people acutely aware of living in a time of transition, on a knife-edge between multiple possible futures. Her argument is not driven by a belief that we are all doomed, but is cut through with tentative hope. And as a small, isolated figure, with her pigtails and open face, poised bravely behind an enormous lectern, facing down a roomful of powerful, suited adults, she embodies what it’s like to be an individual who yearns for change, against a juggernaut of commercial and political interests defending the status quo. I wonder if many of us right now, across a multitude of political persuasions, see ourselves in Thunberg, in the fragility of our political and environmental hopes, and our sense of personal impotence. As she says: “I’m too young to do this. We children shouldn’t have to do this.” A greater readiness to involve ourselves in collective action would go a long way towards lessening not just Thunberg’s vulnerability, but our own. • No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference by Greta Thunberg is published by Penguin (£2.99).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThough this is a climate and energy blog, I’ve decided to meander off into pure politics this one time. It’s a slow day.
In 2009 I asked a friend of mine, who I’ll call Norm, to predict where we would be under Obama’s leadership by 2012. Norm is a flaming liberal and ultra-Obama fan. Needless to say Norm thought Obama was going to heal the planet and deliver the world’s population to socialist prosperity. Below are three predictions he made in April 2009, with reality in brackets. Do you see the difference?
– Unemployment rate 4.5% [8.3%]
– Federal deficit: balanced [about -1.5 trillion$]
– Price for a gallon of gas: $4.50  [$3.82]
Now you’d think Norm would be disappointed with Obama’s performance and change his vote this time around. Even gasoline was nowhere near as expensive as he had hoped. But he won’t. Some people live their lives denying reality. The excuse of course is that Obama had inherited a problem that was much greater than any of us could have imagined, but he’ll surely fix it in the next 4 years, if given the chance. No matter what the stats say, we are better off today, they insist.
On Facebook someone posted the following table. Are we really better off today?

If these numbers aren’t enough to convince all the Norms out there, then nothing will. Some people are unable to cope with reality.

Things are just going like clockwork for Romney. It’s increasingly clear the Democrats are propping up a knocked-out feather-weight fighter, insisting he’s still conscious when in fact he’s out cold.
Romney’s momentum continues and now looks unstoppable. Expect it to carry through election day. The Democrats are more demoralized than ever.
When one looks at the polls closely, say what you want about them, we see that a voter tsunami developing for Romney:
1. Florida is all but locked up.
2. Pennsylvania is going to Romney, and with it Ohio.

4. Romney leads unexpectedly in early voting, Obama underperforming.
5. Huge crowds turning out for Romney.
6. Obama’s enthusiasm is gone, and young voters are turned off.
7. Dead-heat polls ignore dead-beat Obama voters.
8. Obama voters are defecting in droves.

"As I write, metropolitan journalists are doubtless making their way to north Queensland, whose voters have been cast as a principal actor in Labor’s defeat. I’m from Townsville, my family still lives there, and I visit as often as I can. I can easily imagine the articles coming our way. Reporters will certainly find people who are less guarded in expressions of racism than white Australians in metropolitan areas. Others will utterly deny global heating, or perhaps talk in dark or conspiracy-minded terms about opponents to Adani’s Carmichael coalmine.  This kind of quasi-anthropological trekking to conservative rural areas is depressingly familiar fare in Trump-era America. Calling it fetishism won’t stop it happening. But this prospect has some people offering a pre-emptive defence of Queenslanders. On Twitter, some have insisted that these people are no different to other Australians, sharing similar attitudes and anxieties. It seems to me that both of these perspectives are wrong but in complex ways. There clearly is something quite specific going on in north Queensland. It’s obviously partly related to the mine, which local media obsessively highlighted as the only real issue. Just look at the numbers. Labor easily lost Lindsay and other suburban swing seats in the south. But in Herbert, centred on Townsville, the loss was of an unprecedented scale. Their incumbent received lowest primary vote in the seat since the first national election 1901, when north Queenslanders sent Labor’s Fred Bamford to Canberra after he campaigned on excluding South Sea Islander workers from the sugar cane fields. In Herbert only one in four voters gave Labor a first preference. Labor also recorded its lowest primary votes in nearby Capricornia (24.7%) and Dawson (20.6%), where the controversy-plagued incumbent George Christensen got an 11.3% swing in his favour. All three electorates have returned Labor members in recent times, and Capricornia in particular was, until recently, a relatively reliable Labor seat. In Dawson and Herbert the combined total of the far-right and populist-right parties — One Nation, Clive Palmer’s United Australia party and the Katter Australia party — eclipsed Labor’s tally. In Capricornia Labor only just edged out that combined tally. And now One Nation, in particular, looks comfortable and established as a part of the mix in these electorates, which have contributed significantly to the election of their Queensland senators. North Queensland politics have always been volatile and subject to the lure of populism and protest votes but this is new. Some – from the Coalition and Labor camps – have pointed to the Stop Adani convoy, organised by the Bob Brown Foundation, as a direct cause of this heavily depressed Labor vote. This is a convenient but unsatisfying explanation that leads us directly to a dead end. If Labor’s electoral prospects are this dependent on Bob Brown no longer doing the kind of thing that Bob Brown has always done, it is more fragile and hapless than even I could have imagined. Also, this suggests that transient intrusions by national figures are more decisive than local factors – bearing down hard on these lets us put the results in national context in more convincing and disturbing ways. One thing that has been so far underplayed is News Corp’s newspaper monopoly throughout the region. Those newspapers have mounted a sustained propaganda campaign in favour of the new mine. On the reef coast they have downplayed the damage to the Great Barrier Reef owing to the climate crisis. And if anyone can be blamed for turning Bob Brown’s visit into a harbinger of doom, it’s these papers. The virtual collapse of other regional news media means that News has an outsized agenda-setting role in the area. This resembles an exacerbated version of News’s national position, which became a subject of broader debate during the campaign. News’s malign influence is fractal — it distorts debate at the local level just as surely as at the national level. But there’s a far bigger problem – historical, existential – which can’t simply be laid at News Corp’s, or even wholly at north Queensland’s feet. A friend, artist and researcher Rachel O’Reilly said on Facebook on Sunday that “Queensland is not a discrete geography but a dominant mode of production”. O’Reilly is from Gladstone and some of her artistic practice has focused on the destruction of its national environment in the operation and extension of its port. That port in turn serves a hinterland dominated by extractive industries. Her point is about Australia’s present and its history, which from a certain distance has been a series of extractive land grabs, starting with the foundational, violent dispossession of Indigenous people, continuing through immigration exclusion, and through to the present of blind, heedless and reckless coalmining. People in the southern cities have been able to maintain some psychological distance from this – from what goes on in whatever they imagine Queensland to be. But they too – as financiers, realtors, landlords, lawyers, state functionaries, speculators – have always been complicit in what happened on the frontier of extraction. All of us have benefited from theft and environmental degradation, all of us have depended on new mines, new finds. North Queensland is just at the sharp end. There’s a real question after this election as to whether Australia knows any other way to be. The country has foundered for so long on the issue of the climate emergency because no one has a clear, politically salient vision for a post-extractive, post-carbon, post-colonial economy. The Liberals and those to their right deny that any such thing is necessary, just as many of them deny Indigenous dispossession. They nurse lumps of coal in parliament, or claim that the science of climate emergency is a globalist plot, or personally plan yet more mines. Labor has dithered between half-hearted action and half-hearted agreement with the right for years, as if the climate can be met halfway, and is constantly punished for whichever emphasis it chooses. Bill Shorten’s equivocations on Adani exemplify this perfectly. The Greens, so far, are incapable of persuading sufficient numbers of people that their proposals are viable, or can incorporate just transitional arrangements for the people dependent on extraction. And none of the parties are connected with, or pressured by, a climate-focused social movement of sufficient size or force. Climate change policies are mostly experienced as triennial retail offerings to atomised voters who are encouraged to think in terms of their own individual economic interests. People in a district which was rich during the boom and presented with no real alternative prospects voted transactionally. At one level this is unsurprising, and all the safari journalism that southern media can muster may not yield deeper insights. This is not to absolve the voters in my home region, or elsewhere in majoritarian white Australia. It is high time to stop pretending, for example, that people vote for One Nation out of any other sentiment than racism; or that extractive industries have not been connected with colonialism, environmental destruction and racism from the beginning; or that coalmines are not directly connected with the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef, which is happening under north Queenslanders’ noses. But while racism is a more or less permanent factor in Australian politics, what has dramatically eroded, clearly, is any confidence in the idea that Australia’s political system can generate ideas and viable plans for addressing the crisis in our midst. Many people appear to have opted to derive what they can from the status quo, while they can – north Queenslanders as much as anyone else. Perhaps our political system as it’s now constituted will never frame an adequate response to the climate crisis. And elections probably cannot save us in the absence of popular pressure, resilience and creativity. But we can be certain that if north Queensland and Australia cannot remake themselves on a wholly new basis, they will nevertheless be remade. • Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Around 250 environmental activists have laid down among the dinosaurs at the Queensland Museum on Sunday, in the first large Extinction Rebellion event in Brisbane. Protesters, many dressed as endangered animals, laid on the floor of the museum’s Lost Creatures exhibit amid fossils and dinosaur reconstructions, including the state’s famous Muttaburrasaurus.  “This is a symbolic action to show that if we continue killing the planet we will die as well,” Alice Wicks from Extinction Rebellion said. “Scientists are telling us we only have within this next decade to act.” After spending 15 minutes inside, the protesters took their “die-in” to the museum’s famous Whale Mall outside. Craig and Claire Walsh brought their three daughters to the event, inspired by the actions of the teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. “She was 16 and doing something about it, so we took it on as a passion project for the family to get involved,” Claire Walsh said. Annabelle, 10, said it was important for kids’ voices like hers to be heard. “If we don’t change anything we’re doing and try to help save the world, then there won’t be a world to live on soon.” Her sister Josie, eight, said her greatest concern was diminishing bee populations. “They pollinate flowers and that’s how we have cucumbers and all the things in salad we need to keep us healthy.” Extinction Rebellion events have been held around the world as part of a global climate change movement, with rallies staged in Melbourne and Sydney in recent days. The movement is calling for zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 in order to stop the 6th Mass Extinction Event. Wicks said the local chapter was planning more and bigger actions in coming months, particularly focusing on the controversial Adani coalmine in central Queensland. Last week the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, welcomed a series of approval dates for the Adani mine, released by the state’s coordinator general, including a black-throated finch management plan by 31 May and a groundwater dependent ecosystem management plan by 13 June. “It’s been really dodgy the way they’re trying to push this mine ahead,” Wicks said. “We need to save the Great Barrier Reef, we need to save everything.” Meanwhile another Extinction Rebellion protester was briefly arrested before the “die-in” began. Tom Howell, 29, was picked up by police for a breach of bail over a protest on 20 April, in which he suspended himself 10 metres off a railway bridge at Annerley used to transport coal. A Chuffed.org campaign has already raised the $1,500 Howell needs to pay his fines. He was released around 1.30pm on Sunday once the protest had wrapped up."

Climate science skepticism in Germany now has spread from a few once marginalized groups over to the junior member of Germany’s coalition CDU-FDP government, the Free Democrats Party (FDP). Hat tip: Ökowatch.

Coalition government FDP party invitation questions climate dogma – announces skeptical climate and energy conference.
The FDP is holding a skeptic conference at the end of this month. This is the first time any political party in Germany holds a “skeptic” conference, and thus marks a watershed event in Germany when it comes to climate science skepticism. Make no mistake – it’s a clear signal.
It used to be that every political party in Germany, from the communists to the conservatives, accepted the science underpinning the man-made climate catastrophe. But that’s changing now. Germany’s Free Democrats (FDP) party appears to be breaking away from the blind, stampeding herd and is holding a conference that casts serious doubt on global warming dogma, which has gripped Germany for over 2 decades, and the direction of Germany’s environmental and energy policy.
Of course skeptical conferences have been held in Germany, but never has one been sponsored by a political party, let alone one that is in power.
Ökowatch writes that “a conference on the topic of climate organized by a political party is taking place for the first time in Dresden on June 30, 2012“. It is one that will offer an alternative view in the debate: The state faction of the FDP Saxony is holding together with ALDE, the Alliance of Liberal Parliamentarians in the EU, a climate conference titled: “Are we beyond rescue? Between climate catastrophe and eco-hysteria.”
Here’s what the above pictured invitation says:
Whether it is the ban of the incandescent light bulb, the mandating of E10 ethanol fuel, the planned energy renovation obligation for residential buildings, which was set up at the end of December 2010, or the attempt by a few overzealous communities to impose the mounting rooftop solar systems: Starting with the European Union and extending to the administration of German towns, eco-bureaucrats are always waiting to impose new, excessive demands and environmental standards.
Here no one seems to care that the energy-saving light bulbs will have to disposed of as toxic waste at a high cost, that the manufacture of a single electric car requires an additional amount of energy consumption that would be enough to fuel a compact car over its entire lifetime. Ecological hysteria and symbolism have come to dictate our everyday life. Just the requirement to renovate residential buildings could lead to costs of over 10,000 euros for each single family home. For many German homeowners, this will mean financial ruin. Apparently every mean is justified when it comes to protecting the climate, no matter the cost. The ends justify the means. Economic sense? Ecologic sense? – Don’t ask!

Among all this, the question of whether or not there is climate change, a global warming, and if so, is it really caused by man, plays no role.  Today a number of serious scientists seriously doubt the increase in global temperature, let alone the anthropogenic causes.
The FDP faction of the State Parliament of Saxony has decided, together with the Saxony FDP European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer, to offer an alternative to the media-driven hysteria by holding a climate conference.
Our primary objective is to give scientists, economists and journalists, who view the green activism with skepticism and warn of incalculable consequences, a chance to speak out.
The speakers will include scientists Prof. Dr. Knut Löschke, Leipzig; Prof. Dr. Josef Reichholf, Munich; environmental economists Prof. Dr. Bodo Sturm, HTWK Leipzig; Dr. Benny Peiser, London; as well as journalist and publicist Michael Miersch of Munich.
See event website“
Of course no one expects the mainstream media to cover this event, nor is that important in the end.
The skeptic movement in Germany is growing just fine without them. For years eco-activists, scientists, politicians and the media have tried everything to marginalize the skeptics: The result: the skeptics are winning and are stronger than ever.
Look at the progress: EIKE has held 4 independent international conferences in Germany, a number of blogs have sprung up, a new best-selling book by one of the founders of the eco-movement, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, came out earlier this year, and now the FDP party is is joining in and holding a skeptic conference – a first ever. So do we need the elitist media?
Don’t waste a single minute fretting about the absence of our drugged-up-on-green media. They live on another planet.
The blogs and Internet sites will report on this event and you know where to come to get informed. I do hope it will be possible to view the conference via webcam, or later on Youtube.

"Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren across the world have gone on strike in protest at the escalating climate crisis.  Students from 1,800 towns and cities in more than 110 countries stretching from India to Australia and the UK to South Africa, walked out of lessons on Friday, the organisers of the action said.  This is the latest school climate strike, inspired by teenager Greta Thunberg, who has become a global figurehead since protesting outside Sweden’s parliament in 2018. The young people are demanding politicians take urgent action to avoid catastrophic ecological breakdown. In London, thousands gathered in the sunshine in Parliament Square chanting, “Where the fuck is the government”, and “This is what democracy looks like”, before staging a sit-down protest outside the department of education. Ivy, 14, from Surrey, said: “I am here because I believe there is no point having an education if there is no future … I am so frustrated the only people who really care about this are the ones who can’t vote.” Her friend, Arissa, added: “It is not us that did this – we are only 14 – but no one else is doing anything about it and it’s our future, so what choice do we have?” There were similar demonstrations in cities across the UK with organisers reporting record numbers in several places. In Glasgow, Nancy Baijonauth, 16, declared the protest the biggest so far in the city. “It’s really great. It felt like at the start people were hesitant, maybe because they felt nervous and that they couldn’t make a change, but now more people are joining in.” In Cambridge about 2,000 school students demonstrated and there were big protests in cities from Leeds to Bristol, Manchester to Cardiff. Globally, organisers said that hundreds of protests also took place in the US. The school protests come amid growing evidence of the scale of the climate crisis. Last year, the UN’s leading scientists warned that there were just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Earlier this month, another UN report warned that the widespread collapse of ecosystems was putting humanity itself at risk. And just last week it emerged that the Antarctic ice is melting much faster than previously feared and global atmospheric CO2 emissions reached a record level of 415ppm. The school strike movement started last August whenThunberg, then 15, held her solo protest in Stockholm. Since then it has snowballed to be one of the most significant climate movements in history. On Friday Thunberg, and leading youth strikers across the world, called for all adults to join the protests and stage a global general strike on 20 September. Writing in the Guardian they said: “We’re asking adults to step up alongside us … today, so many of our parents are busy discussing whether our grades are good, or a new diet or the Game of Thrones finale – whilst the planet burns,” they write. “But to change everything, we need everyone. It is time for all of us to unleash mass resistance … if we [demand change] in numbers we have a chance.” Before Friday’s strikes, organisers said the number of young people taking part would top the 1.4 million people who participated in the last global day of strikes in March.

"Drowned cities; stagnant seas; intolerable heatwaves; entire nations uninhabitable… and more than 11 billion humans. A four-degree-warmer world is the stuff of nightmares and yet that’s where we’re heading in just decades. While governments mull various carbon targets aimed at keeping human-induced global heating within safe levels – including new ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 – it’s worth looking ahead pragmatically at what happens if we fail. After all, many scientists think it’s highly unlikely that we will stay below 2C (above pre-industrial levels) by the end of the century, let alone 1.5C. Most countries are not making anywhere near enough progress to meet these internationally agreed targets. Climate models predict we’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C for 2100, although bear in mind that these are global average temperatures – at the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be double that. Predictions are tricky, however, as temperatures depend on how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide (CO2). Most models assume that it is not very sensitive – that’s where the lower 3C comes from – but a whole new set of models to be published in 2021 finds much greater sensitivity. They put heating at around 5C by the end of the century, meaning people could be experiencing as much as 10C of heating over land. Such uncertainty isn’t ideal, but for our purposes let’s plump for an entirely feasible planetary heating of 4C by the end of the century. If that seems a long time away, consider that plenty of people you know will be around then. My children will be in their 80s, perhaps with middle-aged children and grandchildren. We are making their world and it will be a very different place. Four degrees may not sound like much – after all, it is less than a typical temperature change between night and day. It might even sound pleasant, like retiring from the UK to southern Spain. However, an average heating of the entire globe by 4C would render the planet unrecognisable from anything humans have ever experienced. The last time the world was this hot was 15m years ago during the miocene, when intense volcanic eruptions in western North America emitted vast quantities of CO2. Sea levels rose some 40 metres higher than today and lush forests grew in Antarctica and the Arctic. However, that global heating took place over many thousands of years. Even at its most rapid, the rise in CO2 emissions occurred at a rate 1,000 times slower than ours has since the start of the Industrial Revolution. That gave animals and plants time to adapt to new conditions and, crucially, ecosystems had not been degraded by humans. Things look considerably bleaker for our 2100 world. Over the past decade, scientists have been able to produce a far more nuanced picture of how temperature rise affects the complexities of cloud cover and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and ecology. We’re looking at vast dead zones in the oceans as nutrients from fertiliser runoff combine with warmer waters to produce an explosion in algae that starve marine life of oxygen. This will be exacerbated by the acidity from dissolved CO2, which will cause a mass die-off, particularly of shellfish, plankton and coral. “We will have lost all the reefs decades before 2100 – at somewhere between 2C and 4C,” says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Sea levels will be perhaps two metres higher and, more worryingly, we will be well on our way to an ice-free world, having passed the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, committing us to at least 10 metres of sea-level rise in coming centuries. That’s because as ice sheets melt, their surface drops to a lower altitude where it is warmer, speeding up melting in a runaway feedback loop. Eventually, dark, heat-absorbing land is exposed, speeding the melting process even more. By 2100, we will also have lost most low-latitude glaciers, including two-thirds of the so called third pole of the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan mountains and Tibetan plateau that feeds many of Asia’s important rivers. However, most rivers, especially in Asia, will flood more often, according to research by Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, because the hotter atmosphere will produce more intense monsoons, violent storms and extreme rainfall. His studies predict a wide equatorial belt of high humidity that will cause intolerable heat stress across most of tropical Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas, rendering them uninhabitable for much of the year. Tropical forests of heat-tolerant species may well thrive in this wet zone with the high CO2 concentrations, especially with the disappearance of human infrastructure and agriculture, although the conditions will probably favour lianas (vines) over slower-growing trees, Betts says. To the south and north of this humid zone, bands of expansive desert will also rule out agriculture and human habitation. Some models predict that desert conditions will stretch from the Sahara right up through south and central Europe, drying rivers including the Danube and the Rhine. Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before: decoupling the political map from geography In South America, the picture is more complicated: increased precipitation could enhance the Amazon rainforest, leading to mightier river flow. Other models predict a weakening of the easterlies over the Atlantic, drying the Amazon, increasing fires and turning it from forest to grassland. The tipping point for the Amazon could well be triggered by deforestation; while the intact forest could cope with some drought because it generates and maintains its own moist ecosystem, areas that have been opened up through degradation allow moisture to escape. “A combination of climate change and deforestation could push it into a savannah state,” Rockström says. All of nature will be affected by the change in climate, ecosystems and hydrology and there will be plenty of extinctions as species struggle to migrate and adapt to an utterly changed world. Daniel Rothman, co-director of MIT’s Lorenz Center, calculates that 2100 will herald the beginning of Earth’s sixth mass extinction event. But what about us? This is undoubtedly a more hostile, dangerous world for humanity, which by 2100 will number around 11 billion, all of whom will need food, water, power and somewhere to live. It will be, in a giant understatement, problematic. The good news is that humans won’t become extinct – the species can survive with just a few hundred individuals; the bad news is, we risk great loss of life and perhaps the end of our civilisations. Many of the places where people live and grow food will no longer be suitable for either. Higher sea levels will make today’s low-lying islands and many coastal regions, where nearly half the global population live, uninhabitable, generating an estimated 2 billion refugees by 2100. Bangladesh alone will lose one-third of its land area, including its main breadbasket. From 2030, more than half the population will live in the tropics, an area that makes up a third of the planet and already struggles with climate impacts. Yet by 2100, most of the low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought; despite stronger precipitation, the hotter soils will lead to faster evaporation and most populations will struggle for fresh water. We will have to live on a smaller land surface with a larger population. Indeed, the consequences of a 4C warmer world are so terrifying that most scientists would rather not contemplate them, let alone work out a survival strategy. Rockström doesn’t like our chances. “It’s difficult to see how we could accommodate eight billion people or maybe even half of that,” he says. “There will be a rich minority of people who survive with modern lifestyles, no doubt, but it will be a turbulent, conflict-ridden world.” He points out that we already use nearly half the world’s ice-free surface to produce food for 7 billion people and thinks meeting the needs of 11 billion in such hostile conditions would be impossible. “The reason is primarily making enough food, but also we would have lost the biodiversity we’re dependent on and be facing a cocktail of negative shocks all the time, from fires to droughts.” Others are more sanguine. “I don’t think that humans as a species or even industrial civilisation is seriously threatened,” says Ken Caldeira, climatologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. “People live in Houston, Miami and Atlanta because they live in air conditioning through the hot summers. If people are rich enough to air-condition their lives, they can watch whatever is the successor to Game of Thrones on TV, as the natural world decays around them,” he says. But he points out that while richer people risk a loss to their quality of life, the poorer risk their actual lives. So how might we give all of humanity the best chance? Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before to radically reorganise our world: decoupling the political map from geography. However unrealistic it sounds, we’d need to look at the world afresh and see it in terms of where the resources are and then plan the population, food and energy production around that. It would mean abandoning huge tracts of the globe and moving Earth’s human population to the high latitudes: Canada, Siberia, Scandinavia, parts of Greenland, Patagonia, Tasmania, New Zealand and perhaps newly ice-free parts of the western Antarctic coast. If we allow 20 sq m of space per person – more than double the minimum habitable space allowed per person under English planning regulations – 11 billion people would need 220,000 sq km of land to live on. The area of Canada alone is 9.9m sq km and, combined with all the other high-latitude areas, such as Alaska, Britain, Russia and Scandinavia, there should be plenty of room for everyone. Food production will need to be more intensive. This will be a mostly vegetarian world, devoid of fish and livestock These precious lands, with tolerable temperatures and access to water, would also be valuable food-growing areas, as well as the last oases for many species, so people would need to be housed in compact, efficient high-rise cities with reflective roofs and resource-recycling systems. That risks raising local temperatures to intolerable levels, because compact cities function as heat islands, so solar-powered cooling or even artificial winds would be needed to counteract this. There is also an increased risk of epidemics in such densely populated spaces. Peter Cox, a climatologist at the University of Exeter, thinks this is viable, but would require a massive programme of infrastructure to manage waste, air quality and water needs. City-scale underground reservoirs could supply domestic needs and efficient recycling would keep water – and other resources – circulating in the population for years rather than hours. Post-fossil fuels, we will require unprecedented electricity production. This could come from vast arrays of solar- and wind-power plants in a belt across the uninhabitable desert regions. High-voltage direct current transmission lines could relay this power to the cities or it could be stored as thermal energy in molten salts and transported in hydrogen – after solar energy is used to split water to provide hydrogen for fuel cells. Hydrogen production will be on an industrial scale and it could be used for nonelectric transport, for instance. Wave farms, nuclear fission (and potentially fusion) and solar power will help meet our electricity needs. In the meantime, the effective capture from the air of today’s carbon emissions will with luck be a reality; they can be stored or used in the manufacture of materials. Food production will need to be more intensive, efficient and industrial. This will be a mostly vegetarian world, largely devoid of fish and without the grazing area or resources for livestock. Poultry may be viable on the edges of farmland and synthetic meats and other foods will meet some of the demand. Heat-tolerant, drought-resistant crop varieties, such as cassava and millet, will replace many of our current unmodified staples such as rice and wheat and they will grow faster and with greater water efficiency because of the high CO2 levels. One problem is that almost all of our agriculture will need to be at higher latitudes, because the tropics will be too dry or too hot for farmworkers. And that means less land and less sunlight in winter. “Global agriculture could be limited by the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the sun,” Cox says. “However, studies have shown that crops thrive with artificial light delivered by LEDs at exactly the right frequencies for photosynthesis. This means we could grow crops through the winter months, hydroponically in smaller spaces, stacked up in warehouses or even underground, leaving valuable land surfaces for other uses.” Cultivation of algal mats and crops grown on floating platforms and in marshland could also contribute, while crops could potentially be grown in uninhabitable regions, farmed and processed remotely by artificial farmers. Either way, we would need to use far more precise nutrient and irrigation systems to avoid polluting more fertile ecosystems and reduce food loss and waste. A 4C warmer world may well be survivable, but it would be eminently poorer than the one we currently enjoy. Rockström believes it takes us beyond our adaptation capabilities. Delivering our children to such a deadly home is a horrifying proposition. Given what’s at stake, it may be worth deploying geoengineering tools, which reflect the sun’s heat away from Earth, and so keep global heating to safe levels. This wouldn’t address the problem of dissolved carbon killing oceanic life, but it could buy us more time to decarbonise and achieve negative emissions. Crucially, keeping Earth cooler for longer would help the poorest people to adapt. “We have come to a point where different forms of geoengineering cannot be excluded,” admits Rockström, “but SRM [solar radiation management] is a very dangerous geopolitical tool to deploy: who decides which part of the globe to shade? How would we govern it?” he asks. We’ve already warmed the world by 1.1C, and we’re experiencing the effects: the International Federation of the Red Cross estimates there are as many as 50 million climate refugees. Once we reach 4C, most models agree it will be impossible to return to today’s abundant world. “For me, the issue is that we are transforming (and simplifying!) our world for many thousands of years into the future with millennia of rising sea [levels], acidified oceans and intolerable tropical temperatures, just because we weren’t willing to pay the small differential between fossil-fuelled prosperity and prosperity fuelled by non-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy systems,” says Caldeira. We are now making the climate of 2100 and however hard it seems to meet our emissions targets, it’ll be far harder for our children if we don’t. With international cooperation and regulation, we can make it livable. • This article was amended on 28 November 2019.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls here has done an analysis of sea level rise. Contrary to claims made by fringe alarmist physicists, we see that sea level rise has decelerated markedly since 2003.
Sea Level Rise Since 2003 Has Slowed Down

From 1993 to 2003, sea level rose 3.5 mm/year. Over the next decade, sea level rose only 2.3 mm/year! Source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu, then supplemented by EIKE.
In his report, Puls writes that even TOPEX and JASON 1+2 show no acceleration. “The acceleration calculated by the models and constantly reported by the media does not exist!” 
Puls adds:
It is obvious to see that sea level rise has slowed down significantly. In view of the relatively short time frame in which the measurements have been made, it should not be speculated on whether the deceleration in the rise is a trend change or if it is only noise. What is certain is that there is neither  a ‘dramatic’ rise, nor an ‘acceleration’. Conclusion: Climate models that project an acceleration over the last 20 years are wrong.”
In the chart that follows, Puls fitted a polynomial curve to the data from TOPEX and JASON 1+2:

“The result is no surprise. The 20-year data series of global sea level rise shows a weakening!” No wonder con-artist Al Gore bought a mansion on the beachfront. It’s great living in a world of suckers and dimwit media.
But let’s not rely solely on the satellite data, which has been around only a measly 20 years, to infer a trend. Let’s compare it to tide gauges, which have been used well over one hundred years. Puls presents the following chart of the trend of the German bight”.

Sea level rise at the German bight. Source: see graphic. 
Puls writes:
An evaluation shows: Also tide gauges indicate a slow-down in sea level rise, and do so with a statistically very “robust” dataset of 160 years.”
Also there has been an evaluation of numerous tide gauages globally, see Die kalte Sonne.de/?p=4429. Conclusion:
We have found no indication that sea level has accelerated over the last 30 years. It doesn’t look good for the fans of acceleration.”
Puls summarizes:
The latest alarmist reports on the supposedly dramatic sea level rise for the present and the future cannot be confirmed by actual measurements. Quite to the contrary, they are refuted by the data. Globally neither tide nor satellite data show an acceleration of sea level rise. Rather they show a slow-down. Moreover they starkly contradict the previous and current claims coming from climate institutes. Also there are good indications that the satellite data were ‘overly corrected’ using inflated amounts.“

However, this is not the Pleistocene, it is the Holocene. For the first time in polar bear evolution, the decline of sea ice now places the bears’ turn to land in direct conflict with an animal with which it has never before had to compete: man.
Polar bears are most certainly more threatened now than in any time in their history, and we are to blame. Behind the screen of climate change, the world has been duped; polar bears do need land, a fact and reality that is being denied.

Behind this denial, there exists no sanctuary for polar bears in Alaska and no one seems to mind, much less care. “Critical Habitat” here in the US, is 96% melting sea ice. While only 4% is land, that land is still available for development.
When the sea ice melts, and it is melting, and the polar bears come to land (they are already doing so), 2,000+ polar bears will have no choice but to come ashore with no land set aside for them.
When 2000+ polar bears find no sanctuary, no refuge from development, no home, no peace, they will not survive. You say they they are in no danger, the fact is that they have never faced a greater danger.
Like Mr. Gore, your misguided position only serves to further public confusion, and further damage the future of polar bears.
Polar bears can survive climate change, but not human greed. If we continue to wage the politics of climate change on the backs of polar bears, they will never have a chance.
Polar bears need sanctuary, and until they get it, they have no future as a species on this planet.

"The Guardian’s decision to alter its style guide to better convey the environmental crises unfolding around the world has prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage. After the Guardian announced it would now routinely use the words “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” instead of “climate change”, a memo was sent by the standards editor of CBC, Canada’s national public broadcaster, to staff acknowledging that a “recent shift in style at the British newspaper the Guardian has prompted requests to review the language we use in global warming coverage”. Senior CBC management told staff they were able to use the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” when covering the wide-ranging impacts of temperature rises around the world. “Neutrality is an important principle in our journalism,” said Paul Hambleton, standards editor of CBC News. “We recognise that ‘climate crisis’ and ‘climate emergency’ are increasingly common expressions in debates over what to do about global warming. “‘Climate change’ and ‘global warming’ offer a neutral starting point for that debate, but as with all our journalistic decisions, context matters.” Along with the revised use of “climate change”, the Guardian’s style guide also now favours “global heating” instead of “global warming”. Meanwhile, the term “biodiversity” is discouraged in certain instances to instead emphasise “wildlife”. “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,” said the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Newsrooms around the globe have been digesting the changes, with journalists at several UK and US media outlets reporting internal conversations about the language used around climate. Laura Helmuth, the health, science and environment editor at the Washington Post, said there were no new guidelines at the newspaper as yet, but she had “circulated the Guardian story about your guidelines to our reporters and copy desk for inspiration”. The Los Angeles Times still uses “climate change” and “global warming” but that may soon change. “We are also reviewing our style guide in light of the recent report from the United Nations,” said Scott Kraft, the managing editor of the LA Times, in reference to a stark report last year that found humanity must cut its planet-heating emissions by nearly half by 2030 to avoid severely escalating climate-driven disasters such as flooding, wildfires and drought. Others are being more circumspect. “We use various terms, ‘climate change’ being the most frequent, and we strive to define what that means in the context of our stories,” said a spokeswoman for the New York Times. The Guardian’s new language around the environment is aimed at better illustrating a rapid breakdown in the natural processes that drive the planet’s climate and the society-wide danger that represents.  Without urgent intervention, global heating will reach a point where hundreds of millions of people are displaced by flooding, food insecurity and unrest, while the degradation of landscapes has led to the potential loss of 1m species and the unravelling of ecosystems that support human life. Whether a change in media tone will help address these problems remains an open question given the general lack of focus on the topic. A report this week found the major US TV networks spent far more news time on the birth of Archie, the new British royal baby, than a report warning of 1m species extinctions. One network, ABC, covered Archie for longer in one week than it spent in the whole of 2018 on the climate crisis. “For better or worse, I think climate change and global warming are likely to remain the primary names for the phenomenon,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale programme on climate change communication. Leiserowitz said the media could help elevate the climate issue by using images that showed the impact on people, rather than remote depictions of melting ice and forlorn polar bears. “I don’t mind terms like climate disruption, climate chaos, climate crisis, which can help a little. But I view them more as seasoning than entrée,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterState parliamentarian Wolfgang Greilich led an FDP delegation on a visit to the German Weather Service (DWD) in his home-state of Hesse.The German Weather Service said it’s time to get back to the facts and away from hysteria. Hat-tip: Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt.
Here’s the press release issued by the FDP Free Democratic Party:
=========================
Visit of the German Weather Service / Greilich: climate debate must be factual and conducted without horror scenarios
“It is of fundamental importance to understand which climate risks (mid-term and long-term) represent a possible danger for our state. It is the duty of politicians to be informed about the current facts concerning climate change so that the appropriate measures can be implemented to weaken the risks from natural catastrophes for the good of the public,“ explained Wolfgang Greilich, Chairman of the FDP faction of the state parliament in Hesse during a visit to the German Weather Service in Offenbach.
“We put a lot of value on drawing conclusions for measures against climate change by using facts instead of myths,“ René Rock, vice faction chairman and climate political spokesman of the state parliament in Hesse. Prof. Dr. Gerhard Adrian, President of the German Weather Service, extensively informed the FDP politicians during over the latest findings concerning weather and climate research during their visit. He reminded that it is necessary to return to the facts and emphasized the importance of scientifically addressing the highly complex issues surrounding weather and climate. The statistics of the German Weather Service show climate fluctuations and their impacts going far back into the last century. One of many examples is the blossom of apple trees, which is currently almost 14 days earlier. Deriving a climate catastrophe from this is, however, false,” said Prof. Dr. Adrian in a discussion with the FDP delegation. After all, strong fluctuations have been shown to always exist. It has been shown that there have always been warm periods with high CO2 concentrations. “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss,“ explained Dr. Becker.

Another point of discussion was the various methods of measurement that scientific meteorology employs. “Political circles using climate and weather storms to fan the fears of people are foolishly putting their own credibility at stake. An active climate and environmental protection is the task at hand. Necessary for this are valid facts and data for example like those collected and scientifically assessed by the German Weather Service,“ Greilich concluded.

==========================================
Getting getting back to the facts and away from hysteria is a good idea. But then they go on about “protecting the climate”, which is utter nonsense. How does one protect the temperature? The humidity? What does a psychiatrist do? Does he protect the behaviour of his patient? When someone talks about protecting the climate, then it’s a sure sign he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Dr. Becker then says, “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss.” Maybe some, but there are many that still need to be answered and we’ve been waiting a long time: 1) Storms are not increasing. 2) The 800-year CO2 lag behind temperature 3) 15 years without global warming. 4) Antarctic sea ice increasing in size. 5) Weather events following the cycles of the sun. 6) A host of questions on the failures of the climate models, just to name a few.
Overall, though, the direction of the visit was correct.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday website Die kalte Sonne tells us there’s a new paper appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters on the relationship of CO2 and temperature.

Al Gore teaching science to a gullible audience. (Image from film: An Inconvenient Truth)
Let’s recall how Al Gore in his Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth proudly stood before the CO2-temperature curve of the last several hundred thousand years and fooled his gullible audience into thinking that CO2 drove global temperature in the past, and not vice versa.
Too bad Gore didn’t take a closer look at the curves. If he had, he would have noticed that temperature rose first with CO2 following, and so CO2 could not possibly have been the main driver. What really happened is that a warming Earth warmed the oceans, which in turn released CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s the real inconvenient truth.
Now there’s a new study by Jinho Ahn et al of Seoul National University. His team has taken another look at the temperature fluctuations 39,000 years ago. What did they find? Did CO2 lead temperature, or was it the other way around.
The data don’t lie, but obviously Gore does.  The results were clear: In the abstract the authors write (emphasis added):

This rise in CO2 was synchronous with, or slightly later than, a rapid increase of Antarctic temperature inferred from stable isotopes.”
Morover, it was thought that atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature in Antarctica varied on millennial time scales and that these changes were gradual. But the authors of the paper write:
In a detailed analysis of one event we now find that approximately half of the CO2 increase that occurred during the 1500-year cold period between Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events 8 and 9 happened rapidly, over less than two centuries.”
Lüning and Vahrenholt at Die kalte Sonne find this interesting. They write:
…about half of the total CO2 increase took place within just 200 years. This brings up important questions. The authors point out that the models based on the CO2 cycle are unable to to reproduce the rapid changes in CO2 condentrations.”
Back to the drawing board for climate modellers. But this time they really ought to put the horse before the cart.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate: I hear they may not have yet added in the FL vote tally….if so, what I said below may have to be adjusted some.
We kept hearing that the Republicans were enthused, would turn out in huge numbers, and that Obama voters would stay home, or even vote for Romney, and so the GOP had a good shot at taking the White House. It turns out that only one of the above actually happened in reality – lots of Democrats stayed home.
So why did Romney lose? Because also too many Republicans didn’t bother to go out and vote, the numbers suggest.
The final results are still not in, but it appears most are (ca. 90%), and they tell a sad story: too many Republican voters sat on their butts and thus gave this one away:
Obama 2008: 69,456,897 votes
 Obama 2012: 59,000,000
McCain 2008: 59,934,814
 Romney 2008: 57,000,000

Like I said, there are still more votes to be counted, and the GOP tally probably will surpass 08’s, though not by much, if at all. The numbers already suggest that enthusiasm was lacking.
All that talk about an “energized party” appears to have been lots of hot air.
The numbers also tell us just how valuable Palin was in energizing the GOP in 2008. Although people were tired of the GOP, she mobilized GOP voters – as many as what we saw yesterday. If Palin had not been the VP candidate in 2008 and had made her debut yesterday, we’d be saying “President-elect” Romney today.
I’m not taking anything away from Paul Ryan. But we have to admit that the ticket was a bit bland this time around.
The GOP really knows how to pick ’em. Is there a Ronald Reagan in sight for 2016?

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I present to you the latest wonderful example of tolerance and open-mindedness from fundamentalist warmist site klimabedwetter.de here in green nutsy Germany.
Nowadays it’s hard to tell what the alarmists are more petrified of: the global climate catastrophe or the skeptic invasion in Europe.  They are angry and panicked that the skeptics have succeeded in getting the public in Europe to question the dubious climate science.
It helps to recall that the klimaretter website is run by devout climate catastrophe alarmists who absolutely can’t live without the imminent threat of the end of the world. Don’t take my word for it, all you have to do is read their site. Of course, you may ask how anyone could possibly get so psychologically obsessed with and insistent about the end of the world? I’m afraid you’ll have to ask a psychiatrist that question.
You can be pretty sure that when December 21 passes many of the disappointed Mayan calender kooks are going to be hitching their wagons to the next best thing: the coming global climate catastrophe. But don’t try to tell them that it’s just another hoax. Good news on climate is like holy water to the devil.
I witnessed this first hand at a press conference when a klimabedwetter went into emotional seizures when Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning introduced their book Die kalte Sonne telling us that there wasn’t going to be a climate catastrophe after all. “Sorry – now go home and do something worthwhile for a living.” That good news was simply too much for the warmists in the audience to take.
So without further ado, here’s the latest spread-the-hate piece by klimabedwetter.de.  It’s about the drive-by journalism hit on skeptics by weekly Die Zeit:
The unscrupulous schemes used by certain circles of business and politics to manipulate public opinion on climate change and renewable energies are revealed by a report by Die Zeit: “The Climate Warriors”. It exposes the crusade of these ideologically blinded deniers in horrifying detail. It is really shocking how professional PR strategists, with the help of lots of money and self-anointed climate experts, are hounding renowned scientists. It is of great worry that these well-paid ‘experts’ have in the meantime gotten gotten attention in Europen. Their crude claims have not only been picked up by the major dailies and talk shows, but also by the German parliament.

It is essential for us all to take a stand against these demagogues and to publicly denounce their unscrupulous schemes.
Die Zeit performed an exemplary service here. I really would like to see more of such detailed researched articles.”
What does this tell us about the warmists in Germany? Gandhi says it the best in a nutshell: First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.
The skeptics in Europe have made it to step 3 in almost record time. I suspect step 4 will the accomplished even more quickly.
And, appropriately, here are Ghandi’s seven sins: 
Wealth without work. Pleasure without conscience. Knowledge without character. Commerce without morality. Science without humility. Worship without sacrifice. Politics without principle.
Sin has always led to downfall. It won’t be any different this time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThank you Sweden for not acting like duped, non-thinking zombies, blindly marching behind activists who claim to be cool, educated and hip. Thank you for exercising critical and open thinking.
Sweden’s English language The Local  has a report titled: Swedish politicos ‘don’t buy climate change’. What on Earth happened to politically correct Sweden? Are they getting tired of enduring bitter, long winters and have they given up hope on the warmer times that were once promised? The Local starts with:
Six of ten local politicians in Sweden doubt whether human activity is to blame for global warming, a new study has found.
In addition, one out of ten municipal politicians and local government managers totally deny that the phenomenon of global warming even exists, according to a survey carried out by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (Försvarets forskningsinstitutet – FOI).
‘This is clearly not good. These people feel like they don’t have to take responsibility for environmental work in their municipalities,’ FOI’s head of climate and energy research, Annika Carlsson-Kanyama, told the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper.
The findings come from a survey carried out by FOI looking into how local decision-makers in Sweden view the issue of climate change.”
Continue reading here.
Don’t expect the rest of the western media to even mention a peep about this survey, which completely embarrasses climate science. Note how they make belief in climate change sound like a part of our “environmental responsibility”.
But what about our responsibility to truth and reality? Oh, I forgot. There’s now a Ministry for Truth and Science for that!

The Local goes on to quote the Defense Research Agency: “It’s a threat to national security” and that the results of the survey “took them by surprise”. Such is the life of those who live in climate-catastrophe fantasyland. Annika Carlsson-Kanyama, head of climate and energy research, says:
It makes me angry that there are groups that spread the idea that research on the climate can’t be trusted.
In essence, the survey indicates that 70 percent of Sweden’s local politicians don’t believe in the science.”
There goes Ms Carlsson-Kanyama’s obsession – up in smoke. The fact is that much of the science has long been revealed as a hoax – a fraud that never held water. I can see the Agency trying to load the survey questions to get the answers they want, and getting all frustrated. Next time they’ll be wiser and just make up the results. That’s what everyone else involved in the climate-catastrophe science does. But it’s the reason no one takes it seriously.
Now comes the funniest part. According to Carlsson-Kanyama, “climate change-doubters are often men from small, conservative-leaning municipalities, while it is often women from larger municipalities who are champions of the need to act to combat climate change.”
So there you have it.  They’ve given up on concensus and have moved on to claiming that the science of climate change is now endorsed by “hip people”.
Carlsson-Kanyama should know, however, that Sweden’s leading skeptic climate blog is operated by a cosmopolitan woman, Maggie Thauersköld Crusell, who, if I am not mistaken, lives in hip Stockholm. And what about Donna Laframboise in Toronto? Or Judith Curry at Georgia Tech? Jo Nova in Australia, to name a few?
Attempting to marginalize “doubters” as narrow-minded male hicks instead of presenting scientific arguments shows precisely why people no longer believe the climate bedwetters.

"The EU is disregarding the climate emergency by continuing to give out billions of euros in subsidies to climate-intensive livestock farms at the same time as promising to cut emissions, say campaigners. Under the Paris climate agreement, the EU and its member states have committed to reduce emissions in the European Union by at least 40% by 2030. The EU’s farming sector has shown no decline in emissions since 2010, with meat and dairy estimated to be responsible for 12-17% of total greenhouse gas emissions.  Yet the EU continues to pay out an estimated £24bn of taxpayer money – nearly a fifth of the EU’s total budget – to support livestock farms across Europe, the majority of which are climate-intensive. “Instead of pouring billions of euros into industrial farms that drive climate change, the EU must support farmers to produce less and better meat, and to provide meat and dairy alternatives,” said Greenpeace’s EU agriculture policy director, Marco Contiero. The EU’s subsidy payouts to farmers are due to be replaced by next year. The EU Commission’s draft Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform proposals, published last year, include an objective to take action on climate change. However, they set no targets for reducing livestock numbers. The EU agricultural commissioner, Phil Hogan, has previously been reported as dismissing the sector’s emissions footprint. Compassion in World Farming campaigner Peter Stevenson said the EU was “deaf to the scientific arguments” that a reduction in EU production and consumption is necessary to tackle climate change. Former EU Environment commissioner Karl Falkenberg pointed the blame at MEPs in the EU Parliament’s all-powerful agri-committee for blocking reforms. More than half the politicians on the committee have declared interests as farmers, former farmers, CAP payment recipients in another capacity, current or former partners in agricultural businesses, or have spouses who own farms. “It is mainly made up of farming or rural MEPs who want to be members of the committee because it gives them a way to get re-elected. The entire EU Parliament might not take the same line as the committee, but if we get a bad policy from them it is harder to change,” Falkenberg told the Guardian. The thinktank Rise Foundation has said Europe’s meat and dairy production would need to halve by 2050 to meet global targets for reducing climate emissions. MEPs from the European Parliament’s environment committee proposed earlier this year to restrict subsidy payments for livestock farms that don’t cut their stocking density – the number of animals they keep in the space available. Greenpeace says the move would help incentivise farms to turn towards less intensive farming. The EU Commission has argued that greenhouse gas emissions at global level could increase if EU production was replaced by imports. It has also pointed to research showing that the least intensive farms are more reliant on EU farm subsidies than more intensive ones. “We should be using the CAP to lower emissions, but there is a danger of scaring off EU production to other countries,” said Allan Buckwell from the Institute for European Environmental Policy, who called for measures, including a meat tax, to tackle meat and dairy consumption as well as production in Europe. The EU farming lobby group Copa-Cogeca said livestock farmers contributed to preserving grasslands, keeping rural communities strong and helping provide consumers with a balanced diet. “Many of the studies that call for a reduction of livestock do not consider the actual implications that a shift in production would have. Land would be abandoned and other benefits for the environment would be lost. “Farmers are already looking into how to reduce emissions from livestock farming and working with research to come up with viable solutions – such as reducing livestock enteric methane emissions through special feed supplements – that do not jeopardise livestock production in the EU and are also sustainable for farmers,” said a spokesperson. The EU Commission said the next CAP would require member states to show how they will be using it to bolster climate action, including from the livestock sector. It said it was also supporting research into ways of reducing emissions from livestock and promoting alternative protein crops."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think things are now horrendous for the Northeast US, just wait few more days. Hell in New Jersey and New York could turn into Super Hell, especially if they don’t get power and real help soon.

 Chart from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of the US National Weather Service indicates massive snowfall across the Northeast, with up to 25 inches of snow in Massachusetts and Vermont in the days ahead. 
More often than not, computer forecasts 5 days out are not that far off. If the latest 5-day forecast has any degree of accuracy, then it bodes very very ill for the Northeast USA – a region already battered and down on its knees after the body blow delivered by Sandy. Mother Nature has no mercy.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) models show a massive winter storm brewing, one that is poised to deliver icy temperatures and heavy snow in an area that is already fully exposed and vulnerable.
On Twitter I’ve been following Dr. Ryan Maue and Joe Bastardi, who have been watching the ECMWF models developing. It appears Mother Nature is preparing to deliver no. 2 of the old one-two punch.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi‘s reaction at Twitter looking at the models:
ecmwf delivers classic noreaster with m-id north atlantic gale to storm forces winds on coast, heavy snows n va to ny/ne. wow!”
Mateorologist Dr. Ryan Maue adds:
Actual snowfall, of which some may melt, 20-25” maximum for W. Mass. Still 5-6 days away to gas up snowblower.”

Maue also brings our attention to projections of a Canadian model:

Canadian model projection for 8 November looks a little less threatening, yet has lots of potential for real danger.
I really do hope people, the media, and especially disaster management officials take this seriously. There are lots of people with no power and other essential services who are fully exposed. Sure the weather is much nicer out in sunny Nevada, but Obama should really get his parka out and get back East and prepare the area.
The forecast is a good 5 days out, and so the accuracy is still somewhat iffy. The picture will definitely become much clearer in the next 24 hours.
Meanwhile, Maue warns that winter is about to break (early) in full earnest out West.
Colorado Low means major winter storm for Montana + Dakotas.  Winter.”
Global warming is causing early winters, the warmists will soon be telling us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi at weatherbell.com/ posted a video where he tells us that another brutal December is in the works for the Northern Hemisphere.

Meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Photo source: Weatherbell
Contrary to what a few crackpot physicists tell us, it’s not because of a relatively small 2 million sq km area of less ice in September, but because of gigantic areas in the tropical Pacific.
At the 2:10 mark Joe tells us:
What goes on in the tropical Pacific is huge. It’s absolutely huge – you have to understand that. In fact it’s huge as to control the entire climate of the globe, which is why you hear me with the type of attitude I have on that because of the flip of the Pacific to a colder mode.”
Later in the video at the 5-minute mark his attention is directed at Europe:
“Look at this! This is just hard to believe. I just want too, again, people get a little nervous when I start talking about the climate aspect of this, but this is how the Little Ice Age began. In Europe there was an attack of one cold winter after another. This is the fourth one in a row that severe to record-breaking cold has entered Europe.”
Clearly ocean cycles do play a major role on climate, as Joe shows. But it’s not only Europe’s weather that is beginning to resemble the Little Ice Age. Also the sun is beginning to look like it did during the Little Ice Age.
Solar cycles as well bode very ill for the coming winters.
Frank Bosse has an article today at Die kalte Sonne.de/7191 on the current solar cycle. He writes as follows (translated and condensed):
Solar Cycle 24 is indeed the start of a deep solar slumber. Leif Svalgaard published a paper Svalgaard et al. 2005 already back in 2005 where he estimated sunspot activity would be a maximum of 70 for Cycle 24. David Hathaway of NASA and his colleagues on the other hand projected a powerful solar cycle, based of course on a new model. Lesson here: Don’t believe every model.
How has SC 24 progressed thus far?

The red line in the chart above shows the monthly sunspot value. The blue line shows the average of the previous cycles 1-24. The light, thin line depicts the entry into the Minimum of 1800 – 1833 ( SC5…SC7). In November 2012 the sun also was only able to reach half of the average value. All SSN values were corrected according to a new paper by  Svalgaard.
The following figure shows a comparison of the periods of activity and allows us to evaluate the accumulated monthly sunspot anomaly for each cycle:

Solar activity as measured by sunspot count today is the weakest we’ve seen since SC 7, which ended in October 1833. The question today is: Was the peak in November 2011 with a SSN=96.7 the high for the current cycle? Although the sun is capable of surprises, all observations indicate that SC 24 indeed reached its peak last year. There are a number of signs that tell us this: The poles of the sun’s magnetic field have switched, which is a strong indicator that the peak is behind us:

The weakness of SC 24 is also indicated by the strength of the solar winds, given by the Ap Index, and is depicted by the following chart:

Here we see that the maximum of the solar wind is always offset by 2-4 years after the sunspot maximum. In 2008 we saw a low point of the kind we haven’t seen since the space age began over 50 years ago. We are still stuck at low levels.
Let’s recall that there are a number of papers showing a strong correlation between low solar activity and harsh winters in Europe, e.g. Lockwood et al.
So what impact could the solar winds have on the planet? They could act as a modulator for cloud formation, which in turn has a massive impact on global temperature – Svensmark’s theory. The following chart depicts the galactic cosmic radiation measured by the Oulu <neutron Monitor, Finland:

It’s easy to see that this curve is the inverse of solar activity: the weaker the solar winds, the greater the cloud-seeding cosmic rays reaching the Earth’s atmosphere. In the current cycle, cosmic radiation is 5-15% stronger than the previous cycle.
So what do the experts say? Much points to a Grand Minimum. observation of the convection belt, solar corona and magnetic field strength of the solar sunspots allows us to derive that the sun could get a lot weaker. This last occurred during the Maunder Minimum from 1645-1715. Scientists Livingston and Penn were hardly given attention when they had observed in 2005 there had been a good linear falling tendency since 2000 with regards to magnetic field and sunspots.

 
If this development continues, then we will see hardly any activity during solar cycle 25, which is anticipated to begin in 2020. It could very well be that our quiet sun is a harbinger of what is to come in the years and decades ahead.
Models of the mainstream climate scientists say: It will not impact the climate on Earth more than 0.1 to 0.2°C. Such models may very well be wrong – much like the “solar model” in 2006 projected a powerful SC 24.

"Environmentalists have warned that sections of the European commission may be “deliberately harming climate action” after a report into the climate impact of the common agricultural policy (CAP) was quietly published the day after the EU elections. The study for the EU’s agriculture department was finished almost a year ago but remained unpublished while debate on the CAP’s future rumbled on, leading the environmental group WWF to lodge a freedom of information request for its release.  Imke Lübbeke, the climate and energy chief at WWF’s European policy office, said: “You couldn’t make it up. The EU commission has been talking about ‘climate urgency’ while sitting on a report which shows how little farming policy is doing for the climate – and how much more it could and should do. “At best it is a case of one hand not knowing what the other is doing. At worst, it is deliberately harming climate action and our commitment to keep the temperature rise to 1.5C, as the Paris agreement says.” Agriculture is responsible for about 10% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions but a lack of “strong external drivers” from the commission is hampering the fight to reduce them, according to the official EU paper. The study questions the effectiveness of current CAP subsidy rules that allow farmers to farm on wetlands and peatlands and plough up “permanent grasslands”, releasing large volumes of carbon dioxide as they do so. Because the CAP does not require states to record how many grasslands are ploughed, the paper can only estimate the cost of emissions reductions under the policy at €274 per tonne of CO2 equivalent – more than 10 times the price for industry. Marco Contiero, Greenpeace’s EU agriculture policy director, said the CAP was “locking Europe further into factory farming and a pathway to climate disaster”. He said: “This study shows once and for all that the CAP is failing to tackle agriculture’s contribution to climate breakdown. In particular it has proved unable to address the detrimental role that meat and dairy farming and consumption play.” The analysis, which will feed into an EU policy paper this summer, also calls for careful consideration of whether legislative moves to encourage more sustainable diets are “feasible and desirable”."
"After polls closed last Saturday night, volunteers from the activist group GetUp gathered at a bar on Brisbane’s southside and watched the election results roll in. For months, an army of some 1,500 volunteers had been engaged in a bitter and expensive campaign to unseat the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, from the marginal Queensland seat of Dickson on the city’s northside.  But as the ABC’s Antony Green sifted through the early numbers on a big screen, the volunteers, many of them still decked out in the orange shirts they had worn throughout a months-long campaign, quickly realised it was not going to be the night they had hoped for. While their comrades in Sydney celebrated the unseating of former prime minister Tony Abbott, the swing in Dickson was decidedly not on. In fact, the needle was moving in the other direction. Dutton had not only survived, he had prospered, picking up a 2.6% two-party-preferred swing in his favour. The campaign, one of GetUp’s most ambitious, had come to naught, and by the time volunteer Gordon Melvin arrived at the pub some time after 7pm, the mood was already desultory. “Things were pretty flat. There was a positive little burst when we found out Abbott hadn’t won, but after that people started to drift away,” Melvin told Guardian Australia this week. “It wasn’t bleak and despondent, but it was certainly, ‘Oh dear … ’” Since the Coalition’s shock victory on Saturday GetUp has faced an avalanche of criticism from both sides of politics, staring down the wrath of a re-elected, re-energised Coalition and a Labor party struggling to come to terms with how it lost an election most pundits assumed would see them cruise to government. Dutton accused GetUp of “deceptive”, “undemocratic” and “unrepresentative” conduct during the campaign that backfired with voters in his electorate, while Labor figures in Queensland including former Gillard and Rudd government minister Craig Emerson suggested the group’s presence in Dickson may have hurt the party. “In a state like Queensland, if people perceive that groups from other states have come to tell them what to do or how to live they will react very badly to that,” he told Guardian Australia. “That’s not an attack on GetUp, maybe 100% of their volunteers who were on the booths campaigning were Queenslanders, but if there is a perception they were outsiders, Queensland is such a parochial state that it would go down very badly.” The government in particular is spoiling for a fight. Despite Abbott being the only one to lose his seat out of the six MPs targeted by GetUp on its so-called campaign “hit list”, senior Coalition figures have wasted no time pursuing a group it has loathed and envied since its foundation as an activist bulwark against the Howard government in 2005. Dutton said after the election that he would back “parliamentary processes” to limit the group’s campaigning power, and this week the Australian reported senior figures within the Coalition were considering curtailing the group’s power by introducing rules to restrict volunteers outside polling booths to those attached to registered parties and independent candidates. Attempts by the Coalition to limit GetUp’s influence are nothing new. Opponents such as conservative senator Eric Abetz have long accused the group of being affiliated with the Labor party, and at the behest of Coalition figures the Australian Electoral Commission has reviewed GetUp’s campaign status three times – in 2005, 2010 and last year. Each time the AEC found the group acted as an independent third-party campaigner and did not need to register as an associated entity, a designation which would likely hurt its appeal to politically unaligned supporters. But in the wake of the election some on the left of politics are questioning the effectiveness of the group’s campaigning, because while it celebrated Zali Steggall’s victory against Abbott in Warringah, other target seats remained firmly in the Coalition’s control. In Victoria, the health minister Greg Hunt in Flinders suffered only a 1.5% two-party-preferred swing against him, while former Abbott loyalist Kevin Andrews in Menzies got a small bump in his favour. In the seat of Boothby in South Australia Nicolle Flint suffered a small swing, while the attorney general Christian Porter picked up a 3.5% swing in his seat of Pearce in Western Australia. Paul Oosting, GetUp’s national director, admitted the group “hadn’t achieved what we set out to achieve” but said that came in a context where a predicted nationwide swing against the government failed to materialise. He said the group had helped stunt the move to the Coalition in seats where it campaigned. “If you look at the places GetUp was active you’ll find much smaller swings to the Coalition – that was certainly the case in seats like Boothby, Flinders and Dickson so I think our work has in many respects been successful,” he told Guardian Australia. “Unseating a former PM and by far the leading climate denier in the Australian parliament, someone who’s done untold damage with cuts to the renewable energy target is a huge achievement and something we and our members are really proud of. “Definitely we aimed to achieve more though, so we need to go back as a movement and reflect on what did and didn’t work and be real about that.” That’s a feeling shared across the left of politics in Australia following the result, fuelled by a sense that traditional blue-collar voters didn’t buy into the more stridently progressive aspects of Labor’s campaign. In the days after the election, Labor’s presumptive new leader Anthony Albanese has pledged to move the party back to the centre, while right-faction figures such as New South Wales MP Joel Fitzgibbon, who saw a huge swing towards One Nation in his coal-dominated Hunter Valley seat, demanded the party “reconnect” with blue-collar and regional voters. Amanda Tattersall, one of the original co-founders of GetUp and a researcher at the University of Sydney, believes there was a disconnect between climate and inequality messaging from the progressive movement during the campaign. While the trade union movement talked about wage stagnation and the economy, groups such as GetUp talked about climate change. The result, she believes, was an incohesive narrative that the Coalition was able to exploit by stoking fears about employment and cost-of-living concerns. “I think that disconnect wasn’t as big a problem in places that weren’t feeling those deep inequality problems that are very real other parts of the country,” Tattersall said. “That’s why you saw such different results in say Warringah compared to say parts of western Sydney and parts of Queensland.” She said progressive groups including GetUp needed to come up with new ways to speak to those communities, and pointed to the Green New Deal in the US and Lock the Gate in Australia as examples of how. “I think for GetUp this is going to be a moment for both celebrating a tremendous campaign with some victories but also sitting down and doing some serious reflecting and learning about how to create the kind of innovative campaigns that will be required to transition our economy and our democracy,” she said. “Because it’s not enough to win Warringah when the communities that are suffering in terms of inequality mostly turned away from a progressive agenda.” That theory is played out by the experiences of GetUp volunteers on the ground. Mosman resident Judith O’Neill, who door-knocked for GetUp in Warringah, said the climate change-focused sales pitch there was largely well-received by residents. “When we introduced ourselves we made it quite clear that our concern as Australians was about climate change and that we were concerned that our local member didn’t believe in climate change and basically wondered if they would like to have a conversation about that,” she said. “Most of the time it was really pretty positive I have to say. There were some very funny moments. There was one young woman who came out and said ‘Look my husband is inside and I don’t want him to hear me but I’m not going to vote for Tony Abbott because he doesn’t believe in climate change.’” But in Dickson, a patchwork electorate, carved from commuter-belt suburbs, industrial areas and rural villages in Brisbane’s north and north-west, GetUp’s pitch had to overcome not only Dutton but also an electorate without a unifying touchstone issue. As a result, GetUp’s campaign was less focused on a single issue and instead about finding out what was exercising voters. “It was really about finding out what they wanted from their politicians, and then reflecting on where Peter Dutton stood on the things they cared about,” volunteer Rob Keniger from Brisbane said. “Obviously we were trying to influence people not to vote for him, but it was about listening to what people’s concerns were and then relaying how we felt and why we felt Peter Dutton wasn’t the right choice.” Keniger said often the challenge in the seat was that the people he spoke to were “just disenfranchised with politics generally”. “A lot of people were just done with the shenanigans in Canberra and had just disengaged. I think often they were concerned mostly about local issues and Peter Dutton has been there a long time and a lot of people know who he is,” he said. The Greens candidate in Dickson, Benedict Coyne, echoed that sentiment, saying the issue that got most cut-through for him was the Greens support for a national anti-corruption body and “stopping the revolving door between lobbyists and parliament”. “There’s that real level of cynicism, and some people wanting earnestly to hope that change could happen but also a lot of people sort of saying ‘yeah good luck with that’,” he said. While he was disappointed with the result, Keniger said he felt as though GetUp had done all it could to swing the seat. Others are less certain, however. Gordon Melvin, 71, who spent the last two weeks of the campaign driving around the electorate in a Tarago kitted out with GetUP’s anti-LNP slogans, said he wondered if the campaign had been too personal. Melvin joined the campaign because of his opposition to the Coalition’s refugee policy, a topic GetUp mostly steered clear of during the campaign because it was seen as too divisive in the suburban sprawl of Brisbane’s northside. He said he understood the reticence to lean too heavily on the issue, but wonders if the campaign went too far the other way in response – making too much of its focus about removing Dutton himself. “From my point of view I joined GetUp’s campaign because they were campaigning against Dutton, I got into it for that reason so I was happy to do it,” he said. “But on reflection I’m not sure we did it in the right way. I was a little disappointed [because] I have no idea what would have happened if we talked less about Dutton himself and more about the things he did. If we’d beat up the policy, instead of the person. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing of course, but I do wonder whether that only galvanised some of his support.” Coyne, the Greens candidate, agreed, saying Dutton had been effective in making himself the underdog. “At the risk of generalising, there is a sense that Dutton was able to play the victim card, you know, ‘GetUp and all these outsiders are coming here to do this to me’, and that certainly speaks to his base to come and defend him whether it’s true or not,” he said. “That really garnered, you know, a huge battalion of volunteers and a hell of a lot of money.” Oosting concedes that combatting the notion of GetUp as “outsiders” in a state like Queensland was “definitely a challenge that we are going to have to reflect on”, but also points to the outside forces that impacted on the campaign in Dickson. “The fact is that our campaign in Dickson was led by local people there who are really fed up with Peter Dutton and wanted change,” he said. “But unlike the 2016 election, this campaign we faced a massive smear campaign. There were billboards, radio advertisements and robocalls directly attacking our movement, some of them highly defamatory and untrue which is something we haven’t faced before. “That’s our challenge, to make sure the public are aware GetUp members are just people like themselves – local people who are passionate about the issues in their electorate.” While people like Craig Emerson believe it’s possible GetUp’s presence may have alienated voters in Dickson, others such as Labor party president and former treasurer Wayne Swan said the group had simply failed to make an impact. “I don’t think when you look at it that the impact of GetUp was all that favourable in terms of what they were trying to achieve,” Swan told ABC radio this week. “I’m not aware of their strategy but if I was GetUp I’d be doing what the Labor party is going to do [and] go and have a good hard look at the effectiveness of what we were doing.” Similarly the former Queensland state Labor MP John Mickel told Guardian Australia that while a “vote Dutton out” message might resonate in cities like Melbourne or Sydney, Dickson was a “jealously guarded area” that may not have appreciated the pitch. Now an associate adjunct professor at the Queensland University of Technology, Mickel said without a single rallying cry it was possible voters reverted to what they knew. “Within his own electorate Dutton’s seen as someone who’s delivered for the various sports clubs, the community organisations, so they’d have a completely different view of him to people attuned to who he is as a minister,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German left-wing online TAZ here has a report bemoaning how industrial countries are all shirking their responsibilities when it comes to helping the poor countries develop sustainable societies.

Sorry – no money for climate protection.
If there is a sure sign of just how serious countries really are when it comes to the “grave problems of climate change”, then look no further than money. If climate change was an imminent catastrophe, you wouldn’t know it from the money that countries are pledging. In fact, you’d think they’ve stopped taking it seriously.
The TAZ writes:
And today, 20 years later? Never has there been a UN climate conference where so little is being said about money, even though it is so urgently necessary,’ wonders Jens Martens, development expert of the international non-governmental organisation Global Policy Forum. The industrial countries wish to avoid costly promises and the South has given in to resignation.”
There are two reasons for that: 1) Many industrial countries are teetering on the brink of financial disaster, and 2) the same countries (e.g. Japan, China, Russia, Canada, USA) are beginning to wake up to the FACT that man-made climate catastrophe is a hoax.
At the 2010 Cancun Conference, industrial countries pledged $100 billion for so-called green climate funds. However, according to the TAZ, only about 10 billion have been paid.
With the financial markets in Europe and North America in worsening disarray, expect the supply of money for climate projects to get even more scarce. It’s back to 1992: “It’s the economy, stupid!” Climate change is just a hoax.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp at Science Skeptical reports on Director of the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany brings us this glittering example of how arrogant and detached from reality the scientific elite among us can be.
How the Fraunhofer Director saves energy in his vacation home in California
By Rudolf Kipp
Professor Eicke R. Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany, recently expressed his opinion in a commentary appearing in the daily Badischen Zeitung. It bothers him that German companies simply are not acknowledging the huge potential of photovoltaics. They simply lack faith, he claims.
Completely unimpressed by the the wave of bankruptcies that has rippled through Germany due to low-priced competition from China, and despite all the generous subsidies pampering the industry, Weber is still convinced that photovoltaic systems will undergo a boom in the future.
Lack of faith as a reason for bankruptcies?
It’s not really clear if the Professor Weber really means solar companies in Germany are going bankrupt one after another because they lack the faith that he himself demands. That seems to be the least of the problems for German manufacturers. They all believe their products are better than those from China, and that the only way to a sustainable future is if more and more customers buy more and more of their solar modules.
Indeed faith can move mouintains, but it cannot pay a single bill from a supplier or employee wages. And because this is the reality, we are currently experiencing a die-off of an entire industry. The problem is not a lack of faith – it’s the lack of profitability.

Rising electricity prices are no problem for the professor
Another thing that agitates the professor from Freiburg is “the myth that German pensioners with their electricity bills are financing rich property owners who own buildings covered with solar panels and Chinese industrial bosses”. But it is indeed true that in Germany mainly land and homeowners are the ones profiting the most, along with Chinese solar panel manufacturers, while low income earners with no possibility to invest wind up footing the bill. Weber makes no attempt to refute this.
Instead, he simply recommends that low wage earners consume less power. And to ensure that they really do this, incentives need to be created. Here the professor, who resides in Germany, prefers a graduated price structure. He explains how this would work:
My electricity bill in my vacation home in California is structured as follows: 13 cents/kwh for base consumption, 29 cents/kwh for up to 200 percent of the base consumption and much more for households with large consumption.”
When you read this, it becomes clear why Professor Weber is not afraid of rising power costs. The man can obviously afford it. Clearly he has enough money to fly to his vacation home in California multiple times a year – emitting huge quantities of CO2 as he does so.
Moreover, the professor has the chutzpah to expect other people, who can only dream of having the professor’s lifestyle and who emit only a fraction of his CO2, to limit their energy consumption in order to rescue the planet. To reach this target, he considers it absolutely necessary to make energy so expensive that the “little man” is no longer able to afford it.
If at some time rising energy prices should lead to unrest, then I would recommend that Professor Weber remains at his California vacation home instead of staying in Germany. In earlier revolutions such arrogant elitists ended up facing angry mobs armed with pitchforks and torches.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the last months, Steve Goddard has dug up a number of clippings from old newspapers showing stories of catastrophic climate change going to the early 20th century.
Here’s one I found from 1947, 30 years before the satellite measurements showed a massively frozen Arctic and the media bedwetted about “global cooling”.

Townsville Daily Bulletin, 31 May 1947. Source: http://trove.nla.gov.au/ 
It’s possible Mr Goddard has already posted this one. If so, then it doesn’t hurt to remind people of what nature does on it’s own and that today’s Arctic condition is nothing new. Note how the language is the same as what we hear from the media and climate institutes today. Like today, it was surely effective fund-raising back then as well.

"After the shocking – for some – results of the federal election were revealed on Saturday night, it didn’t take long for hashtags such as #Quexit and #MakeThemLeave to start trending on social media, calling for Queensland to be kicked out of Australia. Whether people were rooting for Labor for climate-related reasons or otherwise, many unleashed their anger on regional electorates that delivered huge swings away from Labor, and that are home to some of Australia’s largest coalmines.  But while it is easy to dismiss these voters as ill-informed, coal-addicted bogans who don’t care about the climate crisis, the reality behind the political and economic priorities of Australia’s coal communities is more complex. I have spent the past five years working in coal regions across Australia, from the Latrobe Valley and the Hunter region to the heart of Adani country in central and northern Queensland, helping people understand what a transition from fossil fuels to a zero-emissions economy looks like. To be clear, a just transition does not mean a direct shift from coal to renewable energy jobs. This is about taking advantage of the new job creation and investment opportunities in shifting to low-carbon solutions across all sectors – energy, land use and agriculture, construction, transport, waste and manufacturing. My experience shows that the biggest myth that needs busting is the notion that coal communities aren’t interested in or aware of this transition. This is simply not true: everywhere we have worked, people have been interested in and even enthusiastic about the transition and its potential to create new jobs and attract investment. People know that regional economies need to become more diversified and resilient in the face of increasingly urgent pressures ranging from ageing populations to the impact of the “gig economy” and more frequent natural disasters. They see large-scale renewable energy projects being rolled out across their regions, and they are curious about how the new low-carbon economy can deliver for regional Australia. But – and there is always a “but” – virtually every coal-dependent community faces the same challenges that are stopping many decision-makers from publicly backing the transition, even when they believe that more action is needed. First, regions have been doing it tough economically for the last decade. They are understandably reluctant to sacrifice existing industries that have jobs available in the here and now in favour of investing in new projects they are unsure of. Second, in the polarised and politicised debates around coal and energy, people are scared to come out in support of a transition beyond fossil fuels, to the point that some fear their jobs are on the line if they speak up for something other than coal. This isn’t helped by the failure by all to acknowledge the contribution coal has made to our economy. Instead of moving to the future with a sense of respect and pride for what they have contributed to the nation, the rush to renewables has left some workers feeling disrespected and under attack by “outsiders”. Finally, people tell me they feel abandoned by the government and don’t trust the main parties to hold fast to their promises. For an untrusting electorate, it makes more sense to stay with what you know than take a risk on the unknown. Some local governments have tried to push past these challenges and take the concept of transition planning further, but they are constrained by tight budgets and political divisions. External funding is also scarce because too many philanthropists are happy to leave regional economic development to governments, instead preferring to fund high-profile campaigns like Stop Adani. Frontline action is undoubtedly important, but everyone loses when we ignore the effort to build positive alternatives and when we sideline the people at the forefront of the transition. The good news is that the transition is not just inevitable, it is already happening. All around the country, state and local governments and industry are backing and building renewable energy projects. Even more exciting are the community energy projects that are proliferating across the country, keeping profits within the regions. New waste and transport initiatives that will lower our emissions are being explored out of necessity. And where coal closures are already starting to happen, we are seeing a swathe of new economic initiatives popping up like the SEA Electric plan to build an electric vehicle factory in the Latrobe Valley Authority. So how do we turn things around for coal communities that are still struggling to transition? The only way we’re going to effectively deliver the two seemingly competing objectives of strong climate action and secure livelihoods is to deepen our engagement with regional communities – not just coal workers, but also farmers, local business owners and First Nations groups. Advocates need to work with communities to tease out the complexities of a just transition, and co-create the constructive solutions that we urgently need. Philanthropists and impact investors need to consider funding more solutions-focused, regional initiatives, and governments need to step up on allocating the resources needed to make the concept of a just transition a reality. And as for the rest of us? Let’s save our anger for the vested interests who block meaningful climate action, renewable energy uptake, and who perpetuate harmful, polarising untruths in the media – not the ordinary Australians who, like most of us, are just trying to do the best they can for their families.

"  Surging concern among Americans about an overheating planet has done little to shift a political polarization that has now reached a stunning extreme: climate breakdown divides Democrats and Republicans even more than abortion does. When voters were asked to rank topics important to them for the 2020 presidential election, conservative Republicans put global warming last out of 29 issues. Liberal Democrats placed the issue third, behind only environmental protection and healthcare. This yawning gap in priorities between the two voting groups, highlighted in new Yale University data, is more stark than traditionally divisive topics such as abortion and gun control. Abortion ranks fifth and gun policies sit in seventh for conservative Republicans, with these issues coming in at number 13 and number seven, respectively, for progressive Democrats. There is also a large, although slightly narrower, gap between moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans on climate. These more centrist Democrats put global warming in eighth position, with moderate Republicans putting it in 23rd place. “Climate change is now more politically polarizing than any other issue in America,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program on climate change communication. “The issue has climbed and climbed in importance for the Democratic base since the 2016 presidential election to the point that it’s now a top-tier concern. We have never seen that in American politics before. “And yet it’s dead last for conservative Republicans. The issue has flatlined for them over the past five years. In the US, your political party is the greatest indicator to your view on climate change – more than race, age or gender.” This growing alarm within Democratic ranks has already stirred the party’s presidential candidates, with contenders such as Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke releasing policies to slash planet-warming emissions and one hopeful, the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, running solely on the issue of the climate emergency. Joe Biden, the early frontrunner for the nomination, has been put under pressure over his lack of a climate plan to date. It remains to be seen whether climate will fizzle out as a topic once a Democrat emerges to challenge Donald Trump, who has engaged in conspiracy theories about climate science and sought to dismantle regulations aimed at lowering emissions. But polling does show the overall American electorate is now more alarmed about the climate crisis than ever before, with Yale’s latest survey finding that nearly four in 10 of all voters consider global heating policies as very important when choosing a candidate. This total includes 64% of all Democrats, a third of independents and 12% of Republicans. “The crystal ball is cloudy because politics has entered an era of chaos,” said Leiserowitz. “But it’s safe to say climate will be important in the Democratic primaries and then you won’t hear much about it beyond that. The differences with Donald Trump will be enormous, whoever the candidate is.” The two major parties in US politics experienced a major split over climate breakdown a decade ago, when the Tea Party helped drive a rightward shift among Republicans and candidates started to routinely dismiss mainstream science, aided by fossil fuel-funded groups that aimed to spread misinformation. This scenario has helped scupper any sweeping federal action on climate breakdown, although some Republicans are now modifying their position in the face of growing public concern over dire scientific warnings and a string of punishing wildfires, storms and flooding. Voters are prepared to back rapid action, too. Nearly seven in 10 Americans support the Green New Deal, a set of goals to radically reduce emissions, the Yale polling finds. This total includes 44% of Republicans, although this number has dropped sharply in recent months. “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (the New York Congresswoman behind the plan) has been turned into the boogyman by Fox News but if my party wants to win back the House it needs an alternative to the Green New Deal,” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who now runs a group advocating conservative climate solutions. “Republicans in competitive districts are starting to think: ‘Gee, we need to push away from the president on this issue.’ We are starting to see new talking points from Republicans where they talk about realistic solutions to climate change. It’s a huge change from where we’ve disastrously been for the last decade.” Inglis said a shift among grassroots Republicans will be enough to convince about a dozen of the party’s lawmakers to back a tax on carbon dioxide emissions after the next election. “A price on carbon is rock-solid conservatism that is, wonderfully, also shared by many progressives,” he said. “But we’ve got a long way to go yet.” Reaching out to conservatives on climate change remains a conundrum for activists and scientists. But there are now clearer avenues to talk about renewable energy, such as solar and wind, as well as adaptions to climate-related disasters, according to Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University. “There’s nothing about the thermometer that gives you a different answer depending on who you vote for,” she said. “I’ve had many conservative groups say to me ‘Hey, it does look like something is happening, how do we prepare for this?’ “The whole idea we can do this without everyone has fallen flat on its face; the Australian election is the latest example of this. But we’ve been doing it ass backwards by trying to get people to accept the science first. “We don’t have to agree on humans being to blame to agree on the importance on building resilience and weaning ourselves off fossil fuels. There are strong arguments for doing those things anyway.”"

Winter also paid an early visit last weekend in England, reports the Daily Mail, with snow falling in the South and West Country, including in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire and Devon. The Mail writes that “the snowfall was England’s fifth in nine days  amid an early winter”. and that “temperatures plunged to -5.6C last night at Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, with -4.3C Redesdale Camp, Northumberland, and -0.9C at Brize. The Weather Service says temperatures are up to 5°C below normal.
Snow was also reported in Gloucestershire and Dorset, with “up to six inches in Somerset in Bath, Frome, Midsomer Norton and the Mendip Hills” The Mail quotes. Charlie Powell, forecaster at the Met Office:

More snow is due on higher ground in the North by Friday, with mainly below-average temperatures expected for the whole of November.”
Britain’s early winter is being enhanced by a mid-Atlantic high pressure preventing mild south-westerly winds from reaching Britain, and is pumping in Arctic air from Greenland. 
So much for snow being a thing of the past at the middle latitudes. Indeed winter is making early appearances not only locally, but globally.  Odd signs of warming, wouldn’t you say?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt saddens us to report that prominent Austrian climatologist Reinhard Böhm has died unexpectedly, Der Spiegel reports. He was 64.

News of his death was made public by the Central Office for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna (ZAMG).
Spiegel calls him the “father of Austrian climate science” and that he was one of the most important worldwide.
‘The personal and professional loss can hardly be expressed by words,’ says Michael Staudinger, Director of the ZAMG.”
Böhm was an independent thinker, and he advised his students to be critical and to not accept anything at face value. He worked at the ZAMG since 1973 and authored or co-authored more than 150 papers about climate in the Alps and glaciers.

For Böhm, the key to science was to always be skeptical and critical. Spiegel quotes Böhm:
‘Don’t let anyone tell you we know enough,’ he told laypersons. ‘Always question the science, be skeptical, and check everything that I claim,’ said Böhm.”
According to Spiegel, he bristled at the notion of politicians rescuing the planet and detested the politicization of climate science, refusing to participate in political debates, saying: “I don’t know the first thing about rescuing the planet. For that I am not an expert”.
Spiegel adds:
His critical view often contradicted the modern opinion on environmental topics. The renowned scientist never backed down, always distrusting every ideological, pre-concluded science.”
Last May I wrote about a study which he had authored where he found that weather extremes in the Alps had not increased.
Another great one has left us. Rest in peace.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it, challenging a dogma takes real courage and character. There’s the real risk of being ridiculed, marginalized – even criminalized.

Fritz Vahrenholt thinks it is going to take 3 to 5 years before the mainstream says: ‘Oh, unfortunately we made a mistake.’
And history has often shown that sometimes you even have to wait way beyond your death before society wakes up and appreciates that you had been right all along.
Yesterday I wrote about Dr. Hans Labohm‘s report, soon to appear in E&E. In it he describes the growing sceptic movement in Europe and how it is succeeding in forcing a very much unwanted debate on the cause of today’s climate change. It’s a debate that unfortunately governments, academia and media would very much prefer to skip altogether.
Labohm mentions how in Germany Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, a leading environmentalist, began challenging the AGW theory. Prof. Vahrenholt could have taken the easy path, stuck to the popular and morally accepted AGW narrative, and kept his good standing among his many prominent peers.
However, he saw that something was amiss, that the theory was flawed and ridiculously simplistic – he couldn’t in good conscience just stand in silence. So he challenged the “consensus” by co-authoring together with geologist Sebastian Lüning a best-selling skeptic book that took Germany by storm earlier this year. This year you can be sure Prof. Vahrenholt will be getting far fewer Christmas cards.
Thankfully, some elements of the mainstream media have remained open to Vahrenholt‘s views and have given him a voice. One of these is flagship daily Die Welt, which conducted an interview with the free-thinking environmentalist professor.
On the IPCC, Vahrenholt thinks that the UN organization “has committed a huge blunder” by blaming the recent warming on CO2. “This demonization is too one-dimensional, it’s even banal. When it comes to the world’s fossil supply, he says we are still a long way from reaching its peak.
In the interview Vahrenholt believes that Germany “went completely overboard and got over-excited” with its move to renewable energy. Vahrenholt says:

We are conducting a fear-driven energy policy.”
Germany’s drive to renewable energy is not only driven by fear and a lack of science, but also because in Germany “we want to be good. But in truth we are self-destructive.”
What could be the consequences of Germany’s hasty and misguided rush into renewable energy? Vahrenholt tells Die Welt:
Indeed I fear that with the energy feed-in tariffs we are on a path to putting huge burdens on people, especially the poorest among us, and that we are driving out energy-intensive industries out of the country. Even worse, Germany is losing its attraction as a place to generate electricity.”
In the interview Vahrenholt reveals his commitment to protecting wildlife, and explains how Germany’s “green” biofuel policy has actually caused great harm to biodiversity, as thousands of hectares of land have been covered by corn monoculture. Windmills are now claiming hundreds of acres of forests and endangering birds and other animals.
One coal-fired or one nuclear power plant needs about 1 sq. km. of area. To get the same energy output, wind energy needs 1000 sq. km, an area that is 3 times bigger than all of Hamburg.”
When it comes to the heated global climate change debate and how long it is going to take before Vahrenholt is vindicated:
Every morning I can look at spaceweather.com at how the sun is changing. It is doing exactly as we expected. But it is still going to take 3 to 5 years before the mainstream says: ‘Oh, unfortunately we made a mistake.’ […] For the time being, a bitter religious war is raging. But I’m taking it in stride because I know that those who maliciously came after me will soon be on the defensive. […] In the meantime my biggest worry is that too much could be destroyed by then. Like I said, I think we will recognize by 2020 at the latest, that climate gas CO2 had been completely over-rated.”

"Moderate Conservatives including Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd are urging contenders for their party’s leadership to put the battle against the climate emergency at the forefront of the contest. The 60-strong One Nation group of senior Tories, created as a bulwark against what they perceive as their party’s lurch to the right, is calling for the environment to form a central part of the leadership debate.  Morgan said: “The people of the UK know that climate change is an emergency and young people are desperately worried about the future of the planet they will inherit. “There are huge opportunities for the UK to lead the way in green finance and environmental innovation and to show that decarbonising an economy doesn’t mean it has to stop growing – let’s get on with it.” The Tory leadership campaign is already well under way, despite the fact Theresa May has not yet announced an exit date. With her authority shattered, several MPs, including Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and the development secretary, Rory Stewart, have said they will run. Many others have declined to rule it out, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, the chief secretary to the treasury, Liz Truss, and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, joined their number on Sunday. Asked by Sky’s Sophy Ridge whether he would run, he said: “I am focused on the job.” The prime minister has promised the backbench 1922 committee she will meet them in early June, after MPs have been given a fourth opportunity to vote on her Brexit deal. If the bill is rejected, as many in government anticipate, the 1922 Committee would be expected to announce a formal leadership contest, which could run through the summer. Boris Johnson is the clear favourite. A YouGov poll for the Times conducted last week suggested he is the first choice for 39% of Conservative members, with Dominic Raab the only other candidate making it into double figures, with 13%. However, candidates must first appeal to MPs, who have the opportunity to whittle the field down to two before members are given the final choice. The One Nation caucus of Conservative MPs, which is relaunching in parliament on Monday, has urged contenders to pledge to tackle pressing issues aside from Brexit and in particular, bring environmental issues to the fore. Led by Morgan, Rudd, former cabinet office minister Damian Green and veteran MP Nicholas Soames, the group plans to hold a series of leadership hustings, in an attempt to act as a counterweight to the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG). Other supporters of the caucus include the justice secretary, David Gauke, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, who form part of a group inside cabinet dubbed the “Gaukward Squad” for their role in trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The group has announced it will not back any candidate who advocates a no-deal Brexit. Moderate Tories are concerned about the contest turning into what one cabinet minister called a “virility contest” on Brexit. The climate emergency has shot up the political agenda in recent months, aided by the Extinction Rebellion protests and the campaign spearheaded by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, who is also widely expected to run for the leadership, referred to the situation as a “climate emergency” during a debate called by Labour to demand more urgent action from the government. “Every Conservative must feel that this is a cornerstone policy,” said Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. The sacking occurred during an investigation into sexual harassment allegations, which were found to be “plausible”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the mainstream media are hyperventilating over global warming being responsible for the heat wave, fires and thunderstorms hitting the US, it is a good time to check if they are applying the same science they used to explain winter cold snaps, like the one we saw just 2 years ago.
If they were serious, you’d at least think their science would remain consistent when explaining weather extremes. Anything else, after all, is just quackery.
Two years ago, the AP and scientists blamed the unusually cold winter weather on “natural variability”; they began:
Beijing had its coldest morning in almost 40 years and its biggest snowfall since 1951. Britain is suffering through its longest cold snap since 1981. And freezing weather is gripping the Deep South, including Florida’s orange groves and beaches.
Whatever happened to global warming? experts say the cold snap doesn’t disprove global warming at all  ‘It’s part of natural variability,’ said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. With global warming, he said, ‘we’ll still have record cold temperatures. We’ll just have fewer of them.’
Scientists say man-made climate change does have the potential to cause more frequent and more severe weather extremes…and even cold spells.”

The AP then quoted scientists to explain the cause of the cold snap of 2010, saying that it was just a “big outbreak of Arctic air over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere“, and then went on to provide the details about natural variability, which of course is reasonable.
But to explain the current 2012 heat wave near DC, they completely abandoned the reasonable science and went off and blamed CO2 witchcraft and Big Oil sorcerers summoning a heat wave.
So it’s up to us to use the rest of the AP’s 2010 story to explain the heat wave, changing only a few words:
‘We basically have seen just a big outbreak of Arctic tropical air’ over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere, Arndt said. ‘The Arctic tropical air has really turned itself loose on us.’

In the atmosphere, large rivers of air travel roughly west to east around the globe between the Arctic and the tropics. This air flow acts like a fence to keep Arctic tropical air confined.
But recently, this air flow has become bent into a pronounced zigzag pattern, meandering north south and south north. If you live in a place where it brings air up down from the south north, you get warm cold weather. In fact, record highs lows were reported this week in Washington state and Alaska West Coast.
But in the eastern United States, like some other unlucky parts of the globe, Arctic tropical air is swooping down in from the north southwest. And that’s how you get a temperature of 3 104 degrees in Beijing Washington DC, a reading of minus-42 +104 in mainland Norway Norfolk, and 18 inches of snow rain in parts of Britain the South, where a member of Parliament Congress who said the snow heat ‘clearly indicates a cooling warming trend’ was jeered by colleagues.
The zigzag pattern arises naturally from time to time, but it is not clear why it’s so strong right now, said Michelle L’Heureux, a meteorologist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The center says the pattern should begin to weaken in a week or two.
Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said he expects more typical winter summer weather across North America early next week.
That will be welcome news in the South, where farmers have been trying to salvage millions of dollars’ worth of strawberries and other crops.

Why Borenstein and the quack scientists he interviewed didn’t use the same 2010 cold-snap science to explain the general atmospheric dynamics behind the current heat is sort of a mystery. Now that we are dealing with heat, they are blaming it all on CO2 without even citing a single paper to back it up.
So what are we left with? We have to assume that it’s a few fringe charlatans trying to fan the flames of fear. It’s as sad an example of sham science as you’ll ever find.
For these catastrophe-mongers, warm weather in the winter means global warming, cold weather in the winter also means global warming, heat in the summer of course means global warming, and so does cold in the summer. It is nothing more than the irresponsible perpetuation of an increasingly obvious fraud.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper has been published by Twila Moon et al titled: 21st-Century Evolution of Greenland Outlet Glacier Velocities appearing in the journal Science.

Lead author Twila Moon finds that claims of rapid Greenland glacier acceleration are massively overstated.
The study contradicts all the bedwetting projections made by the crackpots at NASA or the PIK in Potsdam.
The paper’s abstract concludes:
Observed acceleration indicates that sea level rise from Greenland may fall well below proposed upper bounds.”
The German online daily Die Welt also reports on the story in an article today called Greenland Glacier Disappearing More Slowly Than Thought.
Die Welt writes that the behavior of 200 glaciers was evaluated over 10 years and that they accelerated on average only 30% instead of the often ballyhooed doubling. Die Welt writes (emphasis added):

The large glaciers ending on land or in fjords have on the other hand hardly changed or have even become slower, the scientists reported in the Journal ‘Science’.
Sea level rise resulting from Greenland ice melt therefore could end up being far less than what climate scientists predicted.”
Gee, like we’re even surprised.
A series of scientists like expert Nils-Axel Mörner have been telling us for years that the bedwetters had been hyper-exaggerating and that there has not been, is not, and will not be an acceleration in sea level rise. How many experts and how much more real, observed data is it going to take before people realize the models are sheer crap?
Moreover, the scientists are simply just not sure how much sea level is rising. Moon admits that. Die Welt writes:
Just how much, remains unclear however, say Twila Moon of the University of Washington in Seattle and her colleagues.”
The tide gauges show zero acceleration. And Die Welt adds:
‘In some respects our results produce as many new questions as they answer,’ said Ian Joughin, co-author, of the Applied Physics Laboratory of the the University of Washington.”

"People across Europe will need to work drastically fewer hours to avoid disastrous climate heating unless there is a radical decarbonising of the economy, according to a study. The research, from thinktank Autonomy, shows workers in the UK would need to move to nine-hour weeks to keep the country on track to avoid more than 2C of heating at current carbon intensity levels. Similar reductions were found to be necessary in Sweden and Germany.  The findings are based on OECD and UN data on greenhouse gas emissions per industry in the three countries. It found that at current carbon levels, all three would require a drastic reduction in working hours as well as urgent measures to decarbonise the economy to prevent climate breakdown. Will Stronge, the director of Autonomy, said the research highlighted the need to include reductions in working hours as part of the efforts to address the climate emergency. “Becoming a green, sustainable society will require a number of strategies – a shorter working week being just one of them,” he said. “This paper and the other nascent research in the field should give us plenty of food for thought when we consider how urgent a Green New Deal is and what it should look like.” The paper focuses on the emissions produced per industry in each economy but does not take into account other environmental advantages of reducing working hours, from less commuting to fewer goods produced and resources used. There is growing support in the US and Europe for a so-called Green New Deal, which aims for a rapid decarbonisation of the economy, creating secure, well-paid sustainable jobs. Accelerating automation has also led to increasing calls for a reduction in the working week. Emma Williams, a spokeswoman for the 4 Day Week campaign, said Wednesday’s report highlighted the link between automation, reduced working hours and the climate emergency.“We welcome this attempt by Autonomy to grapple with the very real changes society will need to make in order to live within the limits of the planet,” she said. “In addition to improved wellbeing, enhanced gender equality and increased productivity, addressing climate change is another compelling reason we should all be working less.” Stronge said technological advances and the climate emergency meant a shorter working week was now not only viable but essential. “The rapid pace of labour-saving technology brings into focus the possibility of a shorter working week for all, if deployed properly,” he said. “However, while automation shows that less work is technically possible, the urgent pressures on the environment and on our available carbon budget show that reducing the working week is in fact necessary.”"

Based on data from a few carefully selected tree rings, dogmatic warmist scientists like to insist that the Medieval Warm Period really did not exist globally and was only a local North Atlantic phenomenon.
The climate, they tell us, was pretty much steady over the last couple thousand years – until man began to prosper a hundred years ago.
However, yet another new study, one by Michael Shawn Fletcher and Patricio Iván Moreno, has been published and adds more to the growing mountain of evidence that the Medieval Warm Period was indeed a global phenomenon. This in turn means that natural climate drivers are dominating the development of the climate, and not CO2.
Yeah, like we’re really surprised.
The authors did an analysis of pollen and charcoal from Laguna San Pedro, a small closed-basin lake located in the Andes of Chile. Their results reveal centennial-scale changes in vegetation, climate and fire regime since 1500 cal yr before present.
According to the study’s abstract, they found periods of relatively low summer moisture and increased fire activity between 1500–1300 and 1000–725 cal yr BP. The period  1000–725 cal yr BP (i.e. Medieval Warm Period) is characterised by remarkably rapid bulk sediment accumulation, from which they infer prolonged annual sedimentation resulting from a decrease in the duration of lake freezing under a warmer climate. Before the Medieval Warm Period, i.e. 1300–1000, they found relatively moist conditions during summer and low fire activity. After the Medieval Warm Period, from 725–121 cal yr BP, there was slow bulk sediment accumulation implying a cool and wet climate. Adios Hockey Stick!

The abstract concludes (emphasis added):
Our results suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly chronozone was relatively warm and dry, followed by a cool-wet climate during the Little Ice Age chronozone, before a substantial modification of the vegetation landscape by Europeans occurred in the mid 1800’s. The timing and direction of changes in the Laguna San Pedro record bear a striking resemblance to multiple independent tropical Pacific precipitation reconstructions, areas where precipitation is governed by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and with the modern influence of ENSO over the climate in the region. We conclude that ENSO was the main driver of changes in growing season moisture in this part of the Temperate-Mediterranean Transition in south-central Chile over the last 1500 years.”
Here the authors lost it in the last sentence. I’m not at all convinced by their attribution to the ENSO, which is an internal oscillation occurring over annual and decadal scales. But the changes that the two authors have observed actually occur over decades, centuries and likely millenia. They really need to compare their results to solar and ocean cycle data, which today are readily available. Of course, they may not like what they find. But as scientists, they’ll surely put aside any prejudices that may exist.
If they do that, then they’ll reach a different conclusion. One thing is sure: the observed climate cycles have nothing to do with GHGs and man. That hypothesis can be fed to the shredder and dustbin.

"Companies bidding for public sector contracts will be forced to take radical steps to tackle the climate crisis under new regulations being proposed by the Labour party, addressing energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. If elected, the party would force suppliers to “put people and planet before profit”, with the threat of losing contracts if they do not, in a stark redrawing of priorities for contract bidders.  The government buys goods and services worth about £284bn from the private sector every year, making it one of the biggest single customers for many private sector companies. The proposed changes would force companies to take a much greater role in combating the climate emergency, and have a knock-on effect across the business sector as they would be more likely to replicate those standards in other non-public sector work. If it was elected, Labour would also ensure the public sector bodies that deliver goods and services, including the NHS, would have to adhere to higher green standards. Shadow ministers have already pledged to “insource” more goods and services to the public sector, rather than favouring private companies. Standards on trade union recognition, late payments and tax compliance would also be updated and enforced. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office for the Labour party, said: “For too long large firms have enjoyed the immense benefits that come from public sector contracts, but have failed to protect the public good. There is no greater public good than our planet and the environment – businesses must deliver decisive action.” Labour has pledged action on climate change to meet the “net zero carbon” target for 2050, recommended by the Committee on Climate Change in a recent landmark report. The party was also instrumental in having parliament declare a climate emergency. If followed through, both would require much greater action on carbon dioxide emissions across the economy but senior figures in politics and civil society are concerned they could be forgotten among other political priorities if pressure is not kept up. Trickett said: “Labour will ensure that every firm providing goods and services to the public sector puts people and planet before profit. The stakes demand nothing less.” The move may end up costing the Treasury and government departments more in the short term, because contracts are currently awarded largely to the lowest bidder, and cutting carbon dioxide emissions may require bidders to increase their investments. But Labour believes it will save money in the longer term and provide improvements in vital areas such as climate change, air pollution, health and other social benefits. Aaron Kiely, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The UK parliament has declared a climate emergency and all areas of government and business must respond to this crisis as quickly as possible. Making sure public money supports public good by only giving government contracts to green suppliers is a sensible start, and will lay down a clear marker for companies to comply.” The party has examined the current standards for bidders to supply the public sector, and believes the new pledges could be delivered with relatively minor changes to regulations. The proposals are part of Labour’s “green industrial revolution”, that has been championed by Corbyn, and would involve new investment in renewable energy such as solar panels, and cleaner forms of transport. It also follows mooted proposals to delist UK companies that fail to take action on the climate emergency, though that would be more complex. Public sector contracts are considered a good place to start because they are within the government’s control and many companies rely on the hundreds of billions they pay out each year. Perhaps unusually for Corbyn, who has often been defined in opposition to former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, the new plans are a redrawing of previous attempts by Blair more than a decade ago to use public sector procurement to force suppliers to make changes to their practices. A taskforce was set up in 2006 on how to “green” public sector contracts. The initiative foundered, however, when it met resistance from suppliers and public sector procurement specialists, who argued it would force a rise in costs for the government. After the financial crisis, little more was heard of it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe main pillar of the global warming, climate change theory is the claim that trace gas CO2 is the single major player impacting climate today. To maintain this, alarmist scientists and climate modelers have been forced to blow up the effects of CO2 by one order of magnitude in their models and to neglect a series of other factors (like the sun!).
Not surprisingly, we see from observations today that the assumed CO2 impacts have indeed been massively overblown. Now the scientists are left to fudge and falsify past climate data to force it to fit their crumbling models.
Ed Caryl’s two recent posts on the subject point out that the Modtran model of the US Air Force, who are forced to rely on real data for successful operations, also shows that CO2 has little impact on warming. Read here and here.
Now there’s a new paper by Martin Hertzberg titled: The night-time radiative transport between the Earth’s surface, its atmosphere, and free space, which is to be published by Energy & Environment (Vol. 23, No. 5, 2012), hat-tip Marc Morano of Climate Depot.
The paper concludes:
In addition, since the recent increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have a trivial effect on the atmosphere’s total emissivity, the effect of those recent CO2 increases on the overall infrared radiative flux balance is insignificant.
The entire abstract is available here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a new study out titled: A public health frame arouses hopeful emotions about climate change – A Letter in the Journal Of Climatic Change. It is a rare and precious glimpse at the warmists’ future strategy.
The study’s conclusion:
Framing climate change in terms of public health and/or national security may make climate change more personally relevant and emotionally engaging to segments of the public who are currently disengaged or even dismissive of the issue.
Don’t expect the results of this study to be made very public. But do expect them to be made very well known to the mainstream media, and watch them zealously apply the results with abandon soon in future communication with audiences.
As for the public, expect to be massively bombarded by all sorts of scare stories about the dangers of climate change to public health soon enough. I can see it now: climate change induced influenza, mental illness, epidemics, widespread allergies, rheumatism, malaria, cancer, depression…you name it!
The authors used a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N = 1,127) conducted in December, 2010, and randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions.
The results: “across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation.”
The introduction of the paper frames what the challenge is all about:
Effectively engaging the American public on climate change—including its causes, impacts, and solutions—remains both a major research question and a communication challenge.”
Clearly even though the public is growing more and more skeptical, the warmist bunch is a long way from giving up.

While many of us may scoff at the notion that a 1°C rise in temperature threatening public health, expect this dastardly scheme to scare will be aimed particularly at schoolchildren and students – the most emotionally vulnerable among us. Again, it’s the warmists resorting to the dirty tactics of scare-mongering and mass psychological manipulation.
The paper adds:
People’s emotional reactions to messages about climate change are an important consideration, yet to date they have often been overlooked both in research and in communication efforts. […] Emotions serve as affective prompts for engagement with an issue and lead to forming predispositions for action when a relevant situation arises.”
But the authors warn that there’s a risk of producing an unintended angry backlash, and that caution is needed:
However, eliciting anger against the claims or proposed recommendations emphasized in a communication strategy also has the danger of inciting action counter to the communicator’s intent. […] the very claim of climate change’s reality might elicit anger among people dismissive of the issue. Thus, a given message could generate an angry backlash by some recipients, leading to an unintended social response, while provoking an equally angry—yet intended—social response by other recipients.”
Us skeptics must work to educate the public about the true intentions of this budding campaign. We need to feed that legitimate backlash.
The authors end by saying the “research demonstrates the potential of the public health frame to inspire hope in the context of the climate change discussion while demonstrating the possibility that certain frames may be poorly received within some interpretive communities. More research is needed to understand how frames both set the context for perception on the issue and interact with emotions in guiding public decisions and behavior.”
It’s a good idea to print this study out and to read it carefully. In my view it’s a playbook for one of the next rounds of the manipulative mind games they intend to play on the public.
The study was supported by a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Investigator Award and by the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment.

"Environmental activists Extinction Rebellion have turned their fire on the advertising industry in a public letter, encouraging it to use its expertise in manipulating public opinion for good or risk mass public protests against it. Speaking to the Guardian, one of the authors of the letter, which was written by Extinction Rebellion members with decades of experience of the advertising industry, said the group was not “singling out advertising, as we previously disrupted fashion week and are systematically challenging all industries who have the platform, influence and skills to tackle this epoch-defining crisis but are failing to do so in any meaningful way”.  “Though our letter is addressed to the boardroom, we ask everyone within the industry to ‘Tell the Truth’ about the climate and ecological emergency,” he continued. “This is the first of Extinction Rebellion’s demands, to business and governments; the vital step required to wake everyone up and drive action to deal with this crisis. “Advertising has helped promote high-carbon lifestyles and hyper-consumption. However, if we’re to survive, this must change rapidly.” In particular, “as mediators between the public and brands, the advertising industry is uniquely capable of driving rapid behaviour change across society, around the world and should take the lead rather than be driven. This isn’t a hippy pipe dream. “Advertising will increasingly be seen alongside oil and logging as obviously toxic industries and those with the job title ‘creatives’ will soon find themselves rebranded as ‘destroyers’.” In the letter which was released on Friday, the group addresses itself to “founders, CEOs, CCOs, CMOs, CFOs, MDs and CDs of the advertising industry”, playfully chiding them: “You didn’t think we’d forget about you?” Addressing industry executives, it reads: “What can I do, you’re thinking, I’m just the founder/CEO/CMO/CCO/CFO/MD/CD of a global advertising agency.” The letter continues: “The answer is: you can do anything you want and you can shift mass behaviour in a heartbeat. One of the reasons we’ve got here is because you’ve been selling things to people that they don’t need.” It ridicules some of the ways that advertising companies currently show their green credentials, saying that “making a small campaign to give up drinking from plastic straws is not going to cut it … neither is doing some pro-bono for an anti-palm oil initiative.” The group demands companies “declare a climate & ecological emergency and act accordingly. Persuade your clients and their audiences to do the same.” It cautions: “If you don’t make this change, consumers will insist you do. Look at the streets of London in the last month. People are beginning to see where the problems lie, and soon they will see you.” A spokesman for the Advertising Association said that “every business knows it has a role to play in tackling issues such as climate change and advertising is a powerful tool to shift behaviour and change the way we do things as a society. “We are seeing challenging advertising emerging on climate change – the recent Ovo Energy ‘Get Mad’ campaign being a prominent example. “Responding to climate change is already on many advertisers’ and agencies’ minds in every aspect of their businesses so we expect to see many more campaigns tackling this in the months and years ahead.” "
