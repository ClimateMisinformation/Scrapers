"Hundreds of thousands of academics, engineers and lawyers in Denmark are set to vote on divesting their €32bn (£23bn) pension funds from the fossil fuels that drive climate change. The first of a series of resolutions will be filed on Monday asking six funds to dump their coal investments by 2018 and exclude high-risk oil and gas projects such as tar sands extraction and Arctic drilling.  Campaigners are hopeful of success after resolutions demanding divestment from all fossil fuels were only narrowly defeated in 2014. The pension funds, which Danish professionals are obliged to join, cover almost 5% of the nation’s workforce. “The Danish energy sector is obviously more green than elsewhere in the world, but even in Denmark we have a responsibility to do our absolute best to drive the [green energy] transition and part of that is moving out of black money,” said Prof Thomas Meinert Larsen, at Copenhagen University and part of the Danish Fossil Free Campaign. “I care about the future for the coming generations.” The Danish move is part of a fast-growing climate change campaign that has already persuaded 180 institutions, worth $50bn (£33bn) and including local authorities, universities and churches, to sell off their investments in coal, oil and gas.  A series of analyses have shown that there are already three times more fossil fuels in proven reserves than can be burned if catastrophic global warming is to be avoided, as world leaders have pledged. The campaigners argue that the trillions of dollars companies are still spending on exploration for even more fossil fuels is a danger to both the climate and investors’ capital.  The six funds being targeted provide pensions for academics (MP Pension), engineers (DIP and ISP), lawyers and economists (JØP), architects (AP) and veterinarians (PJD), over 200,000 people in total.  The resolution filed to each fund will ask the board to “exclude investments in the 100 largest coal companies as soon as possible, but at the latest before the end of 2018, and to engage in, and annually document, a dialogue with owned oil and gas companies to exclude their investments in high-risk extraction projects, eg tar sands, deepwater drilling and drilling in Arctic.” The votes will take place in April.  In 2014, resolutions urging divestment from the top 100 coal and top 100 oil and gas companies by 2020 were filed at three of the funds received and received significant support: MP pension (49% in favour), DIP (46%) and JØP (38%).  “I think that probably for these three pension funds, we will have a majority this year,” said Meinert Larsen. “We have the impression the pension boards are moving.” Other major financial institutions in Scandinavia have already divested from fossil fuel stocks, with the region’s biggest fund manager Nordea and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund (the world’s biggest) both blacklisting coal companies, while Denmark’s largest pension fund, PFA, is excluding tar sands companies. The fossil fuel divestment campaign has been backed by the anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, while the heads of the Bank of England and the World Bank have both warned that action to cut carbon emissions would devalue fossil fuel investments."

"The alarm bells of the climate crisis have been ringing in our ears for years and are getting louder all the time - yet humanity has failed to change course. What is wrong with us? Many answers to that question have been offered, ranging from the extreme difficulty of getting all the governments in the world to agree on anything, to an absence of real technological solutions, to something deep in our human nature that keeps us from acting in the face of seemingly remote threats, to – more recently – the claim that we have blown it anyway and there is no point in even trying to do much more than enjoy the scenery on the way down. Some of these explanations are valid, but all are ultimately inadequate. Take the claim that it’s just too hard for so many countries to agree on a course of action. It is hard. But many times in the past, the United Nations has helped governments to come together to tackle tough cross-border challenges, from ozone depletion to nuclear proliferation. The deals produced weren’t perfect, but they represented real progress. Moreover, during the same years that our governments failed to enact a tough and binding legal architecture requiring emission reductions, supposedly because cooperation was too complex, they managed to create the World Trade Organisation – an intricate global system that regulates the flow of goods and services around the planet, under which the rules are clear and violations are harshly penalised. The assertion that we have been held back by a lack of technological solutions is no more compelling. Power from renewable sources like wind and water predates the use of fossil fuels and is becoming cheaper, more efficient, and easier to store every year. The past two decades have seen an explosion of ingenious zero-waste design, as well as green urban planning. Not only do we have the technical tools to get off fossil fuels, we also have no end of small pockets where these low carbon lifestyles have been tested with tremendous success. And yet the kind of large-scale transition that would give us a collective chance of averting catastrophe eludes us. Is it just human nature that holds us back then? In fact we humans have shown ourselves willing to collectively sacrifice in the face of threats many times, most famously in the embrace of rationing, victory gardens, and victory bonds during world wars one and two. Indeed to support fuel conservation during world war two, pleasure driving was virtually eliminated in the UK, and between 1938 and 1944, use of public transit went up by 87% in the US and by 95% in Canada. Twenty million US households – representing three fifths of the population – were growing victory gardens in 1943, and their yields accounted for 42% of the fresh vegetables consumed that year. Interestingly, all of these activities together dramatically reduce carbon emissions.  Yes, the threat of war seemed immediate and concrete but so too is the threat posed by the climate crisis that has already likely been a substantial contributor to massive disasters in some of the world’s major cities. Still, we’ve gone soft since those days of wartime sacrifice, haven’t we? Contemporary humans are too self-centered, too addicted to gratification to live without the full freedom to satisfy our every whim – or so our culture tells us every day. And yet the truth is that we continue to make collective sacrifices in the name of an abstract greater good all the time. We sacrifice our pensions, our hard-won labour rights, our arts and after-school programmes. We accept that we have to pay dramatically more for the destructive energy sources that power our transportation and our lives. We accept that bus and subway fares go up and up while service fails to improve or degenerates. We accept that a public university education should result in a debt that will take half a lifetime to pay off when such a thing was unheard of a generation ago.  The past 30 years have been a steady process of getting less and less in the public sphere. This is all defended in the name of austerity, the current justification for these never-ending demands for collective sacrifice. In the past, calls for balanced budgets, greater efficiency, and faster economic growth have served the same role.  It seems to me that if humans are capable of sacrificing this much collective benefit in the name of stabilising an economic system that makes daily life so much more expensive and precarious, then surely humans should be capable of making some important lifestyle changes in the interest of stabilising the physical systems upon which all of life depends. Especially because many of the changes that need to be made to dramatically cut emissions would also materially improve the quality of life for the majority of people on the planet – from allowing kids in Beijing to play outside without wearing pollution masks to creating good jobs in clean energy sectors for millions.  Time is tight, to be sure. But we could commit ourselves, tomorrow, to radically cutting our fossil fuel emissions and beginning the shift to zero-carbon sources of energy based on renewable technology, with a full-blown transition underway within the decade. We have the tools to do that. And if we did, the seas would still rise and the storms would still come, but we would stand a much greater chance of preventing truly catastrophic warming. Indeed, entire nations could be saved from the waves. So my mind keeps coming back to the question: what is wrong with us? I think the answer is far more simple than many have led us to believe: we have not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe – and would benefit the vast majority – are extremely threatening to an elite minority that has a stranglehold over our economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets. That problem might not have been insurmountable had it presented itself at another point in our history. But it is our great collective misfortune that the scientific community made its decisive diagnosis of the climate threat at the precise moment when those elites were enjoying more unfettered political, cultural, and intellectual power than at any point since the 1920s. Indeed, governments and scientists began talking seriously about radical cuts to greenhouse gas emissions in 1988 – the exact year that marked the dawning of what came to be called “globalisation,” with the signing of the agreement representing the world’s largest bilateral trade relationship between Canada and the US, later to be expanded into the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the inclusion of Mexico.  The three policy pillars of this new era are familiar to us all: privatisation of the public sphere, deregulation of the corporate sector, and lower corporate taxation, paid for with cuts to public spending. Much has been written about the real-world costs of these policies – the instability of financial markets, the excesses of the super-rich, and the desperation of the increasingly disposable poor, as well as the failing state of public infrastructure and services. Very little, however, has been written about how market fundamentalism has, from the very first moments, systematically sabotaged our collective response to climate change.  The core problem was that the stranglehold that market logic secured over public life in this period made the most direct and obvious climate responses seem politically heretical. How, for instance, could societies invest massively in zero-carbon public services and infrastructure at a time when the public sphere was being systematically dismantled and auctioned off? How could governments heavily regulate, tax, and penalise fossil fuel companies when all such measures were being dismissed as relics of “command and control” communism? And how could the renewable energy sector receive the supports and protections it needed to replace fossil fuels when “protectionism” had been made a dirty word? Even more directly, the policies that so successfully freed multinational corporations from virtually all constraints also contributed significantly to the underlying cause of global warming – rising greenhouse gas emissions. The numbers are striking: In the 1990s, as the market integration project ramped up, global emissions were going up an average of one percent a year; by the 2000s, with “emerging markets” like China now fully integrated into the world economy, emissions growth had sped up disastrously, with the annual rate of increase reaching 3.4% a year for much of the decade. That rapid growth rate continues to this day, interrupted only briefly in 2009 by the world financial crisis. Emissions rebounded with a vengeance in 2010, which saw the largest absolute increase since the Industrial Revolution. With hindsight, it’s hard to see how it could have turned out otherwise. The twin signatures of this era have been the mass export of products across vast distances (relentlessly burning carbon all the way), and the import of a uniquely wasteful model of production, consumption, and agriculture to every corner of the world (also based on the profligate burning of fossil fuels). Put differently, the liberation of world markets, a process powered by the liberation of unprecedented amounts of fossil fuels from the earth, has dramatically sped up the same process that is liberating Arctic ice from existence. As a result, we now find ourselves in a very difficult and slightly ironic position. Because of those decades of hardcore emitting, exactly when we were supposed to be cutting back, the things we must do to avoid catastrophic warming are no longer just in conflict with the particular strain of deregulated capitalism that triumphed in the 1980s. They are now in conflict with the fundamental imperative at the heart of our economic model: grow or die. Once carbon has been emitted into the atmosphere, it sticks around for hundreds of years, some of it even longer, trapping heat. The effects are cumulative, growing more severe with time. And according to emissions specialists like the Tyndall Centre’s Kevin Anderson (as well as others), so much carbon has been allowed to accumulate in the atmosphere over the past two decades that now our only hope of keeping warming below the internationally agreed-upon target of 2C is for wealthy countries to cut their emissions by somewhere in the neighbourhood of eight to 10% a year. The “free” market simply cannot accomplish this task. Indeed, this level of emission reduction has happened only in the context of economic collapse or deep depressions. What those numbers mean is that our economic system and our planetary system are now at war. Or, more accurately, our economy is at war with many forms of life on earth, including human life. What the climate needs to avoid collapse is a contraction in humanity’s use of resources; what our economic model demands to avoid collapse is unfettered expansion. Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it’s not the laws of nature. Fortunately, it is eminently possible to transform our economy so that it is less resource-intensive, and to do it in ways that are equitable, with the most vulnerable protected and the most responsible bearing the bulk of the burden. Low-carbon sectors of our economies can be encouraged to expand and create jobs, while high-carbon sectors are encouraged to contract. The problem, however, is that this scale of economic planning and management is entirely outside the boundaries of our reigning ideology. The only kind of contraction our current system can manage is a brutal crash, in which the most vulnerable will suffer most of all. So we are left with a stark choice: allow climate disruption to change everything about our world, or change pretty much everything about our economy to avoid that fate. But we need to be very clear: because of our decades of collective denial, no gradual, incremental options are now available to us. Gentle tweaks to the status quo stopped being a climate option when we supersized the American Dream in the 1990s, and then proceeded to take it global. And it’s no longer just radicals who see the need for radical change. In 2012, 21 past winners of the prestigious Blue Planet Prize – a group that includes James Hansen, former director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway – authored a landmark report. It stated that, “in the face of an absolutely unprecedented emergency, society has no choice but to take dramatic action to avert a collapse of civilization. Either we will change our ways and build an entirely new kind of global society, or they will be changed for us.” That’s tough for a lot of people in important positions to accept, since it challenges something that might be even more powerful than capitalism, and that is the fetish of centrism – of reasonableness, seriousness, splitting the difference, and generally not getting overly excited about anything. This is the habit of thought that truly rules our era, far more among the liberals who concern themselves with matters of climate policy than among conservatives, many of whom simply deny the existence of the crisis. Climate change presents a profound challenge to this cautious centrism because half measures won’t cut it: “all of the above energy” program, as US president Barack Obama describes his approach, has about as much chance of success as an all-of-the-above diet, and the firm deadlines imposed by science require that we get very worked up indeed. The challenge, then, is not simply that we need to spend a lot of money and change a lot of policies; it’s that we need to think differently, radically differently, for those changes to be remotely possible. A worldview will need to rise to the fore that sees nature, other nations, and our own neighbours not as adversaries, but rather as partners in a grand project of mutual reinvention. That’s a big ask. But it gets bigger. Because of our endless  procrastination, we also have to pull off this massive transformation without delay. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that if we do not get our emissions under control by a rather terrifying 2017, our fossil fuel economy will “lock-in” extremely dangerous warming. “The energy-related infrastructure then in place will generate all the CO2 emissions allowed” in our carbon budget for limiting warming to 2C – “leaving no room for additional power plants, factories and other infrastructure unless they are zero-carbon, which would be extremely costly”. This assumes, probably accurately, that governments would be unwilling to force the closure of still profitable power plants and factories. As Fatih Birol, the IEA’s chief economist, bluntly put it: “The door to reach two degrees is about to close. In 2017 it will be closed forever.” In short, we have reached what some activists have started calling “Decade Zero” of the climate crisis: we either change now or we lose our chance. All this means that the usual free market assurances – A techno-fix is around the corner! Dirty development is just a phase on the way to a clean environment, look at 19th-century London! – simply don’t add up. We don’t have a century to spare for China and India to move past their Dickensian phases. Because of our lost decades, it is time to turn this around now. Is it possible? Absolutely. Is it possible without challenging the fundamental logic of deregulated capitalism? Not a chance.  I was struck recently by a mea culpa of sorts, written by Gary Stix, a senior editor of Scientific American. Back in 2006, he edited a special issue on responses to climate change and, like most such efforts, the articles were narrowly focused on showcasing exciting low-carbon technologies.  But in 2012 Stix wrote that he had overlooked a much larger and more important part of the story – the need to create the social and political context in which these technological shifts stand a chance of displacing the all too profitable status quo. “If we are ever to cope with climate change in any fundamental way, radical solutions on the social side are where we must focus, though. The relative efficiency of the next generation of solar cells is trivial by comparison.” In other words, our problem has a lot less to do with the mechanics of solar power than the politics of human power – specifically whether there can be a shift in who wields it, a shift away from corporations and toward communities, which in turn depends on whether or not the great many people who are getting a rotten deal under our current system can build a determined and diverse enough social force to change the balance of power. Such a shift would require rethinking the very nature of humanity’s power – our right to extract ever more without facing consequences, our capacity to bend complex natural systems to our will. This is a shift that challenges not only capitalism, but also the building blocks of materialism that preceded modern capitalism, a mentality some call “extractivism”. Because, underneath all of this is the real truth we have been avoiding: climate change isn’t an “issue” to add to the list of things to worry about, next to healthcare and taxes. It is a civilisational wake-up call. A powerful message – spoken in the language of fires, floods, droughts, and extinctions – telling us that we need an entirely new economic model and a new way of sharing this planet. Telling us that we need to evolve. Some say there is no time for this transformation; the crisis is too pressing and the clock is ticking. I agree that it would be reckless to claim that the only solution to this crisis is to revolutionise our economy and revamp our worldview from the bottom up – and anything short of that is not worth doing. There are all kinds of measures that would lower emissions substantively that could and should be done right now. But we aren’t taking those measures, are we? The reason is that by failing to fight these big battles that stand to shift our ideological direction and change the balance of who holds power in our societies, a context has been slowly created in which any muscular response to climate change seems politically impossible, especially during times of economic crisis.  On the other hand, if we can shift the cultural context even a little, then there will be some breathing room for those sensible reformist policies that will at least get the atmospheric carbon numbers moving in the right direction. And winning is contagious so, who knows?  For a quarter of a century, we have tried the approach of polite incremental change, attempting to bend the physical needs of the planet to our economic model’s need for constant growth and new profit-making opportunities. The results have been disastrous, leaving us all in a great deal more danger than when the experiment began. Looking for a Moose is one of my two-year-old son’s favourite books. It’s about a bunch of kids that really, really, really want to see a moose. They search high and low – through a forest, a swamp, in brambly bushes and up a mountain, for “a long legged, bulgy nosed, branchy antlered moose”.  The joke is that there are moose hiding on each page. In the end, the animals all come out of hiding and the ecstatic kids proclaim: “We’ve never ever seen so many moose!” On about the 75th reading, it suddenly hit me: he might never see a moose. I tried to hold it together. I went back to my computer and began to write about my time in northern Alberta, tar sands country, where members of the Beaver Lake Cree Nation told me about how the moose had changed – one woman described killing a moose on a hunting trip only to find that the flesh had already turned green. I heard a lot about strange tumors too, which locals assumed had to do with the animals drinking water contaminated by tar sands toxins. But mostly I heard about how the moose were simply gone. And not just in Alberta. “Rapid Climate Changes Turn North Woods into Moose Graveyard,” reads a May 2012 headline in Scientific American. A year and a half later, The New York Times was reporting that one of Minnesota’s two moose populations had declined from four thousand in the 1990s to just one hundred today. Will he ever see a moose? Then, the other day, I was slain by a miniature board book called Snuggle Wuggle. It involves different animals cuddling, with each posture given a ridiculously silly name: “How does a bat hug?” it asks. “Topsy turvy, topsy turvy.” For some reason my son reliably cracks up at this page. I explain that it means upside down, because that’s the way bats sleep. But all I could think about was the report of some 100,000 dead and dying bats raining down from the sky in the midst of record-breaking heat across part of Queensland, Australia. Whole colonies devastated. Will he ever see a bat? When fear like that used to creep through my armour of climate change denial, I would do my utmost to stuff it away, change the channel, click past it. Now I try to feel it. It seems to me that I owe it to my son, just as we all owe it to ourselves and one another. But what should we do with this fear that comes from living on a planet that is dying, made less alive every day? First, accept that it won’t go away. That it is a fully rational response to the unbearable reality that we are living in a dying world, a world that a great many of us are helping to kill, by doing things like making tea and driving to the grocery store and yes, okay, having kids. Next, use it. Fear is a survival response. Fear makes us run, it makes us leap, it can make us act superhuman. But we need somewhere to run to. Without that, the fear is only paralysing. So the real trick, the only hope, really, is to allow the terror of an unlivable future to be balanced and soothed by the prospect of building something much better than many of us have previously dared hope. Yes, there will be things we will lose, luxuries some of us will have to give up, whole industries that will disappear. Climate change is already here, and increasingly brutal disasters are headed our way no matter what we do. But it’s not too late to avert the worst, and there is still time to change ourselves so that we are far less brutal to one another when those disasters strike. And that, it seems to me, is worth a great deal. Because the thing about a crisis this big, this all-encompassing, is that it changes everything. It changes what we can do, what we can hope for, what we can demand from ourselves and our leaders. It means there is a whole lot of stuff that we have been told is inevitable that simply cannot stand. And it means that a whole lot of stuff we have been told is impossible has to start happening right away. Can we pull it off? All I know is that nothing is inevitable. Nothing except that climate change changes everything. And for a very brief time, the nature of that change is still up to us."

"In the early 1700s, investing in ventures that used slave labour was considered to be a normal and prudent practice among financiers. In this context, abolitionist campaigners had two options. Either they could talk the language of the merchant banks and traders, arguing that it is unproductive, unprofitable and reputationally damaging to finance slavery. Or, alternatively, they could argue that it is just plain wrong, regardless of profitability. Slave labour could be delegitimised as a backward and embarrassing relic of a medieval economy, not fit for an enlightenment era.  The fossil-free divestment movement faces a similar societal dynamic right now. Continued investment in fossil fuel extraction is a recipe for ecological and humanitarian crisis, but large investors plough money into it as if it were perfectly prudent. The aim of divestment movements is to delegitimise the apparent normality of such practice, and to showcase the fossil fuel industry as an entrenched relic of the industrial age resisting attempts to modernise. In the course of this battle, divestment movements face a similar choice to that of the abolitionists. Does one argue within the existing terms of the financial mainstream – asserting that fossils fuels are not a prudent investment – or do you attempt to challenge those existing terms, arguing that such investment is simply wrong, regardless of whether it is profitable or not? The language of mainstream investment is the language of risk and return, in which investors ask themselves “how much money do I have to put in, relative to how much money I get out over time?” In practice, this means an investor is going to assess three things. Firstly, how much does it cost? Secondly, how much can they expect to get back from it in terms of predicted future cash flows? Thirdly, what is the risk that those cash flows will actually not materialise?  These basic building blocks of investment desirability can be used by divestment campaigners. To challenge an investor thinking of putting money into a coal corporation, for example, you should argue three things. Firstly, that the costs of doing so are inflated. Secondly, that the imagined future cash flows are actually much lower than expected. Thirdly, that the risks of those returns not materialising are much higher than expected. The Carbon Bubble argument, for example, attempts to show that fossil fuel investments are overvalued, by arguing that they are based on false expectations of future cash flows, stemming from the imagined sale of fossil fuel reserves that cannot actually be allowed to be burned. Arguing in such terms of financial risk and return naturally leads to risk management solutions. Thus, groups such as the Asset Owners Disclosure Project call for large investors to “hedge” the risk of their carbon-intensive portfolios with investments in low-carbon projects. The strength of these approaches is that they tap into a rationality that mainstream investors readily understand, taking seriously the constraints and incentives that a fund manager may face.  On the other hand, they sometimes appear shallow. Given that investors are frequently focusing on shorter-term profitability, is it really less profitable to invest in fossil fuels? And, while it’s true that a carbon bubble exists conceptually, does it really impact the fund manager right now? Many campaigners are thus suspicious of reformist approaches that accept the terms set by the mainstream investment industry. Talking in terms of monetary returns may get the ear of investors, but only at the risk of implicitly legitimising that existing rationality. Consider, for example, this question, frequently asked within investment circles: ‘Will sustainable investment impact our returns?’ Sustainable finance professionals are often quick to buy into the terms set by that question, passionately arguing that high-carbon investment won’t actually be profitable in the long run. The alternative approach, however, is simply to deny the validity of the question, rejecting the idea that monetary profitability should hold any moral weight, and pointing out that an investment framework that has the ability to view planetary-level disruption as justifiable is simply unacceptable.  Even if fossil fuels are profitable, and even if sustainable investment is less profitable, financial returns are invalid if the broader stability of human society is undermined in the process of obtaining them.  Indeed, investors often fetishise monetary returns without thinking about the world in which those monetary returns will have to be spent. This is partially due to misunderstanding the nature of money, which is best thought of not as an independent “thing”, but rather as a claim upon society. What is the point of amassing such monetary claims if the society in which I can use them in has become a lot less liveable?   Divestment campaigns engage young people into politicising investments that will impact their future. They recast fund managers and investors as political agents who wield power over how the world of the future will look. They erode the social license of the financial sector to engage in unsustainable investment, while simultaneously offering it a new role in creatively investing in a better world. In practice, divestment campaigns – and other sustainable finance movements – work best when they blend together the two broad schools of argument sketched out above. In the short-term, it can help to tap into the language of mainstream finance, but the most profound changes come from breaking down social acceptance of the existing norms of investment. The two approaches converge in three areas. Firstly, in the campaign to broaden the notion of fiduciary duty. It is not acceptable for fund managers to hide behind their apparent duty to a narrow group of clients as an excuse for not considering the future stability of human society. Secondly, they find common ground in the quest to redefine the time horizon in which investments should be assessed. Investors must move beyond the short-term interests of a few, and focus on the broad long-term interests of future generations.  And thirdly, they converge in the battle to incorporate non-monetary returns and losses into investment assessments. People would be far better off with lower monetary returns within a healthier environment to enjoy those returns in, than they are with higher monetary returns in a compromised, unstable world.

"In all those sci-fi horror stories foretelling the end of the world, the imagined reaction was never boredom. Panic and hysteria, yes. Sex with strangers, most certainly. We could picture all that at the moment doomsday loomed. But inertia, inattention and a shrugging desire to turn over to the other channel – well, HG Wells never foresaw that. Yet that is the collective reaction of our species to the warnings that we are frying our planet. People barely discuss climate change. Research shows that most have never mentioned it outside their immediate family; one in three have never talked about it at all. When asked to list the issues that matter most, voters put global warming at or near the bottom of the league – and that’s only if prompted. Most wouldn’t even think of it. Faced with a climate catastrophe, our response is catatonia.  When candid, news editors and TV producers admit they presume their audience files climate change under “worthy but dull”. They know they should care, but they struggle. It’s this torpor that those marching in London on Saturday are trying to break through – and which the Guardian is trying to puncture with its new series today. But it is an uphill struggle. For the media, climate change is Kryptonite. It fails to tick almost every one of the boxes that defines a story. For one thing, it’s not new: it’s a perennial part of the background noise of 21st-century life. If John F Kennedy had two in-trays on his desk, one marked “urgent,” the other “important”, climate change falls into what the media regard as the wrong category. It’s important but doesn’t feel urgent. It lacks a hard deadline: there’s a Paris summit in December but there have been summits before. The climate crisis lacks a specific location. What places there are – those that will be hit first by, say, rising water levels – are far away. It’s long on technical details, stats and numbers, and short on human narrative – it lacks a clearly defined, single villain. Above all, it’s a bit of a downer. Plenty of news is depressing – Isis, child abuse, austerity – but a world rendered uninhabitable to human beings? Faced with that, who wouldn’t rather talk about the boy who turned up at school dressed as Christian Grey? True, the press don’t do much to challenge this, but the cast of mind goes far beyond journalists. Cognitive psychologists speak of “loss aversion”: when presented with a choice between a relatively small sacrifice now and an uncertain but larger loss a generation from now, human beings rarely make the apparently obvious and rational move, to make the sacrifice. Add to that our “optimism bias”: the tendency to assume that all will be well in the end – that “they” will think of some whizzy technical fix to keep the world’s temperature stable, and humanity will dodge the bullet. What makes all this harder is not only the absence of a villain, but the fact that the most obvious culprit is us. As George Marshall, author of Don’t Even Think About It: Why our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change, puts it: “There is no outsider to blame. We are just living our lives – driving the kids to school, heating our homes, putting food on the table.” That can induce a sentiment terminal to any campaign: fatalism. If nothing less than total transformation is required, then we might as well give up. Climate catastrophe soon occupies the same psychological space we reserve for death itself: an awful, inevitable fact of life that we shove to the margins, where we won’t have to contemplate it. In the words of one cognitive theorist, “A psychologist could barely dream up a better scenario for paralysis.” If this is the mountain in humanity’s way, how can we hope to get around it? First, campaigners have to present their case as a simple, compelling story that everyone can understand. This argument, like any political argument, won’t be won with data and graphs but with a narrative. It has to address our hearts, not our heads. The appeal of the phrase that animates the Guardian’s campaign – “Keep it in the ground” – is that it is simple and intelligible. We can’t burn the coal, oil and gas that’s in the ground without torching our precious planet, so let’s keep it in the ground. But that’s only a start. Next, the case for the climate has to be at least as much about remedy as diagnosis. If climate campaigners are heard as constant purveyors of gloom, they won’t be heeded. Even the medieval preachers forever reminding their flocks death was coming tempered the message with the promise of salvation. In this regard Naomi Klein’s book, This Changes Everything, is a good example of how it should be done, offering a solution to every problem. But that still leaves what may be the largest political challenge. Right now, climate change has become an issue of the left. One look at the speakers lined up for today’s London rally confirms it: trade union leaders, the Labour MP John McDonnell and Russell Brand. In the US, climate scepticism has become one of the defining traits of the right, a more reliable marker even than attitudes to abortion or gun control. This is a disaster. If the threat to our planet is a preoccupation confined to only one half of the political spectrum, meaningful action will never come. This has to be the cause of all humanity. That means a new, additional climate case has to be made, one that will appeal to the right – and come from the right. That’s hardly an impossibility. Who was the first world leader to dedicate a speech to climate change, but Margaret Thatcher in 1989? Angela Merkel is as sound as any left politician on the subject. Had John McCain beaten Barack Obama in 2008, the US would still have had a president who understands the climate crisis. A climate campaign of the right would appeal to values and identity over data. It might, says Marshall, use the vocabulary of “pollution”, and frame climate change as a matter of inter-generational debt: yet another burden we are unjustly passing on to our children and grandchildren. It would talk less of protecting the abstract global “environment” and more of conserving the visible, local “landscape”. Some greens would experience this as a painful compromise. But it is unavoidable. The alternative is a noisy chapel where the preacher stirs the converted – while outside there is only the rustling silence of a world that would rather look the other way."
"The UK government has become embroiled in a row over financial support for fossil fuel companies after announcing a $1bn (£660m) funding package involving Pemex, the Mexican state oil group. Greenpeace said the move to provide credit for “dirty” energy projects under the UK Export Finance (UKEF) scheme flew counter to the government’s commitments to fighting climate change.  The Tories and Lib Dems pledged in 2010 that export finance would be used to champion British companies that developed and exported innovative green technologies around the world, “instead of supporting investment in dirty fossil fuel energy production”. “The truth is that the ‘greenest government ever’ has spent the last five years bankrolling some of the dirtiest energy developments on the planet, from Russian coal mining to the Saudi oil industry,” said Lawrence Carter, a Greenpeace UK energy campaigner. “Our ministers should stop acting like the merchant bankers of climate change and start using export finance to promote the cutting-edge clean technologies that are reshaping energy markets the world over.”  The financing agreement was revealed during a visit to Aberdeen by Matthew Hancock, the UK energy minister, alongside Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto who is on a wider state trip to the UK. Mexico’s energy system is undergoing significant reform and Nieto was visiting Scotland to speak to energy leaders across the business and education sectors, as well as signing agreements with the UK government for greater collaboration in the areas of energy and climate change. “This visit today by President Peña Nieto to the UK’s energy capital cements the already close links between our two countries and heralds an era of closer collaboration in energy,” said Hancock. “The government of Mexico expects $50bn of investment by 2018 in the wake of its energy reforms – boosting the economy and creating jobs while rejuvenating production,” he added.   Over the course of the parliament, UK Export Finance, a small government department, has given financial support worth only £3.6m to green energy projects around the world, it was revealed last month through data released to the Guardian under freedom of information rules. A spokesperson for UKEF said the memorandum of understanding with Mexico was to work “towards” a line of credit and was not a firm commitment at this stage, or an investment.  “UK Export Finance’s role is to provide financial support to UK exporters, primarily through providing insurance to exporters and guarantees to banks that enable them to take advantage of overseas contracts. As part of that, we have a dedicated Environmental Advisory team which reviews the environmental, social and human rights issues of projects covered by the OECD’s Common Approaches, prior to the department agreeing to provide support.” Nieto was being introduced in Aberdeen to executives from BP and Shell, both of which have made no secret of their desire to enter the Mexican energy sector, which has been largely closed to foreign firms. There is considerable excitement in western oil capitals about the onshore shale prospects that exist in Mexico. Equally, there are unexplored deep-water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, across the territorial dividing line from large US discoveries."

"One already clear sign of climate change in Britain is that it rains harder. That, plus continuous adding of new estates onto existing towns, has meant that drains designed for a different era are sometimes overwhelmed. This was particularly obvious in 2007 when 55,000 properties were damaged by floods and as many as two-thirds of these householders suffered simply because the drains were unable to cope with heavy rain.  An expert review came to the conclusion that developers should be forced to provide sustainable drainage systems, dubbed SuDs, in the form of ponds, soakaways and grassy depressions so that storm water could run away and not overwhelm the local sewage system. To make sure house builders did this their automatic right to connect to the existing sewage system should be removed. The government, having been lobbied hard by the house building industry, has watered down the proposals so much that Lord Krebs, chairman of the statutory Adaptation sub-committee, has written to Elizabeth Truss, the environment secretary, to complain that with summer storms predicted to get five times more intense by 2080 this is a bad mistake. He protests that 100,000 minor planning applications annually have been exempted from providing SuDs and the automatic right to connect any development to main drainage remains – even if new estates would lead to the local sewage works being overwhelmed. The government response has been that it is up to local government planning departments to force developers to do the right thing. Lord Krebs ripostes that there is no sign of this happening. • This article was amended on 16 March 2015. An earlier version said Lord Krebs reposts, rather than ripostes."
"A beautiful new species of carnivorous marsupial has been discovered in far south-eastern Queensland and adjacent north-eastern New South Wales. Isolated at high altitude on the Tweed volcanic caldera, in areas of high rainfall, the distinctness of the Black-tailed Antechinus had escaped scientists until now. The genus Antechinus includes 15 species from Australia. Short-haired with large ears, long whiskers and a pointed snout, these marsupials somewhat resemble shrews in general appearance. Antechinus are small, measuring nose-to-tail from 12 to 20cm and weighing no more than 180g. Males are larger than females and newborns tiny, weighing in at about 4g. The number of surviving young in a litter varies from four to 14, depending on how many teats the mother has in her pouch. Gestation is rapid, taking about four weeks.  Antechinus are in the family Dasyuridae – carnivorous marsupials. The family includes 76 species, limited to Australia and New Guinea. Among them are other small and similarly mouse-like species, but also the cat-sized quolls and the Tasmanian devil, which for their size have the most powerful jaws of any mammal. While diets vary, occasionally including fruits, pollen and vertebrates, most dasyurids are predominantly insectivorous. Specimens of the new species, Antechinus arktos, were previously known to mammalogists but had been falsely assumed to belong to a common and widely distributed mainland subspecies of the Dusky Antechinus, A swainsonii mimetes. Andrew M Baker and Thomas Y Mutton of the Queensland University of Technology, with co-authors Harry B Hines of the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and Steve Van Dyck of the Queensland Museum, have clarified the evolutionary significance of the Black-tailed Antechinus and called attention to its probably threatened status. Baker and his colleagues, noticing the yellow-orange colouration around the eyes and rump of the new species, as well as its black tail and hind feet, suspected that it might be more than a mere colour variant of Dusky Antechinus. A mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that populations of A arktos differ from those of A swainsonii by 10%, a large, species-sized gap between two supposed populations of a single species. Armed with this genetic insight, the scientists reexamined anatomical details, confirming several consistent differences. The more vibrant yellow-orange markings on the upper and lower eyelids and cheeks in front of the ears, the similarly coloured rump, and the evenly black hind feet and tail stand in contrast to the Dusky Antechnus. A swainsonii has a more uniformly coloured body with brownish-grey hair; its hind feet and tail have brown fur. As well as having a very limited geographic distribution, A arktos appears to be locally rare. In spite of evidence that these animals will readily enter traps, extensive efforts to capture them were largely unsuccessful: in 2013-2014 10,000 traps were deployed with only 10 individuals found at a single site. More disturbingly, specimens were not found at some lower-altitude sites where they had once been documented to exist, suggesting that their range may be shrinking. The team reporting the new species fears that climate change is having an impact on populations and that a continued warming trend will place them at even greater risk as they have nowhere left to run, being at the very summit of the World Heritage-listed rainforest of Springbrook. Their recommendation is that the Black-tailed Antechinus be considered endangered and that field studies of its status be continued as they race against time to save the species from extinction. Like other members of its genus, A arktos is short-lived and semelparous, that is, males reproduce only once in their lifetime. Males and females are promiscuous, often enthusiastically so, with copulation lasting up to 14 hours. At the end of the one-to three-week mating period, all males drop dead – victims of raging testosterone, which causes a malfunction in the stress-hormone cutoff switch. As a result, their immune system shuts down, their hair falls out, they become infested with ticks and mites and death inevitably follows, from internal bleeding or infection. When females give birth a couple of weeks later, not a single male is left alive to help rear the young. Offspring in a single litter are often fathered by multiple males as the female is capable of storing sperm for a few days prior to fertilisation.  "

"Next Monday, Oxford University is expected to decide whether or not to rid its £2bn endowment of risky fossil fuel investments. This decision comes after almost two years of student organising, academic and alumni petition drives, marches, rallies, and teach-ins. As someone involved in the campaign, it is incredibly gratifying – and a little scary – to finally reach this point. That we have reached this point is thanks to the growing momentum of the international fossil fuel divestment movement and the combined mobilising efforts of people across Oxford.  The idea of fossil fuel divestment, seemingly a radical pipedream just a few years ago, has taken hold remarkably fast. From Stanford’s decision to divest from coal to the Rockefeller heirs’ commitment to move their oil fortune out of fossil fuels, the dominoes keep falling. Each new win makes it that much easier for our Oxford campaign to argue that divestment is not a fringe notion; rather, it is something that a reputation-conscious institution can sign up to, and even garner mainstream praise in the process.   Inspired by all the international activity, we launched our Oxford campaign with a scrappy motion to present at the student union council. Since then, we’ve faced a steep learning curve.  We’ve worked to mould our demands into something that the university will not reject outright but that still challenges it to take meaningful steps on a road to full divestment. This effort culminated in a lengthy report, which calls on Oxford to immediately drop all direct investments in coal and tar sands, the most polluting of fossil fuels. It also recommends that Oxford continuously review all investments, and so, progressively rid its endowment of fossil fuels and other high-carbon assets.  The report certainly helped our campaign gain credibility in the eyes of the university. The real momentum, though, came from the dozens of debates in college common rooms, speaker events with Oxford professors, rallies, and ‘carbon bubble’ parades on the highstreet, not to mention dinosaur fossil costumes. Through all this, the campaign gained the support of over 100 academics, nearly 550 alumni, and over 2,200 others, as well as 27 college common rooms and the Oxford University student union.  The numbers don’t capture the feel of the campaign, though. The real drive has come from talking about climate change not as some hopeless crisis, but as a challenge we can do something about. It has been a learn-as-you-go process with panel discussions that stretch on for hours and people previously distanced from climate change issues talking excitedly about the possibilities.  The very idea of divestment catches people’s attention, inviting new, challenging questions: what happens to our carbon-intensive global energy system? And what about the pervasive influence of fossil fuels on our politics and wealth distribution?  On the flip side, many people are beginning to get excited about a less centralised, more affordable access to renewable power, less environmental degradation with cleaner water and healthier land – especially for the more vulnerable frontline communities. As so aptly captured in the title of Naomi Klein’s new book, tackling the climate crisis ‘changes everything’. Of course, fossil fuel divestment is a small part of a much broader climate movement, but even so, it has helped unite disparate parts of that larger campaign.  Oxford is a small-scale example of this uniting effect. The support of academics and alumni aside, the student campaign would not be where it is now without the help of the Oxford city campaign. The city group, in turn, introduced us to campaigners in the church, trade unions, and the Art not Oil performing arts coalition. Beyond Oxford, we’ve been in touch with other students at Soas, Cambridge and UCL, and shared a platform with Natalie Bennett of the Green party at a recent panel discussion. We’ve also had support from People and Planet and 350.org, who’ve taught us a thing or two about how to mobilise. If the university divests, it will add to the critical mass of institutions that are demonstrating how to invest in a liveable planet. It will also multiply tenfold a message that is already sinking in within Oxford itself: that we need a new common sense, one where climate change is a top priority. "
"Your warning on the disaster that climate change could bring if we don’t reduce our use of resources (Wraparound of main section, 7 March) comes in an edition that comprises 118 Berliner-size pages, a fashion magazine, a television guide, a general magazine, a cookery supplement, five advertising supplements, four advertising flyers and a plastic bag. Need one say more?Gerrard RavenTeddington, Middlesex • Three cheers for Alan Rusbridger’s valedictory initiative to wrap the Guardian in the compelling narrative of climate-change action. The exhortation to other organisations to desist from fossil-fuel use is duly noted. So when will the Guardian discontinue full-page colour advertisements for carbon-intensive luxuries, such as gas-guzzling status cars, business-class air travel in petro-state-owned airlines, and extravagant international holidays? Or is the whole business less black-and-white than the ink on your page suggests? What if we focus instead on addressing the huge gaps in current engineering capability to deliver the needed change?

"Byron Bay has become the first place in Australia outside the major cities to commit to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions to zero over the next 10 years. Byron shire, which encompasses Byron Bay and parts of the New South Wales north coast hinterland, said it aimed to be a “zero emissions community” by 2025 by cutting greenhouse gases in a range of areas.  The plan will involve boosting renewable energy uptake, retrofitting existing buildings, creating new public transport options and electric vehicle opportunities, changing land use practices and improving the management of waste and water. The council will be the first to use research conducted by Beyond Zero Emissions on how to take Australia’s economy into “negative emissions” and help global efforts to avert the prospect of dangerous climate change. Beyond Zero Emissions said it was in conversation with a number of other councils to implement similar emissions-cutting strategies. The City of Sydney and the City of Melbourne both have policies to be “carbon neutral”, while the South Australian government announced a similar plan for Adelaide last month. Simon Richardson, mayor of Byron Shire, said the region was already making efforts to cut emissions through its strong take-up of rooftop solar and its launch of a community-owned clean energy generator and retailer last year. “Byron is a logical fit for this because we are well on the path with renewable energy – you don’t need to twist many arms in Byron,” Richardson told Guardian Australia. “Beyond Zero Emissions have put together a roadmap and we’ve taken up the mantle. It’s a whole-of-community approach, with renewable energy, agriculture and buildings.” Richardson said the details of any incentives or penalties to push down emissions still needed to be finalised, but that he was confident Byron could get state or federal funding where needed. “Transport is probably the biggest challenge as public transport around here is pretty poor but we’ve got a rail corridor that’s underutilised,” he said. “We’ve had indications from the state government that they want to explore this space. There’s an economic argument too, not just a feel-good environmental outcome. We can save money from polluting industries, there are clear economic benefits.” Beyond Zero Emissions has developed research on removing emissions from waste, energy, transport and land use with the help of the University of Queensland and the University of Melbourne. Steve Bygrave, chief executive of the non-government organisation, said there’s a “very holistic” approach councils can take to lower emissions. “We’ve shown that every existing building in Australia can be retrofitted to become zero emissions,” he said. “Better public transport and electric vehicles won’t happen overnight, but we want to roll this out to every community in Australia. “There is a lot of frustration with the national government, as shown by the lack of vision in the intergenerational report when it came to climate change. People on the ground just want to get on with it, regardless of the lack of progress nationally, and councils are well placed to do that. “The required scale of action needed on climate change is unparalleled. But when you look at large changes in the past, it always comes from the bottom up. Political leaders have to respond to action on the ground.” Bygrave said he had spoken to councils in Victoria and NSW and would be targeting Queensland’s Sunshine Coast next to get further commitments to slash emissions to zero."
"The Guardian’s focus on climate change is to be welcomed (Why we put the climate on the cover, 7 March) – but needs to inform all its political and economic content for years to come and not be just one more issue that is addressed and ticked off before attention moves elsewhere again. I am hoping there will be much to stimulate readers around what we can do, as individuals and communities, actively to hobble the headlong rush of humanity over the precipice.  For a start, with the election looming, we can challenge candidates and parties on their commitments. This could, for example, involve redirecting the £6bn of subsidies for the fossil-fuel industry away from anything to do with extraction and towards clean and renewable sources of energy. It could bring an end to fracking in the UK and re-establish the pre-eminence of the Climate Change Act over the recent covert introduction of conflicting commitments in the Infrastructure Act. Simple questions, the answers to which may determine whether a candidate deserves your vote or not. And we need to confront one of the great “socially constructed silences” (thank you, George Marshall) around climate change. We need to reduce our demand for energy: to accept we can no longer do what we want, when we want, without taking into account the impact on the world around us and on future generations. It might be a message that the Guardian’s advertisers are uncomfortable seeing promoted, but we need to consume less, or Monty Python’s M Creosote sketch may come to feel like a prescient allegory for the last years of the Anthropocene.Dave HunterBristol  • Naomi Klein is right to say (Report, 7 March) that regardless of how hard I try to live differently, I inevitably blink first. Even if I fully acknowledge what is happening, what choice do I have but to continue living in the world as it is? Every time I get into my car, I look away. Every time I buy something, I look away. Every time I heat my house, I look away. But if I cannot look to governments to take a lead, I have no choice but to look to my own actions. Surely the only way is that we each do what we can, with what we have, where we are. Individual life changes do count, both psychologically and materially. They hasten the tipping point. It is hypocritical for those who realise the immensity of the threat to continue living as if individual efforts make no difference – especially flying the world to attend ironic conferences about climate change. If there is a way to live now, one which effectively out-stares the monster of climate change, surely those who know this have an obligation to set an example, to show how it can be done. Martin SandbrookMinchinhampton, Gloucestershire • There is a simple way to cut our personal greenhouse gas emissions by 50% overnight. Stop eating meat and dairy. The UN calculates that 51% of all greenhouse gas emission impacts derive from animal agriculture (direct and indirect CO2 emissions, plus other impacts such as methane and ammonia - as reported in Pollutionwatch, 9 March 2015). Meat and dairy also account for massive freshwater pollution through agricultural run-off; soil erosion (as highlighted in the Guardian many times by George Monbiot); the feeding of over 70% of the world’s human-fit grain to animals; depletion of fish in the oceans (ground fishmeal is a common ingredient of animal feed); the waste of vast amounts of fresh water; habitat destruction and land misuse on a huge scale – not least the destruction of rainforest, particularly in the Amazon basin, driven by cattle grazing and soya production, the majority of which is fed to animals. Going vegan is by far the most effective single action individuals can take to cut emissions, much more effective than fiddling with your central heating, or changing your car, or holiday destination. Going vegan has none of the time lags of other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; you can do it today, with immediate effect and with zero cost.Miles HalpinWirksworth, Derbyshire • You would think, reading most of what is written, that a greener life is a harder life. It’s as if the major changes consumers need to make to prevent climate catastrophe involve hair-shirt privation. Naomi Klein alludes only briefly to the notion that a society run within our means would be a better one for all, both individually and collectively. But where we live more simply and locally, our mental and physical health is enhanced and we also have far less impact on the environment. And for people to make these changes, there is no need to wait for the government or scientists. It is our consumption of their products that makes producers increase carbon emissions. We must emphasise the many positives of a life free from addiction to fossil fuels.Barry O’DonovanLondon • Naomi Klein acknowledges that the carbon emitted into the atmosphere remains there for hundreds of years. Yet progress around the world continues to be measured in terms of carbon reductions which, however impressive when revealed as efficiency gains, energy-renewables switching or low-carbon developments, make no contribution to reducing its concentration. It can only reduce the rate at which the concentration goes on rising. Evidence of ice melting in the polar regions indicates that the tipping point beyond which this process can now be reversed has already passed. The Global Commons Institute’s recent carbon budget allocation tool reveals the outcome of any proposal in relation to any budget under consideration. Sadly, there is no escape from coming to terms with the model’s figures on, for instance, sea-level rises, acidification and temperature increase.Dr Mayer HillmanSenior fellow emeritus, Policy Studies Institute • Alan Rusbridger is right that we need to leave most proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground if we are to avoid disaster. But let’s be clear what that would involve. This massive cut in supply would cause a massive increase in the price of energy, unless governments throughout the world were to introduce strict rationing. Either way, most of us would rarely be indulging in carbon-hungry activities such as flying in planes, driving our cars or eating red meat. Policies such as carbon pricing, which many people call for, would not overcome this reality; they would be mechanisms for implementing it.  How many people would vote for these dramatic changes in lifestyle? I would. I hope many other Guardian readers would. But most people would not. That is why we have to invest in another strategy if we are serious about preventing runaway climate change: this is carbon scrubbing, geoengineering and reforestation. This can be funded by a financial transaction tax that only needs the consent of the 10 or so leading economies. It wouldn’t be easy, but it is possible, whereas agreeing and actually implementing a worldwide policy of leaving most of the oil, coal and gas in the ground is not.Richard MountfordTonbridge, Kent"
"The world has much more coal, oil and gas in the ground than it can safely burn. That much is physics.  Anyone studying the question with an open mind will almost certainly come to a similar conclusion: if we and our children are to have a reasonable chance of living stable and secure lives 30 or so years from now, according to one recent study 80% of the known coal reserves will have to stay underground, along with half the gas and a third of the oil reserves. If only science were enough.  If not science, then politics? MPs, presidents, prime ministers and members of congress are always telling us (often suggesting a surrender of civil liberties in return) that their first duty is the protection of the public.  But politics sometimes struggles with physics. Science is, at its best, long term and gives the best possible projection of future risk. Which is not always how politics works, even when it comes to our security. Politicians prefer certainty and find it difficult to make serious prudent planning on high probabilities.  On climate change, the public clamour is in inverse proportion to the enormity of the long-term threat. If only it were the other way round. And so, year after year, the people who represent us around the UN negotiating tables have moved inches, not miles.  When, as Guardian colleagues, we first started discussing this climate change series, there were advocates for focusing the main attention on governments. States own much of the fossil fuels that can never be allowed to be dug up. Only states, it was argued, can forge the treaties that count. In the end the politicians will have to save us through regulation – either by limiting the amount of stuff that is extracted, or else by taxing, pricing and limiting the carbon that’s burned.  If journalism has so far failed to animate the public to exert sufficient pressure on politics through reporting and analysis, it seemed doubtful whether many people would be motivated by the idea of campaigning for a paragraph to be inserted into the negotiating text at the UN climate talks in Paris this December. So we turned to an area where campaigners have recently begun to have marked successes: divestment.  There are two arguments in favour of moving money out of the biggest and most aggressive fossil fuel companies – one moral, the other financial. The moral crusaders – among them Archbishop Desmond Tutu – see divestment from fossil fuels in much the same light as earlier campaigners saw the push to pull money out of tobacco, arms, apartheid South Africa – or even slavery. Most fossil fuel companies, they argue, have little concern for future generations. Of course, the companies are run by sentient men and women with children and grandchildren of their own. But the market pressures and fiduciary duties involved in running public companies compel behaviour that is overwhelmingly driven by short-term returns.  So – the argument goes – the directors will meanwhile carry on business as usual, no matter how incredible it may seem that they will be allowed to dig up all the climate-warming assets they own. And, by and large – and discounting recent drops in the price of oil – they continue to be reasonably good short-term businesses, benefiting from enormous subsidies as they search for even more reserves that can never be used.  The pragmatists argue the case on different grounds. It is simply this: that finance will eventually have to surrender to physics. If – eventually – the companies cannot, for the sake of the human race, be allowed to extract a great many of the assets they own, then many of those assets will in time become valueless. So people with other kinds of fiduciary duty – people, say, managing endowments, pension funds and investment portfolios – will want to get their money out of these companies before the bubble bursts. Of course, the financial risk comes not simply from the threat of regulation, but could also be hastened by the march of alternative clean energy. Global investment in clean energy jumped 16% in 2014 to £205bn, but because of the rapid drop in the price of that energy (the cost of solar has dropped by two-thirds in 6 years), the money invested last year bought almost double the amount of electricity capacity as in 2011. So there’s a risk calculation to be done by anyone invested in fossil fuels – which, one way or another, is probably most of us. Get out too early and you might forgo the reasonable returns based on current performance and the book value of the assets that are notionally exploitable. But what of the risk of being a late exiter? Do you wait and judge when the politicians could finally summon the will to start making regulatory and market interventions … and then get out? And at the same time as everyone else is trying to do the same?  This is why the divestment movement has changed from being a fringe campaign to something every responsible fund manager can no longer ignore. How could they, when even the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned that the “vast majority of reserves are unburnable” and the bank itself is conducting an inquiry into the risk that inflated fossil fuel assets pose to the stability of the financial system?  When the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, urges: “Be the first mover. Use smart due diligence. Rethink what fiduciary responsibility means in this changing world. It’s simple self-interest. Every company, investor and bank that screens new and existing investments for climate risk is simply being pragmatic”? When the Bank of England’s deputy head of supervision for banks and insurance companies, Paul Fisher, warns, as he did this month: “As the world increasingly limits carbon emissions, and moves to alternative energy sources, investments in fossil fuels – a growing financial market in recent decades – may take a huge hit”? Or listen to Hank Paulson, no bleeding liberal, but secretary of the Treasury under Bush and former CEO of Goldman Sachs: “Each of us must recognise that the risks are personal. We’ve seen and felt the costs of underestimating the financial bubble. Let’s not ignore the climate bubble.”  President Obama puts it most pithily: “We’re not going to be able to burn it all.”  So the argument for a campaign to divest from the world’s most polluting companies is becoming an overwhelming one, on both moral and pragmatic grounds. But the divestment movement is sometimes misunderstood. The intention is not to bankrupt the companies, nor to promote overnight withdrawal from fossil fuels – that would not be possible or desirable.  Divestment serves to delegitimise the business models of companies that are using investors’ money to search for yet more coal, oil and gas that can’t safely be burned. It is a small but crucial step in the economic transition away from a global economy run on fossil fuels. The usual rule of newspaper campaigns is that you don’t start one unless you know you’re going to win it. This one will almost certainly be won in time: the physics is unarguable. But we are launching our campaign today in the firm belief that it will force the issue now into the boardrooms and inboxes of people who have billions of dollars at their disposal.  It’s clear, from our researches over the past few weeks, that many company directors and fund managers have had a nagging feeling that this is something coming up the agenda that – one day – they will have to think about. As the Guardian’s campaign mounts, we hope they will appreciate that there is some urgency about the choices they make.  Who will take the lead? Some huge endowments and investment funds have already announced that they will be decarbonising their portfolios, exiting fossil fuels altogether and/or investing in cleaner alternatives. They include the Rockefeller Brothers Fund; Stanford, Glasgow and Australian National Universities; the British Medical Association; Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, which has sold off 32 coal companies on climate and environmental grounds; AP4, the giant Swedish pension fund; and many other faith groups, local councils and asset managers. The World Council of Churches has committed not to invest. Our own campaign will give readers the information they need to make their own investment decisions and to apply pressure on the workplaces, unions, schools, colleges, churches, NGOs, pension advisers and charities in their lives. But we also want to try to change minds at one or two institutions that have demonstrated inspiring thought leadership in other spheres of life. The Wellcome Trust handles a portfolio of more than £18bn and invests around £700m a year in science, the humanities, social science education and medical research. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has an endowment of $43.5bn. Last year it gave away $3.9bn in grants towards health and sustainable development. In 2014 the Wellcome Trust had £564m invested in Shell, BP, Schlumberger, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton alone. The Gates Foundation has a financial stake of over $1bn in fossil fuel companies. By most standards, these are huge sums of money, helping to fund the extraction of unusable oil gas and coal on a massive scale. But, as a proportion of the foundations’ own endowments, they are relatively small – just a few percent for the fossil fuel investments we know about. So they could, we think, be divested without damaging overall returns. Indeed, we think they could achieve higher and, over time, safer returns by putting their money into other investments with real opportunities for growth in a world tackling climate change Because both foundations are a) so progressive in their aims and actions and b) have human health and science at the heart of everything they do, we hope they, of all institutions, will see the force of the call for them to move their money out of a sector whose actions, if unchecked, could cause the most devastating harm to the health of billions. A landmark report by the Lancet and University College London concluded in 2009: “Climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.” The ask of them is, we think, both modest and simple. We understand that fund managers do not like to make sudden changes to their portfolios. So we ask that the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust commit now to divesting from the top 200 fossil fuel companies within five years. And that they immediately freeze any new investment in the same companies.  We will, of course, suggest that the Guardian Media Group does the same, and keeps you informed about its own deliberations and decisions.  Please sign, retweet and generally spread news about the petition. In everything we say to these foundations, we will emphasise that we come in admiration for what they have done, and continue to do for human health and wellbeing. They aren’t the “bad guys”. But they could certainly show themselves to be the good guys in this matter of life and death. One final thing. This campaign is going to be backed up by much reporting and analysis. We would be very pleased to hear from anyone working in the fossil fuel industries at a senior level, either currently or recently. We are interested, for instance, to learn about internal discussions and papers about the state of knowledge and debate about the environmental harm caused by the extractive industries.

"In 1946 an American commodore gathered Lirok Joash and her people together and asked them to temporarily leave their homes on Bikini Atoll. The US needed somewhere to test its atomic bombs. It would be, said the navy man, “for the good of mankind and to end all world wars”. Eight years later US scientists detonated Castle Bravo, the massive, bungled hydrogen bomb that would gouge a crater more than half a mile wide and make Bikini uninhabitable for decades, perhaps centuries. A calculating error created a blast equivalent to detonating 15 megatonnes of TNT, the bomb was the largest ever detonated by the United States – about 1,000 times larger than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war.  Joash was 20-years-old when she left Bikini. She has been forced to relocate by radiation or unsuitable living conditions five times – including a brief and disastrous return to a still radioactive Bikini in the 1970s. Now, at 89, she is the oldest of the Bikini population forced to move by the nuclear tests. Her memories of the atoll have now grown dim.  “I don’t think she’ll make it until the next return,” says Joash’s grandson Alson Kelen, a former mayor of the Bikinian council-in-exile. “I don’t think I’ll make it. I don’t think my children or my grandchildren will make it. The dream that we would return already faded away a few years ago.” The Bikinians, most of whom will never see Bikini, live scattered across the Marshall Islands, a collection of 24 atolls in the Western Pacific. Joash, Kelen and 200 of their people now live on Ejit, a tiny low-lying islet set aside for the Bikinians near the Marshall Islands’ capital atoll Majuro. “We’ve been kicked around for a while, for the last almost 70 years,” says Kelen. “And until now living in these tight communities here is the best we can get. And it’s so sad. It’s so sad. Because every time we look at this we feel like we’re sailors on a voyage, we’re still right in the middle of the ocean.”  And the ocean, driven by climate change, is rising.  Across the Pacific, the subtle, unremitting first impacts of the climate crisis are already strangling lives. Later this year in Paris, the world’s leaders will attempt to produce an agreement that will secure the global climate. But secure for whom?  Floods washed over Ejit three times in 2014. Kelen fears that before long, his people will be moving again. “It’s the same story. Nuclear time, we were relocated. Climate change, we will be relocated. It’s the same harshness affecting us,” he says. In the Marshall Islands almost everyone lives within a few hundred metres of the sea and less than three metres above it. Inundations have destroyed homes and crops. Droughts of extraordinary intensity and length have necessitated food and water drops. Fresh water grows scarcer. People are trying to defend their land by planting mangroves, and Sisyphean sea walls are built and rebuilt. But people’s thoughts are turning from adaptation and resilience toward a climate exodus. Scientists predict that in 30 years, life here will be so uncomfortable most people will leave. A notion the Marshallese abhor. The Bikinian calamity serves as a national warning that homelands, once lost, cannot be replaced.  “If the land doesn’t exist, what happens to these people for whom the land is the most integral thing? For the answer, just look at the Bikinians,” says Jack Niedenthal, the liason officer for the Bikini Trust. Marshallese foreign minister Tony de Brum, who has emerged as a champion of the global climate movement, says: “Displacement is not an option we relish or cherish and we will not operate on that basis. We will operate on the basis that we can in fact help to prevent this from happening.” But politics and atmospheric physics are running away from the Marshallese. In March 2014 almost 100 homes on the capital atoll Majuro were destroyed by a combination of high tide and big swell. More than 900 people were placed in shelters. Families have since returned to live in homes half collapsed into the sea.  “I can tell you right now that all of those [inundation] events that have occurred in the Marshall Islands can be attributed to sea level rise,” says Reginald White, the director of the Marshall Islands National Weather Service. On the pancake flat atolls, three centimetres of sea level rise will cause a flood to spread inland a further 30 metres. The higher sea level combines with seasonal high tides (known as king tides), large swells and high winds to push water on to the land. During La Niña years (part of the couple of ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that affects weather globally and includes El Niño) the seas can rise up to 30cm above normal. The last decade of predominantly La Niña conditions has offered a bleak curtain raiser for things to come.  “We are seeing more extreme events today than we used to see in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Even without La Niña we still receive inundations,” says White. Some scientists predict climate change will cause more intense and more frequent El Niño and La Niña events – although this is less certain than sea level rise. El Niño events are typically followed by dry periods in the Marshall Islands. During 2013, after a very weak El Niño, the northern atolls were hit by a severe drought. Food and water were delivered to desperate communities. Production of coconut oil, one of the countries only exports, fell by almost a third, a loss of close to US$2.5m (£1.6m) or 1.5% of GDP. “If there is another drought then the industry will be gone. That will really effect everything here,” says Mison Levai, the marketing manager of the national coconut oil producer Tobolar. This will not only be bad news for the 70 employees of Tobolar’s refinery in Majuro. For the 20,000 people who live on the rural coconut-growing ‘outer atolls’ the equation is simple. No coconuts, no income. On the outer atoll of Arno, families work together every day, six days a week, collecting fallen drupes, removing the husks, skilfully shucking the flesh (called copra) and drying it in makeshift ovens. It is then shipped to Majuro to be turned into oil and exported. Torrak Anton, a copra farmer, uses a stick to scratch the arithmetic of his poverty in the dirt of the road. After food, rent and contributions to the copra dealer and island chief, he is left with $34 a week for the seven people in his household. During times of drought the coconuts shrink and the money for clothing, housing and education disappears.  Without copra, outer islanders will be reduced to a subsistence survival, eked from the land, supplemented by fishing and likely made impossible by tidal inundations. Already 1,200-1,400 people are reported to have moved from rural atolls to district centres – exacerbating overcrowding and making flooding in the capital Majuro more damaging. Depending on how sharply the world cuts carbon emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts the global mean sea level will rise by 26-82cm between now and 2100. The IPCC concluded in 2013 that even if the increasingly quixotic-looking “safe” limit of 2C of global warming were somehow achieved by the Paris talks, the sea would continue to wash over Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. What the rest of the world considers acceptable climate change is, quite simply, a disaster for atoll dwellers. In spite of De Brum’s refusal to countenance a national evacuation, White says the Marshall Islands are likely to become unliveable for all but a hardy few before the midway point of this century.  “What is the exact definition of habitable? It gets to a point where the extreme events become so frequent that it becomes very uncomfortable to make a good living,” he says. The people of Kiribati (pronounced Ki-ri-bas) are the Marshall Islands’ fellows on the low road to climate oblivion. The capital atoll Tarawa is overcrowded and underdeveloped, even compared to Majuro. Rita Kaimwata, a 27-year-old mother of two (soon to be three), lives in a typical Kiribati home of driftwood, salvaged timber and palm thatching. Her tiny block of land in the village of Temwaiku is separated from the Pacific Ocean by a thin dirt road and a hump of sand less than a metre high. Like many Tarawans, the Kaimwata’s access to food and fresh water is tenuous. Their diet of rice and fish is supplemented by whatever vegetables they can grow. Every second day, for one hour, the government pumps treated drinking water and the family fill up a small tank. This precious water must be kept for keeping hydrated in the punishing equatorial heat.  For bathing, dishes, clothes and watering vegetables there is a well that taps the thin layer of fresh water (called a lens) a couple of metres below the ground. But last year (and again a few months ago) the sea swept over the road, through the Kaimwata’s home, across their cabbages and into the well. Now nothing grows. Set against scientific warnings of a future of catastrophic climate change events (such as typhoon Haiyan and hurricane Sandy) the loss of a vegetable patch seems insignificant. But for Kaimwata’s children the link between food, water and rising sea levels is profound and the margin between life and death could be as fine as the ability to grow a few cabbages. Kaimwata, like many residents (called i-Kiribati), giggles to hide distress. “I laugh because sometimes we believe that in 20 or 30 years our country will be gone forever. But it’s not funny.” Devoid of rock and substantial natural defences, this is among the most marginal of all regular human habitats. Nearly a decade of regular inundations has caused parts of Tarawa’s already thin and polluted water lens to turn salty. Clean water is almost non-existent. Crops have died. Between 2005 and 2010, the number of malnourished multiplied eight times. In September, an outbreak of rotavirus from bad water infected 2,513 children under five years old. Seven were killed. Kaimwata looks around at her children and her neighbours’ children: “Only the children get sick. Many children die in Kiribati when they get the diarrhoea.” More than a third of i-Kiribati are under 15. The water situation is desperate. Water is being drawn from the freshwater lens 20% faster than rain replaces it. Bacteria from open defecation (there are few toilets), industrial and domestic chemicals and seawater contaminate all water sources – including the government supply. Only 60% of the atoll’s population receive rations of ‘clean’ government water. The other 23,000 rely solely on well water that Tarawa’s director of public health Patrick Timeon describes as “grossly unsafe”. “The enormity of water-associated disease and death has not been fully assessed,” says Timeon, but the direct and indirect impacts are “colossal”. He begs for assistance to raise just £70,000 for two desalination plants that could provide safe water to the entire population. Kiribati’s president Anote Tong is frank. Years of failed talks and prevarication by industrialised countries have shaken his belief in the UN process. The land, homes and futures of his people (like the Bikinians before them) have been deemed the price of doing business, the acceptable cost of delaying the end of the carbon economy. In contrast to De Brum, he is already working on encouraging his people to leave. “If what will happen in Paris will deal with the case of the most vulnerable countries like us, then maybe we have some guarantee that we will be able to stay. But if we don’t, I’m not going to put the future of my country on the outcome and the whims and wishes of those countries to decide. We’ve got to plan ahead. The old saying wish for the best but plan for the worst,” he says.  The countries’ contrary rhetoric on climate change is partly informed by their differing migration opportunities. The Marshallese have a compact of free association with the US, meaning they can resettle as they wish. But the i-Kiribati have few avenues of emigration. Tong’s despairing statements are partly designed to goad Kiribati’s major donor countries Australia and New Zealand to open their borders to his people. His plan for the worst, encourages young people to learn a profession and ‘migrate with dignity’. “We have to relocate people because the landmass is going to decline. That’s common sense. Simple common sense … I can say that I refuse to move, but that’s being stupid isn’t it? Because it will not be me that will be affected. It will be my grandchildren,” he says. Even now, it is not difficult to find the suffering grandchildren of Kiribati. Between Tong’s modest parliament and Kaimwata’s home is Tarawa’s hospital. The overloaded facility desperately needs modernisation and expansion. People sleep on the floor or outside on the ground. Cats roam the wards and ants swarm around dripping taps. In a corner of the paediatrics wing, panting slowly in the heat, lies one-year-old Atanimatang Atanimatang. He fell sick during the rotavirus outbreak in September and his little body has wrestled against the diarrhoea and fever caused by the virus for four months. He shows signs of kwashiorkor, a type of malnutrition commonly found in regions hit by famine. His mother Katewea Atanimatang watches her son’s febrile sleep. They receive government water, she says, but when it is not available they are forced to drink from the well. She looks exhausted and sad.  When I contacted one of his nurses in the days before publication, Atanimatang had recovered slightly. He may yet live long enough to go to school, attend church, marry and have children - like most other i-Kiribati and Marshallese. But if he does, it’s likely he’ll also live to see his homeland evacuated.  The elders are distraught that this loss is being committed to their young. The Reverend Eria Maerierie is an old man. He won’t live to see his country’s loss. But he has a long enough memory to know that things have changed. If the tide is high on a Sunday he now conducts services in a church surrounded by water. And he rages against the apathy behind the rising sea.  “We are suffering in this part of the world from what those people in the rich world are working with gases. And its consequences fell on us in the Pacific. They have been selfish, thinking of what they can achieve with gas. What can we do? We just live with that dying feeling in our hearts. Our voice is nothing to them.” The most widely-reported and possibly most misleading ‘effect of climate change’ in atoll nations is erosion. It’s a striking, media-friendly narrative, climate change we can see. Homes undermined by rising seas, beaches scoured back to the coral shelf and coconut trees felled by salt poisoning. But the evidence showing a clear link between the last century of sea level rise and erosion is far from conclusive. Research on the erosion of atolls really only began in 2011. The University of Aukland’s Murray Ford has compared aerial photography from the second world war with current satellite images and the results may surprise some. Despite a small but significant sea level rise of 20cm last century, Ford found that the last half of the century saw a general (although not uniform) trend of accretion across 100 Pacific atolls. The islands are getting bigger. “All the research that’s come out in the last few years has shown that the islands aren’t eroding away. It’s kind of counter intuitive,” says Ford. “The conventional models show that they should be eroding, but the current observations show that they aren’t.” Rather than being the indisputable first effects of climate change, all the photos of dead palms and disappearing beaches attest to the extreme fragility of these landforms to change. It is likely that on densely-populated Tarawa and Majuro, causeways, shoreline developments and dredging have much more influence on local erosion than sea level. Confirmation bias also plays a part in both the islanders’ perceptions and the reporting from these islands. The eye isn’t drawn so easily to the places where the sand is piling up. Any erosion is accepted as proof of the climate change narrative. But just because the islands are growing now, doesn’t mean they won’t suddenly begin eroding when the sea reaches a certain height. At the moment though, the disappearance of land is less of a threat than the loss of habitable land, says Ford. “The inundation risk continues to rise and it’s highly likely that they’ll be frequently inundated well before they are eroded away,” he says."

"Divestment is the opposite of investment – it is the removal of stocks, bonds or funds from certain sectors or companies. The global movement for fossil fuel divestment (sometimes also called disinvestment) is asking institutions to move their money out of oil, coal and gas companies for both moral and financial reasons. These institutions include universities, religious institutions, pension funds, local authorities and charitable foundations. Evidence shows that proven fossil fuel reserves are more than three times higher than we can afford to burn in order to stay below the generally agreed threshold for dangerous climate change. Fossil fuel companies are currently banking on extracting these reserves and selling them – and are actively prospecting for more. By supporting these companies, investors not only continue to fund unsustainable business models that are bound to make climate change worse, but they also risk their financial assets becoming worthless if international agreements on climate change are met. These investments are creating a “carbon bubble” worth trillions of dollars based on assets that could prove to be unusable. The Bank of England is conducting an investigation into whether these over-valued assets could plunge the world into another economic crisis. Although the impact of divestment on share prices may be relatively small, the reputational damage can have serious financial consequences.  Since 2010, the movement for fossil fuel divestment, started by 350.org, has persuaded 180 institutions, worth $50bn (£33bn) to divest, with Stanford University in the US, Glasgow University in the UK and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund among the most notable.  It is the fastest growing divestment campaign in history and could cause significant damage to coal, gas and oil companies according to a study by Oxford University. Previous divestment campaigns have targeted the tobacco and gambling industries and companies funding the violence in Darfur. Divestment is perhaps most well known for its role in the fight against apartheid in South Africa."

"First of a four-part series-within-a-series presented by Fergal Keane. As the general election looms, Keane takes the cue to wonder whether there is anything politicians are doing – or could do – to enable more people to realise what have long been thought the most basic of ambitions: owning their home; doing work they enjoy; feeling as if they belong where they live; and maintaining confidence that things will improve in the future. A useful reality check for voters and office-seekers alike. Andrew Mueller  Delicious food, gorgeous scenery and sunshine are guaranteed as Rick takes a journey from his Aussie house, where he’s serving up treats and fizz, to Tasmania, “the foodie frontier”.

Once he reaches Tassie, Rick is understandably evangelical about its beauty. Killing a wallaby isn’t the most palatable thing to watch, but seeing it roasted in salt and pepper is.

Is convicted horse-maimer George Edalji (Arsher Ali) the victim of a racist set-up? With Martin Clunes playing Doyle as a wily, spunky thinker who nevertheless feels inferior to his own creation, this first episode has charm to go with the misty period intrigue.

Information overload doesn’t help, so this doc finds three mathematicians – Hannah Fry, Norman Fenton and David Spiegelhalter – who focus on three figures: 0.85C (degrees of warming since 1880); 95% (the degree of certainty that at least half of recent warming is man-made); and 1tn tonnes (the total amount of carbon we can ever burn while avoiding dangerous levels of climate change).

"There aren’t many architects you would believe could hold back seas and save the world from being drowned by Biblical floods. But when you meet Bjarke Ingels, anything seems eminently possible. At the age of 40, a mere teenager in architectural terms, the sprightly Danish architect has built a career on making unlikely feats appear effortlessly doable, and madcap schemes look perfectly logical. He has summoned mountain-shaped apartment blocks from the suburban flatlands of Copenhagen, designed a waste-to-energy plant down whose sloping rooftop you will be able to ski and proposed a cage-free zoo in which visitors will be held captive while the animals roam free. He’s even convinced Google to build a pastoral utopia beneath an enormous glass tent.  A few blocks from his New York office he is building a giant pyramid of apartments, wrenched askew to limbo beneath the neighbours’ viewing corridors, with a big courtyard scooped out of the middle. Now at its full height, rearing up beside the West Side Highway, it is one of the most arresting buildings Manhattan’s regimented grid has ever seen, as well as one of the most commercially illogical: it tapers up to a tiny point, leaving only a handful of flats at the most lucrative upper levels. The architects can barely believe they found someone brave (or mad) enough to pay for it. Yet once again the cartoonish diagram, of the wilful form generated by the forces acting on the site, has come true. In the hands of his practice BIG (the Bjarke Ingels Group), which now numbers 220 people between Copenhagen and New York, even chimneys can be turned into wellsprings of creative possibility. In London they want to install a gigantic Tesla coil between the smokestacks of Battersea Power Station, so that an electric bolt may strike on occasion, sending a streak of lightning fizzing across the sky. Back in Denmark, the chimney of their power plant will be the coolest flue around: it is designed to blow smoke rings, puffing 30-metre wide halos towards the heavens. So what’s the trick to selling these harebrained comic-book dreams? There must be more to it than Bjarke’s boyish charm alone. “I call it bigamy,” says Ingels, sitting in his New York office, where two floors of architects are busy twisting new typologies into shape, while a widescreen TV streams activity of his Copenhagen office doing the same some 4,000 miles away. “Why have one when you can have both? We find that seemingly contradictory things are not always mutually exclusive.” On a quick dash through the office we see a pair of twirling towers under construction in Miami, a whirlwind of a watch museum planned for Switzerland, a honeycomb block of seaside apartments for the Bahamas, with a swimming pool lapping up to the balustrade of each balcony, and a model of something alarmingly tall in the corner of the office – from which my gaze is quickly averted. “If a factory has to exhaust gas,” says Ingels, distracting me with a video of the power-plant chimney test-run on his phone, like a child showing off his latest app, “then why not transform its emissions into a thing of beauty? If you’re going to do something anyway, then you might as well give it a public benefit as well.” BIG’s latest conjuring trick awaits in the next room. Hanging on the wall is a plan of Manhattan with a thick green line running around the island’s tip. It gets fatter and thinner as it traces around the coastline, swelling out into an occasional bulge, like a snake curled up after a meal. Then comes the bigamist proposition, told with the seductive spiel of a TED talk. If New York has to build 10 miles of flood defences to protect the city from another Hurricane Sandy, why not conceive the barrier as a brand new waterfront park? Climate security as leisure amenity. You can almost hear the standing ovation and all-American whooping in the background. In the city that transformed a rusting railway track into the elysian High Line, and which is planning to turn an underground trolley-bus terminal into the atmospheric Lowline, now comes the latest snappily named linear park: meet the Dryline. It is a vision as ingenious as it is elementary, a why-didn’t-they-do-it-already no-brainer of a plan. An animation produced by London studio Squint Opera shows the 10-mile long strategy being unrolled like a magic carpet along the waterfront, leaving safe leisure-loving citizens in its wake. With a sprinkling of fairy-dust, the shoreline becomes furnished with undulating berms and protective planting, flip-down baffles and defensive kiosks, promenades and bike paths, bringing pedestrian life worthy of Lisbon or Barcelona to the gritty banks of Manhattan. “We like to think of it as the love-child of Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs,” says Ingels. It is a project that is at once tyrannical and touchy-feely, as if the bullish highway builder and the people’s urban activist had sat down to draw up a plan over tea: an uncompromising seawall that also wants to give you a hug. “I think they would have agreed on a lot of things if only they had worked together,” Ingels adds cheerfully. “Our project must have Moses’ scale of ambition, but be able to work at the fine-grain scale of the neighbourhoods. It shouldn’t be about the city turning its back on the water, but embracing it and encouraging access. By taking it one conversation at a time, with the principle that everyone can get their fantasy realised, you end up getting there.” It is the most ambitious product of Rebuild by Design, a $1bn federally-funded programme to restore the northeastern seaboard following the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, introducing new infrastructure to guard against future inundations. Ten schemes were selected to be taken forward from an international competition, addressing everything from new breakwaters along Staten Island’s South Shore, to flood prevention and drainage in Hoboken, New Jersey. BIG was the only team to look at Manhattan itself. “It was a bit like going to a big dance,” says Ingels. “No one picks the prettiest girl because they’re too shy.” His office evidently suffers from no such impediment. Its website is named big.dk after all. Originally called the BIG-U, but recently rebranded so as not to promote one office alone (the team includes 10 other consultants, from engineering to landscape), the Dryline imagines a landscaped buffer stretching all the way from West 57th Street, looping down to the Battery and back up to East 42nd Street, bestowing Manhattan with a protective green cushion. Hurricane Sandy shocked New York into facing up to quite how vulnerable it is – and opened the city’s eyes to the realities of climate change. It provided violent and tangible evidence, if ever it were needed, that extreme weather is here, sea levels are on the rise and that cities must adapt more urgently than ever before. It also changed locals’ perception of the city’s physical geography overnight. “The storm really made people aware of the geological map of Manhattan,” says Kai-Uwe Bergmann, BIG’s partner in charge of the Dryline project, when we meet across town at the East River Park where basketball courts and soccer pitches lie under a deep layer of ice. To the north, the chimneys of the Con Edison power plant chug wispy white tendrils into the frozen blue sky, from the very plant that exploded during the superstorm, plunging lower Manhattan into darkness and leaving 750,000 residents without power. “It returned to water everything that had originally been water,” says Bergmann. “Canal St became a canal again and all the reclaimed land was totally submerged, essentially taking the city back to its 1640 coastline.” The hurricane caused $19bn of damage and saw 305,000 homes harmed or destroyed, many of which were here in the vulnerable Lower East Side, a low-lying, low-income district where rows of public housing blocks sit as modernist “towers in the park”. Only it’s the kind of park that actually means car parking, and swathes of tarmac and concrete did little to alleviate the floodwaters. As the most vulnerable area – and the district least likely to attract private investment, mostly consisting of New York City Housing Authority blocks – this first section of the Dryline has received $335m from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development to go ahead. The two-mile long stretch focuses on building a “bridging berm”, a snaking green mound that will rise to 15 feet (4.57m), the once-in-a-hundred-years flood level which Sandy almost reached, and provide a landing point for footbridges across the FDR Drive, the roaring six-lane highway that effectively severs residents of the Lower East Side from the waterfront. The existing bridges, which are narrow and intimidatingly caged, will be replaced with open landscaped bridges three times the width, bringing people across to the top of the sloping berm, which will also seclude the new park from traffic noise. As the berm weaves its way along the highway, it will take on the character of different areas, curving around existing sports pitches, morphing into grandstand seating and providing a level at which the road might be permanently covered over in future. There are plans for fishing piers as well as wild swimming pools in the spirit of Copenhagen’s harbour baths, which came out of one of the first consultation meetings, when an enthusiastic group of East River swimmers turned up. Further south, beyond the first funded compartment, the Dryline adapts to bring existing infrastructure into action against the rising waters. Between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, it’s proposed that the underside of the elevated highway is kitted out with flip-down panels to form a defensive wall in the event of a storm warning, while providing a decorative soffit above a new public space the rest of the time. A stepped 4ft-high bench snakes its way alongside skate park structures and tai-chi platforms, catering to the large elderly Chinese community. As Ingels puts it: “The beauty of the High Line is that it’s a piece of decommissioned infrastructure that is now enjoyable – but why wait?” In the third compartment, at the lower tip of Manhattan, a series of pill-shaped pavilions have been designed with sturdy central flood walls and doors that slide out to plug the gaps, forming a continuous vertical barrier, while retaining views through to the river the rest of the time. As the Dryline meets Battery Park, the berm is planned to return, forming a series of grassy knolls that slope down to a potential new multi-fingered waterfront building, like a blocky claw extended to baffle the tides. It is imagined – with a dash of implacable BIG optimism – as a new Maritime Museum, featuring a spectacular “reverse aquarium” from where visitors might observe the rising waters beneath dangling whale skeletons. As ever with BIG’s bold visions, it can all seem too good to be true, too glib to withstand the battering from both the elements and the public sector bureaucracy now charged with building it. Revisiting their most substantial completed landscape project to date, two years on, brings mixed feelings. The Superkilen park, which weaves its way through one of the most deprived parts of Copenhagen, is still a joyful, well-used strip of surreal undulating mounds, with furniture and play equipment sourced from around the world to reflect the ethnic diversity of the area. But it requires a huge amount of maintenance that the local authority is in no position to keep up, now a scene of flaking paint, broken equipment and the forlorn air of an Expo site left to rot. Whatever gets made in Manhattan will have to be built of sturdier stuff. Others fear the Dryline will give New Yorkers a false sense of protection, leading the city to become blasé behind its new defences. “The city should be proud of the project,” says Klaus Jacob, an esteemed climate scientist at Columbia University, who predicted the impact of a major storm just a year before Sandy arrived. “Except it has a fixed height. As the sea level rises, you need ever smaller storms to overcome it. It’s exactly New Orleans’ problem during Katrina. People think, ‘We have this Big U, we’re safe.’ But you’re building up risk behind the U until it becomes dysfunctional.” “I’m not saying it will leak during the first 10 years,” he adds, “but the sea-level rise calculated is out to the 2050s. What about the 2080s? 2100? You just postpone the problem for future generations.” The arrival of a new green leisure magnet has also sparked fears of gentrification among Lower East Side residents, having seen what effect the High Line has had on the meat-packing district the other side of town. A real estate gold mine wrought in gravel and shrubbery, the planted walkway has attracted over $2bn in private investment since it opened in 2009, seeing local property prices more than double. “It would be terrible if people were against their own interests from this kind of gentrifying fear,” says Ingels, assuring the area in question is protected from such forces, given its designation as New York City public housing. But concerns have also been raised about detailed development happening behind closed doors, now the general ambition for the Dryline has been accepted and handed over to the city to deliver – with BIG’s team subcontracted to corporate engineering consultancy, AKRF. At a public meeting last autumn, community spokeswoman Damaris Reyes described it as a “slap in the face” that local residents “are not even part of the discussions beyond this public setting”. “We don’t want you to come to us at the 11th hour,” she added. “We need to be involved in the planning process.” A task force has since been set up, says the mayor’s office, to ensure that “all of the appropriate people are at the table”. The bigger question remains how the rest of the 10-mile green necklace will be funded, and quite what form it will take. Like many of New York’s major parks, it will likely have to rely heavily on private investment. Seventy-five percent of Central Park’s annual operating budget is now covered by private money through the Central Park Conservancy, a privately bankrolled non-profit that, along with the likes of the Battery Park Conservancy and the Friends of Hudson River Park, now does the work of the hollowed-out public sector. Meanwhile some philanthropists are splashing out on entirely new parks of their own, of a very different kind. Media mogul Barry Diller and his fashion designer wife Diane von Furstenberg, both major donors to the High Line, have recently unveiled their scheme for a magical “pier park” nearby, planned to sprout from the Hudson River atop great toadstool columns. Designed by miracle mushroom maker Thomas Heatherwick, it will cost $170m – compared to the $130m that mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to spend on upgrading 35 parks in poor neighbourhoods across the entire city. Critics suggest the project will be just another playground for tourists and those who can afford lunch in the Meatpacking district. Henk Ovink, the Dutch water management expert who has headed up the Rebuild by Design effort for the last two years, says potential private donors were approached for the first stages of the Dryline in the Lower East Side, with little success. “We tried to see if they might be interested to help on a more supportive level,” he says. “But they’re not. Simply because there’s no return on investment. There’s a total prohibition on private development in that area.” For the forthcoming stages, where the Dryline runs into the well-heeled districts along the prow of Manhattan, up to Tribeca and the West Village, BIG is starting to look at what is known, in the US philanthropy trade, as “plaque-able entities”, ie things you can slap a funder’s name on. There are early sketches for artist-designed barriers along the highway’s central reservation and suggestions of what a Jeppe Hein flood wall might look like. There’s a danger that these things are merely more baubles for Diller and Furstenberg’s big-hearted chums, but the ambition seems genuine, in the architects’ eyes at least, while mindful of needing to play the American funding game. Perhaps the billionaire benefactors will be persuaded to stump up cash for useful infrastructure after all. Barry’s Berm has a certain ring to it. But for now, all efforts are focused on making the first publicly funded stretch as good as possible to set the bar high. “We’re trying to make the initial phase as adventurous a manifestation of the fundamental idea,” says Ingels. “We will have failed if, in the end, it’s just a good-looking green slope.”"

"People need to brace themselves for accelerating climate change that could alter the way we live even over short time scales, scientists have warned. New evidence suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years.  The analysis, based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world, looked at the rate of change in 40-year long time spans. Lead scientist Dr Steve Smith, from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, said: “We focused on changes over 40-year periods, which is similar to the lifetime of houses and human-built infrastructure such as buildings and roads. “In the near term, we’re going to have to adapt to these changes.” Overall, the world is getting warmer due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions that trap the Sun’s heat. But, given natural climate variability over short times scales, the likely effect of global warming over humanly relevant periods such as the length of a person’s life is not so well understood. The new study started off by calculating how fast temperatures changed between 1850 and 1930, a period when the amount of fossil fuel gases collecting in the atmosphere was low. This was compared with temperature data for the past 2,000 years obtained by studying tree rings, corals and ice cores and predicted 40-year rates of change between 1971 and 2020. Over the 900 years preceding the 20th century, 40-year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1C per decade, the study found. But by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25C per decade, give or take 0.05C. Different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation, climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years. The findings are published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Dr Smith added: “In these climate model simulations, the world is just now starting to enter into a new place, where rates of temperature change are consistently larger than historical values over 40-year time spans. We need to better understand what the effects of this will be and how to prepare for them.”"

"The head of the Green Climate Fund has confirmed Australia will not be able to dictate where its $200m contribution will be spent, contrary to the Abbott government’s assertions when it announced it was reversing its previous refusal to give money to the fund. Announcing Australia would provide $200m to the fund late last year Tony Abbott said the funding would be “strictly invested in practical projects” and environment minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was providing the money “on the condition it will be spent within the region for our priorities”.  “We set the terms of our engagement and those of our involvement, and those terms are very clear: support for the Asia Pacific, a focus on rainforests, a focus on combating illegal logging.” “The difference here is that we’re able to target what we’re doing to the region. So on our terms, in our time, in a way which protects the rainforests of the area, our priorities which don’t just help reduce emissions, but they protect the iconic species,” Hunt said. But in an interview with Guardian Australia, the fund’s executive director, Héla Cheikhrouhou, said decisions about disbursement of the $10bn already pledged to the fund would be made by the board, according to a single, clear set of guidelines and priorities.  Individual contributors would not be able to dictate where “their” money was spent, although they would be able to track exactly how the fund, as a whole, was performing in their areas of interest. Australia is represented on the fund’s board by a senior representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and many of the priorities determined by the board coincide with the Australian government’s desired areas of expenditure. The fund is seen as critical to the success of this December’s climate summit in Paris, which aims to reach an agreement on global emissions reductions after 2020. It is seen as an important mechanism to gain trust and win support for a new agreement from developing countries. Australia’s $200m contribution comes from its existing aid budget. Cheikhrouhou said she expected the fund would begin approving projects by later this year, and contributing countries would begin formally signing a template agreement with the fund in April. Before the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, announced Australia’s contribution at last year’s Lima climate summit, Abbott had disparaged the fund as a “Bob Brown bank on an international scale” to which Australia would make no contribution. And at the G20 meeting in November the prime minister resisted mounting global pressure to commit to the fund. Asked about the fund before last year’s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, the prime minister said: “We’re not going to be making any contributions to that.” It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund. At the time the prime minister compared it to a domestic fund championed by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which Abbott wants to abolish. He told the Australian: “One thing the current government will never do is say one thing at home and a different thing abroad. We are committed to dismantling the Bob Brown bank at home so it would be impossible for us to support a Bob Brown bank on an international scale.” The government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting – a stance backed by Canada. Canada has also announced it will now contribute to the fund."
"The world should not rush to judgment on the outcome of the Paris talks on climate change later this year, president Obama’s chief climate change official has warned, as it would take a few years for the effects to become apparent. Declaring the talks a success or failure too soon would be a distortion, said Todd Stern, US envoy for climate change and the country’s lead negotiator in the UN talks. “We will not know in 2015,” he said. “The rush to judgment, that this [agreement] does not do enough [for example], is not the way to think about this.” He said that the process from Paris would not be a “one-off” agreement, but the first in a series of deals that would carry on after 2020, with countries “ratcheting up” their commitments to cut emissions in subsequent years, as the effects of the first targets became apparent. Governments will meet in Paris in December to thrash out a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions, to take effect from 2020, when current international commitments on carbon run out. Though he did not explicitly make the comparison, Stern’s warning recalled the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, when some groups and much of the media following them immediately branded the meeting a failure.  That label stuck and has deeply affected public perception of the negotiation process, even though Copenhagen in fact produced a historic deal by which developed and developing countries for the first time jointly agreed to cuts or curbs on their emissions. Stern said “solid progress” had been made already in the lead-up to this year’s crunch negotiations. The US jointly announced with China last November its targets for beyond 2020. China will cause its emissions to peak by 2030 at the latest, while the US will cut emissions by 25% to 28%, relative to 2005 levels, by 2025. The EU has also set its post-2020 target, of cutting emissions by 40% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. Other major economies are expected to come forward with targets, to cut emissions in the case of developed countries and to curb their growth in the case of many developing nations, this April. After that, they will be scrutinised by the UN and other countries to ensure they are adequate and fair, before the Paris talks begin in December. Alongside the vital issue of emissions targets, the Paris talks will focus on how to provide financial assistance to poorer countries, to help them tackle emissions and to cope with the effects of climate change. Stern was upbeat on this. At Copenhagen, developed countries promised that by 2020 at least $100bn a year would be flowing to developing countries for these aims. To date, about $35bn to $45bn a year is flowing in this way from public origins, Stern said. This includes money from development banks, such as the World Bank, which are ultimately funded by the industrialised world, and other publicly-funded financial institutions. But that figure does not include money from the private sector which has been matched, mobilised or leveraged by public funds, so if these sources are included the number is likely to be much greater. Stern agreed that if the talks failed to produce a significant deal, it would be damaging for the UN process. “With as much teed up as is teed up now, if the thing really were to not get over the finish line, I think that would be a consequential thing for the UN. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.” His opinion echoed that of Connie Hedegaard, the outgoing EU climate chief, when she told the Guardian last year that failure in Paris would effectively be the end of the UN process."
"Everyone agrees that global warming has become a polarized issue. Liberals tend to view themselves as being on Team Human-Caused Global Warming is a Problem, and conservatives tend to view themselves on Team No It’s Not. Convincing people to change their beliefs and leave their cultural group is a challenge with any polarized subject. When it comes to climate change, the scientific evidence falls squarely behind the first team, and so the question becomes how we reduce the polarization that makes so many people culturally identify with second team. That’s a question social scientists have been grappling with for years.  One suggested approach involves consensus messaging – telling people about the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. People tend to badly underestimate the expert consensus on this issue, and research has shown that communicating the 97% consensus makes people more likely to accept the scientific reality of human-caused global warming and the need to do something about the threats it poses. A new study by social scientists at Princeton, Yale, and George Mason universities goes further yet to suggest that perception of the expert consensus is a “gateway belief” that opens people to the acceptance of other important concepts. increasing public perceptions of the scientific consensus causes a significant increase in the belief that climate change is (a) happening, (b) human-caused and (c) a worrisome problem. In turn, changes in these key beliefs lead to increased support for public action. In sum, these findings provide the strongest evidence to date that public understanding of the scientific consensus is consequential. The study illustrates “the gateway belief model” in the following figure. In the study, the scientists asked people to rate their beliefs about these key issues before and after being told about the 97% expert consensus. The results validated the model. Subjects’ perceived expert consensus increased dramatically, and their belief in climate change, its human causation, concern about it, and support for public action all increased as well. The increase in concern about climate change is a key result. Most people, including a majority of Republicans, support taking action to slow global warming. But they view it as a low priority, so they don’t mind when policymakers fail to take action. Hence there’s no penalty for climate denial in Congress, whereas there’s a big financial reward from the fossil fuel industry for delaying climate action. That calculation won’t change until people view tackling global warming as a higher priority. This study suggests that consensus messaging may help people grasp the importance of the problem. The gateway belief model makes sense because people don’t have the time to learn about every important issue, so we often defer to the experts. As shown by a 2013 study led by Stephan Lewandowsky,  when in doubt about scientific facts, people are likely to use consensus among domain experts as a heuristic to guide their beliefs and behavior.  Dan Kahan at Yale is also a social scientist, and has argued that consensus messaging is “counterproductive” and “deepens polarization.” However, both Lewandowsky’s research and this new study find that consensus messaging “neutralizes the effect of worldview” because “Republican subjects responded particularly well to the scientific consensus message.” Especially when they saw it in pie chart form. Kahan prefers to reduce polarization about climate change by telling people about geoengineering. He’s run experiments in which subjects read a fictional article about new technologies to offset global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and reflecting sunlight into space. After reading the fictional article, conservatives become more likely to accept the science behind human-caused global warming, and so polarization is reduced. The problem, as Andy Skuce notes in detail at Skeptical Science, is that the fictional article bears little resemblance to the realities of geoengineering. The technologies are described as “more effective than enactment of emissions restrictions” and would “spare consumers and businesses from the heavy economic costs associated with the regulations necessary to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations”.  In reality, proposed geoengineering technologies are generally very expensive, would require international cooperation and regulation, and are extremely risky. As Skuce notes, even the scientists who are among the biggest advocates for geoengineering research agree that the technologies entail high risks, and their implementation should only be considered in the event that we first fail to mitigate global warming through carbon pollution reductions and have become desperate to slow rapid climate change.  If the Earth’s climate were a car, right now we’re already driving dangerously fast and accelerating. Carbon pollution cuts would be the brakes, and geoengineering would be the airbags. Kahan’s experiment tells people that we don’t need to use the brakes because the airbags will protect us, and we can have fun going fast in the meantime. What Kahan has shown is that when presented with a fictional silver bullet solution to climate change, those with an ideological opposition to real solutions (like making polluters pay for their carbon emissions) become more willing to accept climate science realities. As with many previous studies, it confirms that much of the rejection of human-caused global warming stems from ideological opposition to the proposed solutions, rather than actual doubts about the science. Kahan believes that telling people that scientists are studying geoengineering may still reduce polarization for some groups. He notes that different communications approaches will work for different people, I believe professional communicators must use the data that I and others develop in lab studies and apply their own judgment about how the mechanisms involved should inform their work In short, we have data indicating that if we tell people the experts agree we need to put on the climate brakes, more will accept that reality. And telling people that scientists are also working on an airbag system may also make more people accept the dangers that we face."
"Funders appear to be backing away from a prominent climate change denier who may have failed to disclose that his peer-reviewed articles were funded with grants from petroleum companies.   On Monday, the scientist defended accepting the grants through one of the largest climate denial lobbying groups in the United States, even as former donors are discontinuing contracts.  Documents obtained by Greenpeace showed that Dr Wei-Hock “Willie” Soon, who worked at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, accepted $1.25m in funding from companies such as Exxon Mobil and the industry group American Petroleum Institute.  On Monday, Soon defended his record through the Heartland Institute, a group that lobbies against climate change initiatives and one of the scientist’s most avid supporters.  “In recent weeks I have been the target of attacks in the press by various radical environmental and politically motivated groups,” said Soon in a statement released on Monday on Heartland’s website.  “This effort should be seen for what it is: a shameless attempt to silence my scientific research and writings, and to make an example out of me as a warning to any other researcher who may dare question in the slightest their fervently held orthodoxy of anthropogenic global warming.” The Heartland Institute has framed the debate as a partisan issue, blaming the American left for attempting to discredit a scientist who questions accepted science. Heartland’s president, Joseph L Bast, has gone so far as to call critics “ethically challenged and mental midgets”. This logic will probably ring hollow for scientists who, for years, have worked to build evidence of climate change while denial groups and conservative politicians attempted to discredit them.  Soon’s statement on Monday came as clean energy advocates questioned whether one company, electric utility Southern Company, had any business funding research when it could have used the cash to reduce ratepayers’ bills. Southern granted Soon $409,000, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.  Southern Company said on Tuesday that it “funds a broad range of research on a matter of topics that have potentially significant public policy implications for our business”. “While the scientific and political discussions on climate change continue, Southern Company is focused on researching, developing and deploying innovative energy technologies to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to customers.” • This story was amended on 3 March to correctly reflect Southern Company’s position on funding energy research."
"It was on a broiling summer’s day last August that Hoovergate broke. Brussels bureaucrats were about to ban high-powered vacuum cleaners, and every Tory criticism of the green agenda collided in one nightmarish Daily Mail headline. After protests over onshore windfarms and outrage over higher energy bills because of the levy for renewable investments, the EU was even going to make housework tougher for hard-pressed voters. A few days later, Douglas Carswell became the first Tory backbencher to resign from the party to defect to Ukip. Carswell’s concerns went much wider than the wattage of vacuum cleaners, but his decision propelled a party that questions the very existence of climate change into the mainstream debate. The Conservatives, who pledged in 2010 that the coalition would be the “greenest government ever”, now faced a triple threat to that promise: the recession, Ukip and a politically toxic EU. “Don’t expect climate change to feature in the election campaign,” said one of the greener Tory MPs. It had all been so different for David Cameron back in 2005. He’d recognised that the message of social justice implicit in the green agenda could be an important way of making people see Conservativism differently. Most people remember the Arctic trip with the huskies. The pledge to rule out a third runway at Heathrow was more significant. After the inconclusive election in 2010, the coalition’s programme for government had more about climate change than about cutting the deficit. On 14 May, three days after becoming prime minister, Cameron went to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) to declare his would be “the greenest government ever”. He even appointed himself the department’s “fourth minister”. Decc officials talk of the “energy trilemma” that faces every secretary of state: keeping the lights on, holding down electricity bills and decarbonising supply. The department must control the source of the problem and devise solutions for it. The “greenest ever” pledge was repeated in the coalition’s first Queen’s speech. In the first budget, before a year of eye-watering cuts, Decc got one of the best settlements. Yet within a year, the rhetoric had changed completely. There was a reason why there was so much detail on climate change in the coalition agreement. The Liberal Democrats, always an environmentalist party, were there as a counterweight for the sceptical Tory right. Chris Huhne, the first secretary of state, who had made his pitch for the 2006 and 2007 party leadership contests on a green agenda, was up for the fight. “His approach to the Treasury was that you can’t negotiate with terrorists,” one ally said later. It was an approach that produced impressive policy gains, most notably in 2011, with the Fourth Carbon budget, which set emissions reduction targets for 2023-27, the next stepping stone to the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions (using 1990 as a baseline). In the end, the Treasury, long the enemy of all things green, particularly where it means subcontracting revenue raising powers, conceded a deal on the condition that it would be reviewed in 2014. Huhne’s successor, Ed Davey, managed to protect the targets, but only by trading concessions on fracking. We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business. “Chris Huhne was knowledgeable and effective,” said Tim Yeo, the Conservative chair of the cross-party energy and climate change committee of MPs, “but politically it is not smart to upset the Treasury. Decc is a small, junior department. It’s always a first cabinet job for its secretary of state. Any Whitehall negotiation is always an away match.” Huhne fought to a score draw on the Green Investment Bank, bidding the Treasury up to a capital allocation of £3bn for hard-to-finance green projects, but conceding the battle over borrowing powers. But it was also on his watch that the disastrous Green Deal was devised. The deal was at the centre of Huhne’s energy bill in 2011. It was supposed to be a way of encouraging home owners to invest in energy-saving improvements with loans advanced through their energy bills. Overly complex and badly structured, it was a policy that sank, taking with it a great chunk of the coalition’s reputation for being able to make a difference in an area that is increasingly contested. As the oil price crossed the $100 (£65) a barrel mark, energy bills became the battleground for a wider fight about the value of green policies. In rightwing newspapers, Huhne was accused of masterminding untested initiatives that were hitting families already struggling through a recession. A planned duty rise on petrol was abandoned in the face of ever increasing prices at the pumps. George Osborne told the Tory party conference in 2011: “We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.” The green lobbyist Alastair Harper said: “David Cameron took a deliberate decision to tone the rhetoric down. He decided he didn’t want to talk about [environmental issues] because he didn’t want to make it a cultural issue within the party. The tone changed, but the policy didn’t.” Rather than blame the real problems of rising fuel prices, an uncompetitive market and a weak regulator, it was the energy companies’ obligation (ECO) – levied on customers to pay for investment in renewables, the Green Deal and to help fuel-poor households – that was accused of over burdening the consumer. The collateral damage was investor confidence. The more the government’s commitment to long-term decarbonisation of the energy supply was challenged within its own ranks, the less willing the investors were to take the plunge. When Huhne was forced to resign in 2012 to fight (unsuccessfully) a charge of perverting the course of justice over a speeding penalty, Davey inherited a legacy that was a substantial structure still only half-built. Key projects such as the Green Deal were only just being implemented. To complicate matters, Decc suffers like many other Whitehall departments from a high staff turnover, partly as a result of a deliberate strategy. One of Yeo’s biggest criticisms of the department is the lack of continuity. “Just when they were most needed, the team of officials that worked on the Energy Act in 2011 was broken up,” he said. The appointment of a new permanent secretary was delayed for months after the prime minister intervened to stop a candidate considered “too green”. But that wasn’t the only reason why the Green Deal flopped. Environmental campaigners such as Harper bemoan the failure of successive ministers to make energy efficiency a priority in a cool country with a large proportion of old, inefficient housing stock. “We need an efficiency sector in the same way that policy has been directed into building a renewable sector.” The Green Deal and its new successor, the Green Deal home improvement fund, are both in effect middle-class subsidies, aimed at home owners with enough savings to put cash up front. Poorer families get help with their bills and with efficiency measures through the Affordable Warmth Scheme. Many young families fall between the two extremes and get no incentive at all. Davey, parachuted into a department that was simultaneously developing complex domestic policies and playing a leading role in multi-player global and EU negotiations, then lost the reliable and experienced minister Charles Hendry. His replacement, a sop to the restive right, was the anti-wind turbine campaigner John Hayes. One ex-cabinet minister, Peter Lilley, was secretly recorded claiming Hayes’s job was to “duff up” Davey. Davey only managed to see off Hayes by warning Cameron that the outspoken minister was destroying investor confidence. It was a sign Davey was in control. He won an important battle with the Treasury on the Levy Control Framework, getting approval for a peak of £7.6bn of funding to be available for investment in the renewable sector by 2020. But alongside the efforts to raise investment in renewables, there are the more contentious failures. Davey spent a year playing catch-up on electricity market reform. He lost the fight to get a decarbonisation target into the 2013 Energy Act. Ed Davey’s real regret is that he won’t be in Paris in December. Early on, the Lib Dems were forced to drop their opposition to new nuclear power stations and negotiate what critics regard as the extortionately expensive deal for the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C. Carbon capture and storage technology has made no progress, and the new capacity contracts – the guarantee that the lights will stay on – have disappointed campaigners because of the reliance on fossil fuel. The good news comes from the international successes. Davey loyalists trumpet his role in getting an EU deal on a 40% cut in greenhouse gases by 2030, and praise the part he played in the last-minute deal at Lima that was a step towards success in the forthcoming UN climate change summit in Paris. And if the transformed global environment, with both China and the US now playing a serious part, is what really makes a difference, then at least the EU is not being left behind. “Ed Davey’s real regret,” said one of his closest allies, “is that he won’t be in Paris in December.”"

"On screen, the man widely regarded as the grandfather of climate denial appears a genial participant in a newly-released expose about industry’s efforts to block action on global warming. But behind the scenes, Fred Singer has lobbied fellow climate deniers to try to block the film, Merchants of Doubt, and raised the prospect of legal action against the filmmaker.  “It’s exactly what we talk about in the film. It’s a product of a playbook which is to go after the messengers and attack and try and change the conversation, and try to intimidate, and it is very effective,” said Robert Kenner, the filmmaker. Since the film’s release, Kenner, and Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard professor and co-author of the book on which the documentary is based, have come under attack in climate denier blogs, and in email chains. The backlash appears to have been initiated by Singer, 90, a Princeton-trained physicist who has a cameo in the film. Singer dismisses the dangers of secondhand smoking. He also denies human activity is a main cause of climate change. “It’s all bunk. It’s all bunk,” a seemingly jovial Singer says in the film. By last autumn however Singer appeared to be having second thoughts about his participation in the project. In a series of email exchanges with a global network of climate deniers from Christopher Monckton to the Harvard-Smithsonian scientist Willie Soon, Singer raises the prospect of blocking the film’s release. “Gents, Do you think I have a legal case against Oreskes? Can I sue for damages? Can we get a legal injunction against the documentary?” Singer wrote last October. “I need your advice.” In another email, Singer asks the group: “Has she finally gone too far?...Maybe this is the right time for legal action. What say you?” The cry for help got an immediate response. Monckton offered to help draft a legal complaint against Oreskes. James Enstrom, an epidemiologist who dismisses the public health dangers of air pollution, advised Singer he had “a very strong case” for complaining to Oreskes’s employers. “I suggest you attack Oreskes by filing short grievances with Harvard and Stanford,” Enstrom wrote. “Good thought,” Singer said. By 6 March, Singer had moved on to challenging Kenner directly, raising the prospect of legal action. In a letter, he claimed he was called “a liar for hire” in the documentary. The phrase does not appear in the film, Kenner said. However, it does appear in media coverage of the film. “I have some experience with libel suits,” Singer writes in the letter. “I would prefer to avoid having to go to court; but if we do, we are confident that we will prevail.” He goes on to criticise Kenner for basing his film on the Oreskes book, saying: “It is rather too bad that you got mixed up with Naomi Oreskes. She claims to be a historian of science; unfortunately, she has only demonstrated that she’s a great polemicist with a rather well-defined bias.” On 9 March, Enstrom also wrote to Kenner, echoing Singer’s claims. “I am concerned that your film makes statements about Dr Singer that could be considered defamatory,” he wrote. “Because your film is based on the book ‘Merchants of Doubt’ by Naomi Oreskes, PhD, you need to know about her contentious and controversial background.” Enstrom called on Kenner to arrange a debate between Oreskes and Willie Soon, the Harvard-Smithsonian researcher exposed for taking industry funding, when his film is screened in Boston later this month.  Singer did not respond to requests for comment. Oreskes said such attacks were typical of Singer. “This is what he does.” she wrote in an email. “We are not intimidated because we know that our work is factual, based on years of research, and backed up by extensive documentation... And we never used the term he accuses us of using, so there is no basis for complaint.” On Tuesday, meanwhile, Steve Milloy, a blogger who denies the existence of climate change published a blogpost about Kenner’s brother, a 60s era radical. “I am really just coming on their radar as the film is coming out, and the attacks are just heating up,” Kenner said."
"Alan Rusbridger failed to mention (Why we put the climate on the cover, 7 March) that Naomi Klein’s This Changes Everything is subtitled Capitalism v the Climate. Her thesis is that global capitalism, as it demands ever-increasing consumption of goods and services by the world’s population, is the main driver of catastrophic climate change. The agents of capitalism like to believe that consumption will go on for ever, and ignore, and persuade us to ignore, the unpleasant fact that the earth’s resources are not infinite. The sad reality is that so entrenched is capitalism in governments, corporations, banking systems and other global elites, and so dependent on it are “we”, the ordinary working people of this planet, for our lifestyles, comfortable, impoverished or luxurious as they may be, that the chances of getting rid of, or even modifying, capitalism are effectively nil. It’s all about power, and the ability to enforce the status quo. The likelihood is, as Tom Lehrer put it: “We will all go together when we go.”Tony CheneyIpswich, Suffolk  • The market cannot solve climate change because there are simply not enough short-term profits in it. The only thing that will change this is a complete turning on its head of global economic priorities to the collective planning of an alternative energy strategy for the planet. This requires public investment on a massive scale. The free marketeers in government, the rich 1% and those running global industries would rather see the planet burn than accept that.Philip RamsellStockport • Many, including me, will agree with Naomi Klien’s views on tackling inequality, but to link this with action on climate change is a fatal error. The conservative right, particularly in the US, will simply see this as further proof that action on climate change is letting in socialism by the back door. The message we need to put across is that whether you are the looniest leftie, the most rightwing capitalist or, like most of us, somewhere between those two extremes, then catastrophic climate change is not in your interest and will be a disaster for your children and grandchildren. Climate change is now so urgent that we have to save the planet first and argue about politics afterwards. All political factions have to work together. Martin WoodBradford on Avon, Wiltshire"

"     “No man is an island,” wrote the English poet John Donne. The devastating scenes from Vanuatu in the wake of cyclone Pam show how acutely relevant his lines remain given the threat posed to all humanity by climate change. Small islands are particularly vulnerable to cyclones and rising sea levels, but increased emissions and temperatures mean we are all more vulnerable to climate-related disasters and their devastating consequences.  It is a grim coincidence that cyclone Pam struck as the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction being held in Sendai, Japan. There is a global consensus that a changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented events. Moreover, these disasters hit the poorest people and their communities hardest as we see now in Vanuatu, and previously from typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines to the recent floods in Malawi. Yet even the richest countries of the world have struggled to cope with the increasing ferocity of climate-related natural disasters, from hurricanes Katrina and Sandy in the United States to the damage wrought to the UK’s economy from flooding in 2014.  An effective response needs to be conceived at a global level and to start with an acknowledgement that this is a shared challenge and responsibility. “Every man is a piece of the continent,” added Donne. In 2015, we can add that every man and woman is a piece of the whole planet. The Sendai conference should serve as a starting point for a coherent and integrated disaster risk reduction framework that builds on the Hyogo Framework for Action adopted in 2005 and promotes a people-centred preventive approach to disaster risk. The backdrop is stark. Since 2005, omore than 700,000 people have lost their lives, over 1.4 million have been injured and around 23 million have been made homeless as a result of disasters, including natural disasters and climate and other human-made disasters. This undermines the enjoyment of the full range of human rights by millions of people. The total economic loss is more than $1.3tn, whilst between 2008 and 2012 some 144 million people have been displaced from their homes. The international community has an environmental, economic and a moral imperative to act. This year sees the launch of the UN’s sustainable development goals. They cover a broad range of issues from poverty reduction to nutrition, gender equality and environmental protection. It is obvious that credible progress in all these areas goes hand in hand with an effective approach to disaster risk reduction. There is no point, for example, in establishing a new maternal health clinic in a coastal village which risks being swept away entirely by rising sea waters.  As Elders, we believe that reducing vulnerability to both natural and human-made hazards is the key to building resilient communities and societies. Only empowered and resilient communities operating in the context of global solidarity can ensure a just and equitable policy framework for tackling disaster risk and climate change.  We call on the UN to place greater emphasis on disaster risk reduction so that it receives greater emphasis in the SDGs and their measurement metrics, and for policymakers to base their work on meeting the needs of people living in vulnerable situations all over the world. More attention needs to be given to the underlying drivers of risk such as poverty, inequality, weak governance, declining ecosystems and conflict. Above all disaster response has to aid recovery and reduce the risk of future disasters.  An effective, holistic approach to disaster risk reduction must be people-centred and take into account gender inequality and the vital role women play in building community resilience. Women are not only particularly vulnerable to disasters, they are also frontline actors in disaster preparation and response; their participation in disaster planning needs to become common practice. The stakes at Sendai are high, but we remain optimistic that a positive outcome will be reached. People around the world, from civil society to corporations, are increasingly aware that 2015 is the year when tough decisions need to be taken. As Elders, we will continue to campaign for a just and equitable solution to the world’s climate challenge with human rights and solidarity at its centre. "

"As a barrister acting in some Australia’s biggest defamation cases, Angus Gemmell encountered power in various forms: political, military, celebrity. He killed off rumours bedevilling rising political stars in Canberra. He acted for defence intelligence chief Frank Lewincamp against the Bulletin over stories on Indonesia and the East Timor crisis, in a case where generals Peter Cosgrove and Angus Houston gave evidence. He won the largest damages ever awarded by a judge, $385,000, for rugby league player Mark McGaw over false Today Tonight stories of domestic violence. But after seven years as a barrister, Gemmell decided to leave the intellectual challenges of “other people’s problems” behind, hang up his wig and gown, and devote himself to power in a purer form. Gemmell set up Solar Choice – a solar project broker and consumer comparison service – while still in his legal chambers and he is now the proponent of what stands to become the largest solar farm in the country, perhaps the world. A sea of glass panels, to be located at Bulli Creek on Queensland’s Darling Downs, could be capable of cranking out two gigawatts of power within eight years. That is equivalent to one fifth of the current total renewable energy target for the entire country in a single power station. It is also more power than any coal fired station in Queensland can currently muster. “Excellent sunlight hours” are just one reason why Bulli Creek is ideal for a large-scale solar farm, Gemmell says. It is also grazing land – meaning no prime cropping land need be sacrificed – and is flat, treeless and has no neighbours.  Crucially, Bulli Creek is close to a major transmission node in the national electricity grid, a 330 kilovolt substation, perfectly located to send power around the country. “There’s a surprisingly small number of sites (in Australia) that have everything all aligning at once,” Gemmell says. Factors seem to be likewise aligning in solar power’s favour more broadly, although a few things still need to fall into place for the likes of Gemmell. Investment banks are leaning away from coal fired stations towards large scale renewables, he says, while the electric car market is driving rapid innovations in battery storage that are an automatic fillip to the solar energy industry. Those advances are essential in helping the solar industry “nullify the argument principally raised against renewables as being intermittent, and deliver smooth power throughout the day and night,” Gemmell says. Battery storage is what Bulli Creek will also need to reach full capacity and most effectively integrate with the nearby substation. A report this week by a German think tank Agora Energiewende predicted solar would be the cheapest form of energy in a decade. Gemmell, citing deals for 260MW projects in Dubai and power purchase agreements at US 5.84c a kilowatt hour, agrees. “It’s now foreseeable that solar will in the next decade be able to outcompete a very old, fully depreciated coal-fired generator that chugs along at 3 or 4 cents a kWh.” “Obviously once a project’s been constructed, the cost of fuel is free, it’s sunlight, and Australia is wonderfully geared to some visionary projects to harness those benefits of cheaper, bountiful, reliable sources of power,” Gemmell says. “We’ve got abundant space, modern infrastructure across the longest continuous grid on the planet, from Cape York to Tassie, and amongst all that space is plenty of sunshine.” Big energy players like AGL, who are still buying coal-fired power stations, are nevertheless also moving into solar farms and other renewables, which Gemmell says will inevitably quicken. “I think eventually they’ll realise you can’t hold back the forces of economics forever and, even though we’re perhaps more so than any other country on the planet heavily wedded to coal, the economics of large scale solar is on the right side of history,” he says. “It’s not a matter of if these projects will be built but when.” In large-scale solar’s infancy, however, market signals from government matter, even more so in their absence. Investors have reviewed the Bulli Creek project but Gemmell says the commitment to bring in “the big funds” still awaits clarity from the Abbott government on the status of Australia’s renewable energy target (RET), which has been under review for a year. The RET is also a key driver of what kind of power purchase agreement Bulli Creek can secure from a big Queensland electricity retailer like Energex or Origin. “Hopefully we won’t be the first country in the world to diminish our renewable energy target. Most countries are increasing theirs,” Gemmell says. “We would prefer as an industry no deal rather than a bad deal. “But if there’s a reasonable compromise at least we know where the goalposts are to kick the ball. At the moment we’ve got the ball ready on the mark to kick it, we’ve just been waiting for some time now to know where the goal posts are going to be.” In the meantime, Solar Choice will spend the next six to nine months working with the wholesale network owner Powerlink on the right way to connect the solar farm to the grid. After that, the contract with the energy retailer is the final milestone before construction, due to begin next year. The solar farm gained formal planning approval from Toowoomba regional council last month in what Gemmell said was “a wonderful tangible milestone for the project”. Asked if the urgency of responding to climate change meant that, as one commentator has suggested, someone has to get rich, Gemmell responds: “No one’s suggesting that we need to take a communist approach to this.” “It’s a free market and those who are able to be the first to innovate and embrace the change and to move with it should do well and they shouldn’t be punished for doing so,” he says. “Obviously there’s a great amount of opportunity out there but it does take a fair bit of boldness as well to be able to participate in this paradigm shift.”"

"In 1880, a young man from the American wild west arrived in London with £2,000 and a business plan. His name was Henry Wellcome. Today, the organisation that bears his name is the second largest charitable foundation in the world. Born to a poor farmer in a Wisconsin log cabin in 1853, the young Wellcome went to work at his uncle’s drug store and later enrolled at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. His talent for sales soon became apparent and before long he was pioneering modern advertising techniques, such as branding and direct marketing. Upon arrival in London he was met by his fellow pharmacist and businessman, Silas Burroughs. Together they would found Burroughs, Wellcome and Company, which would later merge with other companies to become the multinational pharmaceutical, GlaxoSmithKline. In its early years, the company sold the first medicines ever produced in tablet form, creating the term “tabloid”. It later sold compact forms of tea, first aid-kits and photography supplies under the Tabloid brand.  Yet Henry was not only a medicine man, he was a collector. By the time of his death in 1936, his collection – stored unseen in vast warehouses – was larger than most European museums. His staff had become accustomed to describing it by the tonne. Today, the Wellcome Collection in central London houses medical artefacts and artworks, while the collector’s original objects can be seen in galleries and museums around the world. The collection spans continents and centuries from Victorian birthing chairs and enema syringes to the death mask of Benjamin Disraeli. With Henry’s death came the capital in his will which would enable the creation of the Wellcome Trust. Today it stands as the second largest non-governmental funder of medical research, last year dispensing more than £727m in grants. At its helm sit its director, Jeremy Farrar, professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford and Sir William Castell, director of General Electric and the former director of BP.  Much of the Wellcome Trust’s funding has been dedicated to new drug discoveries. The development of new forms of drug design by George Hitchings and Gertrude Elion over 30 years at the Burroughs Wellcome Research Laboratories made possible organ transplantations and lead to the first effective treatment for leukaemia. The pair would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  In 1990, the Wellcome Trust co-founded the Human Genome Project, the largest international collaboration ever undertaken in biology. Over 13 years, thousands of scientists around the world sequenced the 3bn pieces of genetic information in every human cell.  Last year, the trust was at the forefront of the fight against the ebola virus, launching a multi-million pound emergency research programme and co-funding the first trials of a vaccine in the UK. It also launched a major new international review, commissioned by prime minister David Cameron, into drug resistant infections, especially antibiotic resistance. The trust has championed open access to academic knowledge, creating journals that are freely available to the public and forcing those they fund to publish their research openly.    Today the Wellcome Building in central London is home to the Wellcome Collection, the Wellcome Library and the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at the University College London. "
"Humans, and scientists in particular, love classifying things. Biologists devised the Linnean system for stuffing species into neat boxes, and a Red List to classify species according to whether we’re killing them off (and to tabulate how we’re doing that). Geologists worked out the passage of time on Earth into distinct ages: Cambrian, Cretaceous, Jurassic, etc. So it’s probably not a surprise that during the last few years, the idea has been catching on that humans are now having such a big impact on the Earth that we should classify modern times as a new epoch: the Anthropocene. But when did the Anthropocene begin? A new paper in Nature looks at some of the evidence, and concludes that we should officially make 1610 the date.  When geologists classify Earth’s periods into ages, they also have to decide where the boundaries lie. Basically, consecutive time periods should be different enough to be distinguishable, perhaps because an entire group of species -- such as the dinosaurs -- were present in the earlier period but either partly or totally disappeared after the boundary.   Ideally the boundary itself should be easy to spot. The preferred method for defining a boundary is to find a “Global Stratotype Section and Point” (GSSP), better known as a “golden spike”. This is a section of rock (or similar) where there is a clear boundary that can be used to delimit two time periods. For example, the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene is easy to see because there is a layer of iridium there in the rocks that dates back to 66 million years ago.  So if we are to have an Anthropocene then geologists must find a clear place in time where they can draw a line between the Anthropocene and those times when the Earth was relatively free of human influence. But where should it be? This is the question that Simon Lewis, of University College, London and the University of Leeds, and Mark Maslin of University College, London, seek to answer. In their paper, they consider several alternatives, and ask whether there is a signature of global change in each period and if a golden spike can be seen there. Their candidates are: Pleistocene. Either fire caused by humans, or the extinctions of big mammals between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, could be used as signals of the start of the Anthropocene. The authors discard both of these because they are a series of local events rather than a global event, so they are not a good golden spike.  Development of Farming. This has had a big impact in the long run, but the effects are diffuse since farming started at different times (11,000 years ago in southwest Asia, south America and northern China, to roughly 4-5 thousand years ago in parts of Africa, Asia, and North America). But by approximately 8000 years ago, most humans depended on agriculture for food, so perhaps a date near then could be chosen. But what might serve as the golden spike? There was a rise in methane concentrations about 5020 years ago (see figure 1b), which may be associated with both increased rice cultivation and more farting cows. Unfortunately, there are alternative explanations for rising methane levels so Lewis and Maslin reject this date, too. Collision of the Old and New Worlds. The authors decide this started in 1492, when rich globe-trotting Europeans discovered the Caribbean. The result of this was the “Colombian Exchange”, with crops being swapped between the Old and New Worlds; maize and potatoes went to Europe, and sugarcane and wheat went to the Americas. The authors note there were other effects, too: Besides permanently and dramatically altering the diet of almost all of humanity, the arrival of Europeans in the Americas also led to a large decline in human numbers. Regional population estimates sum to a total of 54 million people in the Americas in 1492, with recent population modelling estimates of 61 million people. Numbers rapidly declined to a minimum of about 6 million people by 1650 via exposure to diseases carried by Europeans, plus war, enslavement and famine. The accompanying near-cessation of farming and reduction in fire use resulted in the regeneration of over 50 million hectares of forest, woody savanna and grassland with a carbon uptake by vegetation and soils estimated at 5–40 Pg within around 100 years. The approximate magnitude and timing of carbon sequestration suggest that this event significantly contributed to the observed decline in atmospheric CO2 of 7–10 p.p.m. (1 p.p.m. CO2 = 2.1 Pg of carbon) between 1570 and 1620 documented in two high-resolution Antarctic ice core records. [...] This dip in atmospheric CO2 is the most prominent feature, in terms of both rate of change and magnitude, in pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 records over the past 2,000 years.  So, Lewis and Maslin suggest that 1610 is a good candidate and refer to it as the “Orbis Spike”. This is when CO2 was at its minimum (figure 1c), although there are a few similar markers around the same time. However a lot of the climate signature seems to be a blip, rather than a pattern of long-term change, which contrasts with their next suggestion... Industrialization. The industrial revolution (between about 1760 and 1880) is when most of us think that the Anthropocene really got going. But the Industrial Revolution’s impact is cumulative; it lacks a specific point in time where there is an identifiable change, so the authors can’t point to a single golden spike. The Great Acceleration. This is the period after World War 2, when human populations and their impacts exploded -- sometimes literally. So a possible golden spike could be nuclear fallout from the detonation of bombs, with an identifiable spike of 14C in the 1960s (figure 1d). But this spike did not itself do much harm. Instead, it is an identifiable symbol of wider changes that humans have caused. Lewis and Maslin like either 1610 or 1964 as the candidate date for their golden spike. They prefer 1610 since the effect after that date seems larger and, they argue, 1610 is also an important precursor to the industrial revolution. On the other hand, the industrial revolution is widely viewed as the clear start of global changes in both climate and environment, but there is no clear golden spike to mark this geologic boundary. The authors’ choice of 1610 as the golden spike that signals the beginning of the Anthropocene looks like a rather Euro-centric view. After all, there were people in the Americas already, and people had been carrying food crops and other species all around the world long before then. So declaring the European invasion of the Americas as the beginning of the Anthropocene is a very political act. But any date chosen as the beginning of the Anthropocene will be inherently political. We certainly don’t learn anything new about the past by deciding if 1610 or 1963 is the start of the Anthropocene, but classifying our times in this way draws a line in the sand. We can point to a time when we think the planet started changing significantly due to human influences. If we are to save the world and try to reconstruct it as it was, when should we set the clock back to; 1963 or 1610? When will we date our self-expulsion from the Garden of Eden? Simon L.

"The office of Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, and the state’s environmental protection department (DEP) have denied the state banned the phrases “climate change” and “global warming” from educational materials and other products. But the president of the south Florida Audubon society has insisted to the Guardian that the agency charged with setting Florida’s environmental policy had indeed banned those phrases, and that the ban probably came “from the top.”  Audubon executive Doug Young, a member of the Broward county climate change task force, said he had undergone DEP training to become a volunteer presenter of a DEP PowerPoint presentation on Florida’s coral reefs. Young said he was surprised to discover that the PowerPoint presentation omitted all mention of climate change and its potential effects on the reefs.  “They said you can’t mention that when you do the presentation,” Young, 63, said of the DEP employees who were training him. “I told them I have a great deal of difficulty with that. “I found that that particular group within DEP had a gag order,” Young said. “It’s not a mystery, it’s almost certain that that comes from the top, meaning [Governor] Rick Scott. Rick Scott does not believe in climate change.” A report published on Sunday by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (FCIR) quoted six people, five by name, who had worked for or with the DEP as saying that the agency barred employees and contractors from using the phrases “global warming” and “climate change”. The former DEP employees said the ban came into effect after the arrival in office of governor Scott, who is a climate change skeptic and who installed a new DEP director early in his governorship. John Tupps, deputy communications director for Scott, denied on Monday that there was any ban on the phrases. “I can tell you that no policy exists, and also that it’s just not true, the idea that is raised by the FCIR,” said Tupps. “It doesn’t exist and it’s not true.” Asked to explain why so many former DEP employees were telling the same story about a ban on references to “climate change”, Tupps said: “There isn’t a policy though, and it’s not true.” The named sources in the FCIR report who described the DEP ban included a former attorney with the DEP’s office of general counsel, a former DEP employee in Miami, two nature writers hired to write fact sheets for the DEP, and Young. “It’s very discouraging, obviously, because it’s the Florida DEP, and if they’re not allowed to talk about it, then there’s something very broken,” Young said.  A DEP spokesperson backed the denial from Scott’s office on Monday in an interview with the Guardian. “It is simply not true that there is a policy prohibiting words being used,” said Luke Strickland, the spokesman. “I can’t speculate on why former employees and people are saying that. But I can tell you that it’s simply not true, there’s no policy prohibiting the use of the words climate change or words like that.” Asked to provide examples of the use of those phrases in DEP material, Strickland said he would send some. But then he did not.  Young said climate change should not be about politics. “Climate change is a nonpartisan issue. It’s very important in south Florida. It’s not a partisan issue. It’s a world, global issue, affects everyone.”"

"You might have missed it, but Florida has solved climate change. Our state, with 1,300 miles of coastline and a mean elevation of 100 feet, did not, however, limit greenhouse emissions. Instead, the state’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), under Republican governor Rick Scott, forbade employees from using terms like “climate change,” “global warming” or “sea-level rise”. They’re all gone now. You’re welcome, by the way. It’s pointless to call linguistic distortions of reality like this Orwellian: people tune you out when you use that word and, besides, Big Brother at least had wit. These are just the foot-stamping insistent lies of intellectual toddlers on the grift. It is “nuh-uh” as public policy. This is an elected official saying, “I put a bag over your head, so that means now I’m invisible” and then going out looting. Expect to see it soon wherever you live.  The Florida Center for Investigative Reporting broke the news on Sunday, stating that the prohibition on the terms “climate change,” “global warming” and “sea-level rise” went into effect after Scott’s inauguration. Former DEP counsel Christopher Byrd and five other former employees stated that the policy was unwritten and “distributed verbally”. Even when working on projects with people outside their department, employees had to scrub reports of any mention of the terms and, when necessary, replace them with euphemisms. For instance, “Sea-level rise was to be referred to as ‘nuisance flooding’” – like your high-rise atop the San Andreas fault features an “increased likelihood of intermittent wobbliness”. The unwritten nature of the rule was perfect for Scott, who issued a non-denial denial when pressed by reporters in Tallahassee. When it comes to the tough questions, Scott’s happy to plead ignorance or claim he wasn’t there at the time. The same guy who abused his Fifth Amendment privilege a whopping 75 times before his company was assessed $1.7b in fines for Medicare and Medicaid fraud knows the value of not having to defend a policy that “doesn’t exist” (just as much as climate change “doesn’t exist”). Making the science invisible is a much better plan than the current Republican strategy of foregoing all policy decisions by pretending to be too stupid to understand science. Scott already tried the “I’m not a scientist!” excuse anyway, and for his troubles had to entertain a clutch of scientists in Tallahassee trying to explain climate change to him. He gave them a 30-minute limit, spent nearly half of it on chit-chat, stonefaced through the remainder and then bolted.  Claiming that you’re not a scientist trips you up when you do other science-based things with the same tools. For instance: Scott’s environmental policies read like a textbook version of regulatory capture, slashing budgets while staffing agencies with developers and their lawyers. Environmental regulation enforcement dropped by two-thirds while DEP staffers were given bonuses for accelerating permitting for development. Meanwhile, Scott capped environmental penalties for Big Sugar and fought the federal government on clean-water standards. Homeboy made scientific decisions like he was slogging through the ‘Glades in hip-waders, dipping litmus paper in graduated cylinders, testing for phosphate runoff and not finding nearly enough. The contradiction between not being educated enough to understand science, but being smarmy enough to deregulate in the face of it, only emphasize how political his decisions are, because “I’m not a scientist” only works on voters if they think you are categorically an idiot.  Unfortunately, Scott has a history of being a political animal who repeatedly seeks to disappear the problematic. For example, revelations of his “climate change”-as-a-word denialism came just weeks after Scott possibly illegally met with cabinet members over the dismissal of the nearly-universally praised Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey. Bailey charged that Scott’s office demanded his resignation after Bailey refused to: falsely tie a Clerk of Court to an ongoing criminal investigation; expedite a criminal investigation of a Scott appointee; allow FDLE vehicles to be used for Scott’s 2014 campaign events; and help write Scott’s law-enforcement platform for the campaign. When asked to rebut Bailey’s charges, Scott replied, “The facts are the facts and I’ve given you the facts.” Every word of that statement that’s not an article or a conjunction is meaningless. At least he’s consistent. Leaving aside Scott’s propensity for burner phones, private emails and blind trusts, his administration’s record for attempting to “disappear” problems impacts non-Floridians more than they realize. Scott’s budget-balancing, for instance, sought to reduce costs by subjecting welfare applicants and government employees to mandatory drug tests. This gambit tanked when Florida spent nearly $400,000 in legal fees failing to defend the law and only nabbed 2.6% of welfare applicants in a state with a population-wide drug use rate of 8%. Still, the state had to reimburse the 97.4% of applicants who passed – at a rate of $30 per test – which, rounding up, worked out to a projected whopping $100,000 total in annual savings on welfare payouts. Whether the mandatory tests benefitted any of Scott’s friends in his former health care business, or any health care businesses in which he is currently invested (through those blind trusts!) or directly benefited the Solantic Corporation, which he previously owned and temporarily transferred into a revocable trust in his wife’s name, is anyone’s guess. What is certain is that Republicans in 12 other states think that mandatory drug tests for welfare applicants are a great idea. That’s the problem with Weird Florida jokes: like the old Molly Ivins line about George W Bush and Texas, if it failed here, why not try it on the rest of the nation? “I’m not a scientist!” is a grifter idiot’s special plea that works even better when the government’s policies recognize nothing at all like science. North Carolina, Louisiana and Tennessee have all, to a certain extent, tried to solve climate change by either officially obfuscating it or penalizing the act of not ignoring it. In a modern Republican Party increasingly not only impervious to fact but outright hostile toward it, that’s an idea that travels well. And if refusing to use the words “climate change” is enough to politically erase a global phenomenon guaranteed to drown Florida’s most populous city, then who knows who or what else won’t exist next?"

"The coming general election is the least predictable for many years. One reason for this is the “green surge” – the Green party is unprecedentedly polling at around 7%, with recent evidence suggesting that it could affect the outcome in at least 18 seats and thus, in a volatile situation, the overall result.  More people are now members of the Greens than the Liberal Democrats. This is already a major change to the political environment within which business has to operate. Has the green agenda finally arrived in British politics?  Perhaps, but not as we know it. The Greens are arriving just as it is becoming evident that the sustainability paradigm has failed. The issue of climate change illustrates this failure. If we don’t keep average atmospheric temperature to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, we are (as all credible experts now agree) in for dangerous and potentially disastrous climate change. Unless we are already well embarked on a programme for drastic reductions worldwide, we won’t achieve them; as the permanently crossed fingers of the international sustainability establishment testify, we clearly have not.  This example illustrates how impotent the sustainable development model always was. Constraining present needs (or desires) to serve future needs could only offer a toolkit of lead spanners, liable to bend under any real strain. No wonder we still find the nuts and bolts of unsustainable living stubbornly unshiftable. Greens are perhaps as deep in denial about climate change as those with more standard vested interests. This can be encapsulated in the words of the Green Party member who said: it can’t be too late to stop climate change, because if it was, how could we find the energy to go on campaigning? This logic is now coming under breaking strain. Defending the idea that it can’t be too late, from the knowledge that we have barely started, gives rise to techno-fantasy. The Oxford geoengineering programme, for instance, canvasses the introduction of sulphur dioxide particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect away a proportion of incoming sunlight, or adding nutrients to the oceans to increase draw-down of atmospheric carbon. But such projects belong to the realm of science fiction and, as even their proponents tacitly recognise, merely continue the mindset which has brought us to our present plight. Since that mindset is doomed, we are going to have to learn to live with post-sustainability. This will be bleak. It means accepting that we face what a former UK government chief scientist has called a “perfect storm” of food, water and energy shortages worldwide, with all their consequences in terms of attempted migrations, struggles for resources and associated conflict. The only way to retrieve anything for human hope from this mess will be to re-conceive emerging post-sustainability positively, as ‘post-hubris’. Hubris is overweening confidence in human ability to control our surroundings and what happens to us. The modern project of managing the natural world for human benefit, launched by the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, now stands revealed as a lethal form of this failing. To have pointed this out is the green movement’s real achievement hitherto.  This is now gaining wider recognition with unexpected support for what could become a green-led recovery from hubris. We see this in the contempt for all conventional politicians, who promise betterment but fail to deliver. Correspondingly, there is a growing sense that our resilience lies in the strength of both national and local culture, which further moves towards multiculturalism can only subvert. A confused form of this awareness can be seen in the UKIP phenomenon. Closely related is recognition of our need to recover solidarities of community, which neoliberal capitalism under governments of the right and (vaguely) the left has trashed. This explains the haemorrhaging of Labour support to the Greens and nationalists on issues like transport, healthcare and welfare. Post-hubristic consciousness is clearly still inchoate and embraces many contradictions – Scottish nationalists reject the UK but yearn for the EU, many UKIP supporters resist the realities of climate change. The need to rebuild what viable resilience we can is impossible to ignore.  Also impossible to ignore is that these are all profoundly ecological recognitions, of which the Greens should be natural trustees. Will they rise to that responsibility? One thing can confidently be predicted about this general election, is it will cost the Greens an heroic expenditure of effort for very minimal results in terms of seats and parliamentary voice. Given excited expectations among a much larger membership, disillusion will be all the more acute. Will it lead to a reappraisal of strategy and realignment with new allies?

"Would you pay £100,000 to keep the rain away on your wedding day? Luxury holiday company Oliver’s Travels is hoping some couples will. Since January, it has offered an eye-catching new service. For £100,000 – or more – it is offering to harness the cloud seeding powers of science to guarantee “fair weather and clear skies for your wedding day”. “It’s an idea that has come from customer feedback,” says Natasja Rasmussen, head of customer experience at Oliver’s Travel. “We have been working with a wedding consultant for the last 10 years, sending couples out to luxury villas and chateaus in France and the Caribbean. We’ve had lots of feedback and one of the negatives was bad weather. So we have decided to do something about it.”  To fulfil their “guaranteed” pledge for fine weather, which is only nullified in the event of a natural disaster such as a hurricane, Oliver’s Travel has teamed up with the Texan meteorological contractors Just Clouds which specialise in the uncertain art of cloud seeding. This involves flying through clouds in an aeroplane and lacing them with a compound called silver iodide. Silver iodide acts as a freezing nuclei, a key component in the formation of precipitation. Water vapour molecules collide with it and turn into ice crystals that fall to earth as rain. The theory is that by managing the concentrations of freezing nuclei in a portion of atmosphere, meteorologists can control the levels of rainfall in the landscape below. Tweaking the atmosphere to bring rain to order may seem so outlandish that it belongs to some dystopian future, but in reality it is nothing new. The science of cloud seeding dates from the forties, and the work of US chemist Vincent Schaefer. In the post-war years experiments in rain creation were rife on either side of the Atlantic. They reached a zenith during the Vietnam war when the US government allegedly conducted their highly classified Operation Popeye, an attempt to extend the monsoon season by cloud seeding in the hope of flushing out the Viet Cong.  John Thornes, professor emeritus of applied meteorology at the University of Birmingham, remembers these rain experiments of the 1960s. “There were lots of companies in North America,” he says, “and their intention was to make it rain. It often ended up with farmers suing companies – they had been promised rain and it never came. Eventually the US government were forced to carry out proper trials. They found that there was actually a better chance of decreasing rainfall than increasing it.” It turned out that scientists had misunderstood the effect of silver iodide. While it did induce the ice crystals, the drops of water that fell from seeded clouds were often so small that they evaporated before they reached earth. Instead of the anticipated deluge, the silver iodide was dispersing the rain drops, or, in the terminology now used by Oliver’s Travel, “bursting” it. Although not what was initially intended in the 1940s, scientists realised that this process – an ability to prevent rain – was equally useful. For years the Russian government has made use of this science as part of its well-known weather control programme. The Russians seed clouds to ensure bright skies for their three major celebrations of the year: Victory Day, City Day and Russia Day. The Chinese do so too. They fired 21 silver iodide rockets into the Beijing skies in 8 August 2008, four hours before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. The rain stayed away. It is these precedents that give Natasja Rasmussen at Oliver’s Travel hope for the company’s new service, which for logistic reasons is limited to couples planning weddings in France. “When we first had the idea we did research,” she says, “and we didn’t see any negative impacts. A few people have accused us of trying to play god but from our perspective it is a tested technology. It was used at the Beijing Olympics, Paul McCartney had it at a gig in Russia and we’ve heard a rumour that it was used for William and Kate’s wedding too. We’ve had a few inquires by people asking for more information, but we realise it is a lot of money.” For Sarah Haywood, a luxury wedding planner, the £100,000 price tag is too much. “The number of people who would have that amount of money spare are few and far between,” she says. “You would need to have a budget of £1m or above and I can think of many other ideas to spend that sort of money on.” For Haywood the unpredictability of the weather is part of the DNA of a wedding day, especially for couples marrying in Britain. “If you choose the UK,” she says, “you are not doing so in the hope of a gloriously blue day. People are looking for stylish, beautiful, meaningful celebrations. They are not worried about a gimmick. There’s the safety concerns too. What are the risks to you and your guests from these chemicals? What about the décor? Are they going to spoil the flowers?” Haywood’s concerns are not altogether unfounded. In Britain cloud seeding is a largely unregulated industry. A freedom of information request in 2013 showed that the government had little knowledge of the nature, extent or historical application of the practice. And as with the current debate over drone technology, cloud seeding exists in an ambiguous legal context. Who owns the sky? Who owns the clouds? What chemicals can be safely injected into them and which cannot? For the moment these questions remain unanswered and firms such as Just Clouds can operate with little scrutiny.  Thornes is relaxed about the use of silver iodide, which is a benign substance but he remains sceptical of the science. “I edited a meteorological journal for 10 years and we never accepted a paper that proved there was a decrease in rainfall because of cloud seeding,” he says. “It is almost impossible to prove statistically and it remains very controversial.” Yet Rasmussen maintains that Oliver’s Travel’s £100,000 cloud bursting service is “an absolute genuine offer”. “We hope it will take off and we would love to offer it in the UK and Ireland as well as France. We’re just waiting for our first sale,” she says. If Rasmussen’s optimism is well-placed, could we be on the verge of a new era of atmospheric geoengineering? A bright Glastonbury? A bone dry Wimbledon? A rain-free Ashes series? But, as with other human interventions into nature, might there be unintended consequences? Might the cloud seeding activities of one wedding party ruin the plans of another?  While Thornes is sceptical that this will ever happen – “the atmosphere is too chaotic to manage” – for the moment the unregulated cloud space remains open to market forces, something Oliver’s Travel are keen to exploit. “It’s a fun idea,” says Thornes, “but if you’ve paid your £100,000 and it turns out a bright sunny day anyway, you’d feel like a right twit.” The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

"Tony Abbott, drained of authority but determined to hold his job, is racing around the country saying things he thinks will please his backbench and his party’s base and perhaps elicit a bounce in the opinion polls, although, as we have seen, that doesn’t always follow. It’s quite a spectacle for politics watchers. But the more important spectacle is a government, in whatever-it-takes-to-survive mode, increasingly unable to explain how it will take care of the things Australians elected them to do – such as our healthcare, our kids’ education, the elderly, the unemployed, our contribution to slowing climate change, our attitudes towards Indigenous Australians, our unity of purpose as a nation.  Here are 10 of those questions for the prime minister. Your last budget announced that, from 2017, the federal government’s share of hospital spending will grow each year in line with inflation and not by the previously promised 6% or more (which was calculated to help meet the actual cost of running hospitals). The budget claimed this would “save” $50bn over the next 10 years, but of course it didn’t “save” anything. It just hand-balled the cost on to the states. At the time it was assumed this was a tricky negotiating ploy to force the states to the negotiating table when the government starts negotiations about tax and federalism. But then the intergenerational report assumed this vastly reduced future commonwealth funding would continue indefinitely, which helped you make a political point about the long-term forecasts for your “existing policy”, but didn’t actually answer the real question about who would pay for the hospitals. The states are deeply worried. As the NSW premier, Mike Baird, said in a recent interview with Michelle Grattan, “What happened last federal budget is not sustainable. That was, the commonwealth and the federal government said, ‘We are going to allocate a large part of the future growth in health costs from ourselves to the state governments.’ “Now I said at the time, and I say it again ... both publicly and privately to the prime minister, that is not sustainable. The states do not have the capacity to meet those health costs on their own. The commonwealth has a critical role to play.” Voters might well be worried, too, with the future of a functioning hospital system apparently now reliant on your government finding the authority to reach an agreement with the states, half of them now Labor, on tax reform and a shake-up of the federation, and to somehow find the political courage to take radical changes to the next election. The last budget also announced that $30bn would be sliced from projected spending on schools. This may have come as a surprise to voters who had heard you insist during the election campaign that parents could “vote Labor or Liberal and get exactly the same amount of funding for your school”. But if they had read the fine print, they would have seen your pledge to match the funding promised after the Gonski review applied only “over the forward estimates”, which meant for four years. The budget does that, and then reverts to increases in line with inflation, and, once again, the intergenerational report assumes inflation-linked increases will continue indefinitely. The Gonski report said additional money was necessary to stop poorer schools and disadvantaged students from falling further behind. But your government rejected a Senate report calling for Gonski to be implemented, arguing that the report had “created fissures rather than consent and agreement” and insisting “teacher quality” and “school autonomy” were much more important than money (as if these were either/or propositions). Once again, the states (who have to run the schools, but need your money to do it) are deeply alarmed. The NSW education minister, Adrian Piccoli, has said, “The commonwealth government’s budget decision is more than a breach of a commitment with the NSW government, it is a breach of faith with all school students in the state.” The budget suggested the annual increase to the pension would be linked to inflation rather than average wages, which one economist has calculated would mean its value would drop from 28% of average weekly earnings today to just under 16% by 2055. The new social services minister, Scott Morrison, has said that is not a “viable outcome” but your government still wanted to find savings. The intergenerational report suggested you might revert to the higher annual increases in 15 years (like it would be up to you by then anyway). So what is your policy, and why are you looking for savings by reducing the real value of all pensions, rather than restricting eligibility for part pensions or concessions? After four unsuccessful stabs at it, you say a Medicare co-payment is now “dead, buried and cremated” but your health minister, Sussan Ley, says she still wants a “values signal” for visits to the doctor for people who can afford it (which would be a co-payment, right?) and you’ve frozen the Medicare rebate which means doctors are going to have to charge a co-payment over time or go out of business. So is the co-payment dead, or is it just resting until the political fuss dies down? This seemed clear for your first year in office. You were the guys who were “ending the age of entitlement”. You were so determined you didn’t even flinch when the car industry announced it was going in 2017. But then this week you returned “entitlements” to the car industry worth $100m, $500m or $900m, depending on who one talked to – but seem to be closer to $100m, apparently to make sure the car industry didn’t close down one year earlier, ie in an election year. Morrison says he’s open to alternative savings to the plan for under 30-year-olds to get the dole for only six months of the year (which the Sunday Telegraph informed us was imposed by your office over the protestations of the relevant ministers). But what are they? Even your own ministers know the $2.5bn “direct action” plan cannot possibly meet the deeper emissions reductions you will have to agree to in Paris in December. They point to the detail in your policy that would allow you to set tough “baselines” for industries, allowing them to buy and sell emissions permits from each other. Will you agree to that kind of emissions trading scheme? Can you, after what you said about the last one? If not, what is Australia’s climate policy? That “lifestyle choices” comment was obviously the final straw, even for Indigenous leaders who have been supportive of your agenda. They reacted with distress and incredulity. If you genuinely want to make a positive and practical difference to Indigenous affairs during your time as prime minister, how do you rebuild those bridges? Do you still think we are dealing with a debt and deficit disaster that requires big spending cuts? Or do we just need to restrain spending for the time being? Do you abandon last year’s stalled budget policies before you unveil this year’s offering? How does all of that relate to the treasurer’s message that “doing nothing is not an option?” And the big question: will you restore spending for hospitals and schools if you fail to do a tax deal that allows the states to find different ways to pay for them? It was frustrating enough when you didn’t reveal many policies in opposition, but leaving so many major policy areas so unclear after 18 months in government seems very neglectful. With so much depending on a tax and federation deal with the states which may or may not occur, with so many of your achievements running to stuff you’ve undone or abolished (the carbon tax, the mining tax) and so much confusion about your intentions on so many big issues, how do you claim to be a fully functioning government? "
"The world cannot prosper without cutting emissions, an economic expert has warned as he urged countries to use plans for tackling climate change to attract investment. Over the next few months countries are submitting their “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDC) outlining action they plan to take on climate change, ahead of UN talks in Paris at the end of the year to secure a new global deal on the issue.  Instead of putting forward plans for the least effort they thought they could get away with, countries should treat their pledges as an “investment prospectus” to attract international investors to their economy, Climate Group chief executive Mark Kenber said. The plans should set out the policies governments are going to put in place and the investment needed to attract funding, which will go to the places in the world that have the most stable policy regimes, he suggested. Europe has formally submitted its plans, including a commitment to cut emissions by “at least” 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, which Kenber said set a “clear long-term direction for European businesses” on the need to switch to a low carbon economy. “Although we would have liked to see a more ambitious target backed by equally robust renewables and energy efficiency goals, the fact that the target is backed by the Emissions Trading Scheme, the Energy Union package and a raft of other policies mean that business can be under no illusion about the direction of travel,” he said. The Climate Group works with business and governments on the shift to a low carbon economy, and Kenber issued a stark warning on the choice for the world between a high carbon and low carbon future. “There is no prosperous high carbon economy. We haven’t got a choice between a prosperous low carbon economy or a prosperous high carbon economy.” The world faced a “pretty daunting world of high carbon”, with temperatures rising by 4C or 5C causing economic disruption, or low carbon prosperity, he said. Previous economic studies had suggested the losses associated with tackling climate change were lower than not taking action, but more recent evidence suggested that moving to a low carbon economy presented “real gains”.  And the world already has much of the technology and policies it needs to tackle the problem, he said. In the UK political leaders have signalled their commitment to tackling climate change, but Kenber raised concerns that as as a country Britain was not good at supporting things over the long term. “We have offshore wind resources the envy of the world, and we just need to say this is a long game, let’s invest in it, lets make sure we’re creating the skills in the country to service that industry. “And then we have an export opportunity both of the skills and engineering capacity and the technology itself that will be the envy of the world and will drive growth, but it does require government support in the short term,” he urged. Governments did not have to pick winners, he said, but did need to set the direction of travel and make sure the incentives all point in that direction. He said the world was capable of avoiding “catastrophic” climate change, although there would be impacts of rising temperatures. But the shift to a low carbon economy is “not only going to stop climate change it’s going to present new growth and prosperity opportunities, which is also what we need with 10bn people on the planet in our lifetimes,” he said."

"By the time nations once again get round a table in Paris in December to discuss climate change, hunger should be on the menu. Researchers have just warned that a new and aggressive strain of yellow rust fungus is now a threat to Britain’s wheat harvest. Another team has calculated that average yields of wheat per field, which only two decades ago were rising rapidly, are now down 2.5%, and barley by 3.8%. In each case, the scientists identify climate change as a contributing factor. Global warming has barely begun but climate scientists have been warning about the consequences for food security for 30 years. The two latest bits of research into wheat yields are not isolated indicators of tomorrow’s troubles. The big heat has yet to arrive. It will be catastrophic. Another group has studied the consequences for harvests of extremes of heat and calculated that for each 1C notch in the thermometer, global wheat yields could fall by 6%. Some latitudes will benefit, but overall, world harvests could fall. This is very bad news: wheat is one of the world’s staples, and the world’s largest source of vegetable protein. There are other factors at play in the fields. Within a decade, 2.9 billion people in 48 nations will experience chronic water scarcity, another research team warns.  Agriculture consumes 70% of the world water supplies and action is needed “to pre-empt looming conflicts born of desperation”. Separately, US geologists have used historical analyses to work out what modern agriculture does to topsoil. When European settlers took the plough to the American heartlands, erosion accelerated one hundred-fold. At peak, an inch of soil was lost every 25 years. Before the Europeans, wind and water erosion took 2,500 years to remove the same thin layer. Because of erosion, overgrazing and drought, the planet’s farmland is being degraded at a catastrophic rate. An estimated 10m hectares are now abandoned each year; something the size of a family farm every minute. And as the food supply is threatened, demand will accelerate. There will be many more hungry people at the table. In the last year, researchers re-examined UN population projections and decided that the global numbers may not peak at 9 billion. By 2100, the world could be home to 12 billion and still rising. By 2100, according to business-as-usual climate projections, temperatures will have risen by 4C and sea levels by a metre or so. So land that is ever less productive will be expected to deliver vastly more food at ever greater cost in fossil fuel energy to feed increasingly conflict-torn nation states. Solutions exist but none are easy. All will require a generous adjustment between the haves and the have-nots and sustained global cooperation. That sounds like a dream, but the alternative is a nightmare. The enduring lesson of history is that drought and famine feed conflict, and conflict breeds more privation, and despair. Come December, each aspect of the climate challenge will have become more pressing, and more complex. Everything should be on the table in Paris except perhaps, symbolically, lunch."
"The 100 global power companies most at risk from growing pressure to shut highly polluting coal plants have been revealed in a new report from Oxford University. Chinese companies dominate the top of the ranking but US companies, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, occupy 10 of the top 25 places.  The analysis, produced to help investors assess the risk of major financial losses, also found French energy giant GDF Suez was third in the list of most polluting coal station fleets in the world. Coal currently provides 40% of the world’s electricity and three-quarters of this is produced by the most-polluting, least-efficient and oldest “sub-critical” coal-fired power stations. The International Energy Agency calculates that one in four of these sub-critical plants must close within five years, if the world’s governments are to keep their pledge to limit global warming to 2C. The new analysis ranked the companies by how much electricity they produced from sub-critical plants. The major German utilities RWE and E.ON both appeared in the top 25, along with South Africa’s Eskom and Australia’s AGL Energy. “Sub-critical coal-fired power stations are the first thing we need to kill off if we want to tackle climate change,” said Ben Caldecott, the report’s lead author and director of the Stranded Assets Programme at Oxford University. As well as carbon emissions, the air pollution and pressure on water resources caused by these coal plants were also analysed. Caldecott said some Chinese coal plants were already being closed due to public anger over air pollution, while others in India have been unable to operate for months at a time due to a lack of water. However, subcritical coal-fired power stations continue to be built, despite producing 75% more carbon pollution and using 67% more water as the most efficient - but more costly - plants. In the US, new regulations on carbon emissions could see coal companies lose $28bn (£19bn) in value, according to one recent analysis. The US companies in the top 25 of the Oxford ranking have 109 sub-critical stations between them. “These are assets that could become stranded because of environmental restrictions,” said Caldecott. Major financial institutions, including the Bank of England, World Bank, Citi, Goldman Sachs and HSBC, have warned that action to tackle climate change may harm investments in fossil fuels. A series of analyses have shown that most existing reserves of fossil fuels cannot be burned without blowing the safe budget for carbon emissions and a study in January indicated that 80% of known coal reserves would have to stay in the ground. Zoe Knight, head of HSBC’s Climate Change Centre of Excellence, said: “The [ Oxford] research will help investors to understand the material environmental risks associated with sub-critical coal, as well as levels of company exposure to them.” “It is obvious that many sub-critical coal plants will have to shut down if we are to get close to staying within our carbon budget,” said James Leaton, director of research at the Carbon Tracker Initiative. “This will have a major effect on demand for coal going forward, as evidenced by Chinese demand for thermal coal peaking in 2014.” However, Benjamin Sporton, acting chief executive of the World Coal Association (WCA), said: “Coal use is set to grow by around 17% in the next 20 years [because] it is affordable, reliable and abundantly available.” Sporton said the WCA was promoting the adoption of high efficiency, low emissions coal technologies: “The objective is to raise the global average efficiency of coal-fired power plants and so minimise CO2 emissions, whilst maintaining legitimate economic development and poverty alleviation efforts.”  He said increasing the efficiency of the global coal fleet from 33% today to 40% could be done with current technology and would save about 2bn tonnes per year, roughly equivalent to India’s total annual emissions. A spokesman for GDF Suez did not address why its 10 sub-critical coal plants had higher pollution levels than any other company, except for two small companies in India. He said the company was “conscious of its responsibility and of its major role in the energy transition [and] has set ambitious environmental objectives”, including reducing its own CO2 emissions by 10% by 2020."
"After five years of a government that aspired to being the greenest ever, what can we expect from the next parliament?  Here’s how the two big parties stand on some of the key upcoming environmental issues, from crunch UN climate negotiations and how and whether the UK should frack, to what to do about the country’s energy inefficient homes and whether the government should keep killing badgers.  David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signed a cross-party pledge on climate action, but the issue is still approached differently by the parties.  Labour leader Miliband has been forthright in placing climate change on the party’s agenda. In an op-ed in the Observer last week, he said climate change was a key economic issue for the UK and attacked Tory MPs who he said “flirt with climate change denial”. Miliband’s shadow energy and climate change minister Jonathan Reynolds told an audience in London last week: “I look at the Conservative party front bench and I do not see anyone coming through who takes this agenda seriously, who wants to develop ideas on it ... To me, the Conservative party, having had that phase where it looked like it was going to embrace this agenda, has fundamentally moved away from it and that is a great shame indeed.” But Greg Barker, Cameron’s climate envoy who was also on the panel, disagreed: “There are lots of green Tories.” When pressed for names Barker was able to cite just one example – Matt Hancock a minister for business, enterprise and energy – before saying: “The most important green Tory is David Cameron and he has consistently been my greatest ally in government.” But Cameron’s rhetoric on climate change has been undermined by his elevation of prominent climate sceptics to influential positions within the government’s environmental departments. The nadir was the much-lambasted and summarily-ended tenure of Owen Paterson as environment secretary, who has called climate science “consistently and widely exaggerated”. Michael Fallon who was a minister for climate change has also questioned climate science. These appointments represent an undercurrent of scepticism in the Conservative party. Last year a poll found just 30% of Tory MPs accepted it was “now an established scientific fact that climate change is largely man-made”. The election will also decide who represents the UK at the defining climate conference in Paris this December. Labour has employed former deputy PM John Prescott, who led the UK’s delegation on the Kyoto protocol, and it can be expected that he would take a lead role in any negotiations. Liberal Democrat secretary of energy and climate change Ed Davey, who has been the UK’s lead in climate talks, will need a hung parliament and a new coalition deal to see the job through to Paris. Should the Tories win government outright, Barker, may retain an active role despite his imminent retirement from politics. More contentious than the need for action, will be the question of how Britain achieves decarbonisation. In order to chart a way to its goal of 80% emissions reductions from 1990 levels by 2050, the UK has defined how much carbon it can burn in five yearly periods from 2008 until 2028. These are known as the carbon budgets.  In December 2015, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) will advise on Britain’s emissions reductions between 2028 and 2032 – the fifth carbon budget. Under the law, the sitting government must accept this advice and implement policies to achieve the reductions. All parties agree unabated coal power must be eradicated and have committed to phasing it out – although any new parliament will not have to do much to make this happen as anti-pollution laws and carbon pricing will see all stations closed by 2027. Chairman of the CCC John Gummer says, with coal heading for oblivion by the time its term begins, the fifth carbon budget will be the toughest to legislate. “Whoever is in power, there will be tough discussion about how we do that because the fifth carbon budget is going to be very difficult indeed in the sense that we’ll have picked off a lot of the low hanging fruit.” Labour and the Conservatives largely agree that Britain’s low-carbon future involves a broad suite of energy sources, including renewable technologies, nuclear and potentially domestic shale gas. But how much of each and their enthusiasm for certain technologies varies significantly. “No doubt there is greater appetite for the nuclear component and a lesser appetite for onshore wind among Conservatives and a smaller appetite for the nuclear component in the Labour party,” says Gummer. The Tories are openly hostile to onshore wind and various MPs have fanned the flames of public nimbyism by calling it a “blight” on landscapes and consistently rejecting planning applications. If it wins in May, the party has committed to cutting subsidies to the sector – Britain’s largest source of renewable energy – a move renewables groups say would “kill the industry dead”. This is despite onshore wind’s increasing affordability, reflected in the prices offered in Thursday’s government auction for new project contracts.  Jim Watson, research director of the UK Energy Research Centre, says the Tories’ opposition to certain forms of renewables runs counter to the interests of taxpayers. “If we want to reduce the costs of meeting our climate targets we ought to be enabling the lower cost technologies to come through and be built to save people money. It seems odd to me that a politician of whatever party would want to stand in the way of a technology that lowers the cost of meeting our climate targets for consumers.” Financial support for the £25bn nuclear behemoth at Hinkley Point C, which was born of a pro-nuclear policy under the last Labour government, was announced by the current administration in 2013. This is a key plank of the Conservative’s decarbonisation plan and the defining infrastructure announcement of Davey’s term as energy and climate change secretary. But it looks likely to be delayed by shareholder setbacks and legal challenges to its generous subsidy regime. Labour has offered its support for the Hinkley project. “It will be interesting how much [Labour] pursue a pro-renewables versus a pro-all-of-the-above strategy,” says Green Alliance’s head of politics Alastair Harper. Miliband has expressed tentative support for onshore wind. But Harper says the issue could be politically divisive. “Are they going to go all out and say onshore wind has a real future in the UK if you vote for us? They haven’t quite done that yet and it’d be an interesting binary moment for them to go for.” By the time the fifth carbon budget is announced in December, says Gummer, whichever party (or parties) is in government may have had the argument settled for them. “The price of renewables is falling much more sharply than even the most optimistic would have said and the situation of nuclear is of course still not certain with the delay on the next stage of Hinkley [Point C nuclear power station]”. The issue of shale gas exploration, or fracking, will be another key decision during the planning of the fifth carbon budget, says Watson. “How much gas we can burn in the context of our targets and what is the role of shale gas within that will certainly come up, for whatever government is in power,” he says. Both the Conservatives and Labour have expressed enthusiasm for fracking and claim credit for creating a safe, attractive legal platform for the industry – although there is a distinct difference in their approach. The Tories have aggressively pursued an agenda that removes regulatory hurdles. Some of which Labour has opposed, including fracking beneath national parks and beside aquifers. “You’re really talking about difference of emphasis,” says Watson. “But there really isn’t a clear difference of one party is really for it and one party is really against it. I just detect a more cautious approach from Labour. There isn’t the same sort of rhetoric that there is from some government ministers.” Watson says some less-straightforward electoral outcomes could influence the politics of fracking during the next term. Scotland has implemented a moratorium on fracking. Watson raises the possibility that a Labour-Scottish National party coalition (a possibility being hawked by the Tories) may have a more adversarial attitude towards shale gas. The Welsh government is investigating its legal options to implement such a ban. The national Labour party has committed to devolving powers to Wales to allow them to ban fracking.  Badgers and foxes are perhaps the only environmental issues where daylight exists between the Tories and Labour. Should the Conservatives win in May, they will allow a free vote on repealing the Hunting Act, which bans hunting with dogs. They will also continue and expand the badger cull. Labour stands opposed to both these policies. There is massive public opposition to both the badger cull (42% against, 36% for) and fox hunting (80% against). So why are the Tories swimming against the flow? These debates hark back to the days before the UK’s politics became a bland amble to the centre. They are based on ancient rivalries between the country and the city, a small group of landowning toffs versus the renting class. But most importantly, they are politically irrelevant. “It’s very easy for the parties to hold those different positions because they speak to different audiences that don’t really cross over ... It’s very easy to get off the fence both ways,” says Harper. Few people will decide their vote on animal welfare issues. The Tories might grab a few votes from Ukip in rural areas and Labour from the Greens, but the floating centre has more pressing concerns. The coalition government’s flagship energy efficiency scheme, the green deal, has become a traumatic experience for its architects. Despite recent successes in some aspects of the grants-for-home-improvements scheme, the overall take-up has been disappointing. This has left the UK’s desperately needed drive for household energy efficiency languishing. The Conservatives are yet to outline exactly how they will approach this tainted issue in the next parliament. Harper suggests it is a case of once bitten, twice shy. “I think the Tories feel burnt by the green deal and they haven’t really come up with how they’d deal with it. I’d be interested to see what’s in the manifesto on that. At the moment it just feels like they are still amazed that it didn’t work,” he says. Labour on the other hand, smelling electoral blood in the water, has pre-emptively announced an interest-free loan scheme that will replace the green deal grants. As part of a five-part efficiency strategy, Labour says the loans will improve up to one million homes during the next parliament. But the Green Building Council has warned that Labour may have to further sweeten the deal in order to motivate homeowners. Nature is the thorn in the free market’s side, that pesky “externality” that the UK’s major parties don’t really know what to do about. So on the whole, they ignore it. “The thing that is absent from the narrative of both parties right now is a real vision for what they are going to do about nature. And how we’re going to stop the losing battle of our habitats and our local environment getting worse and worse with every passing year and for the last 50 years,” says Harper.  “That conversation, that ambition hasn’t really been owned by either of the main parties. Their manifestos will have to address it in some way and I think what you’ll see is a lot of the big natural environment organisations, like the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts and so on, will be pushing for ... clear legislative plans to restore nature at a national level.”"

"Humans have fought over resources for millennia, so recent studies indicating a link between severe drought and the civil war in Syria shouldn’t come as a complete surprise. That said, some researchers warn we might be jumping to conclusions too quickly.  Any attempt by scholars over the past several years to link climate change with conflict has been hotly contested, and not just by climate deniers. Many respected conflict researchers believe that climate change is happening, that humans are contributing to it, and that it’s a big problem, but that focusing on it as a cause of war may be wrongheaded.  The problem is both scientific and social. “If you want to show that climate change has contributed to an increase in civil violence, then you need to control for other factors,” explains Andrew Solow, senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. “This is a fundamental scientific principle. But it is difficult to do.” Half a dozen or so researchers have attempted to do this, and a few have come close. In 2013, Stanford researchers Sol Hsiang and Marshall Burke, for example, conducted a meta analysis of 50 studies on conflict and climate change and found that higher temperatures and extreme precipitation tend to correlate with greater incidence of conflict. But dig into any particular case and the connection is less clear-cut. “The factors influencing civil violence can be quite complicated and vary in complicated ways from situation to situation,” Solow says. “It’s like what [Tolstoy] said about unhappy families: they are all unhappy in different ways.” In many cases, the researchers themselves are appropriately cautious when making any claims about the connection between climate and conflict. In a statement that accompanied Hsiang and Burke’s study, for example, Hsiang wrote: “There’s no conflict that we think should be wholly attributed to some specific climatic event. Every conflict has roots in interpersonal and intergroup relations. What we’re trying to point out is that climate is one of the critical factors [that] affect how things escalate, and if they escalate to the point of violence.” Although some have criticized the pair’s attempts to quantify how climate change impacts the risk of conflict, the bulk of the criticism – both of the Stanford study and the more recent study linking climate change with the conflict in Syria – has been of the media’s oversimplified take on the research.  Each time a study on this connection is released, the majority of headlines tend to be along the lines of “War Linked to Global Warming.” Newspapers might be excused for using such headlines as opposed to the more accurate but unwieldy: “Global Warming Might Exacerbate Some of the Factors that Can Lead to Conflict”. But scientists warn that when discussing these issues, nuance is important.   “I have tremendous respect for the authors of the recent study of violence in Syria,” Solow says. “But given the history of Syria and the region generally, I find it hard to believe that, but for the drought, this violence would not have occurred.” Edward Carr, a University of South Carolina geography professor, has been a particularly vocal opponent of such reductive takes on climate change and conflict. When Hsiang and Burke’s paper came out, Carr explained his criticism of work connecting climate change and conflict as being driven by a deep concern “that work on this subject (which remains preliminary) might disproportionately influence policy decisions in unproductive or even problematic directions (such as by contributing to the unnecessary militarization of development aid and humanitarian assistance)”. It might be more accurate to consider climate change in the way that the Pentagon has come to think of it: as a “threat multiplier”. “Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, climbing sea levels and more extreme weather events will intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict,” Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a statement announcing the US defense department’s 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap.  Pete Newell, a retired army colonel and a consultant to the defense department and other government agencies, says he has seen the impacts of water and energy scarcity firsthand in conflict zones. “In my personal opinion, that underlies a lot of the issues and conflict,” Newell says. “I saw it a few years ago, watching tribes along the Iraq-Iran border going to war over water rights. And it’s becoming worse as populations migrate to urban coastal centers and those areas’ ability to provide services are overwhelmed. As a precursor to conflict, lack of access to basic human needs is a major driver and it’s only getting worse.” Researchers searching for the climate-conflict nexus wouldn’t disagree with Newell, necessarily, so much as expand upon this line of reasoning.  “I’ll put this in a crude way: no amount of climate change is going to cause civil violence in the state where I live (Massachusetts), or in Sweden or many other places around the world,” Solow says. “If we want to reduce the level of violence in other places, then it would be more efficient to focus on these factors: to bring people out of abject poverty, to provide them with the technology that loosens the connection between climate and survival, to reduce corruption, and so forth, rather than on preventing climate change. I sometimes have the feeling that some people only care about human suffering if it can be traced to climate change.”"
"Pledges at this year’s climate summit to cut carbon emissions are likely to fall far short of the targets needed to avoid heating the planet by more than 2C. That is the stark conclusion of a report by a team led by British economist Nicholas Stern. The group, based at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, concludes that action planned by countries – in particular the European Union, the US and China – will still leave the world emitting 20bn tonnes of carbon a year in excess of levels needed to prevent global warming from having devastating consequences.  “Intended national contributions will not be consistent with the international goal of limiting the rise in global mean surface temperature to no more than 2C,” states the report, whose publication follows Saturday’s climate action march in London which organisers say was attended by 20,000 people. Scientists say 2C is the maximum increase in temperature the world can tolerate without risking environmental mayhem – which could include rises in sea level, melting of the ice caps, drought in Africa, America and Asia, storms and ocean acidification. Loss of ice caps would lead to less solar energy being reflected back into space, while thawing tundra would release more methane and other greenhouse gases currently frozen in polar regions . Both processes could lead to even greater temperature rises. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is to hold talks in Paris at the end of 2015 in an attempt to get nations – particularly in the developed world – to agree to binding reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This would be achieved by closing fossil-fuel power stations, building renewable energy plants and improving energy efficiency in homes and factories. The EU, US and China – which, combined, emit the most carbon – have all indicated the likely pledges they intend to give in Paris towards cutting emissions so that by 2030 global temperatures will be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. In carrying out their analysis, the group split countries into two groups: one including the EU, the US and China, the other made up the remaining nations. The EU has proposed cutting its carbon emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030, while the US has announced that it intends to cut emissions by 26%-28% of 2005 levels by 2025. At the same time China has said it plans to stop its emissions rising beyond 2030. The group worked out how much carbon the EU, US and China – if they keep their promises – would then be putting into the atmosphere by 2030 and concluded that they would, in total, be emitting 21-22bn tonnes a year. By contrast, the rest of the world – which includes growing economies such as Brazil and India – are likely to be emitting around 34bn tonnes, according to figures supplied by the International Energy Agency. In total, this gives a likely carbon emissions output of 55-56bn tonnes a year by 2030. However, the maximum emissions target that has a reasonable chance of curtailing temperatures at 2C has been calculated as having a median value of about 36bn tonnes. In short, the world will still be emitting far too much carbon – an excess of some 20bn tonnes a year – to give the planet a reasonable chance of holding back the heat to a manageable level. The authors conclude three courses of action must now be followed to rectify the dangerous gap they have uncovered: ■ Nations should work even harder over the next few months to improve emission pledges at Paris. ■ Investment should be increased in innovation aimed at improving renewable clean energy generation. ■ A mechanism should be created for countries to review and improve their emission reductions in future years. They say: “The period following the summit in Paris in December 2015 will be crucial, not just to bridge the gap between aggregate intentions and the goal by 2030, but also to lay foundations for even greater action after 2030.”"
"Water is the driving force of all nature, Leonardo da Vinci claimed. Unfortunately for our planet, supplies are now running dry – at an alarming rate. The world’s population continues to soar but that rise in numbers has not been matched by an accompanying increase in supplies of fresh water. The consequences are proving to be profound. Across the globe, reports reveal huge areas in crisis today as reservoirs and aquifers dry up. More than a billion individuals – one in seven people on the planet – now lack access to safe drinking water.  Last week in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, home to 20 million people, and once known as the City of Drizzle,drought got so bad that residents began drilling through basement floors and car parks to try to reach groundwater. City officials warned last week that rationing of supplies was likely soon. Citizens might have access to water for only two days a week, they added. In California, officials have revealed that the state has entered its fourth year of drought with January this year becoming the driest since meteorological records began. At the same time, per capita water use has continued to rise. In the Middle East, swaths of countryside have been reduced to desert because of overuse of water. Iran is one of the most severely affected. Heavy overconsumption, coupled with poor rainfall, have ravaged its water resources and devastated its agricultural output. Similarly, the United Arab Emirates is now investing in desalination plants and waste water treatment units because it lacks fresh water. As crown prince General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan admitted: “For us, water is [now] more important than oil.” The global nature of the crisis is underlined in similar reports from other regions. In south Asia, for example, there have been massive losses of groundwater, which has been pumped up with reckless lack of control over the past decade. About 600 million people live on the 2,000 sq km area that extends from eastern Pakistan, across the hot dry plains of northern India and into Bangladesh, and the land is the most intensely irrigated in the world. Up to 75% of farmers rely on pumped groundwater to water their crops and water use is intensifying – at the same time that satellite images shows supplies are shrinking alarmingly. The nature of the problem is revealed by US Geological Survey figures, which show that the total amount of fresh water on Earth comes to about 10.6m cubic km. Combined into a single droplet, this would produce a sphere with a diameter of about 272 km. However, 99% of that sphere would be made up of groundwater, much of which is not accessible. By contrast, the total volume from lakes and rivers, humanity’s main source of fresh water, produces a sphere that is a mere 56 km in diameter. That little blue droplet sustains most of the people on Earth – and it is under increasing assault as the planet heats up. Changing precipitation and melting snow and ice are already altering hydrological systems in many regions. Glaciers continue to shrink worldwide, affecting villages and towns downstream. The result, says the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, is that the fraction of global population experiencing water scarcity is destined to increase throughout the 21st century. More and more, people and nations will have to compete for resources. An international dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the latter’s plans to dam the Nile has only recently been resolved. In future, far more serious conflicts are likely to erupt as the planet dries up.Even in high latitudes, the one region on Earth where rainfall is likely to intensify in coming years, climate change will still reduce water quality and pose risks due to a number of factors: rising temperatures; increased levels of sediments, nutrients, and pollutants triggered by heavy rainfall; and disruption of treatment facilities during floods. The world faces a water crisis that will touch every part of the globe, a point that has been stressed by Jean Chrétien, former Canadian prime minister and co-chair of the InterAction Council. “The future political impact of water scarcity may be devastating,” he said. “Using water the way we have in the past simply will not sustain humanity in future.” • This article was amended on 12 March 2015 to convert certain measures from miles into kilometres."
"Boris Johnson has been told by the London assembly to pull City Hall’s £4.8bn pension fund out of coal, oil and gas investments, after assembly members voted on Wednesday on a motion in support of the fossil fuel divestment movement. The motion calls on the mayor to publicly support the principle of divestment and to begin the process of dumping the fossil fuel portfolio of the London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA). But the vote is non-binding, meaning the mayor is bound only to consider its proposals and write a response. The motion was proposed by the Green party’s Jenny Jones and was unanimously supported by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Six of the Conservative’s nine members were absent. Those who were present voted against.  Jones said she was “delighted” the motion had passed and while it had no executive value it would force Johnson to seriously consider divestment. “It’s impossible to know what the mayor thinks on any one subject at any given hour of the day, quite honestly,” said Jones. “And I would imagine that he would think this is scaremongering. But people who know more about climate change than he does, which isn’t difficult obviously, feel that this is an urgent threat. And I think there’s a lot of people out there that think this is very timely and might even encourage the mayor to listen.” The mayor was not present at the plenary meeting and declined to comment on his position on divestment. A spokesperson for Johnson said: “The Mayor will consider all of the Assembly’s motions at today’s plenary. The Mayor takes climate change mitigation extremely seriously and is helping drive forward the transition to a low carbon economy.” A spokeswoman for campaigners Divest London said the motion would force the mayor to reveal his position on fossil fuels and reinforce his intention to meet his commitment to reduce London’s carbon emissions by 60% by 2025. “This is a really positive step forward and puts pressure on Boris to divest London from fossil fuels. He came into office making big promises on carbon emissions reductions for London and he has been very good at ignoring them. The motion forces him to make clear his position on fossil fuels, and particularly fracking, to the British public,” she said. “The motion will add momentum to the many other municipal campaigns around the country.” According to scientists, the vast majority of coal, oil and gas reserves cannot be burned if global emissions reduction targets are to be met. This places the companies that own these reserves at financial risk, high profile figures including the Bank of England governor have said. The LPFA manages the pensions of City Hall employees and many other local authorities. It holds roughly £48m worth of shares in some of the companies most exposed to stranded fossil fuel reserves – Rio Tinto, Shell, BP and BHP among others. It also holds shares in several cigarette giants. The global divestment campaign argues that institutions such as the LPFA have a financial and moral imperative to dump their shares in fossil fuel companies. The LPFA said it would not comment in the London assembly vote. Labour’s environment spokesman Murad Qureshi called on the mayor to support the motion divesting from fossil fuels, and make London a “world leader in tackling the injustice of climate change”. “Agreeing to divest from fossil fuels would not only boost London’s contribution to tackling climate change and secure our capital’s future prosperity, it would offer reassurance to those concerned the mayor had lost sight of [his emissions reduction] objective.” A spokesman for Labour’s shadow energy minister, Caroline Flint, said London Labour’s position on divestment did not reflect the national party’s opinion that divestment is untenable because the UK will need to use fossil fuel energy for decades to come. The assembly’s Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Stephen Knight said: “Moving public sector pension investments away from industries and fuels of yesterday and instead investing in growing new green industries is an important part of the vital mix of policies we must now fully adopt to end our long standing dependence on fossil fuels.” Conservative assembly member James Cleverly said divestment was “fundamentally flawed”. “I think there are better ways of generating social good with the pension fund,” he said. “Rather than preventing funding in certain areas, I think it is much more productive to encourage finance in places we know people can be directly helped.” The Assembly also passed a motion urging the mayor to recognise the science of climate change, which has been confirmed by 97% of scientists, and take it into account in his policies. All assembly members voted in favour except the three Tories present."

"Recent news brings yet another example of hubris followed by crisis followed by tragedy. The hubris is our ongoing neglect of human-induced climate change, leading to climate disruptions around the world. One of the many climate crises currently under way is the mega-drought in São Paulo, Brazil. The recent tragedy is an epidemic of dengue fever in ​the city, as mosquitos breed in the makeshift water tanks that have ​bought in to maintain supply through the drought.  Welcome to ‘the age of sustainable development’. We are learning a hard truth: the world economy has crossed the “planetary boundaries” of environmental safety. We now face a momentous choice. Will we continue to follow our blind economic model at growing threat to humanity, or will we choose a new direction that finally combines economic progress with social justice and environmental safety?   São Paulo is just one of many such cascading disasters. My colleagues at the Earth Institute of Columbia University recently detailed how Syria’s disastrous war was triggered in part by a devastating drought that itself was a signal of long-term drying in the eastern Mediterranean. Others have used sophisticated climate models and a deep reading of past climate history to show that California’s extreme drought is a foreshadowing of mega-droughts ahead in the 21st century in the US southwest and mid-plains states, as a result of human-induced climate change. But it happens that 2015 is a key year of decision for sustainable development. Twenty-three years after the Rio Earth Summit, the 193 UN member states have resolved to adopt sustainable development goals (SDGs) this September. Just before that they will meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to redirect global financial flows towards sustainable investments in health, education, and renewable energy, and away from dangerous fossil fuels. And in December, they have the final opportunity to conclude a climate change agreement that can keep global warming below the agreed upper limit of 2-degrees Celsius.  These are momentous decisions, yet still badly understood globally. Our mental models, analytical fields of study, and ethical decision making is poorly equipped to handle the challenges of sustainable development. We have been walking blindly into tragedies and more will come unless we learn to open our minds and our ethical reasoning to the current crisis. My new book The Age of Sustainable Development is an attempt to help the public understand both the growing crisis and the ways to overcome it.  We need a new way of thinking, one that tightly links the human-made world of economics and politics with the natural world of climate and biodiversity and with the designed world of 21st century technology. Consider my own home field of study, economics. Sometime in the 19th century, economics largely dropped its traditional attention to land, water and food, as industry replaced agriculture as the leading economic sector. Economists decided, by and large, that they could ignore nature – take it “as given” – and instead focus on market-based finance, saving, and business investment. Mainstream economists derided the claims of “limits to growth.”  Of course this was never correct; economies have always depended on what we now call “natural capital.” Yet the complete separation of economics and nature was the predominant way of economics thinking and teaching until very recently. Libertarian free-marketers in the US and UK hold to this day that climate change must be a hoax because if it were true it would overturn the laissez-faire economic philosophy.  Economics also needs to team up again with the engineering world, to realise that the economy is a designed system, and one in which smart thinking is required to get the right design. Urban historians know that great cities emerge from a combination of planning and self organisation; and in the same way, safe and prosperous economies in the 21st century will need a combination of targeted technologies (eg zero-carbon energy, smart urban grids, and climate-resilient agriculture); forward-looking infrastructure plans at the local, national, and regional levels; and the usual surprises, breakthroughs and evolution of market-based change.  Sustainable development offers not only a new analytical frame, but also a new way of choosing our common future. It suggests an ethical framework that is consistent with the great moral traditions of both East and West. At the core of sustainable development is the normative idea that we must combine economic prosperity with social justice and protection of the physical world. At this advanced stage of environmental threats to the planet, and in an era of unprecedented inequality of income and power, it’s no longer good enough to chase GDP. We need to keep our eye on three goals – prosperity, inclusion, and sustainability – not just on the money.  Fortunately, if we can just draw our attention to these broader goals, we will learn that they are easier to achieve than we might think. We are the inheritors and beneficiaries of one of the great technological revolutions of human history – the digital age – which rivals steam and electricity in its fundamental power to advance the global economy, and to do so in harmony with environmental needs. A zero-carbon global energy system, for example, is within reach thanks to breakthroughs in renewable energy and efficient energy transmission and use.  We have entered a new age of sustainable development whether we like it or not, even whether we recognise it widely or not. As the great biologist E O Wilson has put it, we have stumbled into the 21st century with stone-age emotions, medieval institutions, and near godlike technologies. In short, we are not yet ready for the world we have made. The sustainable development goals will be a vital opportunity to give ourselves new guideposts and measuring posts for prosperity, justice, and environmental safety in our fast-moving, rapidly changing, and dangerously unstable world.

"At least 24 people died when cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu at the weekend, authorities have confirmed. The storm flattened buildings, wrecked infrastructure and has left more than 3,000 people in the South Pacific island nation displaced. As the full scale of the storm remained unclear due to the archipelago’s remote nature and its severely damaged telephone network, a statement from the national disaster management office raised the death toll from single digits and said that 3,300 people were sheltering at 37 evacuation centres.  It is feared that those numbers could rise still further as communications with outlying islands are restored. Initial indications are that the devastation to rural communities is far more significant than even in the capital city, Port Vila, which is itself very badly damaged. As the first rescue teams to reach those islands warned of significant damage, the president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, warned that climate change was contributing to more extreme weather conditions. Speaking at a UN conference in Sendai, Japan, on Monday, said 90% of buildings in Port Vila had been damaged or destroyed by the category five storm, which saw winds of up to 250km/h (150mph). “It’s a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu,” he said. “After all the development that has taken place, all this development has been wiped out.” Lonsdale said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were directly linked to climate change. “We see the level of sea rise … The cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected ,” he said. “This year we have more than in any year … Yes, climate change is contributing to this. “I am very emotional … Everyone has that same feeling. We don’t know what happened to our families … We cannot reach our families; we do not know if our families are safe. As the leader of the nation, my heart hurts for the people of the whole nation.” Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati, also at the conference, urged action: “It is time to act … Let us match the rhetoric of these international gatherings with pledges and commitments as leaders to do our best to improve conditions and lives of those who need it most.” The aid agency Care International said it had just received its first update from another of the nation’s 83 islands, Tanna, to the south of Port Vila, which was even more directly in the path of the storm. Tom Perry from the organisation said he had talked to a colleague newly arrived on Tanna: “The basic information he gave us was that the damage in Tanna is significantly worse than in Port Vila. There’s an immediate need for water there.” There was no news as yet on deaths, but the situation looked very bad, Perry warned. “Most people in outer islands live completely rural lives,” he said. “They grow what they eat, and this will have wiped out their entire food stocks. People live in very simple accommodation, huts made of timber and palm leaves. There’s no way buildings like that are going to withstand a category five cyclone. “We’re gravely concerned about it, there’s no question. There is a sense that if we don’t get a response quickly, people are going to be running out of water and food.”  Getting aid to more remote communities would prove very hard, he said: “If you look at the logistics involved in an operation like this, it’s incredibly difficult.  “You’ve got a country of 83 islands spread over hundreds and hundreds of kilometres. Getting around Vanuatu is difficult in a normal situation, let alone when you have no communications, you don’t know the status of the airstrips, boats aren’t really travelling yet.” Even in Port Vila, where clearing-up work was beginning, many people had yet to hear word from loved ones elsewhere. Perry said: “People are very resilient here. This is quite a poor place, and people are very tough. But there’s also shock. Most people still don’t have contact with their loved ones. There’s a significant population in Port-Vila who are from somewhere else in the country, and people just aren’t able to get in contact with their family. There’s a real concern about that.” Unicef has expressed serious concerns over children who have been displaced or affected by the cyclone. The organisation estimates that at least 60,000 children may be at risk, and have called for funding to provide child health needs, food and water. Communications in the Port Vila province of the island have now been “almost fully restored”, according to telecommunications provider Digicel, allowing information to flow more freely to and from disaster areas. Several countries have also pledged additional aid and funding for the stricken island nation. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, pledged $5m in support, and New Zealand has offered $2.5m. Bishop said on Monday that Australia was working closely to provide support, and had sent several military planes with supplies and aid workers. “We are aware that this has been a most devastating cyclone,” she said. “The impact will be felt for quite some time ... We stand ready to assist in the long-term recovery efforts.” Cyclone Pam has travelled south after passing over Vanuatu, and reached New Zealand on Monday. The cyclone was downgraded from a category five storm but conditions have been poor in some areas of the country. In Gisborne, in north-east New Zealand, about 40 people were evacuated from sea-level homes, and schools were closed."

"“Science is often thought of as simply a collection of facts which has been handed down to us by some great authority in the past”, says meteorologist Paul Williams, a Royal Society university research fellow at the University of Reading. “But of course, the reality is a lot more complicated than that.” In reality, science is a human endeavour that is built upon a constantly-growing knowledge base. As our knowledge increases, we gain greater insight into the world around us, we improve existing technologies and develop new ones that, in turn, generate more knowledge. It is this struggle to incorporate what was known and what is now known that creates controversy.  Take, for example, climate change. Climate is defined as the average pattern of variations in temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, and other meteorological variables within a specific region over extended periods of time. Thus, climate change is when the patterns of these variables deviates away from average for protracted periods of time. “The fact that the climate can change was once very controversial amongst the scientific community, and of course, it still is controversial today -- not in the scientific community anymore but amongst the general public”, notes Dr Williams. Despite public controversy, there is evidence all around us demonstrating that climate is, indeed, changing, and these changes can be quite dramatic. But this is nothing new. One such climate change lesson comes from antiquity, from the “Parallel Roads” of Glen Roy. These are three parallel terraces that resemble man-made roads running along the inside of a valley in the Scottish highlands.  “Charles Darwin came here in 1838, fresh from his voyage with the Beagle to South America, where he was sure he’d seen similar features along the hillsides, which had shell sands on them, which he, I think, correctly interpreted as having been beaches that had lain at sea level”, says geoscientist Geoffrey Boulton, a Regius Professor Emeritus at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. “[Darwin] came here and was convinced he was seeing the same thing. Indeed, he published a paper in the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions saying exactly that in 1839.” Despite having accurate data to work with, Darwin came to the wrong conclusion in this particular case. As we now know, these terraces were shorelines of an ancient freshwater lake that formed behind a glacial dam after the last great ice age. The lake itself only existed for 1,000 years or so, but even this short lifespan was enough to make an indelible mark on the landscape. And scientific publishing played a critical role in formally correcting Darwin’s mistake in the scientific record.  In this video, Professor Boulton and Dr Williams explore “the consensus gap” that exists between the scientific community and the public, why accurate data are critical to the scientific record, and why “science has to be an open public enterprise rather than one contained behind closed laboratory doors.” This film is part of a series of science stories that celebrate 350 years of scientific publishing by the Royal Society.

"Let’s say you’re a smoker and your tobacco manufacturer of choice tells you they’ve got plans to cut your chances of being killed by their cigarettes. Now plainly, the most obvious way to cut your chances of dying from smoking would be to stop smoking. But the tobacco company says its plan to save you from a wheezing death is to deliver your cigarettes in packets printed with non-toxic soy ink. Cigarettes will also be delivered in more fuel-efficient lorries and a new initiative will be introduced to encourage smokers to take a healthy jog to the shops to buy their smokes.  Presented with such pointless measures, most people (and by most people I mean everyone) would rightly tell the tobacco companies to go shove their cancer sticks in a sun-free spot.  The Queensland government’s latest efforts to “protect the Great Barrier Reef” by allowing the massive expansion of coal exports should be met with similar indignation because the logic is similarly insulting to the intelligence. To make room to export an extra 130m tonnes of coal a year from Abbot Point in north Queensland, about 1.7m cubic metres of seabed need to be dredged. Originally, the spoil was to be dumped at sea. Then it was going to be dumped beside sensitive wetlands.  Now the two miners Adani and GVK, with the backing of the government, will look to dump the dredge spoil on land previously set aside for another port expansion plan.  The Queensland government described the agreement as “environmentally sustainable”. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said this sent a “clear message” that “we can protect the Great Barrier Reef”. But government agencies and scientists have found that the key long-term threat to the reef is not improving the quality of the water (although this does help in the short term) but the rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused chiefly from burning fossil fuels. You can’t “save the reef” while expanding the very industry which puts it most at risk.  The Abbot Point plans are a key part of the efforts to open up one of the world’s largest untapped sources of fossil fuel carbon – Queensland’s Galilee Basin. The scale of the emissions from the mines and burning the coal is something to behold. Adani’s Carmichael mine and GVK’s Alpha and Kevin’s Corner mines would release about 250m tonnes of CO2 every year for 30 years once the coal is burned, according to conservation groups.  If the emissions from the GVK and Adani mines did not go ahead, then this would be the equivalent of Australia suddenly halving its annual greenhouse footprint. For context, Australia’s unambitious plans to cut emissions by 5% by 2020 would see the country’s carbon footprint reduced by about 159m tonnes from expected levels without the target. If the Adani and GVK mines are developed then they easily scrub out Australia’s greenhouse gas reductions based on that 5% target.  This, remember, comes regardless of whether you think those reductions should come from pricing greenhouse gas emissions, as the previous Labor government would have liked, or from the (misnamed) Direct Action policy of the current government. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority – the government agency charged with managing the icon – said in 2009 and again in 2014 that climate change was the main threat to the reef’s future.  Burning fossil fuels impacts the reef in two key ways. The extra CO2 in the atmosphere interacts with the top layer of the ocean to increase the acidity of the water. The accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere also drives the warming of the oceans, increasing the risks of coral bleaching. I’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of seeing the results of an experiment that mirrors the kind of temperatures and ocean acidification that Great Barrier Reef habitats can expect if fossil fuel burning continues unabated. In tanks on the University of Queensland’s research station on Heron Island, vibrant arrays of soft and colourful corals are transformed into a bleached and algae-coated mess. The increased ocean acidity actually starts to dissolve the corals.  Another study has suggested that coral bleaching will become an annual event on many parts of the reef by around the middle of this century.  If these windows into the future become a reality, then Australia can look forward to an ecological disaster while developing a new multi-cent tourism industry derived from slime gazing. The mining industry is not surprisingly bereft of credibility when it comes to interpreting the science linking their products to the reef’s welfare. In April last year, the state’s peak mining body used a government-funded study to claim its port expansions would not put the reef at risk, when the same study actually warned that water quality and fossil fuel burning were driving current and future threats. All of this comes in the context of the reef’s status as a United Nations World Heritage site. The UN committee has warned it could put the reef on a list of sites “in danger” later this year, something the state and federal government is desperate to avoid.  The federal government has even offered international journalists free trips to Queensland where presumably those journalists will be schooled in the government’s own peculiar take on the reef’s future – a take which even it’s own scientists seem to disagree with.  They have even recruited a climate science denier to lobby banks under pressure to rule out funding coal expansions. Just as the only way to cut your chances of dying from smoking cigarettes is to stop smoking cigarettes, the only real way to “protect the reef” is to stop smoking fossil fuels."
"For Nadir Shah, potatoes have been a blessing – and also a curse. Two years ago, as increasingly extreme weather battered his wheat crop, the 34-year-old mountain farmer turned to growing potatoes, an experimental crop in the Gobar valley, Pakistan, where he lives.  The switch was a huge success. His usual harvest of 10 tonnes of wheat and animal fodder per hectare soared to 55 tonnes, and Shah’s income shot up as well, allowing him to make plans for the first time to enrol his oldest child in private school. The problem is that his neighbours did the same thing. Now, in the valley where Shah lives, 60% of people grow potatoes, and as a result potato prices are plunging, seed is getting ever-more costly and no one is quite sure how to store or get to market the area’s huge harvest. Finding ways to adapt to increasingly erratic and severe weather is crucial for farmers in Pakistan and around the world. But adaptation efforts can have unforeseen consequences, creating new problems that also require solutions. In Pakistan’s north-west Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, the emerging potato problem in Gobor valley is particularly acute because of the imposing 8km (five-mile) Lowari tunnel, which lies between the region’s potato farmers and the nearest markets in Punjab province. At the moment, the road tunnel is under repair and is open just two days a week. “The trucks and businessmen have to wait in a queue at the tunnel for five days a week to get the produce to the local markets,” said Amir Hazar, a retired school teacher and farmer. Potato buyers trying to reach farmers face the same barrier. The transport problems, combined with lack of cold storage in the area, have left 20% of Hazar’s potato crop damaged, he said. “The potato is a perishable crop and we can’t keep it in the field or our homes more than a month.”  Once, cooler temperatures might have allowed farmers to store some of their crop for seed and to eat at home. But warmer temperatures mean that potatoes held back from market now often rot. Shah, who earned 80,000 rupees ($793) from his most recent crop, said half his windfall may need to go to pay for seed potatoes, which are selling at exorbitant prices thanks to soaring demand. He urged the provincial government and NGOs to help farmers build cold storage facilities in Gobor, one of 24 valleys in Chitral district. Ibrahim Mughal, the chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a body representing Pakistani farmers, estimates Pakistan will produce more than 6m tonnes of potatoes this year, while consuming only 3m tonnes. “The surplus production has hit the farmers hard as it has brought down the price to 4,000 rupees ($39.50) per 120kg against 6,000 rupees ($59.30) per 120kg last year,” he said. He said middlemen and businessmen were also “slaughtering the growers” by purchasing excess potatoes from farmers at low rates and then banking them in cold storage facilities, which the farmers lack. The aim, he said, is for “the businessmen (to) create an artificial shortage of the product in the market in next two to three months and (then) start selling it for over 6,000 rupees per 120kg”. Rao Muhammad Ajmal Khan, parliamentary secretary for the ministry of industries and production, said the government should make arrangements to export the surplus crop to Russia, the Middle East and Gulf countries, to earn foreign exchange and keep the price stable in local markets. Provincial governments in potato-growing areas, especially Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces, should help growers to build local cold storage facilities to protect farmers from exploitation by middlemen, and to keep prices stable in local markets, he said.

"A work by the artist Antony Gormley has been shown for the first time in the Guardian as the newspaper published an extract on Friday from Naomi Klein’s book on climate change. The piece, called Connection, shows a disturbing silhouette of a giant body against a deep glow which could be manmade or natural. Both the body and the landscape appear to be equally toxic, raising questions of how humanity is impacting the planet through climate change.  “It’s very important that the image is not a didactic one,” said Gormley of the work, made with aniline dye on paper. “Hopefully it gives you an opportunity to put yourself in the place offered by this silhouette and to think about your connection to and dependence on the context in which we find ourselves... the most important being the elemental world that we have managed for the first time ever, for any species, to have destabilised.” The image will wrap around Saturday’s printed copy of the Guardian and be handed out at a climate change protest march through central London. Gormley was minded to share the image because of the concerns he shares with the marchers about the irreparable damage we are doing to the planet. “We are sleepwalking into a massive human disaster.” He said he despaired of politicians who thought no further forward than the next five years – “they are just not capable of long-term thinking.” Gormley has also shared an art work with the Guardian not seen in public before, called Evening IV, made with carbon, casein and Indian ink on paper. It accompanies the extract from Klein’s book, This Changes Everything – Capitalism vs Climate. The Canadian author’s book argues that capitalism is ill-suited to handle the challenge that global warming presents – and that tackling climate change can also address inequality in society. Gormley agrees. “If the division between rich and poor is already chronic and very consciously in people’s minds now, then the division between those who are banished from their homes because of rising sea levels and temperatures will be a hell of a lot more painful. “As Naomi Klein has ceaselessly pointed out, we have to make politicians take notice. “Short termism is the way capitalism works and the way politicians work and capitalism is not going to solve this. We have to find another form of defining value that is not market value. “Nobody wants to face the truth that actually air, water, sunlight are resources that are certainly not free.” Gormley has made previous work which explores questions around climate change, not least Another Place which consists of 100 cast iron sculptures of Gormley’s own body on Crosby beach, looking out at the water from the mouth of the Mersey to the River Alt. The figures ask questions around humanity’s relationship with nature, whether we are a toxic body and whether we can live sustainably. Gormley believes the human population will level out at 7-8bn despite UN projections suggesting it will hit 9bn in 2050, prompting huge questions. “Can we feed ourselves? Can we achieve, as a result of the challenge of climate change, social justice? It seems to me this is our biggest challenge but also our biggest potential disaster. “Can we change what looks like Armageddon into a real go to find global governance that will allow human beings to work with the forces of nature in a sustainable way?”"
"Good to read that the Guardian will be giving climate change more coverage (Why we put the climate on the cover, 7 March). One vital issue that has so far received only limited attention is the lack of a global-level regulator to make sure that in future the global aggregate of fossil-fuel emissions is drastically reduced each year, as dictated by climate science. Climate change is a global issue. It calls for worldwide regulation. Articles published by Scientists for Global Responsibility and the Green House thinktank in Cambridge explain how this could be carried out by an independent trust acting on behalf of all humanity. It could operate a global licensing system as a backup to the system of inter-governmental negotiation, which has failed because it is a system of negotiation between nation-state governments, and which might, but might well not, achieve the necessary global reductions. The new system is described at CapGlobalCarbon.org. The Guardian would be an ideal forum for discussion of this idea and for tracking the many steps required to turn a good idea into a successful project.John JoplingCloughjordan, Co Limerick, Ireland • Publishing a long extract from Naomi Klein’s latest book, This Changes Everything, is not going to have much effect on reducing the “havoc and stress to our species”. Her article canters through the science and glacially slow progress of governments to tackle the issue, interspersed with wistful expressions of hope that “climate change could become a catalysing force for positive change”. But where are the practical ways in which ordinary people can make a difference? Paradoxically, the section of society probably best placed to create positive change is the very group she criticises most. Business – multinationals in particular – is the key to building low-carbon economies, reducing environmental impacts and inspiring large numbers of people to modify their consumption habits.  Rather than treat all businesses as pariahs, why not work with some of the more progressive ones to help their consumers become a catalysing force? Why not urge Naomi Klein’s thousands of followers and the Guardian’s readers to use their buying power to reward companies that are trying to decarbonise their business? That would be a lot more effective than reams of rhetoric or never-ending debate. Rusbridger describes the Guardian as “this extraordinary agent of reporting, argument, investigation, questioning and advocacy”. Why not add change to this list?Richard AldwinckleLondon • You assert (Editorial, 9 March): “So the phenomenon of the climate change refugee is not new. What is new is that, this time, the problem is of human making.” You blame global warming and climate change caused by the profligate burning of fossil fuels. Thus droughts and floods force people to migrate – with sad consequences, such as those who drown in perilous seas. Not once do you remind us that the world population explosion is also to blame for global warming. Each of us has a carbon footprint. Naomi Klein (This changes everything, 9 March) similarly ignores this most obvious fact. I would like to see a higher proportion of the UK’s foreign aid assigned to supporting family planning in those nations that might request it.Giles YoungsDrinkstone, Suffolk"

"Thousands of climate change protesters gathered in central London on Saturday to urge strong action at the Paris climate conference in December. Protesters set off from Lincoln’s Inn Fields and headed for Westminster to hear from speakers including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas and the head of Greenpeace UK John Sauven. The Campaign Against Climate Change, who organised the march, said “well over 20,000” people attended. The number of attendees was buoyed by the bright sunshine of early spring. Last September 40,000 people took to London’s streets as part of the biggest demonstration on climate change action in history. Sauven said the protest on Saturday was the first step in a year of climate action. “This is much smaller in terms of its aims and objectives [than the global day of action in 2014]. But I think it’s also just the beginning. By the time we get to Paris then we have to have far bigger numbers than we had last year in September.” Lucas said climate change was visible and demanded action. “It’s time to stand up against those determined to burn the last drops of oil and gas and be confident in our power to build a better future,” she said. “In coming together we help build the climate movement and inspire others to join us.”  She said there had been a failure of political leadership: “It’s a refusal on the part of most politicians to stand up to fossil fuel lobbyists, listen to the scientists, and act in the public interest.” The author Naomi Klein urged grassroots activists to redouble their efforts during the months before December’s climate change conference in Paris. In a video message for the rally, she said it was not only political leaders who held the power to act on climate change. “Here we are, with just nine months ahead of those critical climate talks in Paris. It’s not nine months to pressure our leaders to act. We have nine months to act ourselves. Nine months to become the leaders we need. To lead from below, from the streets, from the neighbourhoods, from the smallest towns to the biggest cities,” the author said. The designer Vivienne Westwood, who also made a video message, said: “You’re not alone, people know what’s going on. We must keep up the fight against climate change, the clock is ticking.” Leila Wilmers, 30, who attended the rally, said both government and big business needed to do more than “just telling people to switch their lightbulbs off and so on”. Andrew Musser, 30, a physicist at Cambridge University, said: “The government policy is quite bizarre. They say they’re concerned about the environment but then they propose wide-scale fracking. I think they need to move to renewable energy, particularly hydropower and solar power.” The Guardian has launched a campaign to examine the consequences of climate change. Alan Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief, wrote: “The coming debate is about two things: what governments can do to attempt to regulate, or otherwise stave off, the now predictably terrifying consequences of global warming beyond 2C by the end of the century. And how we can prevent the states and corporations which own the planet’s remaining reserves of coal, gas and oil from ever being allowed to dig most of it up. We need to keep them in the ground.” Metropolitan police officers were stationed around the march following a back down on their previous refusal to police peaceful protests last month.       "

"James Inhofe, the US senator who famously claimed that global warming was “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people”, attempted to underscore his climate denial on the Senate floor Thursday by brandishing a snowball. “I ask the chair: do you know what this is? It’s a snowball,” said Inhofe, hefting the icy globe in his right hand, before tossing it at a Senate page.  The snowball stunt was part of a rambling speech to America’s most august deliberative body in which, among other points, Inhofe took aim at evidence by scientists that 2014 was the warmest year on record due to climate change. (According to detailed research Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, two of the top bodies of government scientists, it was.) In 2010, during another record-breaking snowstorm, Inhofe and his grandchildren built an igloo near the Capitol building in Washington, affixing signs to it that said “Al Gore’s New Home” and “Honk If You Love Global Warming”. Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, is chair of the Senate environment committee. “I think it’s lovely that Senator Inhofe enjoys the winter weather so much,” said Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “I’m a winter sports fan myself. But there’s a big difference between people playing with the snow, and global climate change.” Schmidt told the Guardian that, despite Senator Inhofe’s views, 2014 had indisputably been the warmest year on record, and January 2015 had been one of the warmest Januaries on record. “Europe was toasty warm. Alaska was toasty warm. Australia was toasty warm. All these things cancel out the fact that it happens to be cold in Washington DC this week,” he said. Inhofe’s office could not be reached for comment."
"I have spent almost 50 years working in the extractive industries or related fields. Indeed, as a director of Saudi Aramco, I still do. I have always considered that the supply of reliable economic and convenient energy makes an essential contribution to the economic and – in many cases – social and sustainable development of society. However, as with most things we humans set our hands to, this has never been without downsides.   Fired by coal and powered by steam, the industrial revolution brought progress from which we all benefit today. Damaging local environmental side-effects were addressed by a gradual switch to cleaner burning and less polluting hydrocarbon fuels. However, another more global side-effect has emerged: climate change. In the late 1990s, Shell and BP publicly acknowledged this and have not retreated from this position. Although both companies have effectively withdrawn from solar and wind energy, I believe Shell is probably the world’s largest producer of biofuels and one of the largest producers of hydrogen.  It surprises many people that Saudi Aramco is investing in both solar and wind energy, to avoid the waste of hydrocarbons needed to meet Saudi Arabia’s seemingly insatiable, and often wasteful, use of energy.  The industry is not, as Jonathon Porritt might have us believe, a bunch of climate change-denying dinosaurs living in what he calls “a morality free zone”, whose economic interests blind us to change. Of course, there are those in the industry – I suspect in about the same proportion as in all walks of life – who question the almost universally-accepted orthodoxy.  Unfortunately, recognising a problem is not the same as finding a solution. In this case, the solution is made more difficult by the reliance of the present global economy on the supply of relatively affordable and convenient energy from fossil fuels.  Were it not for the urgency imposed by the threat of rapid climate change, we could relax in the knowledge that a gradual evolution of the global energy system would continue: the same process that has been going on for more than a century. However, as a result of climate change, there is a need to accelerate the transformation.  I suggest that there are two essential drivers of change, both of which require cooperation between different sectors of society. The first is putting a price on carbon. This is one of the rational methods of encouraging the development of a low-carbon economy and of differentiating between more and less damaging forms of fossil fuels. Shell, BP and many in other industries have called for this and have applied it internally when making investment decisions. My preference would be for an effective cap and trade system, which gives us some chance of avoiding the most damaging consequences of climate change, but in the absence of this a carbon tax is a start, although a less ideal and flexible one.  While I am a strong believer in the power of markets and price signals, regulatory frameworks are necessary to guide the market in societally desirable directions. This approach can be used to set minimum carbon efficiency standards which would, in the absence of carbon capture and storage, effectively restrict fossil fuel consumption for power generation to low carbon intensity fuels.  So why do we not see faster adoption of these two relatively simple approaches to driving our energy systems in a sensible direction? It is probably because each part of society shifts the responsibility of action to another. Governments are nervous about moving faster because of the reaction of consumers and voters to increasing costs. They are also concerned about damaging the economy and of reducing industrial competitiveness.  Businesses in various sectors stoke this fear, while at the same time complaining that governments are not grasping the mettle and working to establish an effective carbon price or regulatory framework. Consumers (including perhaps Jonathon Porritt?) put all the blame on companies for not investing in the right things.  It puzzles many people that oil companies continue to develop oil and gas fields and seek new sources, when one day we may only need hydrocarbons for petrochemicals and lubrication. Although the demand for liquid hydrocarbons is declining in Europe and North America due to increased efficiency, it is growing elsewhere as economies develop and modernise.  These developing economies will not follow exactly the same path as the OECD countries have done, but most people see a continued rise in global demand for oil and gas, before it reaches a downward turning point. In the meantime, we have to find and develop enough hydrocarbons to meet the growing demand and, equally important, offset the decline of existing sources.  Any thoughtful energy company will be working to make sure its own portfolio of assets remains robust against relatively high carbon prices. There are serious economic risks in erring in either direction, just as there are climate risks if we do not manage the energy transition properly. I do not believe this means those working in one part of the market are morally bankrupt or less responsible than others. It does mean that we need to unite to put in place the price and regulatory frameworks to ensure a rational social and economic transition.  The leadership hub is funded by Xyntéo.

"Climate change is real, caused almost entirely by humans, and presents a potentially existential threat to human civilisation. Solving climate change does not mean rolling back capitalism, suspending the free market or stopping economic growth. With those two rather innocuous statements, I have just alienated most people on either side of the climate debate. Today, climate change is no longer just a scientific or an energy problem. Instead, one’s position on global warming has become a badge of political identity in a debate riven by ideological and tribal conflicts. This bodes ill for humanity’s chances of addressing the threat before it is too late. The nature of the scientific consensus, which on the face of it should be pretty straightforward, has become one of the most bitterly contested issues. Each storm, heatwave and temperature rise – or fall – is fought over, not for what it is but for what it represents. An east coast blizzard apparently represents a victory for the naysayers, as exemplified by climate denier Jim Inhofe’s absurd brandishing of a snowball on the floor of the US Senate. Arctic ice melting is a success for the “alarmists”, while Antarctic ice growing is a boon for the “deniers”. This isn’t science; it is politics. The science – as articulated by the IPPC – says the warming of the climate system is “unequivocal”, that the last 30 years were probably the warmest for the last 1,500 years, and that it is “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century”. Moreover, if current emissions trends continue, warming of 4C or even 6C becomes a possibility this century. No exaggeration is needed to illustrate the gravity of the threat – warming of this magnitude would destabilise major ice sheets, lead to catastrophic shifts in weather patterns, and cause havoc with ecosystems and human societies. The planet’s temperature, along with CO2 levels, would be higher than for tens of millions of years. We should all be able to agree on this. But we can’t, because this scientific narrative seems to have been captured by one, rather extreme, end of the political spectrum. The Guardian’s climate campaign is, in principle, very welcome. But it risks reinforcing this polarisation by leading with two extensive extracts from Naomi Klein’s latest book, This Changes Everything: Climate vs Capitalism. Lefties will lap it up; others will see it as evidence that science has been appropriated as cover for an ideological project. For Klein, whose career has always focused on fighting capitalism, climate change merely means we must renew that fight. It doesn’t seem to strike her as odd or fortuitous that this new “crisis”, which she admits she’s only lately discovered, should “change everything” for everyone else but merely reinforce her own decades-old ideological position. Her analysis of the problem is the same as for all the rest of today’s challenges – that it is the fault of multinational corporations, “market fundamentalism” and the “elites”, who in her view control the media and democratic politics. Global warming issue has now become as much as part of America’s culture wars as abortion or creationism Depressingly, all this confirms what social psychologists have long insisted: that most people accept only scientific “facts” that are compatible with or which reinforce their political identities and worldviews. The environmental left leapt on climate science because it seemed to confirm deeply held notions of the planet being fragile, and modern civilisation being in essence destructive. Moreover, climate science at last seemed to herald the global doom that the eco-Malthusian left had always hoped for. Reacting against this rather miserabilist and dystopian worldview, the political right has increasingly adopted an outright denialist position – attacking the science in a covert war against the political ideology it has been co-opted to serve. The reason half of Americans doubt the science on climate change isn’t because they are stupid or misled by the fossil fuels lobby, but because the global warming issue has now become as much as part of America’s culture wars as abortion or creationism. And let’s not presume that the environmental movement, or the left, has a monopoly on Enlightenment values. Most of those fighting the good climate fight on the basis of scientific consensus fall over themselves to deny an equivalently strong consensus on the safety of nuclear power and GM crops. Witness the recent “no consensus” statement pushed by the greens on GM crops, which exactly parallel “no consensus” statements pushed by the right on the climate. Stuck in their political trenches, neither side sees the irony – or the damage they are doing to science overall. All of this makes climate change much harder to deal with than it would otherwise be. In insisting that tackling carbon emissions must be subordinated into a wider agenda of social revolution and the dismantling of corporate capitalism, Klein isn’t making climate mitigation easier: she is making it politically toxic. In rejecting “too easy” solutions such as nuclear power and advanced renewables technologies (the dreaded “technofix”), the left puts its cards on the table – and confirms what the right has always suspected: that climate mitigation is not a primary but at best a secondary goal. This is also a debate conducted in a western bubble. No one in India doubts that the emergence from poverty of hundreds of millions of people in south Asia will require the production of prodigious amounts more energy – far more than could ever be compensated for by any remotely plausible “energy austerity” path taken by the west. Don’t forget: rich OECD countries have already peaked their CO2 emissions, so pretty much all the future growth will come from Asia, Africa and South America. Forget the political myths: here’s the hard reality. The emergence from poverty of the developing world is non-negotiable. Humanity will therefore double or triple energy consumption overall by 2050. Our challenge is to develop and deploy the technology to deliver this energy in as low-carbon a way as possible, probably using some combination of efficiency, renewables, next-generation nuclear and carbon capture. We need to pour vastly more resources into R&D, and put a significant international price on carbon. But to make any of this happen we will need to recapture the climate debate from the political extremes. We must then work to come up with inclusive proposals that can form the basis of a social consensus that must last decades if it is to have any meaningful effect on the climate change crisis that faces us."
"Officials with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the agency in charge of setting conservation policy and enforcing environmental laws in the state, issued directives in 2011 barring thousands of employees from using the phrases “climate change” and “global warming”, according to a bombshell report by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (FCIR).  The report ties the alleged policy, which is described as “unwritten”, to the election of Republican governor Rick Scott and his appointment of a new department director that year. Scott, who was re-elected last November, has declined to say whether he believes in climate change caused by human activity.  “I’m not a scientist,” he said in one appearance last May. Scott’s office did not comment on Sunday, when contacted by the Guardian. A spokesperson for the governor told the FCIR team: “There’s no policy on this.” The FCIR report was based on statements by multiple named former employees who worked in different DEP offices around Florida. The instruction not to refer to “climate change” came from agency supervisors as well as lawyers, according to the report.  “We were told not to use the terms ‘climate change’, ‘global warming’ or ‘sustainability’,” the report quotes Christopher Byrd, who was an attorney with the DEP’s Office of General Counsel in Tallahassee from 2008 to 2013, as saying. “That message was communicated to me and my colleagues by our superiors in the Office of General Counsel.” “We were instructed by our regional administrator that we were no longer allowed to use the terms ‘global warming’ or ‘climate change’ or even ‘sea-level rise’,” said a second former DEP employee, Kristina Trotta. “Sea-level rise was to be referred to as ‘nuisance flooding’.” According to the employees’ accounts, the ban left damaging holes in everything from educational material published by the agency to training programs to annual reports on the environment that could be used to set energy and business policy. The 2014 national climate assessment for the US found an “imminent threat of increased inland flooding” in Florida due to climate change and called the state “uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise”.

"If you visit the website of the UN body that oversees the world’s climate negotiations, you will find dozens of pictures, taken across 20 years, of people clapping. These photos should be of interest to anthropologists and psychologists. For they show hundreds of intelligent, educated, well-paid and elegantly-dressed people wasting their lives. The celebratory nature of the images testifies to the world of make-believe these people inhabit. They are surrounded by objectives, principles, commitments, instruments and protocols, which create a reassuring phantasm of progress while the ship on which they travel slowly founders. Leafing through these photos, I imagine I can almost hear what the delegates are saying through their expensive dentistry. “Darling you’ve re-arranged the deckchairs beautifully. It’s a breakthrough! We’ll have to invent a mechanism for holding them in place, as the deck has developed a bit of a tilt, but we’ll do that at the next conference.” This process is futile because they have addressed the problem only from one end, and it happens to be the wrong end. They have sought to prevent climate breakdown by limiting the amount of greenhouse gases that are released; in other words, by constraining the consumption of fossil fuels. But, throughout the 23 years since the world’s governments decided to begin this process, the delegates have uttered not one coherent word about constraining production. Compare this to any other treaty-making process. Imagine, for example, that the Biological Weapons Convention made no attempt to restrain the production or possession of weaponised smallpox and anthrax, but only to prohibit their use. How effective do you reckon it would be? (You don’t have to guess: look at the US gun laws, which prohibit the lethal use of guns but not their sale and carriage. You can see the results on the news every week.) Imagine trying to protect elephants and rhinos only by banning the purchase of their tusks and horns, without limiting killing, export or sale. Imagine trying to bring slavery to an end not by stopping the transatlantic trade, but by seeking only to discourage people from buying slaves once they had arrived in the Americas. If you want to discourage a harmful trade, you must address it at both ends: production and consumption. Of the two, production is the most important. The extraction of fossil fuels is a hard fact. The rules governments have developed to prevent their use are weak, inconsistent and negotiable. In other words, when coal, oil and gas are produced, they will be used. Continued production will overwhelm attempts to restrict consumption. Even if efforts to restrict consumption temporarily succeed, they are likely to be self-defeating. A reduction in demand when supply is unconstrained lowers the price, favouring carbon-intensive industry. You can search through the UN’s website for any recognition of this issue, but you would be wasting your time. In its gushing catalogue of self-congratulation, at Kyoto, Doha, Bali, Copenhagen, Cancún, Durban, Lima and all stops en route, the phrase “fossil fuel” does not occur once. Nor do the words coal or oil. But gas: oh yes, there are plenty of mentions of gas. Not natural gas, of course, but of greenhouse gases, the sole topic of official interest. The closest any of the 20 international conferences convened so far have come to acknowledging the problem is in the resolution adopted in Lima in December last year. It pledged “cooperation” in “the phasing down of high-carbon investments and fossil fuel subsidies”, but proposed no budget, timetable or any instrument or mechanism required to make it happen. It’s progress of a sort, I suppose, and perhaps, after just 23 years, we should be grateful.  There is nothing random about the pattern of silence that surrounds our lives. Silences occur where powerful interests are at risk of exposure. They protect these interests from democratic scrutiny. I’m not suggesting that the negotiators decided not to talk about fossil fuels, or signed a common accord to waste their lives. Far from it: they have gone to great lengths to invest their efforts with the appearance of meaning and purpose. Creating a silence requires only an instinct for avoiding conflict. It is a conditioned and unconscious reflex; part of the package of social skills that secures our survival. Don’t name the Devil for fear that you’ll summon him. Breaking such silences requires a conscious and painful effort. I remember as if it were yesterday how I felt when I first raised this issue in the media. I had been working with a group of young activists in Wales, campaigning against opencast coal mines. Talking it over with them, it seemed so obvious, so overwhelming, that I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t on everyone’s lips. Before writing about it, I circled the topic like a dog investigating a suspicious carcass. Why, I wondered, is no one touching this? Is it toxic? You cannot solve a problem without naming it. The absence of official recognition of the role of fossil fuel production in causing climate change – blitheringly obvious as it is – permits governments to pursue directly contradictory policies. While almost all governments claim to support the aim of preventing more than 2C of global warming, they also seek to “maximise economic recovery” of their fossil fuel reserves. (Then they cross their fingers, walk three times widdershins around the office and pray that no one burns it.) But few governments go as far as the UK has gone. In the Infrastructure Act that received royal assent last month, maximising the economic recovery of petroleum from the UK’s continental shelf became a statutory duty. Future governments are now legally bound to squeeze every possible drop out of the ground.  The idea came from a government review conducted by Sir Ian Wood, the billionaire owner of an inherited company – the Wood Group – that provides services to the oil and gas industry. While Sir Ian says his recommendations “received overwhelming industry support”, his team interviewed no one outside either the oil business or government. It contains no sign that I can detect of any feedback from environment groups or scientists. His review demanded government powers to enhance both the exploration of new reserves and the exploitation of existing ones. This, it insisted, “will help take us closer to the 24bn [barrel] prize potentially still to come”. The government promised to implement his recommendations in full and without delay. In fact it went some way beyond them. It is prepared to be ruthlessly interventionist when promoting climate change, but not when restraining it. During December’s climate talks in Lima, the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Davey, did something unwise. He broke the silence. He warned that if climate change policies meant that fossil fuel reserves could no longer be exploited, pension funds could be investing in “the sub-prime assets of the future”. Echoing the Bank of England and financial analysts such as the Carbon Tracker Initiative, Davey suggested that if governments were serious about preventing climate breakdown, fossil fuel could become a stranded asset. This provoked a furious response from the industry. The head of Oil and Gas UK Malcolm Webb wrote to express his confusion, pointing out that Davey’s statements came “at a time when you, your Department and the Treasury are putting great effort into [making] the UK North Sea more attractive to investors in oil and gas, not less. I’m intrigued to understand how such opposing viewpoints can be reconciled.” He’s not the only one. Ed Davey quickly explained that his comments were not to be taken seriously, as “I did not offer any suggestions on what investors should choose to do.” Barack Obama has the same problem. During a television interview last year, he confessed that “We’re not going to be able to burn it all.” So why, he was asked, has his government been encouraging ever more exploration and extraction of fossil fuels? His administration has opened up marine oil exploration from Florida to Delaware – in waters that were formally off-limits. It has increased the number of leases sold for drilling on federal lands and, most incongruously, rushed through the process that might, by the end of this month, enable Shell to prospect in the highly vulnerable Arctic waters of the Chukchi Sea. Similar contradictions beset most governments with environmental pretensions. Norway, for example, intends to be “carbon neutral” by 2030. Perhaps it hopes to export its entire oil and gas output, while relying on wind farms at home. A motion put to the Norwegian parliament last year to halt new drilling because it is incompatible with Norway’s climate change policies was defeated by 95 votes to three. Obama explained that “I don’t always lead with the climate change issue because if you, right now, are worried about whether you’ve got a job or if you can pay the bills, the first thing you want to hear is how do I meet the immediate problem?” Money is certainly a problem, but not necessarily for the reasons Obama suggested. The bigger issue is the bankrolling of politics by big oil and big coal, and the tremendous lobbying power they purchase. These companies have, in the past, financed wars to protect their position; they will not surrender the bulk of their reserves without a monumental fight. This fight would test the very limits of state power; I wonder whether our nominal democracies would survive it. Fossil fuel companies have become glutted on silence: their power has grown as a result of numberless failures to challenge and expose them. It’s no wonder that the manicured negotiators at the UN conferences, so careful never to break a nail, have spent so long avoiding the issue.  I believe there are ways of resolving this problem, ways that might recruit other powerful interests against these corporations. For example, a global auction in pollution permits would mean that governments had to regulate just a few thousand oil refineries, coal washeries, gas pipelines and cement and fertiliser factories, rather than the activities of seven billion people. It would create a fund from the sale of permits that’s likely to run into trillions: money that could be used for anything from renewable energy to healthcare. By reducing fluctuations in the supply of energy, it would deliver more predictable prices, that many businesses would welcome. Most importantly, unlike the current framework for negotiations, it could work, producing a real possibility of averting climate breakdown. Left to themselves, the negotiators will continue to avoid this issue until they have wasted everyone else’s lives as well as their own. They keep telling us that the conference in Paris in December is the make or break meeting (presumably they intend to unveil a radical new deckchair design). We should take them at their word, and demand that they start confronting the real problem.  With the help of George Marshall at the Climate Outreach and Information Network, I’ve drafted a paragraph of the kind that the Paris agreement should contain. It’s far from perfect, and I would love to see other people refining it. But, I hope, it’s a start: “Scientific assessments of the carbon contained in existing fossil fuel reserves suggest that full exploitation of these reserves is incompatible with the agreed target of no more than 2C of global warming. The unrestricted extraction of these reserves undermines attempts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. We will start negotiating a global budget for the extraction of fossil fuels from existing reserves, as well as a date for a moratorium on the exploration and development of new reserves. In line with the quantification of the fossil carbon that can be extracted without a high chance of exceeding 2C of global warming, we will develop a timetable for annual reductions towards that budget. We will develop mechanisms for allocating production within this budget and for enforcement and monitoring.” If something of that kind were to emerge from Paris, it will not have been a total waste of time, and the delegates would be able to congratulate themselves on a real achievement rather than yet another false one. Then, for once, they would deserve their own applause. • Twitter: @georgemonbiot. A fully referenced version of this article can be found at Monbiot.com"

"Insurance companies could suffer a “huge hit” if their investments in fossil fuel companies are rendered worthless by action on climate change, the Bank of England warned on Tuesday. “One live risk right now is of insurers investing in assets that could be left ‘stranded’ by policy changes which limit the use of fossil fuels,” said Paul Fisher, deputy head of the bank’s prudential regulation authority (PRA) that supervises banks and insurers and is tasked with avoiding systemic risks to the economy.  “As the world increasingly limits carbon emissions, and moves to alternative energy sources, investments in fossil fuels – a growing financial market in recent decades – may take a huge hit,” Fisher told an insurance conference. He said there “are already a few specific examples of this having happened”, but did not name them, and added that it was clear his concerns had yet to “permeate” the sector. The new warning from one of the world’s key central banks follows a caution from its head Mark Carney that the “vast majority of [fossil fuel] reserves are unburnable” if climate change is to be limited to 2C, as pledged by the world’s governments. The bank will deliver a report to government on the financial risk posed by a “carbon bubble” later in 2015. “It is encouraging to see this major central bank seeing the need to move with the times and understand its role in dealing with one of the major challenges facing our economies today: climate change,” said James Leaton, research director at the Carbon Tracker Initiative. “We hope to see other financial regulators around the world responding in a similar fashion and collaborating on this issue.”  A series of analyses have shown that most existing reserves of fossil fuels cannot be burned without blowing the safe budget for carbon emissions. A study in January indicated that 80% of coal reserves, half of gas and a third of oil would have to stay in the ground. But companies spent $670bn (£436bn) in 2013 alone searching for more fossil fuels, investments that could be worthless if action on global warming slashes allowed emissions.  Other senior financial figures have also warned of the risks to fossil fuel investments. Former US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson said in 2014: “When the credit bubble burst in 2008, the damage was devastating. We’re making the same mistake today with climate change. We’re staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to both our environment and economy.”  World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said: “Sooner rather than later, financial regulators must address the systemic risk associated with carbon-intensive activities in their economies.” Fisher told the Economist conference on Tuesday: “Climate change impacts insurers on both sides of their balance sheets. Insurers may be impacted by increased claims. But it appears that the asset side may also give rise to unexpected risks.” He said the insurance industry was already taking steps to stay ahead of the climate curve on the liability side, but were not doing so in their role as long term investors.”  Fisher said the bank’s approach to addressing systemic economic risks could be changed by its analysis of the carbon bubble. A recent discussion paper from the bank stated: “Fundamental changes in the environment could affect economic and financial stability and the safety and soundness of financial firms, with clear potential implications for central banks.” “Environmental risks, including climate change and climate policy, have already impacted a range of sectors and if anything this will grow in significance,” said Ben Caldecott, director of the stranded assets programme at the University of Oxford. “Assets from power stations to mortgages have exposure and the challenge is to figure out how much exposure, when this could be a problem, and to identify the best ways to manage such risks.”"

"The prolonged and devastating drought that sparked the mass migration of rural workers into Syrian cities before the 2011 uprising was probably made worse by greenhouse gas emissions, US scientists say. The study is one of the first to implicate global warming from human activities as one of the factors that played into the Syrian conflict which is estimated to have claimed more than 190,000 lives.  The severity of the 2006 to 2010 drought, and more importantly the failure of Bashar al-Assad’s regime to prepare, or respond to it effectively, exacerbated other tensions, from unemployment to corruption and inequality, which erupted in the wake of the Arab spring revolutions, the scientists say.  “We’re not arguing that the drought, or even human-induced climate change, caused the uprising,” said Colin Kelley at the University of California in Santa Barbara. “What we are saying is that the long term trend, of less rainfall and warmer temperatures in the region, was a contributing factor, because it made the drought so much more severe.”  From 2006, the Fertile Crescent, where farming was born 12,000 years ago, faced the worst three year drought in the instrumental record. Unsustainable agricultural policies meant that the drought led to the broad collapse of farming in northeastern Syria. Their livelihoods gone, an estimated one to 1.5 million people surged into the cities. The arrival of so many rural families came on the heels of a million Iraqi refugees who arrived after 2006, causing what Kelley refers to as a “huge population shock” in Syria’s most affected urban centres. Many of the displaced settled on the edges of cities, where already tough living conditions were made more challenging by poor access to water and electricity. Writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Kelley describes how the unsustainable farming practices in Syria led to a massive depletion of groundwater which was crucial for irrigating land beyond the reaches of the rivers.  But the dwindling groundwater was accompanied by a long term decline in rainfall in the region that affected farms watered from rivers. According to records Kelley studied, the Fertile Crescent, including Syria, witnessed a 13% drop in its winter rainfall since 1931. Another trend saw summer temperatures rising, which dried out much of the remaining moisture in the soils. To explore the causes of the drought, the US scientists turned to climate change models. They found that the models predicted the drier and warmer trend for Syria, but only when they included human greenhouse gas emissions. The trend made such a severe drought in Syria more than twice as likely, they report. “There’s a strong argument to be made that the long term trend contributed to this drought and was the reason it was the most severe drought they have ever had,” Kelley said. The theory has not convinced everyone though. Francesca de Châtel at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, points out that rural communities had been left disenfranchised and disaffected from 50 years of policies that exploited and mismanaged Syrian resources.  In the journal Middle Eastern Studies last year, she wrote that the government’s failure to respond to the drought crisis was only one of the triggers of the protests that started in March 2011, along with a host of other political, economic and social grievances. “The uprising has more to do with the government’s failure to respond to the drought, and with broader feelings of discontent in rural areas, and the growing gap between rich and poor, and urban and rural areas during the 2000s, than with the drought itself,” she told the Guardian. “I don’t think the uprising would have started in Syria if other countries in the region hadn’t set the example,” she added. “I also don’t think the movement would have persisted without input and support from organised groups in Syria who had been planning for this moment for years and certainly since before 2006 or the start of the drought.”  The US researchers agree that civil unrest never has a simple or unique cause, and that the civil war in Syria is no exception. But they warn that global warming is predicted to bring more severe climate events, and that some could hit countries where they could spark unrest. Kelley’s latest work suggests that Yemen could face its own problems with reduced rainfall in coming years. “This is an example of the emergence of climate change beginning to influence countries in a negative way. And if it continues, we’ll see more examples of that in the future,” he said."
