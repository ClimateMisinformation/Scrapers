"The fragrant jasmine rice growing on the left side of Kreaougkra Junpeng’s five-acre field stands nearly five feet tall. Each plant has 15 or more tillers, or stalks, and the grains hang heavy from them. The Thai farmer says this will be his best-ever harvest in 30 years and he will reap it four weeks earlier than usual.  It is very different on the other side of the field. Here, Junpeng planted his rice in closely spaced clumps of 20 or more seedlings in shallow water just as he, his father and millions of other small farmers across south-east Asia have always done. He used the same seeds but the conventionally grown plants are wind-battered and thin, and clearly have fewer, smaller grains. Junpeng is part of a pilot project to see if it’s possible to grow more rice with less water and fewer greenhouse gases. The dramatic difference between his two crops points a way to help the world’s 145 million small rice farmers, and could also greatly reduce global warming emissions from agriculture. The project, backed by the German and Thai governments and by some of the world’s largest rice traders and food companies, has seen 3,000 other farmers in this corner of Thailand’s “rice basket” near the Cambodian border trained to grow sustainable rice according to the principles of a revolutionary agronomical system discovered by accident in Madagascar in the 1980s. Jesuit priest Henri de Lalanié working in the highlands observed that by planting far fewer seeds than usual, using organic matter as a fertiliser and keeping the rice plants alternately wet and dry rather than flooded, resulted in yields that were increased by between 20 and 200%, while water use was halved. Giving plants more oxygen, minimising the competition between them and strictly controlling the water they receive is thought to make them stronger and more resilient to flood and drought. When it was first employed outside Madagascar in 2000, the system of rice intensification (SRI) was dismissed  by a handful of scientists who questioned the legitimacy of the reported increased yields. But since then, it has evolved and been developed by peasant farmers working in many different climates around the world. Academic criticism has since all but disappeared and the SRI system of farming has been validated in hundreds of scientific papers and adopted by up to 20 million farmers in 61 countries, according to the SRI information centre in Cornell University. “The results consistently cite yield increases, decreased use of seed, water and chemicals, and increased income,” says Norman Uphoff, professor of global agriculture at Cornell. Vietnamese, Cambodian, Nepalese, Filipino, Indian and African farmers have all reported large increases. In 2011, a young Indian farmer broke the world record for rice production, harvesting 22 tonnes from a single hectare (2.47 acres). “SRI is very positive in west Africa. It uses fewer seed and fertilisers and needs less water. Farmers saved up to 80% of the cost of seed and got increased yields and incomes. They see the advantages and they change. People are teaching each other now,” says Professor Bancy Mati, director of the water research centre at Jomo Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya. The Thai farmers who took part in the Ubon Ratchathani trial say they are delighted. Says Khampha Bunchansee from Noan Dang village: “It was very easy to learn. I will use the extra money to invest in a tractor. If I can do it, anyone can. Everyone can come and learn.” “I applied more fertiliser on my conventional crop but it produced lots more leaf but not more grain,” says Wanna Sriwila, also from Noan Dang. “Now I bring other farmers to see what can be done. Seeing is believing.” But what is now exciting some of the world’s largest food corporations and governments is that growing rice along SRI principles also greatly reduces emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, which escapes when rice, or any other crop, lies waterlogged for weeks at a time. Methane is roughly 30 times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and rice emits as much as 1.5% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. With the human population in south-east Asia expected to grow by around 100m people in the next 20 years, emissions from rice growing could increase 30% or more. The urgency to act for the global good, self-interest in maintaining production and the possibility of accessing money to reduce farm emissions has now led heavy rice-using food companies like Mars and Kellogg’s, and the agri-business colossus Olam, to set up the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). This coalition of companies, NGOs and governments sets the world’s first voluntary sustainability standards for rice growing. It adopts the basic SRI principle of planting seedlings further apart, and keeping them moist rather than flooded, but adds targets and measurements to provide consistency. “Rice is both a victim and a cause of climate change,” says Sunny Verghese, CEO of Singapore-based Olam’s, which grows its own rice on 25,000 acres in Nigeria, owns mills and processing plants across south-east Asia and ships nearly 20% of the world’s globally traded rice. “South-east Asian rice farmers are among the world’s most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as rising sea levels, salinity, temperature rise and droughts. Yields can decrease as much as 10% for each 1C temperature increase, threatening food security for billions of people. “With another two billion people we cannot carry on the way we are. We must go beyond what is currently being done and achieve far more at greater scale. We must re-imagine the whole food supply chain if the world is to become carbon neutral by 2050,” he says. “SRI should influence everyone’s thinking. In Nigeria we saw a 70% increase in yields, albeit from a low base. SRI is revolutionary. It is a genuine change in thinking. It is difficult for scientists to understand that an amateur [like Lalanié] should have a solution. We want to partner with SRI, to scale up in Africa. “But reducing emissions from rice cannot be a trade-off that hurts farmers and communities who depend on it for their income and sustenance. We have to measure the true cost of food and dismantle the subsidy system.” Working with German development agency GIZ and south-east Asian governments, Olam now plan to roll out SRP rice to 100,000 farmers in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and India within five years, increasing yields and incomes, and reducing methane emissions by 50%. Governments and global bodies must act too, says tropical agronomist Erika Styger, director of climate-resilient farming systems at Cornell University who led a three-year World Bank study of 50,000 farmers using SRI methods in 13 west African countries. This saw a 56% rise in yields in irrigated areas, an 86% increase in rain-fed areas and an average 41% increase in income. “The SRI revolution is happening. People are changing their practices and you can see SRI in the field in many places now. There is no reason why SRI should not become normal agronomic practice,” says Styger. “But there is no long term funding. If we want to make it mainstream it needs to get to a critical mass. We are left with breadcrumbs, with only short-term project finding,” she says. “The food system is broken. Olam on its own cannot fix it, we can only change it. We can’t do it overnight but there is a new way of collaborating. Companies must change and reduce their resource intensity. The whole food sector must change,” says Verghese. “What is needed now is large retailers to brand SRP. It’s the way we can reduce emissions, use less water and grow more. Win. Win. Win.”"
"Glaciers in western North America, excluding Alaska, are melting four times faster than in the previous decade, with changes in the jet stream exacerbating the longer-term effects of climate change, according to a new study. The retreat hasn’t been equal in the US and Canada. The famous alpine ice masses in the Cascade Mountains in the north-west US have largely been spared from the trend.  “The losses we would expect were reduced because we got a lot of additional snow,” said David Shean, a co-author at the University of Washington. “Moving forward we may not be so lucky.” The jet stream – the currents of fast-flowing air in the atmosphere that affect weather – has shifted, causing more snow in the north-western US and less in south-western Canada, according to the study released in Geophysical Research Letters, a publication of the American Geophysical Union. Changes in the northern hemisphere jet stream are increasingly firmly linked to global warming. That warming from humans burning fossil fuels is also expected to continue to melt alpine glaciers, even under scenarios for more moderate greenhouse gas levels. While some of the fourfold increase in the melting rate in western North America is related to manmade climate change, the researchers can’t say with certainty how much. “We’re starting to understand these shorter cycles that have real impacts on how the glaciers are behaving and how much water is stored in the glaciers,” Shean explained. Alaskan glaciers get much of the attention in North America because Alaska is warming faster than the continental US. Mount Hunter in Denali national park, is seeing 60 times more snow melt than it did 150 years ago. The North American glaciers analyzed in the new study are far smaller than those in Alaska, Asia and elsewhere, so they won’t contribute much to sea-level rise as they melt. The authors say they offer critical lessons for water management, fisheries and flood prevention. With shrinking glaciers, less water will be available for nearby river systems when rainfall is low. In some parts of the world, millions of people could lose their primary water supplies. In the Pacific north-west US, if glaciers melted entirely, that could reduce the flow of certain watersheds by up to about 15% in dry months of August and September, Shean said. “In our case that will have an impact, especially if we’re having a drought year … but in general at least for the foreseeable future we should be OK here in Washington,” he said. Snow pack changes will be more important than glacier melt for water planners in the western US, Shean said. Still, changes in water temperature could pose problems for fish. And the sediment that comes with melting glaciers could fall to the bottoms of riverbeds, making them overflow during heavy rains. The authors got their data by comparing satellite images of glaciers from 2000 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2018. They estimated elevation changes, which can be difficult to assess with the smallest glaciers. Other researchers are attempting to get spy satellite and aerial photos from the 1950s and 1960s declassified so they can study longer-term changes, Shean said."
"I’ve long felt America, particularly the south, where I grew up, is in the “denial” stage of grief when it comes to our psychological response to climate change. The sixth mass extinction has begun, our oceans are warming 40% faster than scientists anticipated, and the US’s carbon dioxide emissions rose 3.4% in 2018. How, I wonder, is everyone so calm? So business-as-usual? The field of ecopsychology explores our connection to nature, and the way it affects our state of mind. Many of us fail to realize how essential that connection is. Given that southern Florida – with its billions of dollars of vulnerable real estate on exposed coastline – is considered by many scientists as ground zero for climate change, I started my listening tour there. Floridians receive a constant stream of bad climate news. I was curious: does the state of the environment – specifically, the pending losses of biodiversity, tourism and property, and the prediction of category 6 hurricanes – keep people up at night?  After a long morning of driving through the Everglades, I stopped at Joanie’s Blue Crab Cafe, a vibrant red shack on the side of Highway 41 in Ochopee. “Sit anywhere you like, baby,” Lisa, the waitress, said. I grabbed a bottle of Coors from the cooler, and sat on the sun-soaked back deck overlooking a stretch of water lined with sawgrass and frequented by alligators. Over a few hours I saw cypress swamps, mangrove forests, osprey, bald eagles, roseate spoonbills and sandhill cranes. Even though there has been a 90% loss of wading birds in the Everglades this century, there is still so much left to lose. “You’re having the blackened grouper sandwich,” Lisa said. “So good it will make you cry.” Lisa was right – the grouper was incredible. And crying wasn’t out of the question. The government shutdown had given my trip a raw feeling. That morning signs were posted at the national park sites: “Enter at your own risk.” The Everglades – the largest subtropical wilderness left in the United States – is an environmental treasure imperiled by pollution, toxic algae blooms, disrupted water flow and politicians who favor big industries like sugar. Climate change denial and avoidance are prevalent here. The new governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, announced surprising plans for big environmental reforms earlier this month, without mentioning climate change (a term his predecessor, Rick Scott, also refused to use). Many people I spoke to in the Everglades didn’t want to talk about climate change. They considered it too political. After I got home, I reached out to Erica Henry, a biologist who studies at-risk butterfly populations in the Florida Keys and Everglades, for her take. “You could be fatalistic about the fact that the news is bad, or that particular species seem doomed,” she said. “You could be paralyzed. But I’ve picked off my little piece, the problem I can help solve.” I drove north, through Florida’s panhandle, witnessing miles of extensive tree damage from Hurricane Michael. I thought I’d hear tales of increasing environmental anxiety over rising seas, and the misery of enduring hurricane seasons in the era of climate change. But in nearly all of my conversations, I encountered more resolve than anxiety. I booked a charter boat out of Ocean Springs, near Biloxi, to see Mississippi’s barrier islands. My captain was Matthew Mayfield, a chef, restaurateur and fisherman with an infamous smoked tuna dip. As we pointed the skiff away from the Gulf Coast, he recalled how his wife’s dresses were caught in the branches of the oak trees after Hurricane Katrina, just waving around. We found a pelican skull and tail tracks of a small gator as we walked the white sand beaches of Horn Island, made famous by artist and conservationist Walter Anderson, who notoriously rode out Hurricane Betsy tethered to a tree. Mayfield told me about the clouds of monarchs that pass through in the fall. Generations from now, Horn Island may be gone. On the way home, I worked up the courage to ask Matthew why he rebuilt his life on the coast. “Why do you stay?” I asked. He said he needed time to think about it. In the days that followed, he sent me reasons and pictures of the family property, colorful sunsets, local food, and a tame fox. “People that live here realize that the reward greatly outweighs the risk and pain of a storm,” he explained. “No one really cares how much you make or what you do for a living. Maybe we have a bond that storms intensify.” “Don’t you worry about the future?” I asked. “I can’t live my life like that,” he said. A few days later, I stood across the street from the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, where 13 years ago Hurricane Katrina took down massive oak trees, ornamental fencing, a portion of roof and the marble hands of a statue of Jesus Christ. Cammie Hill-Prewitt, who coordinates residencies for artists focused on the environment for Tulane University, agreed to talk to me about the spiritual tax of living on the coast in the era of climate change. She evacuated for Katrina, but stayed through Isaac, pregnant and with three house guests. “I grind my teeth during hurricane season,” Hill-Prewitt admitted. “But I have a 30-year mortgage. My partner owns restaurants. It’s not easy to leave.” “We’re not exactly zen about it,” she clarified. “If you came back in September, when it’s hot, and there are four tropical depressions looming in the Atlantic, you’d get different responses. Incredible how short our memory is.” While waiting for the annual Joan of Arc parade to start, we talked about a kid she knew who processed the trauma of Katrina through his Lego play for years, building houses then smashing them to pieces. Thousands of people had lined the street, drinking, wearing sequined dresses and feathered hats. The drums started. A green paper mache dragon was hoisted into the air, followed by angels, then Joan of Arc on a well-trained horse. Hill-Prewitt leaned over to me. “This is why we stay,” she said. Later, I met Anna and Cam working at The Little Toy Shop near the bustling Cafe du Monde. They were in elementary school when Katrina hit. When I ask if they were anxious about climate change forecasts, Anna shrugged. “Maybe for a year or two after Katrina,” she said. Then she said something quietly profound. “You just learn not to get too attached to things.” From New Orleans, I drove through Mississippi, from Natchez, to Piney-Woods, and finally Oxford, where I joined Heather McTeer Toney for coffee. She was the first African American mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, and a former Obama appointee, overseeing the south-east region of the Environmental Protection Agency. I wanted to hear about her experience with frontline communities, people living near levees and in flood zones. “Our story of climate change and the south has always been about attachment to land,” Heather explained. “It’s generational. Cultural. This is our home and we’re as intertwined as flesh and blood.” Heather agreed with me that the south – particularly communities of color – is often unfairly painted as uniformly oblivious, and disinterested, when in fact the conversation is just taking place in a different language. “We talk about climate concerns daily, but express our fears through the changes we see in hunting, fishing and farming instead of carbon emissions and PM2 standards,” she said. “We understand it quite well and are fearful for the future of our homes and children.” During my trip, I thought that I might observe more of a cultural tipping point, an urgency in places that need it most. But I found that many members of coastal communities have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather. Avoidance and denial are proven coping mechanisms. And, frankly, most people are just trying to work and get through the day, and express concern for the future differently, from off-record conversations to outright advocacy. But continuing to reckon with a science-based reality – as painful and worry-inducing as it might be – is an important step toward informing meaningful, individual action. Home is an emotional commitment. We’re an adaptable species, but also habitual and sentimental; that’s one reason we’re stuck in denial. It’s the reason change is going to hurt so much."

"Removing coal from the global energy mix is taking too long, too many forests are still being destroyed, and fossil fuel subsidies are ongoing despite their distorting effect on the market, a  study has found. There has also been insufficient progress in agriculture to stop harmful practices that increase carbon dioxide production, and heavy industry is not doing enough to use energy more efficiently, according to analysis carried out by the World Resources Institute thinktank. Without progress on all these fronts, the world is unlikely to see global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2020, which is likely to be necessary to stay within the 1.5C or 2C warming thresholds that scientists have identified as key to the future safety of the planet. But the analysis also found important steps forward, on renewable energy, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, and public sector investment in reducing emissions. These suggest progress in other aspects of tackling climate change is also possible, with greater effort from the public and private sectors. The WIR looked at six key goals that have been pegged as necessary to cause emissions to peak in 2020 and achieve the targets of the 2015 Paris agreement. They include goals on energy, transport, land use, industry, infrastructure and finance. The report found that renewable energy accounted for about a quarter of global electricity generation in 2017, and more than two-thirds of new power generation capacity. By 2020, electricity from renewables is likely to be consistently cheaper than fossil fuel energy, making it possible that 30% of electricity could come from renewable sources by 2030, one of the Mission2020 milestones. But coal-fired generation is still increasing, with coal-fired power plants continuing to be built in some areas, while existing plants are not being removed from service fast enough. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, comprise 1.4% of overall sales, making a 2020 milestone of 15% of new car sales hard to reach. The goals are the work of Mission 2020, a global coalition of several climate analysis organisations, headed by Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris accord. Mission 2020 has calculated that if these milestones are achieved by 2020, it will make the longer-term Paris goals possible – because progress now on reducing emissions will make it easier and cheaper to reduce them in the longer term – and wants to spur sufficient progress on climate change to bring that about. Figueres is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to press political and business leaders for more support for climate change initiatives. She said: “The impacts [of climate change] have never been as clear, nor action so urgent, as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return. It would follow, then, that leaders everywhere should now be discussing this number one concern as their number one priority.” She added: “The decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark on to safeguard our climate and clean up our air. This is the make it or break it opportunity we have, knowing that the world is expected to invest about $90tn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030, with much of this investment to be programmed in the next few years.”"
"The Guardian is the only newspaper to recognise the seriousness of the threat we face from accelerating climate breakdown. Yet you, like Labour, still treat it as an “add-on” – as a separate subject, not something that, in Naomi Klein’s words, changes everything. Thus Jonathan Haidt and Pamela Paresky (Opinion, 10 January) write about the mental effects of childhood stress, never mentioning how terrifying it is for children to live in an environment of existential threat coupled with denial. Thus Owen Jones (Opinion, 10 January) discusses Labour’s Brexit choices and the need to reverse austerity, with no recognition that redistribution must now be within an economy focused on reducing emissions to net zero by 2030, not on “good” growth. All discussion of Brexit or any other policy issue should now be in the context of the need for central and local government to enter emergency mode.Caro NewGreen party of England and Wales campaigns coordinator (jobshare)  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Last year was Australia’s third-warmest year on record, with every state and territory recording above average temperatures in 2018. According to the Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate statement, the nation’s average temperature last year was 1.14C above the average for 1961-1990, making 2018 slightly warmer than 2017. “When we look across all of Australia in 2018, we can see that every single state and territory had above average day and night-time temperatures,” the bureau’s senior climatologist, Lynette Bettio, said in a statement on Thursday. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The average maximum temperature for the country as a whole was particularly warm, sitting 1.55 °C above the 1961–1990 average, making 2018 Australia’s second warmest year on record for daily high temperatures. Nine of the 10 warmest years on record in Australia have occurred since 2005. Bettio said the only part of the country to buck the trend for above average temperatures was Western Australia’s Kimberley region, which had cooler than average nights for the year. The bureau said rainfall totals in Australia in 2018 were the lowest since 2005. The total was 11% below the 1961-1990 average, but many areas experienced significantly lower average rainfalls, the bureau found. Bettio said large areas of south-east Australia had rainfall totals in the lowest 10% on record. New South Wales had its sixth-driest year on record while the Murray-Darling Basin had its seventh driest. However, some parts of northern Australia and south-east Western Australia received above average rainfall totals. The climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said the data confirmed what Australians knew about climate change. He said increasingly hotter years were the country’s “new normal” and polling by the institute showed just under three quarters of Australians (73%) had serious concerns about climate change. “Most Australians will feel vindicated that 2018 was officially one of the hottest years on record, having felt the impacts that are now becoming the new norm,” he said. “We have entered a new normal of increasingly hotter years and in 2018 we had a spike in Australians seriously concerned about the changing climate – 73% in 2018, up from 66% in 2017.” The bureau’s statement follows a run of exceptionally high temperatures around the nation late last month, along with a prolonged heatwave in Queensland in late November and early December. Globally, 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service assessment, released on Tuesday. The last four years have seen the highest average temperatures globally since records began in the 19th century."
"The 16-year-old activist behind the fast-growing School Strikes 4 Climate Action has taken her campaign to the streets of Davos, to confront world leaders and business chiefs about the global emissions crisis. Greta Thunberg, whose solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament has snowballed across the globe, will join a strike by Swiss schoolchildren in the ski resort on Friday – the final day of the World Economic Forum.  Thunberg travelled by train for 32 hours to reach Davos, and spent Wednesday night camped with climate scientists on the mountain slopes – where temperatures plunged to -18C. Having already addressed the UN Climate Change COP 24 conference, Thunberg is rapidly becoming the voice for a generation who are demanding urgent action to slow the rise in global temperatures. As she travelled down Davos’s funicular railway from the Arctic Base Camp – while more than 30,000 students were striking in Belgium - Thunberg said the rapid growth of her movement was “incredible”. “There have been climate strikes, involving students and also adults, on every continent except Antarctica. It has involved tens of thousands of children.” Wow! They're back and this time they're 32,000 strong! These students want #climateaction and they are not going to stop marching until they get it! Be Like Them!!!#ActOnClimate #Klimaatmars #Youth4Climate #ClimateMarch #klimatstrejk #FridaysForFuture via @Green_Europe pic.twitter.com/Jra5Zq4TLg Thunberg started her protest by striking for three weeks outside the Swedish parliament, lobbying MPs to comply with the Paris Agreement. After the Swedish election, she continued to strike every Friday, where she is now joined by hundreds of people. “This Friday I can’t be there,” she told the Guardian. “So I will have to do it here in Davos, and send a message that this is the only thing that matters.” Students around the world have been inspired by Thunberg, with thousands skipping school in Australia in November. Last Friday there were strikes in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, where more than 20,000 students skipped school. Missing gym class, geography and religion each Friday is something of a sacrifice for Thunberg, who says she loves school and can’t pick a favourite subject. “I like all subjects. I love learning, which people maybe don’t think about me.” She’s also been forced to give up her hobbies, as climate change activism has taken more of her time. “I used to play theatre, sing, dance, play an instrument, ride horses, lots of things.” She’s sanguine, though, pointing out that climate activism is much more important: “You have to see the bigger perspective.” Thunberg said she would like more students to join her strike. “That would have a huge impact, but I’m not going to force anyone to do this.” In the UK, only a small number of students have so far begun strikes, including 13-year-old Holly Gillibrand in Fort William. But plans are now being made for a big strike on 15 February. Thunberg predicts there will be protests in many locations. She believes parents should be supportive if their children tell them they’re striking on Friday. “Everyone keeps saying that the young people should be more active, and they’re so lazy, but once we do something we get criticised.” The world’s scientists warned in October that, without a dramatic ramping up of action to cut emissions, global temperatures would rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with severe consequences for humanity. Thunberg believes the older generations need to acknowledge that they have failed to protect the environment. “We need to hold the older generations accountable for the mess they have created, and expect us to live with. It is not fair that we have to pay for what they have caused,” she says. Thunberg has also called on business leaders and politicians to commit to “real and bold climate action”, and focus on the “future living conditions of mankind” rather than economic goals and profits. In a video address for leaders attending Davos she says: “I ask you to stand on the right side of history. I ask you to pledge to do everything in your power to push your own business or government in line with a 1.5C world.” Thunberg has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, which she believes helps her see the problem of climate change clearly. “My brain works a bit different and so I see things in black and white. Either we start a chain reaction with events beyond our control, or we don’t. Either we stop the emissions or we don’t. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.” The school strikes last Friday were by far the biggest to date. In Germany, an estimated 30,000 students left their schools in more than 50 cities to protest, carrying banners including: “Why learn without a future?” and “Grandpa, what is a snowman?” One 17-year-old student in Kiel, Moritz, told Deutsche Welle: “We want to help shape and secure our future so that there will be another world for us to live in in 60 years.” In Belgium, 12,500 students went on strike last Thursday and plan to strike weekly until the EU elections in May. Some teachers were tolerant of the truancy. Patrick Lancksweerdt, in Brussels, said: “Education has to turn youngsters into mature citizens. By their actions, they proved that they are.” School strikes also took place in 15 cities and towns in Switzerland. In Geneva, 12-year-old Selma Joly said: “Frankly, I would rather demand climate action than go to school. Otherwise, years from now, we may no longer be here.” Janine O’Keeffe, who helps coordinate and keep track of the school strikes from her home in Stockholm, Sweden, was surprised at the scale of last week’s actions: “I am still in shock, actually – a nice kind of shock.” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, says youth activism on climate change gives her hope. “The 15-year-olds just speak truth to power.”"
"The risk to global civilisation from nuclear weapons and climate change remains at an all-time high, according to a group of prominent US scientists and former officials, who said the world’s predicament had become the “new abnormal”. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced that its symbolic “doomsday clock”, unveiled every year, was stuck at two minutes to midnight, the same as last January. The only other time the Bulletin has judged the world as being this close to catastrophe was 1953, in the early volatile stages of the cold war. The reasons given by the Bulletin’s panel of experts included the collapse of arms control treaties, and the emphasis in Washington and Moscow on modernising nuclear arsenals rather than dismantling them, and the lack of political will to reverse climate change. “We are like passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead, enjoying the fine food and music,” said Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, said. Since leaving office this month, Brown has become the Bulletin’s executive chairman, citing the imminent threats to humanity. “It’s late and it’s getting later. We have to wake people up. And that’s what I intend to do!” The former US defence secretary William Perry said that the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last June, succeeded in calming some of the “hysteria” in the standoff between the two countries, but had not led to any North Korean moves to dismantle its nuclear arsenals. Perry pointed to Trump’s declared intention to suspend compliance with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty on 2 February, and serve notice of US withdrawal, as a sign of the erosion of contacts between the world’s most heavily armed nuclear weapons powers. “When you withdraw from treaties you are losing this important vehicle of dialogue,” Perry said. “We will have only one [arms control] treaty left, the New Start treaty, which could very well go away when it expires in another two years.” “My own judgment is, relative to a year ago, we are slightly worse off,” Perry said. Rachel Bronson, the Bulletin’s president, said there should be no comfort taken from the fact that the clock did not move forward over the past year. “This new abnormal is a pernicious and dangerous departure from the time when the United States sought a leadership role in designing and supporting global agreements that advanced a safer and healthier planet,” Bronson said. “The new abnormal describes a moment in which fact is becoming indistinguishable from fiction, undermining our very abilities to develop and apply solutions to the big problems of our time.” As governor of California, Brown introduced emissions controls and other regulations aimed in part at mitigating the impact of Trump’s decision to walk out of the Paris Climate accord, but he said that states and businesses could not combat climate change effectively without support from the White House. “I find that the political response is alarming. It’s akin to sleepwalking,” Brown told reporters on Wednesday night. “We’re headed toward a very bad situation on the climate front and it will drive many more migrants to the border and create more political instability politically. So all the problems we have are going to be made worse and we may have passed a tipping point where we can’t make them better in any reasonable time and so that will undermine the entire basis of democratic governance.”"
"A chemistry master at school was universally known by the nickname Cleg, at least when he was out of earshot.  When quizzed, older pupils revealed that a Cleg, Haematopota pluvialis, is a particularly nasty form of fly that you do not notice until pain alerts you to the fact it has cut a hole in your skin and started to suck your blood.   It is very similar to a horsefly, except smaller, silent and stealthy, so normally not detected until the damage is being done. At the time it seemed a rather apt name for an unpopular master, never happier than when wielding a cane, but was completely forgotten about until last summer’s heatwave.  The wet spring benefited the overwintering larvae and the hot summer was ideal for the adults. Bites were frequent, painful and itchy for days.  But all those years ago the boys had got it wrong – it is only the females that bite and suck your blood to provide the nourishment for the eggs they are about to lay. The males lack the sharp mouthparts to cut through your skin and are harmless nectar eaters and beneficial pollinators.  It is too early to say whether last year’s unwelcome population surge will be repeated; the larvae do not emerge as adults until May. "
"Damian Carrington gives us a fine review of the “planetary health diet” in his article (New plant-focused diet would ‘transform’ planet’s future, say scientists, theguardian.com, 16 January). It’s clear that this diet offers both better health than the current norm of a high-meat diet, and a more environmental food production system with its emphasis on plant rather than animal production. However, I doubt the validity of some claims in the report. The report states: “Food is the single strongest lever to optimise human health and environmental sustainability on Earth.” Population reduction is a much more powerful lever. It reduces not just the need for food, but also the need for energy, housing, transport, schools, climate change mitigation strategies and waste disposal.  Moreover, population reduction should be easier to effect than the proposed change of diet, the latter clearly being, as the report states, a daunting task. “Humanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment.” Conversely, when women have access to education and contraception, they will not choose to have more children than they can support. Population decline follows. The provision of education for girls and women, and of contraception, needs only expansion of existing well-known programmes.Richard VernonIffley, Oxfordshire • Your story oversimplifies a report that does not acknowledge the significant differences in farming methods and consumption patterns across the globe, and could serve to misinform readers about the realities of our fantastic livestock production here in Britain. We do not yet understand the implications of a heavily plant-based diet like the report recommends on either our health or the environment. There is a very real possibility it could see us relying on imported produce, produced to lower standards than our own and with increased transport emissions. In Britain we have extensive grasslands, which act as carbon stores helping to mitigate climate change. The most effective and sustainable way to use this land is to graze livestock, which will turn inedible grass into high-quality, grass-fed, nutrient-rich beef, lamb and dairy, all reared in an extensive system. Your readers should be assured that when they buy British, they are buying a product that is high quality, safe and sustainable. It would be a shame if this report has the effect of undermining British farmers who do a fantastic job producing food for the nation, all while caring for our countryside.Stuart Roberts Vice-president, NFUJohn Davies President, NFU Cymru • The survey featured in your article (Strongest opponents of GM foods know the least but think they know the most, theguardian.com, 14 January), contains flaws that question the validity of its conclusions. The UK government’s GM Nation? debate on GM crops and foods in 2002-03 included formal public engagement meetings. At these events, participants were presented with information on GM technology, including arguments for and against its application in agriculture. The outcome was clear: the more knowledge about the subject the participants received, the greater was their concern, as reported by the Guardian at the time. The lesson learned from this exercise was that balanced scientific information on a technically complex subject such as GM must be provided so that people can make an informed decision. Thus the information gathered from surveys of the type featured in this latest article is meaningless, since no effort was made to educate the survey respondents on the topic in question.Dr Michael AntoniouHead, Gene Expression and Therapy Group, King’s College London • Every January we get a shedload of articles in the media about health and diet followed by a plethora of correspondence arguing the points about what is good or bad, and what we should or should not eat and drink. It’s almost like having an annual Brexit debate and just as tedious. I’ve discovered a highly nutritious way to get oils, fibre and fruit in one bite-sized package every Christmas: brazil nuts “enrobed” (as they say in the industry) in plain chocolate. I manage to make them last through January to help cope with all the newspaper articles, magazine supplements and TV programmes that bang on about diets. Balanced diets and all things in moderation (even chocolate coated brazil nuts).Paul FaupelSomersham, Cambridgeshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Not only are heat waves becoming more frequent and intense, but they are getting larger too. Analysis of 38 years of NASA climate data has shown that the average size of northern hemisphere heat waves has grown by 50% since 1980. Presenting his findings at the American Geophysical Union’s Fall meeting in December, Chris Skinner from the University of Massachusetts explained how today’s “mega” heat waves are putting more people and ecosystems at risk. “If D.C is in a heat wave, then New York might be in one, and Phily might be in one too,” he said. Strangely the team found that winter heat waves had experienced the greatest growth in size, leaving northern hemisphere seasons less defined than they used to be. Although winter heat waves tend not to be as hot as summer ones they do still strain health services and confuse ecosystems. In particular false springs can trick plants into blooming prematurely and being in trouble when winter returns. For farmers this can be economically devastating.  Having established that heat waves have grown, Skinner is now looking ahead, understanding what kind of heat waves we can expect twenty years hence, and pin-pointing which parts of the world are most vulnerable."
"Today we live with non-stop special events of fire, flood, mud slide, rising water, whirling hurricanes, toxic algae blooms, unprecedented droughts. That word “unprecedented” is coming to define our time. Most of us were short-changed by educations that ignored ecology. We need clear explanations of climate change, what it means and how to cope with it. Tim Flannery, an Australian mammalogist, is a supple writer with a wide-ranging and questioning mind. His 2005 The Weather-Makers gave lucid and easily understandable explanations of climate change, both a history and a look into what might come next. It is still a basic starting point. Climate scientist Michael Mann and Washington Post cartoonist Tom Toles collaborated on The Madhouse Effect. It is drawn straight from the frontline of the climate wars. In trenchant sentences the authors skate out, hockey sticks swinging, and scythe the legs from under the cabal of vested interests, venal payola scientists and shadowy political éminences grises. They name names and present a player list as well as the irrefutable tough news.  The Water Will Come by Jeff Goodell is especially good at showing the daunting complexity of solutions to on-the-ground problems in places such as Miami Beach, Alaska, New York, Venice and remote islands whose residents have nowhere to go. Here are real-world headaches of flood insurance, transportation, nuclear reactors on eroding shorelines, the tendency to rebuild rather than rethink following disasters. Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable is literate and probing. He presents a critical discussion of the Paris Agreement vis-a-vis Pope Francis’s Laudato Si’. As for the “unthinkable” in his book’s title, it is left to the reader to decide which of several dreadful outcomes he means. I concluded one was truly unthinkable. Charles Wohlforth’s The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern Front of Climate Change looks at two different and sporadically intermeshed groups – science experts from distant universities and local whale-hunter people of the Arctic with millennia of ice experience. The cooperations and rivalries between local residents and academic scientists matters in the way we handle the hellishly complex changes bearing down. Both groups work towards understanding how best to survive. Peter Brannen’s The Ends of the World is a witty review of Earth’s previous global species extinctions. His discussions with experts present the evidences in the ancient rocks showing that in the vast life collapses of the geologic past CO2 was a major operative and thus a patterned back-story to our present situation; climate change extinction is new to humans but not to the planet. It puts a lid on the hubristic belief that Earth exists solely for human use. Poet-linguist Robert Bringhurst and classicist philosopher Jan Zwicky offer a meditative approach in their Learning to Die: Wisdom in the Age of Climate Crisis. Bringhurst’s essay The Mind of the Wild outlines the liminal relations between the natural world and humans. Here the wild is the bedrock of human ethical and moral values. He suggests that to understand what is happening we should individually “practise thinking like an ecosystem ... ” by “spending a day in the wilds – alone with reality, keeping quiet and letting things unfold”. This exercise can clarify our thinking and open windows of perception. Zwicky’s essay A Ship from Delos guides us towards ways to live and know the situation of climate change. Her beautiful recasting of Socratic excellences – awareness, courage, self-control, justice, contemplation and compassion – can profoundly shape our inner selves. • Barkskins by Annie Proulx is published by 4th Estate.

"The level of climate-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is forecast to rise by a near-record amount in 2019, according to the Met Office. The increase is being fuelled by the continued burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests, and will be particularly high in 2019 due to an expected return towards El Niño-like conditions. This natural climate variation causes warm and dry conditions in the tropics, meaning the plant growth that removes CO2 from the air is restricted. Levels of the greenhouse gas have not been as high as today for 3-5m years, when the global temperature was 2-3C warmer and the sea level was 10-20 metres higher. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels that scientists advise, according to the UN. But the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions are rising again after a brief pause. “Looking at the monthly figures, it’s as if you can see the planet ‘breathing’ as the levels of CO2 fall and rise with the seasonal cycle of plant growth and decay in the northern hemisphere,” said Prof Richard Betts, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre. “The graph is a thing of beauty, but also a stark reminder of human impact on climate. Each year’s CO2 is higher than the last, and this will keep happening until humans stop adding CO2 to the atmosphere.” “This news is worrying and compelling,” said Prof Nick Ostle, at Lancaster University. “It represents a call to innovate with rapid and radical responses to offset these growing emissions.” He said cuts in fossil fuel use, deforestation and emissions from livestock were needed: “It’s a massive challenge but there are real opportunities to make an impact individually and globally.” The Met Office has a good record of forecasting global CO2 levels and predicts that the average rise over 2019 will be 2.75 parts per million (ppm). That would put it among the highest annual rises in the 62 years since good records began. Only years with strong El Niño events, 1998 and 2016, are likely to be higher. The rise in 2016 was 3.39ppm. In the decade after the first measurement on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa in 1956, annual rises were less than 0.9ppm per year. An El Niño event occurs when the tropical Pacific swings into a warm phase, causing many regions to have warmer and drier weather. Trees and plants are natural carbon sinks because they absorb CO2 as they grow, but this is reduced in El Niño years. “This year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,” said Betts. The Met Office forecasts an average CO2 level in 2019 of 411ppm. Monthly averages are expected to peak at 415ppm in May, before the growing season temporarily reduces levels to 408ppm in September, when CO2 will begin rising once again. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution sparked the large-scale burning of coal, oil and gas was 280ppm. “It never rains but it pours,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “Our own CO2 emissions are still increasing, and now the world’s natural carbon sinks are set for a bad year too. We know these sinks have been mopping up around half of all our emissions to date. We can only hope their faltering in 2019 is just a short-term blip, as without their help any chance of a safer climate future will turn to dust.” Prof Jos Barlow, also at Lancaster University, said the rising destruction of forests is serious concern: “This has been a particularly bad year. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased to around 8,000 square kilometres in 2018, which is equivalent to losing a football pitch of forest every 30 seconds. There are also worrying signs that deforestation is occurring at a faster rate in other Amazonian countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.”"
"Look at all that snow in the Alps; has global warming taken a break? Alas, no, it turns out that the recent record-breaking dumps of snow across much of southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria are more likely a consequence of global warming. Why? Balmy temperatures in the North Sea and Baltic Sea are cooking up the ideal conditions to create snow. Right now, average surface water temperatures in the North Sea are about 8C (46F), while the Baltic Sea is hovering at about 3C (37F). It might sound bracing, but as data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows, these numbers are a good couple of degrees warmer than average for the time of year. And herein lies the problem. “Global warming enhances the current snowfall … Anomalously high sea surface temperatures in the North Sea and Baltic are loading winds from the north with moisture,” tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam last week. Meanwhile, warmer than average air temperatures across northern Europe in early January provided the ideal environment to turn all that moisture into snow.  Around the globe oceans are warming far faster than expected. Extra snow and rain is a consequence we are all going to have to get used to. "
"Victoria may experience its hottest day since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires on Friday, with its main power stations at reduced capacity after a third coal-fired generator shut down overnight. Energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio told 3AW radio on Friday morning that she “can’t rule out brown-outs” with three generators across the Yallourn and Loy Yang A power stations out of action, meaning the state is down more than 1000MW of power generation capacity.  “We have aging coal-fired power stations,” D’Ambrosio said. “They are becoming less reliable.” Between 5,000 and 10,000 homes lost power for a few hours overnight, but those faults have been attributed to localised issues. The Alcoa aluminium smelter at Portland in western Victoria also reduced production for an hour on Thursday night to reduce demand, and South Australia — which experienced a record breaking heatwave on Thursday including a high of 46.6C in Adelaide — switched on emergency diesel generators for the first time. However the Australian Energy Market Operator said it was not expecting blackouts on Friday. Temperatures in Melbourne reached 35C by 8am on Friday, and hovered around 30C overnight. Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Chris Godfred said the sweltering night would have set records for high minimum overnight temperatures, but for a slightly cooler morning on Thursday. BoM records are taken in 24-hour intervals from 9am to 9am, and in some places — such as Shepparton in northeast Victoria, which was 27.8C at 9am on Thursday but did not dip below 29.1C overnight — that meant minimum temperature records remained intact. According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future. So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia? The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected. They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days. The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times. Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year. These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse. Melbourne was forecast to reach 44C by mid-afternoon, approaching the all-time hottest day of 46.4C on 7 February 2009, when Australia’s deadliest bushfires killed 173 people, burned through 450,000 hectares and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. A cool change was expected to bring relief by 4pm but gusty north and north-westerly winds were predicted to sweep across the western districts of the state, with a chance of dry lightning, before hitting the capital city in the afternoon. The combination, coming after months of drought in northern areas, has created a very high fire risk. Firefighters in Victoria and Tasmania are on high alert and have warned campers and bushwalkers to rethink their plans to head out early for the long weekend. Large swaths of the Tasmanian wilderness are already burning. Victorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp told ABC News Breakfast he had 500 firefighters in control centres across the state and 60 aircraft on standby. “We are ready,” he said. “What I keep saying is are you, as the community of Victoria, ready? Have you downloaded your Vic Emergency app? Do you know who the emergency broadcaster is? Because if you’re travelling around and you’re enjoying the last of the holidays, you need to be able to access good information to make good decisions.” Crisp urged people to be sensible in the heat and said that since December emergency services had received more than 300 callouts for people or animals who had been left in hot cars — averaging about 10 a day on really hot days. There is a total fire ban in both states. The fire danger for parts of south-east Tasmania, around Hobart, has been set at severe. The fire danger rating for the Mallee and Northern Country districts of Victoria is extreme on Friday, with a severe rating for the Wimmera, South West, Central and Western and Southern Gippsland areas. Heatwaves and prolonged drought have caused mass fish kills in western NSW as well as mass deaths of feral camels and horses in central Australia, renewing already loud calls for Australia to take serious action on climate change."

"Sir David Attenborough has warned that “the Garden of Eden is no more”, as he urged political and business leaders from around the world to make a renewed push to tackle climate change before the damage is irreparable. Speaking at the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, the 92-year-old naturalist and broadcaster warned that human activity has taken the world into a new era, threatening to undermine civilisation. “I am quite literally from another age,” Attenborough told an audience of business leaders, politicians and other delegates. “I was born during the Holocene – the 12,000 [year] period of climatic stability that allowed humans to settle, farm, and create civilisations.” That led to trade in ideas and goods, and made us the “globally connected species we are today”. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  That stability allowed businesses to grow, nations to co-operate and people to share ideas, Attenborough explained, before warning sombrely: “In the space of my lifetime, all that has changed. “The Holocene has ended. The Garden of Eden is no more. We have changed the world so much that scientists say we are in a new geological age: the Anthropocene, the age of humans,” he declared. In a stark warning to the world leaders and business chiefs flocking to the WEF this week, Attenborough warned that the only conditions that humans have known are changing fast. “We need to move beyond guilt or blame, and get on with the practical tasks at hand.” A survey conducted before the WEF found that environmental threats are now the biggest danger to the global economy, and concern is mounting that co-operation between countries on the issue is breaking down. Attenborough admitted that even he has been surprised by the speed of the damage caused to the environment during his career making TV programmes showing life on earth. In response, Attenborough – recently voted Britain’s most trustworthy celebrity – said humans must use their expert problem-solving skills. “If people can truly understand what is at stake, I believe they will give permission for business and governments to get on with the practical solutions,” he told the WEF. Get it right, he argued, and humans can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy and sustainable fish stocks, but only if decisive action is taken now. “Over the next two years there will be United Nations decisions on climate change, sustainable development and a new deal for nature. Together these will form our species’ plan for a route through the Anthropocene. “What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” he added. Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way,” he explained, citing the old joke that anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in finite circumstances is “either a madman or an economist”. He is also hopeful that he can change hearts and minds during his trip to Davos, pointing out that some delegates have more power than a nation state. “The enormity of the problem has only just dawned on quite a lot of people ... Unless we sort ourselves out in the next decade or so we are dooming our children and our grandchildren to an appalling future.” Before he spoke, Attenborough received the Crystal award from the WEF for his work. Saudi Arabia’s first female film-maker, Haifaa al-Mansour, and conductor Marin Alsop of the Baltimore Symphony were also honoured for their work. Prince William is due to appear with Attenborough to discuss environmental issues at the WEF on Tuesday."
"Ask Australians about their favourite beach and you’ll get 11,000 different answers. With 85% of the population living within 50km of the coast, the beach holds a special place in Australian culture, identity and our capacity for endless arguments.  What makes a good beach? Emotions run high and the lists run long. It could be the place your family picked or some half-mythical spot your mates once showed you, that doesn’t really have a name. Sydneysiders scoff at the cold waters of St Kilda, while Bondi is a hell-hole compared with the serenity of Western Australia and the clear waters of Queensland, as long as you, uh, don’t look at Brisbane’s South Bank. But who’s right? In an attempt to determine this, Guardian Australia is running a poll so you can pick Australia’s favourite beach. We spoke to Australia’s beach ambassador, Brad Farmer, who has visited a vast chunk of the country’s 11,761 beaches (including the islands) and reviewed them, and also seen the slow degradation that threatens them. He points out that there’s probably a big difference between Australia’s best beach and an individual’s favourite beach. We are also in danger of loving our beaches to death. At Hyams beach, in Jervis Bay, New South Wales, thousands of cars and illegal campers have to be cleared every season. Wherever we go, a tide of plastics and microplastics follows us. Two years of data analysed by Guardian Australia shows that plastic accounts for 75% of the litter on our beaches – chip packets, cups, decaying bags. Climate change is speeding up coastal erosion, and even the deadly jellyfish are moving south, thanks to warming waters. We have more than 11,000 beaches in Australia, and cannot include them all in the poll. But don’t be too alarmed if your favourite isn’t listed – you can enter it in and start a campaign to get it added. If there are enough people behind your beach, we’ll include it. Please note, however, that only coastal beaches will count (sorry Wagga Wagga). We’ll also be watching for voter fraud, after this year’s New Zealand bird of the year competition was hacked, and our own Australian 2017 bird of the year poll detected some automated voting for the powerful owl. Not on our watch. There are three categories: metro, regional and remote. You can vote once in each category. So please enter your favourite or go find it and cast your vote."
"It’s hard right now to remember how hot it was last August on the long sandy beach where the Colorado river meets the Green river in southern Utah. I was a few days into a rafting trip through Cataract Canyon with a bunch of young climate activists, and one of them, Will Munger, was telling me that since his months at the Standing Rock resistance camp, he had been encountering young Native people whose experiences at the protest site had encouraged them to dream of new possibilities and take actions that might otherwise have seemed out of reach.  Wandering back and forth along the edge of the water, we began to discuss how, often, the consequences of an uprising or a movement are not linear. Success and failure are often premature measures and oversimplifications; actions, interventions and conversations change beliefs and create new values, alliances and possibilities. We’d seen this dynamic from many unanticipated uprisings and movements: the indigenous movement Idle No More, which began in Canada in 2012; Black Lives Matter; the feminist insurgencies since 2013 and the anti-gun movement in the hands of the Parkland youth. On a cold day this January, I was thinking again about that conversation as I contemplated Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s decision to run for office. “I first started considering running for Congress, actually, at Standing Rock in North Dakota,” she said late last year. “It was really from that crucible of activism where I saw people putting their lives on the line … for people they’ve never met and never known. When I saw that, I knew that I had to do something more.” In 2016, when LaDonna Brave Bull Allard and others launched the camps protesting the Dakota Access pipeline, they could not have known some of the indirect consequences of their actions – including prompting a young woman from New York City to run for office. Sometimes the results that matter are not direct or intended – though four tribes continue to litigate over the pipeline, and they had a modest court victory on 8 January. Today, Ocasio-Cortez represents New York’s 14th district in Congress, and 45 congresspeople support the Green New Deal that she began promoting last fall. Significantly, the Green New Deal is not Ocasio-Cortez’s creation. As Standing Rock prompted her to run for office, the Sunrise Movement created the climate vision she carried into Congress. Founded in 2017, Sunrise is a youth-led movement that aims to “to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process”. As the movement’s co-founder Varshini Prakash recently told the Huffington Post, Sunrise is trying to “activate the millions of Americans who are ready to fight for a Green New Deal but haven’t heard of it yet”. For me, the movement’s sudden appearance in national politics this year was even more surprising and thrilling than Ocasio-Cortez’s primary victory. The Green New Deal is a much-needed response to what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and American scientists told us last fall: we probably have 12 years to transform the energy economy globally, or else. The proposal makes its mark by setting new goals for the nation and by reminding us that climate and jobs, ecology and economies don’t have to be opposed, while recent polls tell the congressional leadership that the majority of Americans want swift and radical action on climate. Getting there requires understanding that the process may not be straightforward. Unsurprisingly, the Green New Deal was not immediately adopted by the Democratic leadership, and if you were to tell the story thus far in the terms that we’ve learned from action movies and sports, it’s a conflict that already has a conclusion: as the news site Politico put it: “Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi 2, Ocasio-Cortez 0.” But, like the Standing Rock uprising, the work of the Sunshine Movement and Ocasio-Cortez will generate other benefits and consequences; if we are going to get to the goal it will, of course, be by a more circuitous route – though it must be a speedy one. Last Wednesday, Congressmen Jimmy Gomez and Ted Lieu of California introduced a bill, the Climate Solutions Act of 2019, with similar goals – or reintroduced it, since Lieu (who’s also supporting the Green New Deal) has introduced a bill by that name twice before. You could not possibly catalyze a movement in the Dakotas with the intention that a woman would run for Congress in New York City and then go to the Capitol to advocate on climate. You could not assume, imagine or calculate that that would be a consequence. But you can recognize how common such indirect consequences are, and how important it is to not discount them. The course of history is full of confluences and meanders, oxbows, watersheds, dams and floods, tributaries and distributaries. Cataract Canyon is where the Colorado river pours into the reservoir of stagnant water backed up from Glen Canyon dam. When Glen Canyon dam was completed, a little more than 50 years ago, most people – whether they loved or hated this massive intervention in the wilderness – imagined that the reservoir would stand for centuries. But the dam is failing, thanks to overallocation of the river’s water and to the way climate change has reduced rainfall and snowfall in its watershed. At the end of my journey with Will and the other climate activists, I saw over and over how the river was cutting new channels through the silt that had built up when the reservoir was higher; how what was stagnant was now active again. This was never supposed to happen, or it was supposed to happen hundreds of years hence. “Let us never, ever, ever give up,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez the day after her swearing-in, adding: “It wasn’t long ago that we felt our lives were over; that there were only so many do-overs until it was too late, or too much to take … I honestly thought as a 28-year-old waitress I was too late; that the train of my fulfilled potential had left the station.” Climate change tells is there is no time to waste. But history tells us that social change works in indirect and unpredictable ways, and that it’s worth pressing on for what you believe in. • Rebecca Solnit is a Guadian US columnist and the author of Men Explain Things to Me and The Mother of All Questions"

"“We knew that something was amiss in the first couple days,” said Brad Lister. “We were driving into the forest and at the same time both Andres and I said: ‘Where are all the birds?’ There was nothing.” His return to the Luquillo rainforest in Puerto Rico after 35 years was to reveal an appalling discovery. The insect population that once provided plentiful food for birds throughout the mountainous national park had collapsed. On the ground, 98% had gone. Up in the leafy canopy, 80% had vanished. The most likely culprit by far is global warming. “It was just astonishing,” Lister said. “Before, both the sticky ground plates and canopy plates would be covered with insects. You’d be there for hours picking them off the plates at night. But now the plates would come down after 12 hours in the tropical forest with a couple of lonely insects trapped or none at all.” “It was a true collapse of the insect populations in that rainforest,” he said. “We began to realise this is terrible – a very, very disturbing result.” Earth’s bugs outweigh humans 17 times over and are such a fundamental foundation of the food chain that scientists say a crash in insect numbers risks “ecological Armageddon”. When Lister’s study was published in October, one expert called the findings “hyper-alarming”. The Puerto Rico work is one of just a handful of studies assessing this vital issue, but those that do exist are deeply worrying. Flying insect numbers in Germany’s natural reserves have plunged 75% in just 25 years. The virtual disappearance of birds in an Australian eucalyptus forest was blamed on a lack of insects caused by drought and heat. Lister and his colleague Andrés García also found that insect numbers in a dry forest in Mexico had fallen 80% since the 1980s. “We are essentially destroying the very life support systems that allow us to sustain our existence on the planet, along with all the other life on the planet,” Lister said. “It is just horrifying to watch us decimate the natural world like this.” It was not insects that drew Lister to the Luquillo rainforest for the first time in the mid-1970s. “I was interested in competition among the anoles lizards,” he said. “They’re the most diverse group of vertebrates in the world and even by that time had become a paradigm for ecology and evolutionary studies.” The forest immediately captivated Lister, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the US. “It was and still is the most beautiful forest I have ever been in. It’s almost enchanted. There’s the lush verdant forest and cascading waterfalls, and along the roadsides there are carpets of multicoloured flowers. It’s a phantasmagoric landscape.” It was important to measure insect numbers, as these are the lizards’ main food, but at the time he thought nothing more of it. Returning to the national park decades later, however, the difference was startling. “One of the things I noticed in the forest was a lack of butterflies,” he said. “They used to be all along the roadside, especially after the rain stopped, hundreds upon hundreds of them. But we couldn’t see one butterfly.” Since Lister’s first visits to Luquillo, other scientists had predicted that tropical insects, having evolved in a very stable climate, would be much more sensitive to climate warming. “If you go a little bit past the thermal optimum for tropical insects, their fitness just plummets,” he said. As the data came in, the predictions were confirmed in startling fashion. “The number of hot spells, temperatures above 29C, have increased tremendously,” he said. “It went from zero in the 1970s up to something like 44% of the days.” Factors important elsewhere in the world, such as destruction of habitat and pesticide use, could not explain the plummeting insect populations in Luquillo, which has long been a protected area. Data on other animals that feed on bugs backed up the findings. “The frogs and birds had also declined simultaneously by about 50% to 65%,” Lister said. The population of one dazzling green bird that eats almost nothing but insects, the Puerto Rican tody, dropped by 90%. Lister calls these impacts a “bottom-up trophic cascade”, in which the knock-on effects of the insect collapse surge up through the food chain. “I don’t think most people have a systems view of the natural world,” he said. “But it’s all connected and when the invertebrates are declining the entire food web is going to suffer and degrade. It is a system-wide effect.” To understand the global scale of an insect collapse that has so far only been glimpsed, Lister says, there is an urgent need for much more research in many more habitats. “More data, that is my mantra,” he said. The problem is that there were very few studies of insect numbers in past decades to serve as a baseline, but Lister is undeterred: “There’s no time like the present to start asking what’s going on.”"
"Climate change could be kept in check if a phaseout of all fossil fuel infrastructure were to begin immediately, according to research. It shows that meeting the internationally agreed aspiration of keeping global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is still possible. The scientists say it is therefore the choices being made by global society, not physics, which is the obstacle to meeting the goal.  The study found that if all fossil fuel infrastructure – power plants, factories, vehicles, ships and planes – from now on are replaced by zero-carbon alternatives at the end of their useful lives, there is a 64% chance of staying under 1.5C. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the difference between 1.5C of warming and the earlier international target of 2C was a significantly lower risk of drought, floods, heatwaves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Christopher Smith, of the University of Leeds, who led the research, said: “It’s good news from a geophysical point of view. But on the other side of the coin, the [immediate fossil fuel phaseout] is really at the limit of what we could we possibly do. We are basically saying we can’t build anything now that emits fossil fuels.” Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics, who was not part of the research team, said: “We are rapidly approaching the end of the age of fossil fuels. This study confirms that all new energy infrastructure must be sustainable from now on if we are to avoid locking in commitments to emissions that would lead to the world exceeding the goals of the Paris agreement.”  The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, used computer models to estimate by how much global temperatures would rise if a fossil fuel infrastructure phaseout began immediately. The lifespan for power plants was set at 40 years, cars an average of 15 years and planes 26 years. The work also assumes a rapid end to beef and dairy consumption, which is responsible for significant global emissions. In this scenario, the models suggest carbon emissions would decline to zero over the next four decades and there would be a 66% chance of the global temperature rise remaining below 1.5C. If the phaseout does not begin until 2030, the chance is 33%. The analysis did not include the possibility of tipping points such as the sudden release of huge volumes of methane from permafrost, which could spark runaway global warming. The scientists accept their scenario is at the extreme end of ambition, but said it was important to know that meeting the 1.5C target was still physically possible and dependent on the choices made now and in the coming years. “The climate system is not stopping you [hitting the target], global society is stopping you,” Smith said. Other work, using a different approach, has also shown that keeping within the 1.5C limit is possible if radical action is taken immediately. In some sectors, zero-carbon technology already exists, such as renewable energy. But in others, such as aviation, it does not. “Maybe the solution here is flying less,” Smith said. Prof Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, who also was not part of the research team, said: “Whether it’s drilling a new gas well, keeping an old coal power station open, or even buying a diesel car, the choices we make today will largely determine the climate pathways of tomorrow. The message of this new study is loud and clear: act now or see the last chance for a safer climate future ebb away.” Smith’s personal belief is that global heating will surpass 1.5C. “We are going the right way, but I don’t think we will do enough, quickly enough. I think we are heading for 2C to 2.5C.” But he added: “If you don’t have a goal, you are not going to get anywhere. If you have a target that is really hard to achieve and you miss it slightly, that is better than wandering aimlessly into a future climate that is no good for anybody.”"
"Josh Frydenberg has defended the Coalition’s record on climate change and says he will work hard to earn the trust of his constituents in the face of a challenge from long-time Liberal and now independent Oliver Yates. Yates, a former Macquarie banker and head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, confirmed on Wednesday he would run in Kooyong at the coming federal election, declaring Frydenberg deserved to be challenged because of a lack of action on the environment.  Yates told Guardian Australia that Frydenberg, now treasurer, “had plenty of opportunity to stand up in relation to the environment when he was minister, or even now, as a more influential person, but he’s failed to discharge his duty in relation to environmental responsibility”. Frydenberg told reporters climate change was “real” and he defended the government’s policy record. “The Coalition takes very seriously our international and domestic responsibilities and obligations to reduce emissions,” he said. In rebutting Yates’ arguments, Frydenberg did not mention the policy he tried to implement as environment and energy minister, the national energy guarantee, which was scuttled when party conservatives moved against Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership last year. But he said he was “proud of the work we’ve done to support the renewable energy target” – a mechanism Tony Abbott as prime minister attempted to wind back, and conservatives within the government still oppose. Frydenberg said the government continued to fund abatement through the emissions reduction fund, which the Coalition declined to top up in last year’s budget, although the government has signalled more recently that the fund, a vestige of the Direct Action policy, will get a cash injection ahead of the federal election, and its remit could be broadened to look after threatened species and their habitats. He also referenced ongoing work on energy efficiency and said the government would deliver “the world’s biggest pumped hydro scheme” in an expansion of Snowy Hydro. The government is yet to confirm whether it will back an expansion adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity, which was approved by the Snowy Hydro board in mid-December. Frydenberg says the Coalition has presided over a reduction in per capita emissions, but emissions have been rising since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government. The latest government projections show that Australia will miss its 2030 emissions reduction targets, despite Scott Morrison’s regular assertion that the country is on track to meet its obligations “in a canter”. The report, released in late December, says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels, driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector. It projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030. A new report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found that Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets under the Paris agreement and needs to bring its environment policies into line with the “scale of the challenge” the country is facing. Yates joins other high-profile independents facing off against Liberals in the coming contest, with a number, including barrister and former Olympic skier Zali Steggall, who will take on Abbott in Warringah, citing inaction on climate change as a central motivation. There is also continuing speculation that Julia Banks, a Liberal who quit the government for the crossbench late last year, will run against the health minister, Greg Hunt, in the Victorian seat of Flinders. Yates will face an uphill battle to unseat Frydenberg in Kooyong, a prized Liberal seat held by party leaders including Robert Menzies. The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader tends his local turf assiduously, and won the seat in 2016 with a primary vote of 58%, which was a positive swing of 2% on the previous federal contest."

"The Queensland state government has emerged as the latest thorn in the side of what is left of the government’s “big stick” energy legislation, warning it could lead to the unpopular privatisation of state-owned assets. Queensland’s energy minister, Anthony Lynham, has called on the federal government to bring its much vaunted energy market misconduct bill to the next state energy ministers meeting for discussion.  The objections come as the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, will on Friday confirm that the Morrison government has received more than 60 submissions for its program underwriting new power generation assets. Taylor says the proposals for new power generation include coal, gas and hydro. The government has not released the submissions, but some of the applicants have outed themselves. One proposal is a $6bn plan by power baron Trevor St Baker for two new coal power plants. The underwriting program, as well as the “big stick” legislation, has been blasted by a number of stakeholders. There has been criticism about the short timeframe for the program, and the Australian Industry Group has warned it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities “with a net present value of billions of dollars” because the government could indemnify projects against the costs of new climate change policies. In his submission to the parliament committee reviewing the “big stick” legislation, Lynham echoes concerns from power market players that the bill risks investment uncertainty, as well as providing at least three pathways to force the sale of Queensland-owned assets to the private sector. The privatisation of electricity assets, pushed through an asset recycling fund introduced by the Abbott government, has come under fire in recent years. The sell-offs have left governments with little recourse to tackle high prices. Queensland voters are particularly averse to privatisation, voting out both major parties in the wake of privatisation programs. While acknowledging the bill includes an exemption to allow government corporations to “dispose of assets to a related or associated government authority in certain circumstances”, Lynham said the legislation contains enough uncertainties to pose a “significant risk” state assets could be sold. “The exception for state authorities in the legislation appears to apply to Queensland [government-owned corporations] but it is unclear, based on the definition of a state authority in the competition and consumer act, whether this exception would apply to a subsidiary of these organisations, such as Ergon Energy and Energex,” Lynham wrote, naming the retail arms of Queensland’s power companies. “Due to the uncertainty around this term and how it would apply in the Queensland context, there is a risk that a divestiture order which targets public assets owned by a subsidiary of a Queensland Goc, could be required to privatise these assets.” Lynham said the legislation could potentially allow for privatisation of state-owned assets if the state authority was not considered “genuinely in competition”, and noted there was nothing stopping a state government from selling an asset to the private sector, as was once the policy of the state LNP. When introducing the legislation late last year, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, sought to allay concerns the bill could lead to the privatisation of state assets, in a bid to ensure the support of the key crossbencher Bob Katter. “If there is a divestment as last resort of a government asset, then it will be as another government entity,” Frydenberg said in December. Katter, not entirely convinced, introduced his own amendments to the bill, which would specifically prevent privatisation. The Queensland submission, which comes on the back of energy and business market players who are critical of the legislation, is the latest hurdle for the government to overcome, after promising to tackle energy prices during Malcolm Turnbull’s reign as prime minister. Upon taking over the party leadership, Scott Morrison appointed Angus Taylor the ‘minister for lowering electricity prices’ and promised a “big stick” approach to combating perceived misconduct by power companies, which would have allowed the minister of the day to forcibly break up energy companies. Following partyroom discomfort with the measure, the final product was watered down to where divesture could only occur at the direction of the federal court, as a last resort, if previous warnings, including injunctions from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, were ignored. The government’s attempts to have the legislation passed in the final sitting week of 2018 were derailed by Labor, with the opposition successfully hijacking the debate through procedural motions, which saw it put off until February at the earliest."
"Australia is “on the cusp” of a transport revolution but the country will miss out if it doesn’t end the policy vacuum that has so far kept the electric vehicle industry from growing, according to a Senate committee report released on Wednesday. “[Electric vehicle] uptake in Australia lags behind that of other comparable countries due to a relative absence of overarching policy direction from Australian governments,” the report said.  The result is that there are only around 7,300 electric cars on Australian roads, with most people unable to afford current models. This is negligible compared with countries like Norway and New Zealand, which have clear government policies to support the rollout of the new technology. The committee warned that Australia will miss out on the environmental, health, social and economic benefits of the growing industry should governments fail to act. “Australia is on the cusp of the most significant disruption and transformation of our transport system since the advent of the internal combustion engine,” the report said. “Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, cost savings for vehicle owner-operators, increased job opportunities and economic growth, improved health outcomes and increased fuel security are just some of the benefits that Australia can realise as EV use begins to climb.” The committee made 17 recommendations including calling for a national plan to manage the rollout of electric cars. Other recommendations include a dedicated taskforce to develop this plan, a national target to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles on Australian roads, more “coordination” with operators to expand the existing charging network and a national target for government fleets. There are currently 12,691 vehicles in the commonwealth fleet, but only 12 are electric. On costings obtained by independent senator Tim Storer, it would cost an extra $5m by 2022 to start converting half the government fleet to electric by 2025, or an extra $2.7m to do the same by 2030. Behyad Jafari, head of the Electric Vehicle Council, welcomed the report’s findings as a step in the right direction. “For our part it’s yet another endorsement, this time by the Australian Senate, that there’s a massive amount of evidence to support a mass switch to electric vehicles,” Jafari said. “The report really emphasises the fact that something should be happening. We welcome the report, but also say the recommendations need to be acted on urgently.” According to the Climate Council, transport is Australia’s second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, contributing 18% in 2018. This makes electric and other clean-energy transport critical to addressing climate change – a fact not lost on the Australian public. In polling released Wednesday, the Australia Institute surveyed 1,449 people across the country on specific policies to support the uptake of electric cars. While most opposed more direct policies such as a ban on the sale of petrol cars after 2030, it found the overwhelming majority were supportive of encouraging their uptake. Almost four in five people said they wanted the government to expand the network of charging stations and to ensure new cars sold in Australia were more fuel efficient – even if they cost more. Roughly three in four said they wanted to see the government add more electric cars to its fleet and ensure new apartment blocks were required to install electric car-charging stations. Richie Merzian, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Australian Institute, said the results showed the public support was there and it was time Canberra stepped up. “The appetite for Australians to pay more for their cars if they believe there are core benefits came through quite strongly,” Merzian said. “There’s some really strong support for low-hanging policies that the government could take up. “All that’s missing now is federal government support.”"
"Jeremy Corbyn considered it wasting time at a “billionaires’ jamboree”, referring to a quarter of the cabinet flying to Davos in the middle of the Brexit impasse (The week that was, Environment, 26 January). Greta Thunberg (Mountain mover, 26 January) clearly didn’t think it was a waste of time. Taking 32 hours to get there by train, the 16-year-old activist practised what she preaches. What could be more important than the future of our planet? As she said in her speech: “Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t.” Our leaders apparently don’t: private jets, Davos “gridlocked with limos” (What we learned at Davos, 26 January). Not a mention anywhere of a crisis, or climate emergency. But if we don’t take this desperate situation seriously, if we don’t act “as if our house is on fire” (Thunberg), Brexit will not matter in the least – Theresa May, Corbyn and thousands of other world leaders will have wasted their time.

"New South Wales is “well behind” on developing crucial water-sharing plans for its rivers and “is unlikely to meet agreed timeframes of 30 June 2019”, putting in doubt its claims that water is being shared fairly between farmers and the environment. The damning assessment by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is contained in the December 2018 progress report posted on its website and comes as NSW faces growing questions over whether its rivers are over-allocated in the wake of a big fish kill at Menindee on the Darling River.  Water resource plans, or water-sharing plans, set the detailed rules for sharing water between irrigators and the environment in each catchment. They include rules on how allocations will be made, when irrigators must cease pumping in low flows, pump sizes permitted, and rules for shepherding environmental flows down the river. But NSW has failed to submit even first drafts of 12 of of its 20 required plans, including those for major rivers such as the Barwon Darling, the Lower Darling, the Namoi and the Murrumbidgee. Instead, NSW is operating its rivers under old plans, which have not been accredited. In particular, the 2012 Barwon Darling water-sharing plan has come in for heavy criticism because it allows irrigators to pump during low and medium flows. The revelations of NSW’s slow progress come as as low river flows, hot weather and algal blooms in several rivers have caused massive fish kills. The NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, denied on Tuesday there was a problem of over-allocation in NSW, saying that the primary cause of falling dam levels and low flows was the drought. “We have water-sharing plans and we are developing and submitting our water resource plans for all across New South Wales to be signed off by Canberra,” he said. “This is not a debate about over-allocation. “This is a drought. For people to jump on the bandwagon now and point the finger at farmers and tell them they are responsible for this – go and look at the records. But the water-sharing plans Blair was referring to are incomplete and NSW lagging is far behind other states. The MDBA said 12 of NSW’s were only at the “preliminary phase” in which NSW outlines its approach to the MDBA. The MDBA rated its level of confidence of NSW meeting the deadline at 30% or less. “The MDBA remains concerned about the large volume of work that needs to be completed,” the report said. “At this stage MDBA considers that eight of the 20 NSW WRPs are on track for accreditation by mid-2019. While the authority said NSW was co-operating, it said the state still needed to resolve a number of complex policy implementation issues to enable the accreditation of its plans. These included floodplain harvesting, water accounting issues and the protection of environmental water in the northern NSW catchments."
"Pasta, protein bars and granola bars made from insect flour are to go on sale in Selfridges to highlight alternative proteins for inclusion in mainstream diets. Amid growing awareness of the environmental impact of livestock farming – and the benefits of reducing meat consumption – the British department store is the latest retailer to tap into the rising recognition of the benefits of eating insects on both nutritional and environmental grounds.  Basil fusilli pasta and raspberry and pumpkin seed granola – made from flour from ground buffalo worms – will go on sale in Selfridges’ food halls this week, along with dark chocolate and fig protein bars made with cricket flour. The products have been developed by the specialist French brand Jimini’s, which sells through Spanish and German supermarkets and is aiming to expand its presence in the UK. The new products are exclusive to Selfridges. Environmental experts have long recommended insects as a sustainable food source that could help end world hunger and reduce the damaging impact of meat production. Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. A regular portion of buckwheat pasta usually contains about 10g of protein, whereas Jimini’s insect fusilli contains 18g. Jimini’s cereal bars contain 20% protein and granola 14% – both products are blended with a selection of fruit and nuts for variety of texture. The products will be promoted in Selfridges initially in themed, pop-up “bug bars” but may remain on sale permanently. Edward Goodman, the food buying director of Selfridges, said: “We are sure our epicurious customers will be surprised and delighted discovering the new range in store.” In the UK, food choices are becoming increasingly important in the debate about how to counter climate change, reflected in the rise of “flexitarianism” whereby a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat. In November, Sainsbury’s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets – selling the roasted insects as snacks in small bags from the UK brand Eat Grub in 250 of its stores. “Having sold over 10,000 packs of Eat Grub crickets in less than three months, we’re continuing to see Sainsbury’s customers explore edible insects as a new sustainable protein source,” said Katherine O’Sullivan, Sainsbury’s buying manager. “We’re always looking to provide our customers with new and exciting products such as these.” The global edible insect market is forecast to exceed $520m (£395m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects and they could help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population. More than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but they hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations. In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets and feature on a few restaurant menus."
"Fish fingers and cod and chips are under a far greater threat from carbon emissions than previously thought, according to a recent study that has grave implications for food security. The North Atlantic cod stock in the Barents Sea is likely to first rise and then crash, possibly to almost zero before the end of the century if climate change isn’t addressed, says the scientific paper, published by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme.  The grim forecast is based on the most comprehensive study to date of the effects of climate change on cod, which – for the first time – takes into account ocean acidification as well as warming. It found larvae mortality rates were 75% higher when exposed to the combined pressures of the two factors – both of which are caused by emissions – than to heating alone. As a result, fish numbers, catches and revenues will decline faster than previously estimated. The Barents Sea, which is in the Arctic, is a major source of seafood nutrition for northern Europe. Along with Iceland, it is a key source of cod imports into the UK, which has over-fished its own waters. More Atlantic fish are migrating into this region as a result of global warming. But this ocean has the highest level of acidification in the world because cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, which changes its pH level. It is also the ocean that is experiencing the fastest rates of heating. While the global average is a rise of 1.1C since the start of the industrial revolution, the coastal breeding grounds of the cod in the Barents Sea have experienced a temperature increase of 3.5C. Unless the warming trend is controlled, the stocks will see a boom and then a bust. A temperature rise of up to 4.5C is beneficial to the cod. By this time, catches are projected to be worth 255 million Norwegian kroner per year (£23m). But after this point, the larvae rapidly start to die off. At 6C of warming (less than 3C for the rest of the world), they completely disappear. Even if nations keep to their Paris commitments, which is currently not the case, global temperatures are on course to rise above 3C, which would mean well over 6C for the Barents Sea. The numbers, which were released on the fringes of this week’s Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromsø this week, may yet prove an under-assessment of the risk because oxygen depletion – another side-effect of man-made climate change – is not accounted for. “We are trying to show the magnitude of risk and it looks very significant,” said Martina Stiasny, one of the co-authors. “This is one of the most important fish stocks in the world. It will be a problem for food security.” Responding to the findings, the Norwegian environment minister, Ola Elvestuen, said the study showed the need for urgent cuts in emissions. “The first task is to stop this happening. This is one more piece of news that shows the need for urgency. We must work to stay within 1.5C. We need to move forward really fast.”"
"One of Brexit’s more pernicious aspects, even before you get to its actual flaws, is its tendency to suck all available oxygen unto itself, to drain resources that might otherwise have gone elsewhere. Before the referendum, civil servants warned that such a task – untangling 40 years of legal agreements, ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded – would consume all their energies. Naturally, their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear. But even the head of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch, conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the “hardest job since beating Nazis”. Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money, including the £4bn we’re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self-inflicted calamity of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. The effort we could have made for jobs or housing, or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity; the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change, globalisation and automation. But Whitehall didn’t have the bandwidth. Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but walking while shooting yourself in both feet – that, it turns out, is impossible. It’s not just the machinery of state that has seized up since June 2016, all but paralysed by Brexit. It’s affected what you might call the attention economy too: both the news media and its consumers, those who shape the collective conversation and those who take part in it. So enveloped are we in Brexit that we hardly have the space to contemplate anything else. Our gaze is turned inward, and we can barely see what’s going on around us. If news bulletins, front pages and social media feeds were your guide, you’d think climate change had gone away, quietly resolved while we were obsessing over the Northern Ireland backstop. Not so. It barely made a ripple, but last week came word that the oceans are warming at a rate some 40% faster than previously understood. Remember, it’s the seas that absorb most of the extra heat going into the climate system, and the dangers posed by a rise in ocean temperature are clear and present, whether it’s fuelling ever more extreme storms and hurricanes or increasing sea levels, thereby flooding low-lying areas and rendering potentially hundreds of millions homeless. It’s just one more sign, along with melting ice-sheets or the drying up of the Rhine, Europe’s most critical waterway – where low water is rendering whole stretches impassable – that while the government tears itself apart trying to fulfil a nostalgic fantasy of taking back control, global temperatures are getting relentlessly out of control. Perhaps it’s harsh to blame Brexit for our apathy about climate change, which long predates the 2016 referendum. But even those subjects that we used to discuss barely get a look-in now. The war in Syria rages on. This week, as MPs were debating their confidence in Theresa May, the UN reported that at least 15 infants, including eight babies, had died for lack of medical care and from extreme cold. Most of their families had fled the fighting to seek refuge on the Jordanian border. It’s a reminder that the world has not stopped turning just because we’ve stopped looking. More pertinent for Britons, perhaps, given our government’s still warm relations with the country, is that Saudi Arabia’s dirty war in Yemen goes on, causing what the UN has repeatedly called the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. It is a war so dirty that even the perpetrators are victims: the Saudis are recruiting young survivors of the horrors of Darfur to serve as child soldiers on the front line. In the 1980s, pictures of starving children in Ethiopia prompted global outrage and determination to act. Now, footage from Yemen of emaciated babies and wizened toddlers, and a toll of 85,000 children dead through hunger, induces no more than a shrug. And yet, the famine in Yemen should offend us morally at least as much as the suffering of three decades ago, for this catastrophe is entirely manmade, and therefore avoidable. Perhaps it’s giving ourselves too much credit, but I’d like to think that, were we not so distracted by the customs union and Norway plus, we would at least have registered that China is currently holding an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region in what seem to be Mao-style “re-education camps”. Forced to listen to hours of Communist party propaganda aimed at their “rehabilitation and redemption”, inmates are held in squalid conditions and subject to brutal interrogations. There are reports of prisoners taking what, in their despair, they conclude is the only way out: suicide. One former captive describes being held still in a “metal device” that kept him entirely rigid. That rather puts our debates about “free movement” into perspective, doesn’t it? The Chinese authorities call these places, which satellite photographs reveal have dramatically expanded, “vocational training centres”. But they are behind barbed wire and high perimeter walls. The authorities say they inoculate “trainees” against the lure of terrorism. The truth is they represent state persecution of a reviled religious minority. The historical resonances are obvious, and should have provoked fierce condemnation from our leaders. But they, and we, are all too busy. Even those stories that not long ago commanded our attention now struggle to be noticed. Last year, Israel’s use of live ammunition against protesters at the Gaza frontier rightly made big news, as did the presence of antisemitism within Labour’s ranks. You might imagine both issues had faded away, given how rarely they’re now discussed. But the Gaza protests continue and the anguish of daily life there has not receded: witness, by way of an exception, Mishal Husain’s BBC report from a hospital struggling to function. Meanwhile, every day brings fresh evidence that within Labour’s ranks there remain some deeply suspect attitudes toward Jews: note the Labour councillor in Fife who reckoned concerns about anti-Jewish racism were all part of a Mossad-orchestrated plot – in other words, a Jewish conspiracy. She was briefly suspended but is now safely back in the Labour fold. Or you could look to the United States, where the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has admitted sharing polling data with the Russians – as slam-dunk a proof of collusion as you could wish for. So conclusive is it that Trump’s own lawyer, the once credible Rudy Giuliani, has reversed his previous line of defence: now he all but admits there was collusion, but says Trump himself was not involved. It’s all happening out there, but our minds are elsewhere. It means we don’t even have to wait to leave the European Union to see that the notion that Brexit would forge a global Britain, eager to head “out and into the world” was bogus. We can already see that it’s doing the opposite to us, turning our gaze ever more inward, shrinking our horizons – and ourselves. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"
"Ever since Tony Blair rebooted support for nuclear power 13 years ago, British governments have been committed to a new generation of reactors to secure supplies and cut carbon emissions. However, those ambitions have yielded only one project under construction, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England. The past two months have dealt serious blows to hopes for more, with Toshiba abandoning its plans for Moorside in Cumbria and Hitachi scrapping its Wylfa plant on Anglesey. Wylfa’s death means a second Hitachi plant planned for Oldbury, Gloucestershire, is doomed, too. Together the three projects would have provided 15% of today’s electricity demand. That begs the question: is it time to rethink plans for new nuclear or redouble our nuclear efforts? With the cost of wind, solar and batteries dropping rapidly, have renewables and smart technologies matured enough to fill the gap? What is not in question is the UK’s need for more low-carbon power. Coal and old nuclear plants are shutting in the 2020s and tough climate targets are looming. The Green party and groups such as Greenpeace advocate ditching nuclear in favour of more renewables, energy efficiency and flexibility through imports, batteries and other technologies. However, most energy industry experts think the future involves some new nuclear. The government has already restated its commitment to new nuclear power. “It’s difficult to see a low-carbon energy system in the future which has no new nuclear,” says George Day, the head of policy and regulation at the government-funded Energy Systems Catapult. “If you try to rely on just renewables and storage, without carbon capture and storage or nuclear, you are looking at a very challenging transition and one that is more costly than a balanced mix [of supplies].” All of National Grid’s four future energy scenarios envisage some new nuclear, although the amounts differ considerably. Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said it was hard to imagine an energy system without the baseload power – or continuous electricity supply – provided by nuclear. “There is a school of thought that says baseload is a 20th century thing. They might be right – but it would be a big call by government to bet baseload won’t be a thing by 2025.” The government has already downgraded the amount of new nuclear it expects to be built in the future. It assumes 13 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2035, implying three further nuclear power stations in addition to the 3.2GW plant at Hinkley. There are now only two firms in the running, which are both involved in plans for two new plants. French state-owned EDF Energy, which is behind Hinkley, wants to start building a carbon copy of that project at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, in 2021. Chinese state-owned CGN, meanwhile, is accelerating work on a Chinese-designed reactor for Bradwell in Essex, with the aim of being operational around 2030. Hitachi’s withdrawal suggests the financing model used for Hinkley, and proposed for Wylfa, is dead. The government will likely junk that approach – of offering a guaranteed price of power for 35 years – for an alternative known as the “regulated asset base” (RAB) model. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has created a whole division to develop RAB, where a regulator would set a fixed sum for the power station’s costs and fixed returns for the developer, paid for by energy billpayers or taxpayers. Officials are assessing RAB’s viability, with a decision expected this year. But critics say the approach loads the risk of nuclear plant construction delays, such as those seen in France and Finland, on citizens. Returns would also be paid for years before any electricity was generated. EDF Energy backs the RAB model and the Chinese have said they would look at it. The influential government adviser Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, has called it “plausible and preferable” to the Hinkley approach if the UK wants new nuclear. Day believes it could produce the power stations that ministers want. Labour, which is pro-nuclear, has branded the approach risky and reckless but has not put forward an alternative. Given the uncertainty over new nuclear, could the UK manage without it? Maybe. The obvious route is a lot more renewable power capacity than currently planned. The government’s climate change advisers last year hiked up the amount of renewables they expected four years ago, to 45-60% of electricity supplies by 2030, up from 40-55% previously. Both are a big increase from the 33% level today. The Committee on Climate Change said there is evidence the energy system could cope with as much as 60% of supplies coming from intermittent renewables. Filling the 9.2GW-sized hole left by Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury would require 14GW of offshore wind power, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. That is equivalent to more than 20 of the world’s biggest offshore windfarm, which consists of 87 turbines. According to Atherton, the only way renewables and storage could plausibly fill the nuclear gap would be to “spend a vast amount of money on saturating the UK with offshore wind”. That could end up with enough turbines in enough different locations to replicate the “always-on” nature of nuclear. Large-scale batteries will help with the variable nature of renewables and are expanding fast. But they will not address the fact that electricity demand is much higher in winter than summer, or solve long windless spells. The other big techno fix in the arsenal of low-carbon energy options is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, many years of government efforts to kickstart it failed and ministers have switched their focus away from CCS for power stations to CCS for industrial uses. Day said gas power stations with CCS still looked “pretty promising” but significant policy changes would be needed to enable firms to invest in it. Others, however, are more dismissive. Atherton said: “People have been working on CCS gas for 20 years and nobody has got within a mile of it yet. People will tell you the technology works … that doesn’t mean I can do it on a budget.”"
"Dramatic increases in the rate at which ice on Greenland and East Antarctica is melting are, along with the heatwave gripping Australia, among the latest manifestations of the changes our planet and its atmosphere are undergoing. Concerns surrounding the risk of melting ice causing sea levels to rise were previously focused mainly on large glaciers. But scientists have discovered that the largest recent losses from Greenland’s vast ice sheet, which is two miles thick in places, have occurred in the island’s largely glacier-free south-west. Combined with recent analysis of retreating Antarctic glaciers that were previously thought to be stable, this new research makes unnerving reading. This is because of what it tells us about the extent of likely sea level rises, and warming seas linked to coral die-off and chaotic weather, but also because it highlights the difficulty of fully understanding the climate system.  Last year the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urged governments to work towards the most ambitious targets in the 2015 Paris agreement, and a global temperature rise not greater than 1.5C. Many experts fear that factors including the election of Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil mean that even the more modest goal of sticking to current commitments, putting the world on course for a 3C rise, remains a huge challenge. Currently, global carbon emissions are still rising. But if people all over the world are getting used to the idea that higher temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events are the new normal – recent polling in the US suggests 72% of Americans believe global warming is important, the highest-ever figure – we are arguably less advanced in our understanding of warming oceans.  The sea level rises that scientists expect to accompany a temperature rise of 3C would submerge cities including Shanghai, Osaka and Miami along with parts of Rio de Janeiro and Alexandria – less than a century from now. Among nations, Bangladesh will be particularly severely affected, with one estimate suggesting that 250,000 people are already forced to move each year, making them environmental refugees. Such facts on the ground, as well as predictions, are why climate activists have long linked their cause to wider concerns around social justice. Just as carbon emissions must be limited to protect the livelihoods of people already struggling in areas vulnerable to drought and desertification, sea level rises must be restricted to protect the millions of people who live on coasts and in low-lying areas. The movement of peoples around the world, including but not limited to refugees, is in some cases a direct consequence of changes to the environment. Weather and climate systems are complex, and sea levels are hard to predict confidently. Already, ice sheets and glaciers are surprising scientists by behaving in unexpected ways. But while trying to limit future emissions remains the most pressing task, these ominous findings highlight the need to address the consequences of carbon already emitted. Sea level rises will continue long after emissions have peaked. We will have to adapt to our world’s changing shape."
"The distinguished medical journal The Lancet has issued not one but two apocalyptic warnings about our food in under a month. One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth’s ecosystems. This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet. The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe. It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat. Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders, the libertarian right. Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts! Cue cries of distress from champions of local, low-impact agriculture who include grass-fed animals, and their meat and manure, in their sustainable mix. These self-appointed experts don’t understand farming! Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day. Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan! Yet the evidence that our diets are the largest cause of climate change and biodiversity loss is now overwhelming. The global food system is responsible for up to 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock sector on its own accounting for about half of that total or 14.5%. The modern western way of eating is also making very large numbers of people fat and sick as other parts of the world adopt it. Diet-related diseases now cause roughly 11 million deaths a year as preventable cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and diabetes have spread along with our way of eating. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, and 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, yet at the same time 2 billion are overweight or obese. In poorer counties you can even find obesity and stunting within the same family as calorie-heavy but nutrient-light processed industrialised foods are adopted. In other words, something has gone horribly wrong and we don’t have much time to fix it. The so-called “reference diet”, published in the first Lancet report, has caused uproar in some quarters. This is a theoretical attempt to answer the Malthusian question: if the global population reaches 10 billion by 2050 (as is anticipated), will there be enough food to meet everyone’s basic nutritional needs without cutting down more forest, polluting more water courses and generally destroying the planet? The answer it comes up with is yes, but only if we share things out differently, and stop feeding a quarter of the world’s grain to animals. The reference diet models each person globally having 14g of red meat a day, 29g of chicken, a fraction of an egg, 250g of dairy, a little fat or oil, very little sugar, and lots of grains and lentils, vegetables and nuts. And here’s where the trouble begins, because calculated day by day and universally these allocations make for a pretty depressing plateful. They contain some odd judgments. Why favour industrialised chicken? Why palm oil? They are plain weird if you try to interpret them as daily instructions without thinking about the diet as a whole or what’s available to people locally – hence the one-fifth of an egg, the quarter rasher of bacon. People don’t shop and eat by numbers and fractions. And the fact that nutrition epidemiology – the study of patterns in diet and disease – has got it wrong before does not help. Remember when fears about dietary cholesterol were used to condemn eggs? These instructions sound top down and, worse, appear to throw responsibility back to the individual. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, yet 2 billion are overweight or obese But that is to miss the point of these instructions. They are calculations that give a sense of the scale of the problem and a science-based framework for political action. Contrary to some claims, the Lancet commission that undertook the modelling, supported by the philanthropic EAT Foundation, received no funding from industry. And the uncomfortable truth is that meat, and specifically the meat from intensively-fed livestock, processed in the way it generally is in the western diet, is a hotspot when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and ill health. Well-produced meat and dairy can have a place, but it will be a small one, and it is expensive. Our diets are out of kilter with what’s good for both us and the planet because powerful vested interests and misplaced economic incentives have driven them in that direction, and this is the thesis underlying the commission’s findings. The equivalent of $500bn in agricultural subsidies goes each year to the wrong sort of food – corn, soya, meat and dairy, as cheap raw materials for intensive livestock production and for highly processed foods. About $5tn a year goes in subsidies to the fossil fuels which industrialised agriculture uses so profligately. Big food has spent hundreds of millions advertising unhealthy food and lobbying to block the sort of measures that might help shift consumption. Although individuals can make a difference by modifying their diets, and send clear demands for action to politicians , we cannot redraw the food system on our own. That will require not just governments, but global agreement. The Lancet says the problem is so big and so urgent that we need an intergovernmental convention to agree a way forward, in the way that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have. Expect plenty of hysterical, dark-money opposition to that. The Lancet, founded in the 19th century, caused uproar back then by publishing the unwelcomenews that food was routinely adulterated. It has once again kickstarted a vital debate about how we eat. If it all sounds too gloomy, it’s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease. It’s not so very long since most people ate in the way we now need to rediscover.  • Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the Guardian and author of Not on the Label and Eat Your Heart Out"

"What better example is there that the Liberal party must split than the proposed nomination of Peta Credlin for the seat of Mallee. If, as Credlin says, “climate change remains Malcolm Turnbull’s kryptonite”, then her preselection could just be the Liberal party’s dynamite. The split already exists, but for now, it’s being held together with sticky tape and string. And Credlin’s preselection could well be the spark that lights the fuse, and blows the whole thing up. The Liberal party is suffering an existential crisis. And no other issue defines this crisis like the looming threat to our safety and security caused by inaction on climate change. Credlin understands this and has used her position as a climate change-denying, hard-right mouthpiece of the Murdoch empire to advance her own political interests, and the interests of the coal industry. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She’s consistently claimed climate change is a political hoax, and used her position in the media to undermine a sitting prime minister and any energy policy supported by the Coalition party room that does not involve more coal and the end of renewables. She doesn’t represent real liberal views, and if she appeals to what’s left of the “base”, then many people who used to vote Liberal will keep moving for the exits. Inspired by Donald Trump, Credlin has argued Australia should tear up the Paris agreement, tear up any sensible national energy guarantee. Credlin has demanded taxpayers’ money go to the Adani coalmine and be used to build new coal-fired power stations. It’s madness. Australians don’t want this. We would prefer a Great Barrier Reef, renewable energy and a future we can survive and thrive in. These views are so ignorant – their political manifestation through Tony Abbott, Craig Kelly and their ilk – that it presents a grave economic and security threat to Australia’s future. And it could be the final death knell to the Liberal party. Credlin’s demonstrated lack of understanding of the serious climate emergency we face, or even the basic economics of power production costs are breathtaking. She promotes the view that climate change is some leftwing conspiracy and that the science is rubbish. These views need to be called for what they are: dangerous. In her media roles, Credlin has even attacked the scientific foundation for energy and climate policy. From the desk at Sky, she announced her displeasure that former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull asked chief scientist Alan Finkel for real consideration of the climate change transition and energy policy. Instead she demanded a manufactured report devoid of reality. It is essential now that real liberals stand against this reckless game of Russian roulette “What started out as a report designed to expose the South Australian Labor government’s catastrophic handling of energy policy leading up to last year’s blackouts” – promoting the lie that the blackouts were caused by renewables – “is now a report that threatens the tense equilibrium of the Coalition party room”, warned Credlin. Heaven help us if facts were allowed to get in the way of the stability of the party room or facts should reach the people! We should be deeply concerned that the Liberal party is once again seeking to preselect people who are prepared to sprout deranged conspiracy theories. “Green ideology has trumped sensible economics. Affordable power, from abundant coal and gas, is Australia’s principal competitive advantage and in recent years, we’ve given it away in the name of saving the planet.” Good luck finding a bank, or anyone under 35, to agree with you. The job of any politician should be to put the long-term wellbeing of the public before cheap and dangerous political point-scoring. People are sick to death of it. This kind of pandering to the hard-right’s views did not serve Matthew Guy well in Victoria, and it will not serve the Liberals well at national level either. Australians know it’s getting hotter every summer and see the increases in extreme weather. Report after report, overflowing with scientific evidence, traditionally a solid foundation for investment and public policy making, has been abandoned by the federal Liberal party. We understand how this will threaten our families, economy and security, and we must act to provide people with a real liberal alternative. Credlin, Abbott and the rest of the hard-right’s “commitment to coal” is entirely political. The calculation they’ve made is that their short-term political interests, and the interests of the coal industry, are more important than the future of our country, our people and holistically the environment we all share. It is essential now that real liberals stand against this reckless game of Russian roulette the hard right are playing with our future. If not, they too will adorn the walls as climate change deniers, who, despite all the evidence, refused to act. • Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation"
"The rise of the gilets jaunes protest movement requires governments to prove that ordinary people and corporate elites are “in this together” in shouldering the costs of fighting climate change, a senior EU figure has said. Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s vice-president, said the movement, first triggered by a proposed rise in fuel tax in France, highlighted the need to share the burden.  He was also critical of people and groups who condemned attempts by the EU and national governments to encourage changes such as dropping single-use plastics or driving cars with lower emissions. “This is the game of those who deny climate change or who deny the need for sustainability,” he said. “They say: ‘They are going to take everything away from us. They are going to take our cars away from us, they are going to take our steaks from us, they are going to take all the things that make life nice away from us. So let’s not go there.’ “It is a false contradiction. If we put our policies in the right order, we have a sustainable society without lowering but even increasing our levels of wellbeing. Is wellbeing only economic growth? Only salaries? Or is wellbeing also being able to breathe clean air and drink clean water?” Speaking before the publication on Wednesday of a “reflections paper” on the EU’s next steps in changing the way Europeans live and work in order to protect the environment, Timmermans said the challenge was to bring about reform in a way that was equitable. “The most important thing the gilets jaunes and others ask themselves is: is this fair, are people taking a fair share of the burden or are [the elites] unburdening all that on us? If you create the impression, rightly or wrongly, that this is just a burden on citizens unloaded by companies that don’t do anything, then people will just block it,” he said. “Politically speaking, one of the most important tasks will be to show that this is something we are doing together in an equitable way, a fair way.” On Monday a second French gilets jaunes leader announced she was founding a political party. Its programme calls for removing privileges from elected representatives, developing “charity houses” paid for by donations from chief executives, a reduction in VAT on essential products and higher taxes for higher earners. Timmermans said there were calls for the EU and member states to slow down in making major societal changes in favour of sustainability, but he warned: “The time is now.”"
"We know remarkably little about the oceans that cover most of the Earth, provide half of our oxygen and help to regulate the climate. Maps of the ocean floor are less detailed than those of Mars or the moon. Marine biologists have discovered deeply weird and genuinely wonderful species: boxer crabs wielding anemones like weapons; the rope-like Praya dubia, up to 50 metres long; immortal jellyfish, which unlike any other known creature can revert from maturity to an earlier stage of development, akin to a butterfly becoming a caterpillar. But on one estimate we have identified less than a tenth of ocean-dwelling creatures. What we can be certain about is that the extraordinary diversity of life in the oceans is under immense and growing threat. This week we learned that the last five years were the hottest on record. Global warming has heated the oceans by the equivalent of one atomic explosion per second for the last century and a half; in recent years the pace has accelerated to between three and six atomic bombs per second. More than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas. Billions of people living in coastal areas are under threat from rising sea levels, due both to the melting of ice – happening at a frightening and increasing rate – and the physical expansion of water as it warms. Climate change is making storms more powerful and disrupting the patterns of marine life on which communities depend. But it is only the most comprehensive of the dangers. Carbon emissions are also causing ocean acidification. Intensive fishing, pollution and the exploitation of mineral resources are all taking their toll. Between a fifth and a quarter of marine species are already threatened with extinction; global marine populations have halved since 1970. Though only three humans have reached the deepest known point, the Mariana trench, our collective impact is felt there in the form of pollutants and plastics. Recently, an expert warned that today’s children may be the last generation to see the glory of coral reef systems which have survived for tens of millions of years. Bleaching, first observed in 1983, has already affected up to a third of warm-water reefs. Scientists around the world are “farming” corals in an ingenious attempt to sustain them, but the only real solution is to stave off the worst climate change scenario. The New York summit overseen by the UN secretary general this September will be a key test of whether nation states are serious about cutting emissions. The new reports provide yet more evidence of how urgent this is. As one expert on ocean warming notes in the Guardian today, it can still be tackled if we act immediately; this is a test of will, not ability. We know that the human consequences if we fail will be catastrophic. And yet, because we have still to explore the oceans more fully, we may never realise quite how much we have lost."

"January was Australia’s hottest month on record, with the country’s mean temperature exceeding 30C for the first time since records began in 1910. The Bureau of Meteorology released its climate summary for January on Friday and said the widespread heatwave conditions and daily extremes were “unprecedented”. “There’s been so many records it’s really hard to count,” said Andrew Watkins, a senior climatologist at the Bom. January was Australia’s warmest month for mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. Large parts of Australia received only 20% of their normal rainfall, particularly throughout the south-east in Victoria and parts of New South Wales and South Australia. Tasmania, which has been battling bushfires throughout the past month, had its driest ever January. Watkins said Borrona Downs in north-west NSW broke the record for hottest minimum temperature, registering one night at 36.6C. According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future. So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia? The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected. They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days. The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times. Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year. These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse. Port Augusta recorded the country’s highest temperature in January, reaching 49.5C. “We’ve also seen records in many states set including places like Victoria where Swan Hill and Kerang got up over 47.5C,” Watkins said. Menindee in far-west NSW, the site of December and January’s mass fish kills, had four days in a row of temperatures above 47C. In parts of western Queensland and western NSW, there have been long strings of more than 40 days of temperatures above 40C. Cloncurry had 43 days in a row that exceeded 40C. Birdsville in the state’s west had 16 days in January of temperatures higher than 45C and 10 of those days were in a row. Bom said a persistent high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea that blocked cold fronts and cooler air from reaching the country’s south, and a delayed monsoon in the north, contributed to the heatwave. “The warming trend which has seen Australian temperatures increase by more than 1C in the last 100 years also contributed to the unusually warm conditions,” Watkins said. New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and the Northern Territory all had their warmest January on record. "

"For the past 25 years I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy a spectacular view of Collaroy-Narrabeen beach from my old wooden house tucked into the northern slopes of Mt Ramsay. I survey a gorgeous, curved slice of coast where swell dispatched from the far reaches of the Southern and Pacific oceans reaches a final, spectacular resignation.  Collaroy-Narrabeen on Sydney’s northern beaches is arguably as well known for its peerless status in Australian surfing culture as it is the pinup for rising sea levels due to climate change. There cannot be a beach in Australia that has been more studied by experts and fought over by homeowners, beach users and grandstanding politicians than Collaroy-Narrabeen. At 2.6km it’s Sydney’s second-longest stretch of golden sand and pounding surf (Cronulla, at 4.8km is the longest). It’s also classified as the most at-risk beach from erosion in New South Wales and the third most at-risk in the nation. Collaroy takes its name from an 1881 shipwreck. The paddle steamer Collaroy, that plied its trade between Newcastle and Sydney as a passenger vessel, grounded at the end of my street, according records in the State Library of NSW. As for “Narrabeen”, its name is disputed as meaning either “source of fresh water” or “swan”. Camaraigal descendant and historian Dennis Foley, describes the idyllic shores and waterway of Narrabeen Lagoon, “the heart of our world” before British settlement. Collaroy-Narrabeen is mecca for international surfers. A bucket-list wave. Quick trivia question: which is the only non-American surf spot mentioned in the Beach Boys’ Surfin’ USA? It’s Narra-beyaaan… There you go. Look it up. (You owe me a chop from your next triumphant meat tray.) World-renowned surfing legends Simon Anderson, Terry Fitzgerald, Nat Young, Damien Hardman, Laura Enever, Mark Warren, Col Smith and Ozzie Wright had their pick of waves along the stretch – from the powerful beach break at Collaroy to the fabled left-hander at North Narrabeen known as “northy”. Surf writer Nick Carroll says: “It is possible that more surfers learned to pull vertical off-the-lips here than any other surf spot in the world.” Standards and expectations are high and routinely met. Master the hassle at “northy” and you’ll survive any competitive break on earth, my surfing husband Brendan Donohoe reckons. He’s been the president of the northern beaches branch of Surfrider Australia since 1999 (also former chair of the board) and through him I’ve had a front-row seat to observe the pitched battles fought over Collaroy-Narrabeen. For those not immersed in surfing culture, the beach is that one in those ubiquitous news pictures of smashed houses, tangled timber and a swimming pool wrenched from its moorings – all flung to the sand in the wild winter storm of 2016 which swallowed 50m of coastline, 150m of sand and dumped it in the surf zone. The images don’t surprise anyone with a passing local knowledge. Storms have been claiming houses and various bits of the beach’s four surf life saving clubs regularly since the first recorded image of splintered timber in 1920. Ask the old-timers. Question is, can a man-made seawall hold back the tides? One thing is absolutely certain according to coastal scientists worldwide: seawalls protect land property in the short-term but, eventually, destroy beaches. Think of the dunes of a beach as its precious lungs … breathing in and out with the tides. Sand is accreted, washed away. Breathe in. Breathe out. For the vast swathes of Australia’s uninhabited shoreline it’s a dynamic, natural process. When humans build houses in the dunes or breakwalls and seawalls on beaches and rivers, they harden the coast and its ability to recover naturally. Such structures have the inevitable effect of reflecting and concentrating wave energy and accelerating erosion. Eventually, the beach narrows and disappears. In 2002, the Surfrider Foundation called on the beach-loving residents of Collaroy-Narrabeen to protest the building of a seawall more than a kilometre long proposed by the then Warringah council. Also noted was that seawalls are eye-wateringly expensive to maintain, adding huge imposts to council rates. Thousands gathered, held hands, drew a “line in the sand”. Said “No to seawalls” and the audacious engineering project was scrapped. Decades earlier the council had committed to a “buyback” of properties in the wave impact zone. A strategic retreat from the worst of it. A handful of properties were purchased, but the policy was abandoned in 2007, deemed as “unsustainable” into the future, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars by the MP for Pittwater, Rob Stokes. In 2013 Tony Abbott, member for Warringah, declared that a “green army” would build seawalls up and down the coast. The rising waters would be forever thwarted! Northern beaches mayors said “yeah, nah”. “It’s the opposite of the direction councils are going in.” The science is in. And it’s not that simple. The new, amalgamated Northern Beaches council now has a policy of approving partial seawall reinforcements with costs largely borne by the homeowners themselves. It’s seen as unfair by some. No comfort to the many thousands of homeowners along Australia’s vast, settled coastline whose precious properties (built in good faith) are now subject to the merciless forces of evermore destructive coastal surges due to climate change. So, what’s the answer? Coastal municipalities have been tackling the problem with a suite of measures. For some it will be a strategic retreat with assets that can be moved, for others it will be building partial seawalls, cliff reinforcement and revegetation. As is happening in other parts of the world, the costs of defence will sometimes be calculated as too onerous and properties will be abandoned to topple into the sea. What about pumping more sand to replenish the beach? I hear you ask. Good question! It’s what Surfrider Australia and others (including Rob Stokes) have been advocating for decades. After all, it’s been done on the southern Gold Coast since 1976 after breakwalls built in the 60s on the Tweed River disturbed the natural flow of sand, leaving local beaches bare and bereft. Sand is pumped through pipes on to the beaches, to the point where many now complain there’s too much of the stuff. However, the topography of threatened beaches in NSW is very different to the Goldie. Most of our eroding beaches are locked between headlands and sand is washed directly offshore to deep water, making restoration of our beaches a much more expensive and tricky proposition. In October 2017, a technical report on sand nourishment was prepared by the University of NSW’s Water Research Laboratory for the state Office of Environment and Heritage. It notes that in the US the trend since the 1960s has been to move away from fixed structures for coastal protection. These days some 80%-93% of US Army Corps of Engineers’ expenditure is directed to replenishing sand. The detailed report covers the waterfront in its analysis: the optimum width of beaches that sun-lovers expect; the sourcing of suitable sand with the right grain size; how to get it on to our beaches by either road or via a variety of offshore sand dredges and the attendant environmental impacts. It’s well worth a read if you’re wondering if sea-level rise is coming to a beach near you. Spoiler alert: it is. There’s increasing clamour from coastal experts for the NSW government to invest in a dredging vessel (or two) that could ply our coast and continually pump sand on to our most at-risk beaches. We could name one Beachy McBeachface! Renting sand-pumping vessels is also an option – there’s plenty of spare global capacity. The cost would be considerable, the oversight demanding and, no doubt, the science and technology is continually evolving. But the utter negligence of government(s) to not act, or even model future solutions, is unfathomable. The sheer volume of reports commissioned and left mouldering in bottom drawers could in themselves be a handy bulwark in the face of gathering storms. And those increasingly ferocious maelstroms are coming. Leaving in their wake another round of useless hand-wringing and blame. Hearts and homes broken. Ask yourself, what is a beach worth? To our economy, tourism and our adored beach-going and surfing culture? On Collaroy-Narrabeen, at least, the cost of doing something has been estimated. Too high a price to pay? The loss of my beloved beach, and yours – and it could happen in our children’s lifetime – is incalculable. It’s way past time to act."
"Around 40 climate activists have staged a peaceful occupation of the Scottish parliament’s debating chamber, urging MSPs to introduce much tougher climate targets. Campaigners with the recently formed direct action group Extinction Rebellion posed as tourists on a visit to Holyrood before staging an hour-long sit-in in the chamber. There were no arrests. Police escorted the protesters from the building through a side entrance and they were greeted by cheers from other campaigners gathered outside the parliament. Extinction Rebellion was launched last October with the backing of 100 academics and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Friday’s occupation was the group’s first direct action in Scotland, after sit-down protests in Parliament Square, Westminster, and at climate talks in Poland. Robert Alcock, a builder and eco-designer who took part in the sit-in, said the group wanted Holyrood to take up far more ambitious CO2 reduction policies geared towards cutting net emissions to zero by 2025, in line with analysis from the International Panel on Climate Change. Extinction Rebellion wants Scotland to convene a citizens’ assembly to decide how to achieve that goal through consensus. It would be made up of 73 members of the public drawn from Holyrood’s 73 single-member constituencies, and have the power to revise the parliament’s climate bills. The Scottish government insists the country’s climate policies, enacted by Holyrood, are among the most ambitious and far-reaching in the world, and the most radical from any UK legislature. Scotland’s first target to reduce CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020 has already been met, and the parties are now debating a fresh target to hit 90% by 2050 in a new climate bill. Asked why Extinction Rebellion was targeting Holyrood rather than oil companies in Aberdeen or the oil refinery at Grangemouth west of Edinburgh, Alcock said: “This is a very symbolic place because it is representing the people of Scotland, and today is Burns Day, the day of Scotland’s national poet. “While it is relatively progressive compared to other countries it comes nowhere near what is necessary to really address the gravity of the climate emergency.” A Scottish parliament spokeswoman said: “Around 40 individuals on a free public tour refused to leave the chamber for approximately 60 minutes before leaving peacefully at 1.30pm. “The public tour route takes in the debating chamber when parliament is not sitting. There was no impact on parliamentary business.”"
"“Spring is here … and they can’t stop you enjoying it.” That’s George Orwell in his essay Some Thoughts on the Common Toad.  “So long as you are not actually ill, hungry, frightened or immured in a prison or a holiday camp,” he continues, “Spring is still spring. The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun, and neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.” But, of course, now they have. Today spring’s no longer spring – at least not in the old way. With climate change wrecking the seasonal rhythms, scientists find plants emerging from the soil earlier than ever before. Almost everywhere, the ancient patterns have gone awry: last November, for instance, summer temperatures killed a third – yes, a third! – of Australia’s remaining spectacled flying foxes. The atom bombs, the police, the dictators and the bureaucrats remain with us and, God knows, so do the lies streaming from the loudspeakers. But, as the sociologist John Bellamy Foster noted back in 2002, Orwell’s beloved toads are now vanishingly rare, with some 200 different species of amphibians driven to extinction in the last few decades. Some Thoughts on the Common Toad appeared in the socialist newspaper Tribune in 1946 just as the planet entered what environmentalists call “The Great Acceleration”: the period in which the human boot, weighing heavily since the industrial revolution, began to stamp on the face of nature. Throughout the post-war boom, the tremendous expansion of the global economy drew more and more of the world into the circuit of capital. Ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions: all of these, and other indicators, shot violently upward from the late 1940s on. The periodisation highlights a fundamental problem in the fight against climate change today. We know now that scientists understood all the key principles of global warming decades ago. Furthermore, as Nathaniel Rich notes, back in the 1980s a real response seemed eminently feasible as “many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: non-partisan and of the highest possible stakes”. But the early consensus for climate action coincided with what Naomi Klein dubs “the absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade”. As a result, the leaders who committed to fighting warming also ruled out any response to emissions incompatible with their free market dogma. Thus, in the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the US, with the backing of companies like Enron, insisted that international efforts for climate change mitigation rely on business-friendly, market-based mechanisms such as cap and trade schemes. Even though Washington eventually refused to ratify Kyoto, the methodology championed by it (and institutions like the World Bank) became, by the early 2000s, an unassailable political orthodoxy. Again, the notion that the market offered the best (or indeed the only) mechanism for fighting climate change was always pure ideology. For instance governments can shut down coal-fuelled power stations whenever they like – they don’t need price signals to pass legislation. In the real world, as researcher Jesse Jenkins explained to the New York Times “policies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date”. The ideologically-determined attempts to generate environmental outcomes through market action thus resembled huge Rube Goldberg machines, dependent on ultra-convoluted systems for results that can also be produced by non-market means. But those fossil fuel corporations who supported (and sometimes led) the early campaigns for emissions trading systems saw the redundant complexity of market environmentalism as a feature, not a bug. Companies like BP and Shell understood – better than many environmentalists – that, in practice, a trading system could amount to a massive subsidy for big polluters since they could profit hugely by “selling” emissions they didn’t actually require. Furthermore, because a trade in carbon allowed the purchase of credits associated with carbon offsets (usually in the developing world), tremendous opportunities opened up for creative (and sometimes blatantly dishonest) accounting. An EU study from 2017 found that a full 85% of offset projects actually failed to reduce emissions at all. Many progressives reluctantly embraced free market environmentalism, judging any action to be better than none – particularly as overt climate change denialism grew. But that missed something else that the corporates grasped: namely, that the “put a price on carbon” slogan accepted, by definition, the commodification of the environment. That was, after all, the goal of pricing: transforming nature, in all its complexity and diversity, into an asset legible within a corporate ledger. Fixing a market value on carbon was never supposed to halt the economic activity underpinning the Great Acceleration. On the contrary, it was intended to speed it up. Even if trading schemes do cut greenhouse gases (which, by and large, they don’t), they’re designed, as pro-business measures, not to limit industrial expansion but to foster it. They’re meant explicitly to encourage more economic growth – and that’s something that’s no longer compatible with the preservation of nature. As Foster points out, a continuous 3% average annual rate of growth means that world industry doubles every twenty-five years, grows by a factor of sixteen every century, and 4,000 times every three centuries. Given the current state of the planet, how would that not bring utter ruination? The World Wildlife Fund says that populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians have declined by 60% since 1970. What will be left if we continue economic metastasisation for another half century? In political terms, the embrace by progressives of mitigation schemes so closely associated with big business has proved utterly disastrous. Over the last decades, an “environmentalism” that rewarded rapacious corporations seemed to many ordinary people less a strategy for preserving the planet they depended upon and more a rhetorical bludgeon wielded by an out-of-touch political class. Take the experience in France, where President Emmanuel Macron, pledging to Make the Planet Great Again, introduced another neoliberal nostrum – a carbon tax. A recent study revealed that carbon taxes don’t make a meaningful difference to the climate because governments invariably set them at too low a rate. Why? Well, carbon taxes are innately regressive – they pass the cost of reform onto the consumers who can least afford it – and thus are rarely popular. In France Macron implemented his levy on fuel as part of a broader austerity package – and spurred the Yellow Vest revolt, a rebellion led by workers living outside the metropolitan centres, and with no choice but to use cars. In other words, in the name of environmentalism, Macron managed to alienate France’s poorest – the very people who will suffer most in a warming future and so should have been a key constituency for change. That’s why Thoughts on the Common Toad repays re-reading. In his essay, Orwell takes for granted an affinity between everyday nature and working class people, who can, he suggests, find an alternative to oppression and exploitation in the environment around them. “Even in the most sordid street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of London.” In other words, Orwell celebrates an uncommodified environment, explicitly because it doesn’t obey the rules of the market. “[T]he pleasures of spring are available to everybody, and cost nothing,” he explains, before exulting at the thought of birds, in the midst of bourgeois Britain, flagrantly avoiding rent. The Great Deceleration we require today means deploying our scientific and technical knowledge to undo the damage we’ve wreaked. It means embracing economic planning, so that we use scarce resources for human need rather than corporate profit; it means confronting the military-industrial complex and abandoning the fossil economy; it means involving ordinary people in the decisions that shape their lives. It means, in other words, constructing a non-market society, as scary as that idea will seem to some In 1946 Orwell, a lifelong socialist, defended an appreciation of nature as something that made “a peaceful and decent future a little more probable”. The joy that he took in toads and kestrels and other creatures that evaded the market’s invisible hand hinted at an older kind of society – and potentially, a newer one. The dictators and bureaucrats might be ruining spring, as they force every living organism to bear the consequences for their profits. But for most of human history we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that’s remarkably recent. And if the past was different, the future can be, too. As we struggle to preserve our only planet, that insight matters more than ever. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Heatwaves and blackouts have been the talk of the town as temperatures climbed over 40C in all states except Tasmania, and once again the commentariat have gone into a renewable-generated bluster. Chris Uhlmann and Alan Moran blamed the high prices on wind power, Pauline Hanson called for people to use more power and Judith Sloan called demand management a bribe. There were three notable things that happened with our energy system during what will become the new normal of extreme heat.  At the end of last week it was hot. Like, record-breaking, fry an egg on the pavement hot. Many parts of South Australian and Victoria faced their hottest days on record. As Australians tried their best to stay cool, almost everyone who had an air conditioner switched it on and we experienced a “peak demand” event. This is a period where our electricity system is stretched to its limit and wholesale electricity prices reach their peak. Updated: pic.twitter.com/IclDc3fpai As our planet warms we can expect more days like Thursday and Friday. While we still have time to avert the worst impacts of climate change, some warming is now locked in and that means the heatwaves we have experienced more than once already this summer are now an inevitable part of Australia’s future. So what should we do about it? Australia needs to get serious about reducing climate pollution, which continues to rise and do our contribution to stop runaway global warming. We can improve our houses and building so they better manage the heat. Australian houses are sometimes called leaky tents; they let in the heat in summer and the cold in winter. It doesn’t have to be this way. Insulation, double-glazing, draft proofing, better building standards, all these things will keep your house passively cool and reduce (though not eliminate) the amount of air conditioning you need. It’s not rocket science, but currently we aren’t doing any of this. We can also upgrade our air conditioners to be more energy efficient. According to energy analyst Tristan Edis, new air conditioners use half the electricity of the majority of air conditioners that were installed in the early 2000s. On hot days, this would make a significant difference. Our coal and gas plants are ageing. As they age, they breakdown and need maintenance more often. Last week was a case in point. In Victoria, Yallourn power station took one of its units offline for maintenance and another had to be taken offline unexpectedly early Friday morning. Also in Victoria, Loy Yang A had a boiler tube leak just before the heatwave hit and was out for the duration. In New South Wales, Liddell and the Tallawarra gas plants were both offline for many days due to unplanned faults. These six coal and gas units totalling 2,225MWs of capacity were not available for at least some of the period of Australia’s most intensive heatwave on record. This is at best a sign that our coal plants are getting old and can’t be relied on at peak times and at worst it was price-gouging behaviour by some of Australia’s largest energy companies. We need to get serious about demand response. Demand response is when households and industry are paid not to use electricity for some nonessential operations for a period of time. While this isn’t a great idea all year round, for a few hours on a few days a year it’s the cheapest and most effective way of maintaining an electricity system. This is standard practice in the US and Europe where they even have markets for demand response. This is urgently needed here, but was resisted by rule-maker, the Australian Electricity Market Commission (AEMC), until late last year. We also need to continue to build new electricity supply in the form of solar, wind, battery storage, pumped hydro and similar. At the end of last week we experienced two types of blackouts. First there were localised blackouts affecting about 25,000 households in South Australia on Thursday night. These were due to fuses blowing in our distribution infrastructure. These fuses are designed to blow when infrastructure gets too hot so that it isn’t damaged. This was the electricity system working as it should. It isn’t surprising given the record temperatures. The second type of blackout experienced was “load shedding”. This is where the market operator temporarily cuts off some energy users from the system to ensure “system integrity” and to ensure it doesn’t fail catastrophically. In Victoria on Friday afternoon, 160,000 customers were blacked-out over a two-to-three-hour period. Load shedding is the action of last resort and Aemo did everything it could before taking this path. It fired up emergency reserves, asked big energy users to power down and appealed to us to lower our electricity use. Australia’s electricity system is incredibly reliable, typically exceeding our reliability standard of 99.998%. That basically means that the electricity supply needed is available 99.998% of the time. Almost all blackouts in Australia (96.6% according to the AEMC) are because of faults in the poles and wires. What happened on Friday was very rare – only 0.2% of blackouts occur because there isn’t enough operational generation in the system. However, particularly for people suffering health conditions as well as older and younger people, power outages are dangerous and they aren’t good for business either. So what should we do about it? We need more on-demand capacity – there is need for storage (batteries and pumped hydro) and dispatchable solutions (concentrating solar thermal and demand response), that can turn on and ramp up quickly. Renewables (hydro, solar and wind) account for about 20% of generation in the National Electricity Market, higher in South Australia. Over the two-day period in question, renewables averaged higher than 20% generation and on Friday afternoon, when power was needed most, a combination of hydro, wind and solar provided over one-third of Victoria and South Australia’s power. However, while wind and solar will provide the bulk of our annual electricity need in the future, there is need for on-demand solutions. These solutions will fill the gaps in the two to six hours overnight where there is a lull in the wind, or when forecasts (demand or supply) are wrong. The good news is that CSIRO and Aemo have found that just such solutions – wind and solar backed by batteries and pumped hydro are also the cheapest new-build options to deliver reliable, clean electricity supply. We need to recognise climate change is causing more heatwaves which brings increased risk of localised blackouts and even load shedding. We need to start adapting to this new normal. One strategy to do this would be to create community cool zones where people can go to stay cool in extreme heat. These cool zones should have backup power that means they will stay cool even during blackouts. Finally, we also need to have strategies for giving people, particularly vulnerable people, more notice of potential blackouts. If we get serious about demand management there will be better systems in place to provide this notice to people and even incentives and support for folks to go to the movies or a community cool zone. While we can never have an electricity system that is 100% reliable, there are straightforward policy and engineering solutions that can increase our electricity system’s resilience to climate change in the future.

"Extreme temperatures are persisting – and even peaking – in Victoria and New South Wales on the fifth day of Australia’s extraordinary, record-breaking heatwave with Noona in western NSW recording a minimum temperature of 35.9C, a new Australian heat record. On Friday, parts of NSW and the ACT were again forecast to soar above 40C – for the fifth day in a row.  Nine records were broken in NSW on Wednesday, and more are forecast to fall on Friday. In Penrith in Sydney’s west, temperatures will hit 45C, up from 42C on Thursday. In Menindee – the site of mass fish kills in the Murray river – another 45C day is on the cards. It reached 47C on Wednesday and Thursday, and the maximum temperature hasn’t been below 45C since Monday. Australia has a new heat record! Overnight, #Noona in the #NSW west recorded a 35.9C MINIMUM temperature. It's the latest in a series of broken records in this #heatwave Heatwaves are dangerous - stay hydrated & look out for others! #beattheheatForecast: https://t.co/nTTbM3WZEP Rebecca Farr, a forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology, said Canberra would break the record for the longest stretch of over-40C days since records began in 1939. “For Canberra, today we are forecasting 40C and, if we reach that, it will the the first time on record that we will have four consecutive days of 40C or more,” she said. “Broken Hill is forecast to hit four consecutive days of 45C, and that also hasn’t happened before. Records there started in 1957.” The northern regions of Victoria, including Mildura, Shepparton and the border towns of Albury-Wodonga, will also stay above 40C. According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future. So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia? The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected. They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days. The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times. Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year. These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse. But southern and coastal regions will experience the welcome relief of sub-30 temperatures and even rain. Melbourne is set for a maximum of 28C, Geelong 26C and Warrnambool 21C. It will also cool in South Australia, at least compared with the record-breaking 48.9C recorded in Port Augusta on Tuesday. Temperatures will still hover in the 30s but the stretch of nearly-50C temperatures looks to be over. Port Augusta is set for 32C (down from 48.9C), Tarcoola 31C (down from 48.7C), Coober Pedy 38C (down from 47.8C) and Woomera 37C (down from 47.6C). But central Australia will remain scorching. Oodnadatta – one of the hottest 15 places in the Earth this week – will still sit at 46C. In NSW, the towns of Ivanhoe, Bourke and Wilcannia are all facing 46C. Gundagai will swelter through 44C, which is only slightly down on the 45C experienced on Wednesday. Farr said the summer had smashed records across the state. “Yesterday we saw some January records broken,” Farr said. “Cobar (47.2C), Parkes (44.5C), Wagga (45.2C) and Tuggeranong (40.8C) all had their hottest January day since records began. “On Wednesday, we even saw some annual records broken. It was the hottest day since records began at Broken Hill airport (46.3C), Whitecliff (48.2C), Wilcannia (47.9C) and Albury (45.6C).” Temperatures in NSW are expected to drop over the weekend. Menindee is set for 36C with some cloud cover and Penrith 32C. Wilcannia and Ivanhoe will drop to 40C, but Bourke is set to stay hot at 45C on Saturday, and hold at over 40C through all of next week."

"A new analysis shows US greenhouse gas levels are increasing as the Trump administration unravels efforts to slow climate change. Carbon emissions rose sharply last year, increasing 3.4%, according to new estimates from the economic firm Rhodium Group. That year’s jump in emissions is the biggest since the bounce back from the recession in 2010. It is the second largest gain in more than two decades.  Coal plants are shutting down, but electricity demand is growing. Natural-gas fired power emits about half as much carbon as coal but still contributes to climate change. The fossil fuel is replacing most of the coal plants that are closing and also fed most of the higher demand, increasing power-sector climate pollution. Outside of the power sector, transportation, industry and buildings all increased their emissions as well, according to the estimates. The numbers undercut one of the Trump administration’s key defenses for dismissing federal science reports that show rising temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy, kill people and cause more extreme weather. Trump has said he doesn’t believe the findings and his officials have argued they are exaggerated. The Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, often trumpets declines in greenhouse gases, citing data showing that they fell 2.7% from 2016 to 2017. But the EPA is rescinding Obama-era climate work, including regulations meant to speed a shift from coal. The agency contends that Donald Trump’s agenda is driving energy innovation that could help cut emissions. Energy experts, however, say Trump is doing the opposite by rolling back the rules and policies that could have sped renewable growth and by forgoing new regulations beyond the electricity sector. Rhodium Group tracks the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The firm found a modest decrease in carbon emissions between 2016 and 2017, in part because of a warmer-than-usual winter that didn’t require as much heating. Since then carbon output has surged. “The tailwinds of Obama administration policy are dissipating,” said Trevor Houser, a partner at the firm. “This year makes it abundantly clear that energy market trends alone – the low cost of natural gas, the increasing competitiveness of renewables – are not enough to deliver sustained declines in US emissions.” Houser said the numbers would have been worse without the state and local policies enacted during the past five to 10 years. But that the groundswell of climate commitments by governors and mayors since Trump said he would exit the international Paris climate agreement might not translate into policy for some time, he added. He said those efforts are likely to be significant but not sufficient to meet the levels the US pledged."

"As its name suggests, the polar vortex is found around the north pole. It’s a band of strong winds, high up in the atmosphere that keeps bitterly cold air locked around the Arctic region. This circulation isn’t considered a single storm, or even a weather pattern as such. Occasionally, the vortex can become distorted and meander far further south than normal. The phenomenon became widely known to Americans during a particularly frigid spell in 2014, when the media first started using the term “polar vortex”. It was also a factor in the “bomb cyclone” that battered the US east coast last year. This time, the polar vortex has broken in two, bringing the coldest conditions in decades to the midwest US. On Wednesday, Chicago was 10 degrees F colder than Antarctica. “At the moment the vortex looks like two swirling blobs of cold air, one settled over North America, the other over Eurasia,” said Jennifer Francis, the senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. “It splits up when there is sudden stratospheric warming.” Studies have pointed to a recent increase in instances where the polar vortex has bulged down into heavily populated areas. Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why this is happening, with many identifying climate change as an influence. There’s some evidence that the jet stream, a meandering air current that flows over North America and Europe, is slowing and becoming wavier as the planet warms. The jet stream interacts with the polar vortex, helping bring numbing temperatures further south. Scientists also point to a complex sequence of events involving sea ice, which is rapidly diminishing in the Arctic. As the ice retreats, summertime heat is absorbed by the dark ocean that lies underneath. This heat is released into the atmosphere during winter, spurring winds that can disrupt the polar vortex. “We aren’t entirely there yet but there’s more and more support for this concept,” said Francis. “It’s a new and developing hot research topic.” Well, Donald Trump certainly thinks so. “In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes,” the US president tweeted on Monday. “What the hell is going on with Global Waming (sic)? Please come back fast, we need you!” Scientists were quick to point out climate change’s role in allowing Arctic air to flow south, as well as to remind the president that winters still exist. A localized, albeit large, cold snap isn’t representative of the rest of the planet, as Australians currently sweltering in searing record heat of more than 46C (114F) will be well aware of. The past four years have been the hottest on record for the globe. In the US, record-breaking high temperatures are outnumbering record lows by a ratio of two to one. Research suggests this ratio will expand to 16 heat records for every cold record set if the US warms by 3C (5.4F) this century, which is likely unless greenhouse gases are severely curtailed. Trump’s repeated tweets mocking climate science when the temperature drops are “ridiculous, in a word”, said Francis. “He cares not to understand. It’s the only explanation.”"

"It was 48.9C last Tuesday in Port Augusta, South Australia, an old harbour city that now harvests solar power. Michelle Coles, the owner of the local cinema, took off her shoes at night to test the concrete before letting the dogs out. “People tend to stay at home,” she said. “They don’t walk around when it’s like this.” It’s easy to see why: in the middle of the day it takes seconds to blister a dog’s paw or child’s foot. In Mildura, in northern Victoria, last week gardeners burned their hands when they picked up their tools, which had been left in the sun at 46C. Fish were dying in the rivers. Almost every day last week a new heat record was broken in Australia. They spread out, unrelenting, across the country, with records broken for all kinds of reasons – as if the statistics were finding an infinite series of ways to say that it was hot. The community of Noona – population 14 – reached the highest minimum ever recorded overnight in Australia – 35.9C was the coldest it got, at 7am on Friday. It was 45C by noon. A record fell on Tuesday in Meekatharra in Western Australia – the highest minimum there ever recorded (33C). Another fell on Wednesday, 2,000 miles away, in Albury, New South Wales – their hottest day (45.6C). It was 45C or higher for four consecutive days in Broken Hill – another record – and more than 40C for the same time period in Canberra, the nation’s capital. Nine records fell across NSW on Wednesday alone. Back in Port Augusta, Tuesday was the highest temperature since records began in 1962. In the Niagara Cafe in Gundagai, whose claim to fame is that the former Australian prime minister John Curtin once popped in during the second world war, Tina Loukissas turned off the deep fryer, then the grill. “It feels like you’ve walked into a sauna,” she said. “When it’s getting up to 43C or 44C, because you have all these machines going, the air conditioning isn’t coping very well. “We’ve got tables outside that nobody has sat at for the last couple of days … You’d be crazy to sit outside on a day like today.” In Mildura, Tolga Ozkuzucu, owner of Top Notch Gardens, had the misfortune to be working outdoors. “It’s been like hell,” he said. “You have to try to leave your tools in the shade. If you don’t, it burns your fingers. There’s not much you can do. “I try to start as early as I can. I’m not going to risk my body and health. People here are very understanding of that because they know how hot it is … nobody wants to be outside when it’s 46C.” In South Australia, they declared a “code red” across Adelaide, the state capital. Homelessness services were working overtime and the Red Cross started calling round a list of 750 people who were deemed especially vulnerable. At the Australian Open in Melbourne, only the sea breeze kept the temperature below 40C. At Adelaide’s Tour Down Under, a bike race, it was 41C. On Monday last week the hottest spot in New South Wales was Menindee, a river town that feeds the country’s largest water system, the Murray-Darling basin. It was 45C. It climbed to 47C on Wednesday, and by Thursday the fish were gasping. Australia’s native Murray cod can live for decades under normal conditions, growing all the while. The oldest are a metre long, with heavy white bellies that have to be held with both hands. Last week, hundreds died, choked of oxygen due to an algal bloom that fed and grew in the heat, and collapsed when temperatures dipped. Blue-green algae flourishes in hot, slow-moving water. Then, when temperatures inevitably drop, the algae dies and becomes a food source for bacteria, who multiply and starve the river of oxygen. The fish rise to the surface. The mass fish death has reignited a debate over water management in the region, where cotton farmers upstream have been accused of taking more water than they should. The heat is not the root cause, the locals stress. But the five punishing days settling over the river have not made it better. Last Thursday the cod were up near the surface and struggling. On Friday, it was 45C again. In Menindee, the locals believe the fish kill will happen again, with temperatures in the 40s expected to continue into this week. The water will be running hot. But away from the Darling, Michelle Coles from Port Augusta says she is used to the heat. “I didn’t think it was that hot yesterday, if you want an honest answer,” she said last Wednesday, the day after the temperature hit 48.9C. “Yesterday at the cinema, it was very quiet. People tend to stay home. We’re quite used to it. Once it’s over 40, it’s hot. “We’re conditioned to it. Honestly, I’d much rather be in 48C heat in Port Augusta than in the city. You’ve got so much concrete and it’s closed in, but here it’s quite open. “You just don’t stand out in the sun though. That would be stupid.”"
"Donald Trump’s administration is cutting programs scientists say are proven to protect Americans, from pollution safeguards to teen pregnancy prevention and healthier school lunches, with effects that could last for years. Experts who have worked in the federal government under Republicans and Democrats say both have sometimes put politics ahead of science but none have done so as blatantly as Trump. And they warn the consequences could continue long into the future.  “It’s as egregious as I’ve ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests,” said the former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who testified to Congress that the George W Bush administration pushed him to weaken or suppress public health findings. Trump’s high-profile denial of manmade climate change has occasionally overshadowed the many other ways his agencies are contradicting established research. The administration is really not using science. It is using ideology The agriculture department last month rolled back standards for schools to serve more whole grains, less salt and non-fat flavored milk. Department officials claimed schools struggled with the programs because students wouldn’t eat healthier foods. But research found the food changes didn’t deter students from getting lunch and didn’t cause more plate waste. And the healthier food requirements were projected to be effective: one study estimated they could prevent 1.8 million cases of childhood obesity over a decade. “I do think it’s pretty clear that these standards are working and that given more time, they will work better,” said Karen Perry Stillerman, a food policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The Trump administration is also cutting short evidence-based grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs, favoring curriculum focused on abstinence instead, despite a large body of research that shows abstinence-only programs don’t work. A 2007 evaluation of four federal abstinence programs found that they had no impact on sexual activity or rates of unprotected sex among teens. Sara Flowers, the vice-president of education for Planned Parenthood, said the majority of the programs previously funded demonstrated young people changed their behavior in at least one of five categories: delaying sex, reducing sexual partners, increasing contraceptive use, reducing rates of sexually transmitted infections or reducing rates of pregnancy.  “The administration is really not using science. The administration is really using ideology, and those are very different,” Flowers said. “This [program] has been rigorously tested by experts and vetted and analyzed.” The Trump administration has also erroneously questioned the effectiveness of contraceptives in rules expanding exemptions for employers that don’t want to cover them under insurance plans. Climate change and environmental science have also been at the forefront of the battle between science and the Trump administration. Power plant and car standards are being rolled back, as are pesticide restrictions and wildlife protections. The Trump administration has ignored climate scientists’ warnings that rising temperatures and more extreme weather will hurt the US economy and risk lives. The interior department initially sought to remove references to manmade climate change in a report about how sea-level rise might flood national parks. “The notion of there being political appointees who try to impose their political agenda in a way that is contrary to scientific evidence is not a new thing, but it has reached an entirely new level in the Trump administration,” said the Obama science adviser John Holdren. One of the first major decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was to forego a ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which is associated with developmental delays and health problems in children and has sickened farm workers. Judges ordered the EPA to bar the substance, citing the science that shows it is dangerous. The agency is appealing the case. Agency officials have also made fundamental changes to how the federal government weighs environmental and health research. The former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt barred scientists working with EPA grants from serving on the science advisory panels that help shape policies. Instead, industries and states now have more sway over those boards. The agency also plans to limit what science it will consider, requiring any studies used in the regulatory process to publish confidential participant data.  A Democratic staffer for the House science committee, which plans to investigate the administration’s science cuts, said it’s been hard to even track all the agency changes. John Bachmann, who advised the controversial Reagan-era EPA appointee Anne Gorsuch Burford on air pollution science, said she would listen to briefings on peer-reviewed data, even as she slashed budgets and eased enforcement. “That was the most comparable period,” Bachmann said. “That was nothing compared to what we’re seeing now.”"
"Greenland’s ice is melting faster than scientists previously thought, with the pace of ice loss increasing fourfold since 2003, new research has found. Enormous glaciers in Greenland are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic Ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 actually occurred in the south-west region of the island, which is largely glacier-free. This suggests surface ice is simply melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. South-west Greenland, not previously thought of as a source of woe for coastal cities, is set to “become a major future contributor to sea level rise”, the research states. “We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” said Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University. “But now we recognize a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.” The research provides fresh evidence of the dangers posed to vulnerable coastal places as diverse as Miami, Shanghai, Bangladesh and various Pacific islands as climate change shrinks the world’s land-based ice. “The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect,” Bevis said. “This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point. “We’re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future. Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: how severe does it get?” The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from Nasa’s gravity recovery and climate experiment (known as Grace) and GPS stations scattered across Greenland to analyze changes in ice mass. This showed that Greenland lost about 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually. If all of Greenland’s vast ice sheet, 3km thick in places, was to melt, global sea levels would rise by seven meters, or more than 20ft, drowning most coastal settlements. The rate of loss hasn’t been even, however, with the ice melting four times faster in 2013 compared with 2003. Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland. The fate of Greenland’s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island’s south-west may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater. Scientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere. Arctic ice loss has tripled since the 1980s, with melting in places such as Greenland and Alaska providing the greatest instigator of sea level rise while destabilizing the very ground underneath 4 million people’s feet. Antarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world’s largest expanse of ice is now losing about 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070. Should the entire west Antarctic ice sheet collapse, sea levels would balloon by around 3.5m, albeit over a lengthy timeframe. “We are warming the planet, this is melting ice, and that is raising sea level,” said Richard Alley, a geologist and glacier expert at Pennsylvania State University. Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise “if the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected”."
"Americans’ concerns about climate change have surged to record levels, new polling shows, following a year marked by devastating storms, wildfires and increasingly dire warnings from scientists. A total of 72% of polled Americans now say global warming is personally important to them, according to the Yale program on climate change communication. This is the highest level of concern since Yale starting polling the question in 2008. Overall, 73% of Americans accept that global warming is happening, outnumbering those who don’t by five to one. This acceptance has strengthened in recent years, rising by 10% since March 2015. The proportion that grasps that humans are the primary cause of warming is smaller, with 62% understanding this to be the case. About two-thirds of Americans believe that global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures. “Global warming used to be viewed as a problem distant in time and space,” said report co-lead researcher Ed Maibach, a climate change and public health communications expert at George Mason University. “But Americans increasingly understand that global warming is here and now and are growing concerned about the threat to themselves, their communities and the nation.” The Yale polling, which was conducted in November and December, is backed by findings from separate new research by the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That poll found similarly wide acceptance that climate change is happening, among seven in 10 Americans. A stark political divide on the science still exists, however: while 86% of Democrats say climate change is happening, just 52% of Republicans concur. Climate change has become an increasingly animating cause for progressive Democrats, with campaigning by emerging grassroots groups and figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected congresswoman from New York, pushing for a “Green New Deal”. While this concept has yet to be fully fleshed out, its broad goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy has energized younger activists and has gained a foothold among established Democrats. The sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. A landmark United Nations report from last year warned that the world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs."
"Scientists have found the remains of tiny, ancient animals in an Antarctic lake that has lain undisturbed for thousands of years beneath a kilometre-thick slab of ice. The surprise haul of dead crustaceans and tardigrades, also known as “water bears” or “moss piglets”, was made by US researchers on a rare mission to drill into the Mercer subglacial lake which lies nearly 400 miles from the south pole.  David Harwood, a researcher at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a member of the Salsa (Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access) expedition, told the journal Nature that finding carcasses of the small animals – they range in size from 0.1mm to 1.5mm – was “fully unexpected”. Scientists made the discovery when they inspected mud scraped off an instrument they had lowered into the lake’s icy waters. As expected, the mud contained remnants of photosynthetic algae that lived and died in the area millions of years ago when Antarctica was much warmer. But the mud also contained the bodies of other, more recent creatures. Researchers found eight-legged tardigrades, the speckled shell of a shrimp-like crustacean with legs dangling from it, and a second shell still bristling with delicate hairs. What at first looked like worms in the mud turned out to be the tendrils of a plant or fungus. Aware that the creatures might have contaminated other equipment, the scientists cleaned their kit and lowered it into the lake once more. When they hoisted it up and analysed the mud a second time, they found more of the same remains. It is not clear how the organisms came to be in the ice-covered lake, but scientists believe that they may have lived in nearby ponds and streams during warm periods when the glaciers retreated either 10,000 or 120,000 years ago. One possibility is that the creatures washed into the lake through rivers under the ice. Alternatively, they may have been carried in after becoming stuck to the underside of an encroaching glacier. Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College and head of the Lake Ellsworth Consortium, a UK project that aims to explore a subglacial lake under the ice of west Antarctica, said it was “a lovely finding”. He said: “It hints that life may exist in more complex forms than thought previously underneath the massive ice sheet in Antarctica.” Siegert said more work was needed to establish whether the organisms had been flushed into the lake from upstream – suggesting there was life under the middle of the Antarctic ice sheet – or from the sea, or by some other route. “Each of these would be intriguing,” he said. Sandra McInnes, an expert in tardigrades at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “If they can get DNA out of these remains, that would be fantastic.” If the tardigrade DNA perfectly matches that of species alive today, then scientists will suspect the animal was carried into the lake on contaminated drill equipment. But the DNA may be far older and indicate an ancient relative of a modern species. Genetic analysis might also confirm whether it was a marine or terrestrial creature, McInnes said. So far, nothing has been pulled alive from the Mercer subglacial lake. With so much ice overhead, too little light may reach the water to sustain organisms such as photosynthetic algae. But Byron Adams, a researcher at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, told Nature that he still hoped to find something that had set up home in the lake. “It’s possible that you could still find things that are alive,” he said."
"European colonization of the Americas resulted in the killing of so many native people that it transformed the environment and caused the Earth’s climate to cool down, new research has found. Settlers killed off huge numbers of people in conflicts and also by spreading disease, which reduced the indigenous population by 90% in the century following Christopher Columbus’s initial journey to the Americas and Caribbean in 1492.  This “large-scale depopulation” resulted in vast tracts of agricultural land being left untended, researchers say, allowing the land to become overgrown with trees and other new vegetation. The regrowth soaked up enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to actually cool the planet, with the average temperature dropping by 0.15C in the late 1500s and early 1600s, the study by scientists at University College London found. “The great dying of the indigenous peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth system in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution,” wrote the UCL team of Alexander Koch, Chris Brierley, Mark Maslin and Simon Lewis. The drop in temperature during this period is known as the “Little Ice Age”, a time when the River Thames in London would regularly freeze over, snowstorms were common in Portugal and disrupted agriculture caused famines in several European countries. The UCL researchers found that the European colonization of the Americas indirectly contributed to this colder period by causing the deaths of about 56 million people by 1600. The study attributes the deaths to factors including introduced disease, such as smallpox and measles, as well as warfare and societal collapse. Researchers then calculated how much land indigenous people required and then subsequently fell into disuse, finding that around 55m hectares, an area roughly equivalent to France, became vacant and was reclaimed by carbon dioxide-absorbing vegetation. The study sketches out a past where humans were influencing the climate long before the industrial revolution, where the use of fossil fuels for the manufacturing of goods, generation of electricity and transportation has allowed tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. Widespread deforestation for agriculture and urban development has also spurred the release of greenhouse gases, causing the planet to warm by around 1C over the past century. Scientists have warned that the world has little over a decade to drastically reduce emissions or face increasingly severe storms, drought, heatwaves, coastal flooding and food insecurity. The revegetation of the Americas after European arrival aided declines of global carbon content in the air, dropping by around seven to 10 parts of carbon dioxide for every million molecules of air in the atmosphere. This compares to the 3ppm of carbon dioxide that humanity is currently adding to the atmosphere every year through the burning of fossil fuels. “There is a lot of talk around ‘negative emissions’ approaching and using tree-planting to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,” study co-author Chris Brierley told the BBC. “And what we see from this study is the scale of what’s required, because the great dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few parts per million. “This is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate.”"
"Our house is on fire. I am here to say, our house is on fire. According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50%. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale. Nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. And on climate change, we have to acknowledge we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so, and the media has failed to create broad public awareness. But Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases. Either we do that or we don’t. You say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5C of warming or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control or we don’t. Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. We all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. Some say we should not engage in activism. Instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just vote for a change instead. But what do we do when there is no political will? What do we do when the politics needed are nowhere in sight? Here in Davos – just like everywhere else – everyone is talking about money. It seems money and growth are our only main concerns. And since the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences on our everyday life. People are not aware that there is such a thing as a carbon budget, and just how incredibly small that remaining carbon budget is. That needs to change today. No other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide, public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budget, that should and must become our new global currency and the very heart of our future and present economics. We are at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilisation – and the entire biosphere – must speak out in clear language, no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be. We must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility. Adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is. This is an edited version of a speech given by Greta Thunberg at Davos this week."
"David Attenborough might have urged world leaders at Davos to take urgent action on climate change, but it appears no one was listening. As he spoke, experts predicted up to 1,500 individual private jets will fly to and from airfields serving the Swiss ski resort this week. Political and business leaders and lobbyists are opting for bigger, more expensive aircrafts, according to analysis by the Air Charter Service, which found the number of private jet flights grew by 11% last year.  “There appears to be a trend towards larger aircraft, with expensive heavy jets the aircraft of choice, with Gulfstream GVs and Global Expresses both being used more than 100 times each last year,” said Andy Christie, private jets director at the ACS. This is partly due to the long distances travelled, he said, “but also possibly due to business rivals not wanting to be seen to be outdone by one another”. Last year, more than 1,300 aircraft flights were recorded at the conference, the highest number since ACS began recording private jet activity in 2013. Countries with the highest number of arrivals and departures out of the local airports over the past five years included Germany, France, UK, US, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, according to ACS. The World Economic Forum disputed ACS’s analysis. . Oliver Cann, of the World Economic Forum, said: “We have been offering incentives to participants to use public transport for some years. We also ask that they share planes if they have to use them; something that has been gaining popularity in recent years.” The World Economic Forum’s global risk report, released ahead of this week’s meeting, identified environmental challenges, including the failure to mitigate climate change, as top of the list of dangers facing the world economy. On Monday, broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough warned that “the Garden of Eden is no more”, and urged political and business leaders to make a renewed push to tackle climate change. “We have changed the world so much that scientists claim we are in a new geological age, the anthropocene, the age of humans,” he said. “What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” added Attenborough, who received a Crystal award from the WEF for his work. Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way.” • This article was updated on 23 January to incorporate a response from the World Economic Forum"
"On a dank day in January, a small slice of Walsall is blooming. Marie and Tony Newton’s back garden is filled with summery colour: miniature mauve cyclamens, frilly red camellias, graceful hellebores, seasonal snowdrops and the bright green sheaths of bulbs promising more flowers to come. A few winters back, their first daffodil bloomed on Boxing Day. “It’s basically chaotic,” says Tony of the new climatic normal. “It’s non-stop flowers from now on. Winters are milder on average and there’s every opportunity to have a riot of lovely flowers from December right through till spring.”  Deadly floods in Bangladesh, devastating wildfires in California, melting glaciers in Greenland, coral bleaching in the oceans – this is climate change in action. Highlighting far more benign changes in Britain, long blessed with a moderate climate, may appear trivial or downright insensitive. Our gentle extremes – the beast from the east, or summer 2018 being England’s hottest ever – are far from drastic. But they still pose challenges, and there is more change coming. Britain’s 27 million gardeners could be the canaries in our coalmine. How are gardeners experiencing climate change in Britain and how is it transforming our gardens? And can adapting our gardening styles mitigate the negative impacts of climate change? Marie and Tony couldn’t see their garden when they first viewed the house in 1982 because it was covered by a snowdrift. In the years since, as their south-facing quarter-acre evolved from a children’s play-space to a “four-seasons garden” with an all-year-round rainbow of flowers, shrubs and trees, they have witnessed the Midlands climate become steadily milder. Autumn frosts are much later, if they strike at all, and September is a summer month now. Their begonias continue until October. “That would never have happened in the past; we’d barely get through September without air frosts,” says Tony. “Although it’s warming up, you’ve got to plan for the extremes. We’re still going to get very severe winters and it will wipe out many gardeners’ new species.” They know about this only too well. Their garden features a jungle area of bamboo, palm trees, a banana tree and the stumps of several Tasmanian tree ferns. These ferns survived the winter of 2009, the coldest for 30 years, but a run of -15C nights and sub-zero days the following December killed them off. “It’s a mortgage to replace them,” grimaces Marie. Climate change is encouraging many gardeners to buy exotic plants but “we still need truly hardy varieties,” says Tony. Their banana is wrapped in black cloth over winter. He ensures that whenever they add a shrub to the 3,000 in their garden it can survive at -15C.  Marie and Tony’s garden fared better during last summer’s drought. Their clay soils retain moisture, which helps, but they didn’t lose a single plant to the weather, despite being on holiday for two weeks. This may be because they are obsessive mulchers. Mulch is material added to the surface of the soil to increase organic matter and repress weeds. The Newtons have added 108 cubic metres of tree bark to their soil over the years; each year they also compost all their garden leaves and cuttings, reapplying this to their soil. This organic matter has steadily improved soil quality and, crucially, helps it retain moisture. When Liam Shoesmith, deputy parks manager of Truro city council, saw how dry 2018 summer’s long-term forecast looked, he suggested the city’s gardeners should plant succulents and cacti for their Britain in Bloom competition entry. “It was a bit of a joke really,” he says. But the community group that organises Truro’s displays took his advice. In what the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) described as the “toughest year for community gardening in 54 years”, Truro’s blend of exotic, drought-tolerant plants, including palms and Mediterranean herbs, serviced by a solar-powered rainwater-harvesting system, thrived. And Truro won the Britain in Bloom competition for the first time. Shoesmith is currently dispatching his team to mow parkland grass: milder winters mean Truro’s grass grows all year round. He began gardening as a boy in the 1980s. “It’s definitely milder and wetter,” he says. “The difficult thing we have with the climate is the more changeable weather. Last winter was probably one of the wettest on record here and then we went into one of the driest summers. The capricious nature of the weather is very hard to anticipate and work with.” We don’t think of mild winters as extreme weather events, but December 2015 was the most anomalous month ever recorded, 5.1C above average, and the warmest in the Met Office’s central England temperature dataset, which stretches back to 1659. Shoesmith notices how pollinating insects, such as solitary bees, often emerge during these mild midwinters. If there are no flowers, and no nectar, they will perish. “Climate change is a big issue and as gardeners we can all do our bit to help by planting the garden so it’s flowering throughout the year,” he says. “We all want that anyway.” Wildlife-friendly gardening focuses on native flowers, but Shoesmith argues we have long had non-native plants – particularly in milder Cornwall – and many exotic species are just as attractive to pollinators. In general, Britain’s 400,000 garden plant species provide genetic diversity, enabling more selection and breeding to adapt to future extremes. But Shoesmith also has a motto – “don’t go silly buying too much frilly” – because certain varieties of exotic flowers with lots of petals lose their nectar-holding sexual organs and so become useless for pollinators. Daisies, aconites, crocus, hellebores are good for winter-waking bees. Allotment holders are also adapting to the increasingly capricious climate. Mandy Barber has turned to growing perennial produce on her plot in Ashburton, Devon. “Annual vegetables needed a lot more watering and it was touch and go whether they would make it last summer, but perennial vegetables have a lot more resilience to temperature changes,” she says. Barber is experimenting with crops including Taunton Deane kale; poireau perpétuel, a perennial leek; and Hablitzia tamnoides, or Caucasian spinach, which is grown in Scandinavia and can survive -25C. “The Hablitzia tamnoides plants go on for decades, they are like a rampant triffid, but you get a crop between February and June every year and the leaves are a bit like baby spinach,” says Barber. She also propagates and sells these perennials. Every gardener I speak to agrees that milder winters are enabling more pests to survive and encouraging new pest species. Allan Trigg has been growing vegetables for more than 40 years and has an allotment in Chelmsford, Essex. “This is my little patch of England,” he smiles. Fewer frosts means his fellow allotment holders plant out runner beans, sweetcorn and potatoes earlier. With an extended growing season, Trigg can grow more, and second crops, although last year he grew less because he was spending so much time watering his vegetables. The dry weather produced lower yields of crops such as potatoes. After 2017, his potatoes lasted him and his wife through to February; this winter, they were eaten by November. And allium leaf miner and leek moth are a growing problem. “I used to grow loads of leeks but now I don’t bother,” he says. He pulls one up to show the damage below ground. “We never used to have this trouble years ago.” In Walsall the Newtons are accepting of their growing losses to pests such as the lily beetle and the lace bug. “It went absolutely berserk after the hot summer,” says Tony. “I thought it was going to kill all the plants in the garden.” Barber is beset by voles (which survive the milder winters), while in Cornwall, Shoesmith has noticed the spread of fuchsia gall mite along the hedges. “It had the opportunity to come to Britain for decades, but only arrived this century because of the milder winters,” he says. “We don’t have the same amount of frosts now and so we get many more fungal problems.” These observations precisely match the more scientific language of Gardening in a Changing Climate, a 2017 RHS report that outlines the challenges – milder winters, more unpredictable extremes and more pests – posed by climate change. But the RHS also asks how gardeners might help save the planet. The way we garden is still sometimes part of the problem – using precious water in pursuit of a perfect lawn during a drought springs to mind – but it can be part of the solution. Gardeners can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mitigate pollution and flooding, and help increase their neighbourhood’s resilience. “Water use in gardens is going to be a major issue in the future,” says Alistair Griffith, director of science at the RHS. London is forecast to require 100m litres a day more than it can supply in 2020, with this deficit rising to 400m litres a day by 2040. The use of energy-intensive mains water on gardens is still socially acceptable and Britain lags behind more water-stressed countries where grey-water recycling is commonplace. But hosepipe bans could become perpetual for some regions in coming decades. Apart from using only rainwater – even a small balcony can catch and store rainwater with a mini-reservoir – Griffith recommends gardeners provide “as much greenery as possible”. He suggests planting hedges instead of fencing and planting trees. Trees not only dispel pollution but can alleviate flash flooding and provide shade for a home during heatwaves. Perhaps the most overlooked way gardening can benefit the climate is via the soil: adding organic matter (mulch from home-composting, not peat) can create a soil that stores more carbon and retains more water, also making gardens more resilient in flood and droughts. Griffith’s final practical suggestion for climate-friendly gardening is to make everything permeable. Unfortunately, paving gardens for parking continues (in 2015, the RHS found that the number of paved, plant-free front gardens had tripled in 10 years from 1.5m to 4.6m). Even car park gardens can be permeable and planted with trees and shrubs around the edge. But, according to Griffith, people resist, citing a lack of time and a nervousness about failing at gardening. “Gardening is always trial and error,” he says. “Give it a go.” Gardening won’t stop climate change, but it could make our local communities more resilient when faced with extreme floods, heat – and mild weather. In troubled times, it is also a fundamentally optimistic gesture."

"One of the oft forgotten aspects of the ALP’s 2007 election campaign was that for the first time since losing the 1996 election it stopped being afraid of the Hawke-Keating legacy. After years of being worried of the tainted brush of high interest rates and recession, it embraced their reforms and dared the Coalition to run its scare campaign about interest rates and economic management in the face of concerns about economic ructions occurring overseas. So wedded was the Coalition to these scare tactics that, in the run-up to the 2013 election, it was still saying interest rates would always be lower under the Liberal party, even though the cash rate was then over 4% points lower than it had been when the Howard government lost office.  It’s a good reminder that reality will never stop the scare campaign, and that the Coalition is very slow to change – it will keep banging out its fear until well after anyone has stopped caring or listening. 2007 was also a good year for the ALP to push the issue of climate change. The nation was in drought and the push to reduce emissions and be active on the international stage was prominent. This year economic ructions overseas are again present and so too is a drought and the need to take action on climate change. And where the 2007 opposition stopped being afraid of the economic legacy of the last ALP government so too should the current opposition not run from the climate change policies of the Gillard government. Because, as interest rates showed, regardless of the ALP’s policy, you can be sure the Coalition will keep shouting about carbon tax bogeymen. It’s always amazing how things repeat themselves. Now, a decade on from the GFC, the worrying signs from overseas are there again just as we see the ALP looking set to take office. The yield for US five-year treasury bonds is now lower than for one-year bonds – suggesting investors believe the economy is going to get worse. This doesn’t necessarily indicate than the US will go into a recession, it’s just that when bond yields acted this way at the end of the 1960s, in the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and before the GFC, a recession followed every time. But hey, I’m sure Donald Trump will respond in a calm and well-thought-out way. And while we remain more dependent upon China than the US, it too is showing signs of concern. The Chinese government has responded to the ructions of the trade war with the US by injecting $83bn into its financial system to avoid a credit crunch. That our largest trading partner is having to inject a record amount of money into its financial system does not exactly bring Marie Kondo levels of joy. The Commonwealth Bank’s senior currency strategist, Joseph Capurso, suggests that “China’s economic miracle is over” and that its annual GDP growth will fall to around 4% over the next decade rather than the current average level of 6.5%. This does not mean Australia is about to head into a recession – we are a very long way from such a thing. But it does serve as a reminder that projections of glorious revenue and growth that were found in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook over the next 10 years are rather hopeful. It is now so long since the last recession that no one under 45 has really experienced it in their working life. Such a long stretch of time can lead to complacency and the type of dumb commentary that suggests “we need a recession to ...” Recessions wreak destruction on families and lives. To measure them I prefer to focus on employment rather than GDP growth. In the 1990s recession the percentage of the adult population employed fell 3.2% points in 18 months – the equivalent of 400,000 fewer people in work. In recessions, masses of people in their 50s lose work and never return to the labour force. The overall unemployment rate rose from 6% at the start of 1990 to above 10% within two years; for men aged 55-64 it went from 6% to 14% in four years. In the space of a year, real household disposable income fell on average by 2%. Recessions are horrific. And while we should not talk ourselves into such a negative condition, the chances are that whoever is in power for the next three to five years will likely have to deal with an international economic slowdown. That does focus the mind, and yet what should also be at the forefront of our brains is another issue high on the agenda in 2007 – climate change. Back in 2007 we were suffering from a drought, there was a push to reduce emissions and competing ways to do it as well as a desire from within the LNP to ignore international agreements. Climate change policy became an election issue in 2007 because it fit with the new versus old difference of Rudd and Howard, and people could feel the change in the drought and heatwaves. Now people feel it still and also see it in the dying fish and terrible water management of the federal and the New South Wales governments. And they can see it in the division and idiocy that the government displays on climate change. Climate change is now an issue that doesn’t so much differentiate old versus new thinking as it does between parties that are able to think with those utterly incapable of doing so. And on this issue the ALP, like it did in 2007 with economics, should embrace its past. Forget stale arguments over whether or not Rudd or the Greens did the right thing with the ETS. The Gillard government did introduce a carbon price – and it worked. It brought with it the long-term stability companies and their lobbyists such as the BCA now say they so desire. It reduces emissions. The carbon price did not lose the election. It was lost because the ALP was a basket case of a party so riven with discord that the electorate voted for someone so disliked as was Tony Abbott to be prime minister. For now, the ALP is adopting a measured approach to emissions – focusing on electricity but fearfully doing all it can not to utter carbon and price (let alone tax) in the same sentence. And maybe a copy of the Gillard carbon price is not achievable now, but they should not cower – because regardless what they do the Coalition will cry “carbon tax”. Now, like 2007, is a time in which the electorate can feel the need for action. It needs to be grasped. And it is not a time to be fearful. Given the economic ructions accruing, the easy way is to play safe and seek caution, but that will achieve nothing except someone in a decade’s time noting once again we’re in an election year during a time of drought and a country without a decent climate change policy. Only by then it will be far too late."
"“Why?” is the question I’ve had from friends and family when I’ve told them I’m running for the seat of Kooyong in the next federal election. It’s a good question but perhaps not the right one. Politics in Australia, as it currently operates, isn’t something immediately appealing to anyone in their right mind. I’ve had a successful business career; my kids are all but grown-up.  But the time has come when I’m compelled to act as the situation we face is so dire, and the quality of the actors so poor, and the unwillingness of the Liberal party to reform is so evident that the right question is “how can you just sit there and not stand?” We have to change the way politics is done in Australia so we can address climate change, restore political integrity and ensure business operates within society’s expectations and not as an entity unto itself. Unfortunately, the current Liberal party has lost the plot. Its failure to deal with these issues threatens to sell out the future of all Australians. Without environmental and public assets and public confidence in our politics we’re unable to deal with a warming climate, a growing and ageing population and an unequal economy. Growing up, I learned what it takes to be elected to parliament, door-knocking Doveton to Kooweerup for my father, the Liberal member for Holt, the late Bill Yates. But despite being a member for most of my life, I am done with this form of the Liberal party. Seeing the now prime minister, Scott Morrison, wave around a lump of coal in parliament, and witnessing a follow-up act with brown coal at a Victorian fundraiser made me angry. Environmentally it’s like waving asbestos. If this is the Liberal party, then it has no place for me. I can’t quite explain what has happened but the Liberal party’s culture is sick. Ten years of negative policy actions have created a black hole around the leadership, surrounding them in impenetrable darkness. They’ve ignored or denied claims of bullying, which is evident to all. Now there’s a flood of cabinet ministers rushing for the backdoor. Family reasons aside, the environment in Canberra within the Liberal party is toxic. Faced with this, and when it is made clear that the “broad church” in Kooyong won’t extend to other Liberals with environmental concerns, the time comes to offer an alternative way so that the people of Kooyong can have a voice and be represented in Canberra. The majority of them want action on climate, fair treatment for asylum seekers, businesses to consider people and the environment, and politicians to act with integrity. Currently they feel let down. The Liberal government’s blindness to the dangers of climate change is sickening. It’s about 28 years since the first international report called on governments to act to reduce carbon emission as a known threat to the environment. Since then, global emissions have risen more than 60%. The current government is delaying action, and encouraging global inaction. We can’t afford that. How can Liberals not see this? The Liberal party put the interests of the coal and fossil fuel industry ahead of just about every other industry, and source of employment, in Australia. Our beautiful reefs, right through to our southern wilderness, are being destroyed as you read this. Our rivers and everything that relies on them are dying. Communities are facing crippling droughts and fires. Meanwhile, the government continue to peddle dangerous nonsense that we need new coal-fired power stations, or talking up Adani. Having run the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and as an investor in renewable projects, I understand the jobs, economic benefits and new industries that can emerge while we reduce pollution. I can’t understand why the Liberal party, which prides itself on its economic credentials, fails to see the economic opportunities. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s recent speech to the Sydney Institute should mark another point of intense disappointment. It highlights how seriously the Liberal party has lost its way. Now its leadership can’t even make moral sense of its own values and belief. Frydenberg said: “Fairness is achieved through equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes”, and “intergenerational equity requires fiscal discipline as the next generation should not have to pick up the tab for the last”. If he seriously believes current Liberal policies reflect these two values, then he is totally deluded. The government’s policies are preventing individuals having “equality of opportunity”. Inequality of wealth is growing. Wealth has a direct relationship with the opportunities an individual has from birth. The outcome will not be fair if government policies fail to address the massive financial inequality individuals face. Policies that constantly increase the benefits of those who can afford to pay versus those less well off layer this government’s thinking. Poor suburbs have poor schools, hospitals and services in contrast to wealthy suburbs. I don’t want an American-style split society. Menzies did not suggest it, and it grinds against the identity I thought we shared as Australians, which had pride in egalitarianism and mateship. Secondly, intergenerational equity applies to the climate and our natural resources not just the budget. Those retiring today are leaving oceans filled with plastic, mines that have not been rehabilitated, soil depleted, ecosystems destroyed and our climate in ruins. The tab is being left to the next generation without care or regard. How a Liberal government cannot see the scale of this is breathtaking. We must return integrity to politics. We need real people with real experience to sit in Canberra. We can’t afford another generation of party hacks who believe politics is a game of numbers, slogans and spin. The public have lost trust in their political leaders. We need an integrity commission, proper political donations reforms and a bill of rights that enshrines what it means to be Australian. And we need to stop ignoring the concerns of Australia’s first people before we can become a mature country. We need a strong business sector that works with society. Currently there are deep cultural problems. Corporations and CEOs are there to act in the collective interests of people. They cannot continue to claim that their only job is to maximise profits. They need to understand that they must act in the same way we expect an individual to act as part of a heathy society that protects and cares for each other. Government and business love free trade. But it doesn’t always benefit the people. My first public run-in with the Howard government was over the US-Australian free-trade agreement. The PM’s office called my employer to suggest it was not in my employers’ best interest that I continue to point out the deficiencies of the agreement. It triggered my disbelief in our politicians, and highlighted our lack of individual rights to speak and debate views, as all citizens must do, if they care about their country. Our trade agreements need to be carefully considered to ensure the benefit for our economy and society. We shouldn’t be signing up to deals that could harm Australia’s economic interests or impose major social costs. I will fight to bring greater transparency to the negotiation of international trade deals and to ensure that the economic and social merits of all future deals are independently assessed by the Productivity Commission before the parliament is asked to vote on them. Having said all that, winning this seat will not be easy. But then again, you never know – moderate Liberal, Greens and Labor electors might welcome the chance to have a member in Canberra that reports to them rather than someone who represents a party most of us cannot understand."
"Growing tension between the world’s major powers is the most urgent global risk and makes it harder to mobilise collective action to tackle climate change, according to a report prepared for next week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The WEF’s annual global risks report found that a year of extreme weather-related events meant environmental issues topped the list of concerns in a survey of around 1,000 experts and decision-makers. But with Donald Trump announcing protectionist measures aimed at China and the European Union in 2018, the report said the international cooperation needed to limit further global warming was breaking down. “Global risks are intensifying but the collective will to tackle them appears to be lacking. Instead, divisions are hardening,” the report said, noting that nine out of 10 people polled said they expected relations between the leading powers to worsen in 2019. “The world’s move into a new phase of strongly state-centred politics, noted in last year’s Global Risks Report, continued throughout 2018.” The global economy slowed in the second-half of 2018 and the report said activity this year would be held back by growing geo-economic tensions, with 88% of respondents expecting further erosion of multilateral trading rules and agreements. Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, said: “With global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation.”  “We simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards. What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today,” he said. Environmental risks continued to dominate the risks report, although there were also long-term concerns about the dangers posed by cybersecurity breaches in the years ahead. The report tracks five environmental risks: biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, man-made disasters, and natural disasters. All five are thought to be in the high-impact, high-likelihood category. The risks report is a collaboration between the WEF, the Zurich Insurance Group and the professional services firm Marsh & McLennan. Alison Martin, group chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said: “2018 was sadly a year of historic wildfires, continued heavy flooding and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. “It is no surprise that in 2019, environmental risks once again dominate the list of major concerns. So, too, does the growing likelihood of environmental policy failure or a lack of timely policy implementation.” Martin said a significant increase in infrastructure was needed to effectively respond to climate change in order to adapt to the new environment and transition to a low-carbon economy. She added: “By 2040, the investment gap in global infrastructure is forecast to reach $18tn against a projected requirement of $97tn. Against this backdrop, we strongly recommend that businesses develop a climate resilience adaptation strategy and act on it now.” Trump’s “America First” agenda has involved pulling the US out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, the introduction of tariffs on imports into the US, the announcement that American troops are being pulled out of Syria and the decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. The risks report said: “Reconfiguring the relations of deeply integrated countries is fraught with potential risks, and trade and investment relations among many of the world’s powers were difficult during 2018. “Against this backdrop, it is likely to become more difficult to make collective progress on other global challenges – from protecting the environment to responding to the ethical challenges of the fourth industrial revolution.”"

"As we are starting to see the effects of climate change materialise in front of our eyes, people are looking for things they can do to help heal our planet. One common theme has been a call to stop eating meat, mainly due to methane emissions from cows. This is a simple answer, but I suggest it is an answer to the wrong question.  How did nature get things so horribly wrong when she allowed cows to evolve? After all, they are evil weapons of climate destruction, aren’t they? Let’s start with a few basics. Cows are ruminant animals. This means they have a multi-chambered stomach, one part of which is called a rumen. This is a fermentation vat containing billions of microbes breaking down the plants the animal eats. As part of this process, some of these microbes produce methane. Lots of animals produce some methane, including horses, dogs, termites, people and even kangaroos. Ruminants evolved 50 million years ago, and today there are almost 200 different species. So ruminant animals have a rich ecological diversity and a long evolutionary history. Other ruminants include the American elk, Chinese goral, Himalayan tahr, Japanese serow, Reindeer, Siberian ibex, water buffalo and yak. There are mountain, marsh, snow and swamp ruminants. There are American, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, even Siberian ruminants. If nature got it wrong when she allowed ruminants to evolve, she got it wrong at a global scale. But maybe she didn’t get it wrong after all? Maybe it’s not her, maybe it’s us? Instead of asking “What do we humans need to do to reduce ruminant methane emissions?”, we should be asking “What have we humans done that has so unbalanced the natural methane cycle?” Bacteria that “eat” methane live in healthy, properly managed soils beneath the feet of healthy, properly managed livestock. (Remember, nature doesn’t do “waste”.) These methane-eating bacteria (methanotrophs) act as a balance to the methane produced by the methane generating bacteria (methanogens) in the rumens of the livestock above ground. This is the missing part of the natural methane cycle that we need to restore. I believe there is a massive difference between “livestock” and “properly managed livestock”. As soon as we take grazing animals off grass and put them into a feedlot or confinement dairy, we have severed their link to the land. This means that we have now prevented nature from doing what she does best, which is utilise any “waste”, cycle and reuse nutrients, and balance the system.  When we manage livestock properly, out on grass and respecting the natural relationship between soils, grasses and grazing animals, we get a cleaner, fresher and properly balanced production system. We get healthy ecosystems, healthy animals, healthy people. If we start asking the right questions instead of the wrong ones, the answers begin to matter. The answer to reducing our impact on the climate is not to stop eating meat, it is to properly manage land and livestock. Tony Lovell actively manages land and livestock to regenerate ecosystems and produce positive financial, social, and environmental outcomes. His goal is to profitably leave all land he manages in better condition each year"

"The fall lasts long enough that I have time to watch the blue ice race upward, aeons of time compressed into glacial ice, flashing by in fractions of seconds. I assume I’ve fallen far enough that I’ve pulled my climbing partner, Sean, into the crevasse with me. This is what it’s like to die in the mountains, a voice in my head tells me. Just as my mind completes that thought, the rope wrenches my climbing harness up. I bounce languidly up and down as the dynamic physics inherent in the rope play themselves out. Somehow Sean has checked my fall while still on the surface of the glacier.  I brush the snow and chunks of ice from my hair, arms and chest and pull down the sleeves of my shirt. Finding my glacier glasses hanging from the pocket of my climbing bib, I tuck them away. I check myself for injuries and, incredibly, find none. Assessing my situation, I find there’s no ice shelf nearby to ease the tension from the rope, so Sean will not be able to begin setting up a pulley system to extract me. I look down. Nothing but blackness. I look at the wall of blue ice directly in front of me, take a deep breath and peer up at the tiny hole I made when I fell through the snow bridge spanning the crevasse – the same bridge Sean had crossed without incident as we made our way up Alaska’s Matanuska Glacier towards Mount Marcus Baker in the Chugach Range. “You get to look down one more time, then that’s it,” I tell myself out loud. Again, there’s only the black void yawning beneath me, swallowing everything, even sound. My stomach clenches. I remind myself to breathe. “Sean, are you OK?” I yell as I clamp my mechanical ascenders to the rope in preparation to climb up. “Yeah, I’m all right, but I’m right on the edge,” he calls back. “I can’t set up an anchor, so we’re just going to have to wait for the other guys to catch up.” Time passes. The onset of hypothermia means I can’t control my body from periodically shaking. To ignore my fear of dying, I gaze meditatively at the ice a few feet in front of me as I dangle. The miniature air pockets found in the whiter ice near the top of the glacier have long since been compressed, producing the mesmerising beauty of centuries-old turquoise ice. Slightly deeper into the crevasse is ice that has been there since long before the Neanderthals. I hang suspended in silence, mindful not to move for fear of dislodging Sean. Giving my full attention to the ice immediately within my vision, I focus on how the gently refracting light from above seems to penetrate and reflect off the perfectly smooth wall. Staring into it, the blue seems infinite. Despite the danger of my situation, the glacier’s beauty calms me. Eventually our two other teammates arrive and work to extract Sean from his perch just six inches from the edge of the crevasse. The three of them set up a three-way pulley system. Laboriously, my teammates begin to haul me up, inches at a time, out of what nearly became my tomb. I continue to focus on the delicately shifting shades of blue in the ice as I draw closer to the surface. My teammates pull me up to the lip of the crevasse. I repeatedly plunge the pick of my ice axe into the snow and haul myself out, never before as grateful for being on top of a glacier. I stand and gaze up at a mountain to the west, behind which the sun has just set. Snow plumes stream off one of its ridges, turned into red ribbons by the setting sun. Snowflakes flicker as they float into space. As relief floods my shivering body, I roar in gratitude. Utterly overwhelmed by being alive and surrounded by the beauty of the mountain world, I hug each of my three climbing partners. Now that I am safe, it sinks in just how close to death I’ve been. That was 22 April 2003 – Earth Day. In hindsight, I believe the emotion I felt then stemmed in part from something else – a deeper consciousness that the ice I had seen was vanishing. Seven years of climbing in Alaska had provided me with a front-row seat from where I could witness the dramatic impact of human-caused climate disruption. Each year, we found that the toe of the glacier had shrivelled further. Each year, for the annual early season ice-climbing festival on this glacier, we found ourselves hiking further up the crusty frozen mud left behind by its rapidly retreating terminus. Each year, the parking lot was moved closer to the glacier, only to be left farther away as the ice withdrew. Even sections of Denali – the highest mountain in North America, which stands more than 20,000 feet tall and is roughly 250 miles from the Arctic Circle – had already undergone startling changes in 2003: the ice of its glaciers was disappearing quickly. Our planet is rapidly changing, and what we are witnessing is unlike anything that has occurred in human, or even geological, history. The heat-trapping nature of CO2 and methane, both greenhouse gases, has been scientific fact for decades, and according to Nasa, “no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response”. Evidence shows that greenhouse gas emissions are causing the Earth to warm 10 times faster than it should, and the ramifications of this are being felt, quite literally, throughout the entire biosphere. Oceans are warming at unprecedented rates, droughts and wildfires of increasing severity and frequency are altering forests around the globe, and the Earth’s cryosphere – the parts of the Earth so cold that water is frozen into ice or snow – is melting at an ever-accelerating rate. The subsea permafrost in the Arctic is thawing, and we could experience a methane “burp” of previously trapped gas at any moment, causing the equivalent of several times the total amount of CO2 humans have emitted to be released into the atmosphere. The results would be catastrophic. Climate disruption also brings with it extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods. For instance, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to an increase in the frequency of severe major rain events, such as Hurricane Harvey over Houston in summer 2017, which dropped so much rain that the weight of the water actually caused the Earth’s crust to sink by 2cm. Earth has not seen current atmospheric CO2 levels since the Pliocene epoch, some 3m years ago. Three-quarters of that CO2 will still be here in 500 years. It takes a decade to experience the full warming effects of CO2 emissions. Even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions, it would take another 25,000 years for most of what is currently in the atmosphere to be absorbed into the oceans. Climate disruption is progressing faster than ever, and faster than predicted. Seventeen of the 18 hottest years ever recorded have occurred since 2001. The distress signals from our overheated planet are all around us, with reports, studies and warnings increasing daily. Worst-case prediction made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the rise in temperatures, extreme weather, sea levels and CO2 levels in the atmosphere have fallen short of reality. Countless glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests and species are already vanishing at a pace never seen before, and all of this from increasing the global mean temperature by “only” 1C above the preindustrial baseline. Some scientists predict it could rise by as much as 10C by 2100. A study led by James Hansen, the former director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, warned that the rise we have seen so far has already caused unstoppable melting in both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Mountaineering in today’s climate-disrupted world is a vastly different endeavour from what it used to be. Glaciers are vanishing before our eyes, having shrunk to the lowest levels ever recorded, and are now melting faster than ever. Seventy per cent of the glaciers in western Canada are projected to be gone by 2100. Montana’s Glacier National Park will most likely not have any active glaciers by 2030. The Matanuska Glacier’s ancient ice is already rapidly vanishing. Dramatic changes are occurring even in the planet’s highest and coldest places. Even Mount Everest is transforming, as thousands of glaciers across the Himalayas are likely to shrink by up to 99% by 2100. A child born today will see an Everest largely free of glaciers within their lifetime. I lived in Alaska for a decade beginning in 1996, and spent time on the glaciers there. As early as the late 90s, large portions of the holiday season would go by in Anchorage without any snow on the ground. The waterfalls that my climbing friends and I had used for ice climbing barely froze some winters, and we could see the glaciers that we used to traverse to access peaks shrinking from year to year. In Nepal the sacred mountain Machapuchare rises abruptly on the eastern boundary of the Annapurna Sanctuary. As a child I came across a photograph of this peak in a geography textbook and was immediately captivated by its majesty. Shaped like a fish’s tail, the knife-edged ridge that forms its summit is a seemingly paper-thin line of rock that drops precipitously on either side, causing the apex of the peak – which is nearly half a mile higher than the top of Denali – to be one of the more dramatic summits anywhere. It is a masterpiece of nature. When I was 10 years old, I saw the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for the first time, their silhouettes against the setting sun, and I was awestruck. Years later I travelled to Alaska and drove a short way into Denali national park and preserve. When the afternoon clouds parted to reveal the majesty of Denali’s summit, my first inclination was to bow in wonderment. A year after that I moved to Alaska, and began training myself in the mountaineering skills I needed to access these sanctuaries that stand far from the violence, speed and greed of society. John Muir, the Scottish-American naturalist, author, philosopher and early wilderness-preservation advocate, captured my feelings precisely: “I am losing precious days. I am degenerating into a machine for making money. I am learning nothing in this trivial world of men. I must break away and get out into the mountains to learn the news.” A glacier is essentially suspended energy, suspended force. It is, in a sense, life frozen in time. But now they are themselves running out of time. The planet’s ecosystems, pushed far beyond their capacity to adapt to human-generated traumas and stresses, are in a state of freefall. Just as I watched hundreds of years of time compressed into glacial ice flash before my eyes in a matter of seconds as I fell into the crevasse, swathes of the natural world are, in the blink of a geological eye, falling into oblivion. Modern life has compressed time and space. You can traverse the globe in a matter of hours, or gain information in nanoseconds. The price for this, along with everything we want, on demand, all the time, is a total disconnection from the planet that sustains our lives. I venture into the wilds and into the mountains in large part to allow space and time to stretch themselves back to what they were. The frenetic pace of contemporary life is having a devastating impact on this planet. Humans have transformed more than half the ice-free land on Earth. We have changed the composition of the atmosphere and the chemistry of the oceans from which we came. We now use more than half the planet’s readily accessible freshwater runoff, and the majority of the world’s major rivers have been either dammed or diverted. As a species, we now hang over the abyss of a geoengineered future we have created for ourselves. At our insistence, our voracious appetite is consuming nature itself. We have refused to heed the warnings Earth has been sending, and there is no rescue team on its way. At the end of July 2017 I flew to Alaska’s northern shore. A couple of days after my arrival I took a morning walk along the Arctic Ocean. The only thing that was a constant was the shore beneath my boots and the crunching sound of the tiny stones as I walked. Up here, only 1,300 miles from the north pole, the sun never sets in summer, and time stretches until it loses its meaning. Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), one of several ancient villages in the area, is the northernmost incorporated point in the US. The indigenous people here, the Iñupiat, have learned to live on the edge of the tundra and the seas, with the whales, the birds and the ice floes. I met 55-year-old Marvin Kanayurak, who was born and raised here, as were his parents. He is a whaler and volunteers doing rescues. He tells me how there used to be pressure ridges in the sea ice (formed when two ice floes are forced together) during the winter that were 50 or even 60 feet high, but now they are “lucky” to find any even 20 feet tall. Heading out across the ice to find open water in the spring used to take them two weeks of plotting and making a trail. Now it takes them only a couple of days because the open water is so much closer. Kanayurak had told me that he was a volunteer gravedigger. The permafrost used to be 10-12 inches below the surface, so it would take three days of chipping with an ice pick to dig a grave. Now the permafrost is several feet below the surface, and softer, so he can dig a grave in a few hours. Permafrost is a layer of ground that is continuously frozen for a period of two years or more. It contains dead plants that absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere centuries ago, and then froze before decomposing. When it thaws, microbial activity converts a large portion of that organic material into methane and CO2, which is released back into the atmosphere. According to a Nasa report, over hundreds of millennia, “Arctic permafrost soils have accumulated vast stores of organic carbon” – an estimated 1,400-1,850 gigatonnes, compared to 850 gigatonnes of carbon in Earth’s atmosphere. That’s equal to around half of all the estimated organic carbon in Earth’s soils, with most of it located in the top 10 feet of thaw-vulnerable soil. Scientists, along with others, are learning that the Arctic permafrost is less permanent than its name implies. Estimates of how much carbon will be released by thawing permafrost show it could average around 1.5bn tonnes annually, which is roughly the same amount as current US annual emissions from burning fossil fuels. Dr Kevin Schaefer, a research scientist for the National Snow and Ice Data Center who studies permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) – the warming of the surface of the planet that would result from the release of carbon from the permafrost – estimates that PCF by itself will increase temperatures by 0.2C by 2100, and even more beyond that. This means PCF will have a significant effect on the long-term climate, even if the goal of limiting atmospheric temperatures to 2C is reached. While I was in Utqiagvik I spoke to Dr Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who also specialises in permafrost. His lab has been collecting temperature data each year in many locations around the world, but mostly across Alaska, Canada and Russia. “If it comes closer to thawing point, then it becomes unstable,” Romanovsky said. “For any permafrost research, that is the crucial data: what is the temperature and how stable is it?” His lab is unique in that it now has nearly 40 years of data records from a variety of locations, and he generates permafrost temperature modelling to explain how the temperatures are changing. The changes in the permafrost happening across Alaska’s North Slope are due to some of the most dramatic temperature increases in the world. In 35 years of measurements here, the temperature at 20 metres below the ground has increased by 3C since Romanovsky’s first measurement, and at the surface of the permafrost one metre below the ground, the average temperature has increased by a staggering 5C since the mid-1980s. Even small increases bring the temperature of the permafrost closer to 0C. Crossing that line means the permafrost will start to thaw. Scientists used to believe the permafrost was stable across the North Slope, and that it would not begin to thaw this century. Romanovsky said: “If you look at our records, however, and extrapolate into the future another 30 years, assuming changes continue as they have been for the last 30 years, the permafrost on the North Slope will hit 0C by 2050 or 2060 at the latest. Nobody was expecting this, and most people would be surprised to see this happen so soon.” Schaefer also expressed concern about the impact that thawing permafrost will have on the infrastructure and people of the Arctic. “Thawing permafrost represents a radical change to the environment and way of life in the Arctic, with unknown social costs,” he said. I asked if he thought it would be necessary to relocate most, if not all, of the coastal villages in northern Alaska. He said that as sea levels go up and permafrost thaws, “there is risk the thawing will destroy critical infrastructure, which will require repair or moving it, and that includes entire villages. If you built your village right next to the ocean and it starts to melt, you have to move. This is happening in interior Alaska along rivers, and it’s also happening across the entire Arctic zone.” Roads, railroads, oil and gas infrastructure, airports, seaports – all these things were built across the Arctic on the assumption that the permafrost would stay frozen. “When it is frozen it is solid, but it thaws out and turns to mud, so it’s easy to see this causing a lot of damage to infrastructure,” Schaefer said. Dr Leonid Yurganov, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County physics department and the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology, is an expert in the remote sensing of Arctic methane levels. He told me his team of researchers had already detected long-term increases in methane over large areas of the Arctic, and warned that the fast liberation of methane would influence air temperature near the surface and accelerate Arctic warming. “The difference in temperatures between the poles and the equator drives our air currents from west to east,” he said. “If this difference diminishes, the west-to-east air transport becomes slower, and north-south air currents become stronger. This results in frequent changes in weather in the midlatitudes.” It would change the climate, he says, “everywhere in the world”. Two days after leaving Utqiagvik, I flew from Anchorage to Seattle on my way home. Forty-five minutes before we landed, while flying at 35,000 feet, the plane entered a cloud of brownish-grey smoke rising from the 146 wildfires scorching British Columbia beneath us. At that point, they had burned more than 600,000 acres and forced 7,000 people from their homes. We descended into the brown cloud until we landed in Seattle, which was also enveloped in the smoke. A couple of days later, a leaked draft report from US scientists across 13 federal agencies warned of a worst-case scenario of 18F warming over the Arctic between 2071 and 2100. The report also noted that the Arctic was losing more than 3.5% of its sea ice coverage every decade, that the extent of the September sea ice had declined more than 10% per decade, that the land ice was disappearing at an increasingly rapid rate and that the severity of winter storms was increasing because of warming temperatures. The grim news seemed endless: the snow-free season on Alaska’s North Slope is lengthening. The year 2016 experienced the longest snow-free season in 115 years of record-keeping – roughly 45% longer than the average snow-free period over the previous four decades. The October temperature at Utqiagvik increased by a staggering 7.2C between 1979 and 2012. We are already facing mass extinction. There is no removing the heat we have introduced into the oceans, nor the 40bn tons of CO2 we pump into the atmosphere every single year. There may be no changing what is happening, and far worse things are coming. How, then, shall we meet this? Like so many people, I have wondered what to do at this time. Each of us now must find our own honest, natural response to the conditions that we have brought upon ourselves. I am heartened by people like my friend Karina Miotto in Brazil, who has devoted her entire life to protecting the Amazon. Each time a report is published about increased deforestation in her beloved rainforest, I watch Karina become consumed in grief. But each time, she goes deeper within herself and her community, further strengthening her love for that portion of the planet where she lives, and repurposes herself into her next action to protect the Amazon. I find solace in the fact that there are millions of others like Karina, particularly among the younger generations, who have drawn their lines around their respective portions of the planet closest to their hearts and are making their stands. I find my deepest conviction and connection to the Earth by communing with the mountains. I moved to Colorado and lived among them when I was in my early 20s, and it was there I began to deepen my relationship with them, and to really listen to them. I would hike out and just sit among the peaks, watching them for hours, and write about them in my journal. Today I know in my bones that my job is to learn to listen to them ever more deeply, and to share what they are telling us with those who are also listening. While western colonialist culture believes in “rights”, many indigenous cultures teach of “obligations” that we are born into: obligations to those who came before, to those who will come after, and to the Earth itself. When I orient myself around the question of what my obligations are, a deeper question immediately arises: from this moment on, knowing what is happening to the planet, to what do I devote my life?

"Urban life can be an insulated existence, consisting of circling between one temperature-controlled space after another. But cities are not invulnerable to climatic changes. Indeed, when it comes to heat, they can fare worse. They are also far from homogenous. Counter to the images of “domed cities” that Buckminster Fuller proposed for Manhattan in the 1960s and that Dubai is touted to be pursuing, cities do not have equally distributed temperatures. Even if they do, the risk those temperatures represent are far from equally perceived or experienced.  Australians typically pride themselves on being pretty sanguine about the nation’s extreme weather, at least when it comes to spectacular events like Dorothea Mackellar-esque “flooding rains” or disasters playing out elsewhere on our vast continent. But this week even our assumed role as the world’s most variable climate took a turn for the worse, as Australia hosted the planet’s 15 hottest sites. Many of these extreme temperatures were recorded inland in small settlements. Port Augusta, for example, with 15,000 residents, was number two on the list at 49C. Nonetheless, the heat wave rolled across the continent affecting major urban settlements such as Canberra and Western Sydney. Just as it is not merely an issue for “the inland”, heat is also far from external to cities. Heat is produced unevenly by cities themselves, especially given the way many urban settlements have been developed to date. As detailed in the well-understood “urban heat island” effect, dense building materials like concrete take longer to heat up and cool down. Metals reflect heat back into city environments. Buildings block the wind and stop the city from cooling down. Vehicles and other machinery all produce heat, including the air-conditioning that many of us rely on to cool our internal retreats. All this means that in general the outdoor environment of a city is several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside. Australia’s cities complicate this classical view of the heat island model to the extent that city centres are close to the coast and heat is ameliorated by the immense heat-absorbing capacities of the ocean and associated breezes. But the size of Australia’s cities and in many places, their lack of greenery produces large contiguous patches of heat-absorbing and -emitting materials. Many of our cities’ heat islands are therefore better termed “heat continents” reflecting their size and inland location. For those who need or want to move around the city on foot or by bike, people are advised to stay in the shade. For this reason, the City of Greater Bendigo is working with RMIT and Spatial Vision to develop an app that enables people to find “shadeways”. But much more could be done. In some places, shady routes simply do not exist, nor do safe pedestrian or cycling routes. Increasingly cities are working to make cities more walkable in recognition of the multiple benefits that come from doing so. But these efforts need to go hand in hand with shading. In hotter cities, walkability and rideability is increasingly not only about access but about the physical qualities of those routes. Are unshaded footpaths and cycling lanes alongside busy roads really walkable or rideable? More broadly, the shading and transpiration of tree canopies can ameliorate the temperature of any space, even indoor spaces that otherwise rely on expensive and maladaptive air-conditioning. “Leafy suburbs” have a head start when it comes to seizing the temperature controlling properties of trees. They also tend to be the older, more expensive and better built suburbs and thus inaccessible to the majority of city residents who live in hotter, more air-conditioning-dependent areas and buildings. In growing recognition of trees as an important form of public infrastructure, numerous initiatives are seeking to increase tree cover. But trees take a long time to grow. They are also themselves vulnerable to heat and other climatic conditions, particularly in areas where urban development means the basics of good soil and water are hard to find. Besides tree planting and maintenance, therefore, protecting existing trees is paramount. At present, development for new housing tends to occur on greenfield sites where one of the first steps is to remove existing trees to enable the movement of building equipment and later cars. While some of this tree removal is compensated by later plantings, the net loss, uncertainty and lag time in accessing the ecological services of trees can be immense. The development industry needs to rethink the term “greenfield” towards “treefields”. This would be a rediscovery of well-known landscape ecological principles put forward by Ian McHarg and others in the Woodlands development more than 50 years ago. Designing new housing leaving the trees in the ground and the existing ecosystem in place, augmented with new strategically placed plantings, would help future proof new development sites against extreme heat by reducing the amount of heat the site itself produces. Combined with the role of trees in holding carbon and absorbing carbon dioxide and thus reducing the global warming that is worsening heat extremes, protecting existing trees in treefields and further afield is ever-more essential. The “bubble” we need to live in is not a glass air-conditioned dome, it is a tree canopy. • Marco Amati and Lauren Rickards are associate professors at the Centre for Urban Research in the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies at RMIT University, Melbourne"

"As all of Australia suffered through a brutal heatwave last week, locals in the outback New South Wales towns of Walgett and Lightning Ridge were better prepared than most. Almost every day in summer is 40C or above here. Usually, the rivers provide relief: swimming in cool water, fishing for golden perch or Murray cod or seeking the solace of a big sleepy red gum that lines the banks. But this year there are no rivers. With the mercury in the mid-40s, the Narran, the Namoi and the Barwon – all tributaries of the vast Murray-Darling river system – are dry, or reduced to a series of green, stagnant weir pools. The mighty red gums, roots exposed, are hanging on for dear life. Heritage-protected lakes and wetlands are empty, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish. Australia has endured a searing summer of drought and extreme heat. Hundreds of feral animals have died of thirst or faced culling as they encroached on properties in search of water. All-time temperature records have been broken in South Australia, with Adelaide reaching 46.6C, while Melbourne had its hottest day since the catastrophic 2009 bushfires, and more fires swept through Tasmania. The Murray-Darling basin, which stretches from Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria before emptying into the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, should be the lifeblood of the continent in such times. But things have gone very wrong on the rivers. At Menindee, near Broken Hill, thousands of fish were found dead on 6 January, including giant Murray cod up to 40 years old. Government ministers blamed the drought that set in across eastern Australia from April 2017. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it “just hasn’t rained”. “We are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,” he said. “And when it rains, it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying ‘what are we going to do with all the water?’ That’s Australia.” But the huge fish kill drew the nation’s attention to the wider crisis on the Murray-Darling, which has been the subject of political wrangling between farmers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups for decades. While irrigation has expanded in some of Australia’s driest regions, the Darling and its tributaries have been reduced to a series of muddy pools. It’s not the first time the Darling has ceased to flow, but the unfolding severe ecological and social consequences have caused Australians to question whether its plan to save the Murray Darling basin from environmental disaster is working. “We have witnessed a catastrophic failure of Australia’s supposedly world-leading water management system,” Rene Woods, from the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations says. ******* For decades the states along the river had been handing out water licences to farmers without any thought about what unbridled extraction for farming would mean for the river or downstream states. By the 1990s, the mouth of Murray at the end of the river system silted up. Salt levels became dangerously high, jeopardising Adelaide’s water supply, as well as internationally recognised wetlands. Governments were forced to act and in 2007, after years of difficult negotiations, the states and the commonwealth agreed to a plan that would licence water extraction and buy back a share of water for the environment. This water is owned by the Commonwealth and is released periodically to mimic nature and, in theory, keep the rivers healthy. But from the outset, the plan owed more to political compromise than science. “The best available science assembled for the guide to the the Basin Plan said that we needed 3,200GL to 7,600GL for the environment,” said Jamie Pittock, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists. But ultimately only 2,750GL was allocated to the environment. Astoundingly, the plan also failed to take into account climate change, despite scientific reports showing that most of the basin will become hotter and drier. ****** The Aboriginal nations of the basin have been all but ignored, too. “In the 1990s, when NSW water reform began, it was really difficult, because we had people say “what have Aboriginal people got to do with water?” They didn’t see that we had a valid place at the table,” Yuwalaraay man Ted Fields says. Aboriginal people have some say over about a third of the country in the basin, but they hold less than 0.01% of Australia’s water diversions. Native title rights do not include ownership of natural waters. They can include the use of water for personal, social, domestic and cultural purposes but an entitlement to extract water doesn’t mean there is any water to extract, or that the water is drinkable. Traditional owners are angry at being shut out of the water conversation. The loss is not just about day-to-day shortages. Gamilaraay and Yuwalaraay elders who have lived on the rivers all their lives say they have never seen conditions as bad as now, and they doubt it can ever be recovered. “This to me is the ultimate destruction of our culture,” Gamilaraay elder Virginia Robinson says in Walgett. “All people think about now is there’s no water. Aboriginal people were very close to nature and that’s all unbalanced now. There’s no nature to go back to.” Buying up water to return to the environment remains deeply unpopular in much of rural Australia because of its impact on farms, rural towns and jobs. At the same time the creation of a water market, where allocations can be traded, has benefited big agribusinesses who moved into industrial scale production of cotton and other high value crops, as well as water trading. The Greens and Indigenous groups have called for a royal commission amid allegations of corruption and poor governance. South Australia has already held its own royal commission into the plan, but was hampered by the federal government’s refusal to cooperate. It will report next week and is expected to warn that key aspects of the Murray-Darling plan are in breach of the Commonwealth Water Act. In Walgett the dry river means the town must live on bore water indefinitely. Bore water is high in mineral content, especially sodium. It kills gardens and discolours basins and bathtubs. It comes out of the tap very warm – there’s no need to turn on the hot tap to have a shower, but there is also no chance for a cool drink. Locals say bore water is not a long-term option as a drinking supply. Water restrictions mean no water can be used during daylight hours, and there are limits on washing, flushing of toilets and the use of evaporative air conditioners, even when with temperatures at extreme levels. The fish kill and the heat have at least brought the problems of water management squarely into the consciousness of city dwellers. The future of the Murray Darling basin is now a major issue in the upcoming federal and NSW elections. Yuwalaraay cultural educator Daryl Ferguson has a message for politicians and voters alike. “Everyone should take a leaf out of our culture – it is about looking after the land. “Everyone says “this is mine, this is my part of the river, this is mine, mine, mine.” “I’m not here to talk about ownership; that’s not our culture. You want to own it? That’s fine. “Just look after it.”"
"McDonald’s, KFC and Burger King have been urged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains by a coalition of global investors, with the animal agriculture industry criticised for being one of the world’s highest-emitting sectors without a low-carbon plan. Increasing concern that the industry is neglecting climate change and has failed to set emissions targets – unlike other sectors – prompted more than 80 investors representing $6.5tn (£4.94tn) to challenge fast food chain owners to put robust targets in place for their meat and dairy suppliers, in what could prove a landmark demand.  In a letter jointly organised by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (Fairr) Initiative and sustainability organisation Ceres, the fast food companies – which account for more than 120,000 restaurants worldwide – were censured for expanding without sufficiently mitigating their environmental impacts. “If we are to meet the global climate ambitions set by the Paris agreement, and ensure the availability and sustainable management of global water resources, then global fast good brands need to take concrete action to manage supply-chain emissions and water impacts,” said Heike Cosse, from Aegon Asset Management. “The takeaway from investors is that those firms that fail to meet this challenge face regulatory and reputational risks that put their long-term financial sustainability under threat.” BMO Global Asset Management added that the long-term value of fast food multinationals was under rising threat, citing the growing demand for plant-based food, increased environmental regulation and fears over water pollution from intensive farms. In the letter, the investor coalition – which also included Aviva UK – advised the chains to reduce their impact on freshwater, publish time-sensitive targets and publicly announce their progress each year. Livestock farming is one of the leading causes of deforestation and water pollution, responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. If global demand for beef increases 95% by 2050 as expected then catering to the growing appetite could have severe consequences. “If you look at the next 20 years, methane is over 80 times more potent at warming the planet than CO2, so pollution from livestock is playing an outsized role in the climate-driven devastation we’re already seeing from superstorms, floods, droughts and wildfires,” said Ian Monroe, chief investment officer at Etho Capital and an earth systems lecturer at Stanford University. In the US the majority of large meat processing plants that pollute streams and rivers face few consequences, according to research by Ceres, and the animal agriculture industry is exempted from reporting its greenhouse gas emissions. Across the world, animal farming uses 83% of agricultural land despite providing only 18% of calorie intake, with consumers in Europe eating around five times the recommended amount of red meat, poultry and dairy products, according to Fairr. The organisation previously warned demand is set to exceed what can be met within “planetary boundaries”, and that the intensification of animal farming is not sustainable, with scientists recommending people adopt plant-based diets. “Every day around 84 million adults consume fast food in the US alone, but the inconvenient truth of convenience food is that the environmental impacts of the sector’s meat and dairy products have hit unsustainable levels,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of Fairr and chief investment officer of Coller Capital. “To put this in perspective, if cows were a country, it would be the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.” He added: “Other high-emitting industries, such as cars or oil and gas, are beginning to set clear yet ambitious climate targets, making animal agriculture one of the world’s highest-emitting sectors without a low-carbon plan.”"
"It was the very last “frost fair” to be held on the frozen waters of the River Thames in London. These events had taken place from time to time during the 17th and 18th centuries, during a colder-than-average period known as the Little Ice Age. By the early 19th century, Britain’s climate was beginning to ameliorate a little. But as a final throwback, the winter of 1813-14 proved to be one of the coldest on record. January 1814 ranked as the third coldest ever: ahead even of 1963, but just behind 1795 and 1684.  As in previous very cold winters, the tidal stretch of the river froze over. January 1814 was also very snowy, while icebergs floated down the river and into the estuary damaging ships. It was also very foggy. Not that the freezing weather deterred Londoners from enjoying themselves. Once again, they erected temporary gin-palaces on the ice, played games of skittles, danced to music, and even roasted whole oxen over open fires. Someone even walked an elephant across the river by Blackfriars Bridge. They could not have known, as the climate warmed and the river was cleaned up, that this would the last time they would ever indulge in such hedonistic but no doubt highly enjoyable pastimes."

"I’ve walked the forest track a thousand times, but in the flat grey of this January morning the view is unrecognisable. The first Sitka spruces were notched into the grassy Borders hill just over 40 years ago, making them almost a decade older than me. For all my life, Wolfhopelee hill – which shares its abstruse name with, and is visible from, the house I grew up in – has been covered in rows of trees. When they were smaller, adders basked along the crushed stone track, and the grassy rides remained as fragments of the old sheep-grazed landscape. As the trees grew, the rides shrank and woodland species arrived: goldcrests, siskins and the occasional red squirrel.  Now the spruces’ time is up. This whole section of forest is being felled and will be replanted. Clear-felling is banned in Switzerland and has largely been abandoned in Germany, but is still favoured by British forest managers: it is faster and more profitable than selective felling. I watch a contractor load logs on to his eight-wheeled forwarder, picking up giant scoops with the claw-like grab arm. Using the grab as a counterweight, he bumps over an undulating mat of twigs and broken branches to the log stack. It’s skilled work. The best lengths will be milled for construction or fencing, while thinner sections go for biomass pellets or chipboard. The Cumbrian naturalist Derek Ratcliffe likened a clear-felled plantation to a battlefield, and this is what awaits me round the corner. I pass a forester’s caravan with a satellite dish and a sign warning me that I am on CCTV, and reach the summit. What I remember as a patch of open tussocks fringed with spruce (a favourite viewpoint) is now a quarry, the hill gouged out to remove the shale that surfaces the tracks. Otherwise there is nothing but a flattened mess of brash, with the occasional dead tree left standing, like the survivor of a wildfire. Then I hear a familiar sound. Through the still morning air comes the rising and falling chinking and clinking of a flock of crossbills in flight. They land in the bare branches of a dead tree and begin preening, their bodies silhouetted like miniature parrots against the grey sky."
"International Falls is known as the “Icebox of America” for good reason. The average high temperature in January is -9C, or 15F. In a typical year, the city will experience 109 days of subzero weather. But this week the nickname seems particularly appropriate. At 8am on Wednesday, the temperature in International Falls, at the very northern tip of Minnesota, was -36.4F (-38C). The windchill was -58F (-50C). The National Weather Service warned that it could get even colder here on Wednesday night – potentially down to -65C (-85F). But in this little city of 6,000 people, people were carrying on as usual, using a few tricks they’ve learned from a lifetime of frigid temperatures. “You gotta have that International Falls shuffle going on,” said Stephanie Heinle, owner of the Coffee Landing Cafe downtown. Heinle demonstrated the manoeuvre by shuffling quickly across the wooden floor of the cafe. It’s a method of walking across ice that minimizes risk, she said. “Because in this weather you can fall and break a hip and if someone doesn’t see you you freeze to death,” Heinle said. Forecasters are describing the icy influx sweeping the American midwest as the coldest weather in a generation. On Wednesday, Chicago is predicted to see its lowest “high temperature” – the warmest point of a given day – since records began, and Minneapolis could also see historic lows. The cold won’t stop there. It’s expected that 75% of the contiguous US will see sub-zero temperatures over the next week, a result of the polar vortex Arctic air pressure system bursting apart in early January. The wind system normally traps cold air at the North Pole, but its splintering has whipped frigid air far further south than normal. Few have experienced the kind of cold currently occurring in International Falls. The temperature in a commercial freezer is -18C (-0.4F). In New York City the all-time coldest temperature was recorded as -26C (-15F), back in 1934. The record low in the United Kingdom is -27.2C (-17F), which has been reached on three occasions, each time in northern Scotland and most recently in the Highland village of Altnaharra, in 1995. On Wednesday the thermometer here never made it past -30C (-22F). Still, at midday Coffee Landing was a hive of activity. There was a birthday party going on in the back, with eight people wearing little strap-on hats, and people bundled in and out, barely mentioning the weather. “I’m not worried at all,” Heinle said. “Because I know it’ll go away. I know it’ll warm up.” When she’s walking around town or running errands, Heinle doesn’t even wear a hat and gloves. “If you’re used to wearing them when it’s only this temperature,” she said – there was a windchill of -45F at this point – “Then when you go snowmobiling or something where you really have windchill, you’re going to be really cold. I know it sounds crazy.” Heinle offered a personal tip on staying warm: “A little alcohol helps.” It was a bit early to take Heinle’s advice, so I shuffled soberly out into International Falls’ main street. International Falls is undeniably beautiful, divided from Canada by the picturesque Rainy river. The paper mill, a big local employer that looms over the city, pumps out steam as it turns wood into pulp, sending cascades of mist down the high street. It covers the trees in a crystalized frost, with the fog creating an other-wordly atmosphere. But it is preposterously cold. Within seconds of stepping outside my nostril hairs had frozen. After two minutes my moustache was covered in ice. I’d prepared well, I thought. I was wearing two pairs of long-johns, a pair of thick jeans, thick socks, insulated boots, two long-sleeved undershirts, a wool jumper, a fleece, a ski jacket, a balaclava, a “deep-winter” hat and two pairs of gloves, but still I was surprised to find my teeth literally chattering. My phone quickly stopped working, as did my voice recorder, and my pen. My hat, purchased for cycling in New York winters, started letting in the cold after about two minutes. My ski-gloves, which my dad found in the back of a rental car in 2006, lasted about 30 seconds. The winter has its upsides for the city. Tourists come to hunt and ice fish, and to drive the picturesque seven miles route around the frozen Rainy Lake. Car companies, including Kia, Hyundai and Land Rover, come too, testing new vehicles in the frozen conditions, and on Monday more than a hundred endurance athletes traveled to the area for the Arrowhead 135, a 135-mile race across northern Minnesota on cross-country skis, fat-tyre bicycles or just on foot. The winner, Jordan Wakeley, managed to set a new record in the race, on a bike, although around half of the 146 entrants dropped out in the freezing cold. It was a boon for the local taxi company, which worked through the night picking up frozen athletes along the trail. But there is no escaping the fact that it is dangerously cold. In a weather warning issued on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said that the wind chill could cause frostbite on exposed skin in just five minutes. “Hypothermia can set in quickly, which may lead to death,” the NWS added. In this weather some households keep their water running nonstop, for months at a time, to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. People leave their cars running while they eat inside bars and restaurants, to prevent doors from freezing shut and engines conking out. Extra time has to be allocated each morning to pull on layers of clothing, extra money spent on arctic-level jackets and boots. It might raise the question as to why people choose to live here. For International Falls’ mayor, Bob Anderson, the answer is easy. “I love my city,” Anderson said. “You can go ice-fishing, cross-country skiing. We have a beautiful lake that opens up every May through October, a beautiful river. “I just really enjoy the birds, the animals. We have very distinctive seasons, we also enjoy that a great deal.” Anderson, 76, was born and raised in International Falls, and has been mayor since 2012. He worked at the paper mill for 51 years before retiring in 2011, and remembers a nine-day stretch in the 1970s when the temperature never rose above -18C (-0.4F), and a record snowfall in 1996. When the ice descends on the the city it doesn’t thaw for months. But it doesn’t bother Anderson. “The cold is probably akin to the heat in the south. I would not want to be where it’s 110F in the summer time. I know I would melt,” he said. “I enjoy the cold. I’m not bothered by it terribly. You take a few more precautions, do a bit more reading in the winter time, and life goes on. “And for 120, 130, 140 years it’s always been a white Christmas.”"
"The world’s oceans are warming at a faster rate than previously estimated, new research has found, raising fresh concerns over the rapid progress of climate change. Warming oceans take up more space, a process known as thermal expansion, which the study says is likely to raise sea levels by about 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the rise in sea levels from melting ice and glaciers. Warmer oceans are also a major factor in increasing the severity of storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall.  Oceans store heat so effectively that it would take decades for them to cool down, even in the unlikely scenario that greenhouse gas emissions were halted urgently. The report, published on Thursday in the journal Science, found that the warming of the oceans was accelerating and was matching the predictions of climate change models, which have shown global temperature rises are likely to lead to extreme weather across the world. Zeke Hausfather, co-author of the paper and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: “While 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the [earth’s] surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. The global warming signal is a lot easier to detect if it is changing in the oceans than on the surface.” Oceans absorb more than nine-tenths of the excess energy trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, and play a key role in regulating the world’s climate. But the role of oceans in the global climate system was overlooked for many years, in part because of a lack of data and the difficulty of studying the marine environment. Only in recent years have scientists come to realise the full importance of oceans, which have effectively absorbed much of the impact of climate change in recent decades, but are now understood to be reaching their capacity as a buffer. Separate recently published research extrapolated temperature estimates for the oceans for the past 150 years, and found substantial warming. Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, that research found the total heat taken up by the oceans in the last century and a half was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the world’s population. A Guardian analysis of those findings suggested that the amount of energy absorbed by the oceans was equivalent to an atomic bomb per second for the past 150 years. Scientists said this was unsustainable in the long term without seeing further massive effects, including extreme weather, fiercer storms, and sea level rises. The heating could also affect sea currents around the world, with unpredictable consequences. Late last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world would face dire effects from global warming from 2030 unless urgent and drastic measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The new Science paper analysed four studies published between 2014 and 2017, which corrected for discrepancies between different types of ocean temperature measurements and gaps in measurements. Satellite monitoring, buoys and ships are all used to gather data on the effect of climate change on the oceans. In the past decade, a network of 4,000 buoys known as Argo has provided an unprecedented data set on the temperature, salinity and acidification of oceans. By taking the four studies, with different methodologies, into consideration the authors of the new analysis were able to build a fuller picture than was previously possible, with calculations extrapolated back to the 1970s."
"When the American artist Danielle Eubank visited the Indian Ocean in Mozambique, she was taken back by the garbage. “There’s pollution everywhere, in the water, on the beach, baby strollers and plastic mats, plastic bags, plastic bottles,” she said. “They’re everywhere.” The artist has painted roughly 200 bodies of water in 22 countries, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, for her 20-year project One Artist Five Oceans. The goal is to raise awareness about ocean pollution and climate change.  “I have always been a huge environmentalist, I’ve screamed at people and tried to get the message across in so many ways,” said Eubank, on the phone from her Los Angeles studio. “I prefer to show people, ‘Hey look, this is our world, let’s take care of it. Don’t destroy it.’ It’s something very precious, something we all share.” On 28 February, Eubank embarks on a long journey south to the Antarctic Circle for the last leg of her ocean painting project. She will depart from Ushuaia, Argentina, to the Antarctic Peninsula to paint the Southern Ocean. It all started 20 years ago when Eubank was visiting the Doñana national park in Huelva, in the south of Spain, where she spent her days painting on the beach with her back to the water. “Coming from California, I abhorred water paintings,” said Eubank. “For me, I could only see ideas other people had before me – crashing waves, dolphins and mermaids, I just couldn’t get into it.” But that all changed when, after spending days painting the park, she turned to the Atlantic Ocean. “I painted the dunes and got fed up and turned around at sunrise, in the morning,” she said. “I was faced with the water and nothing else. From that first point on, that’s all I wanted to paint – water.” She painted the Arctic Ocean from Svalbard, Norway. “What I noticed about the Arctic, is that the polar ice caps were melting in October,” she said. “The rate the oceans are warming up is the most frightening thing I can think of. Oceans are getting warmer.” When she painted the Indian Ocean, she noticed the illustrious hues. “The Indian Ocean is the most beautiful, it has the most difference in colors,” said Eubank. “It has times when its more golden and aqua, at times. There’s a lot of variations.” Though her series started in Spain, Eubank considers the Pacific the ocean her “home ocean. “I grew up in northern California near the coast,” she said. Having sailed the seven seas and (so far) four oceans, Eubank has visited most of these bodies of water by sea. Not in any kind of boats, but by old-fashioned ships, including one called the Borobudur, a wooden replica of an eighth-century vessel. In a sense, Eubank is honoring a time-worn tradition. “Explorers all had expedition artists; look at Captain Cook, he had William Hodges,” she said. “Back then, because people didn’t have cameras, they would take artists or do sketches themselves to document what they saw.” Sailing by in a showy replica of an ancient boat does get a lot of attention. “Private boats would wave as they passed by,” said Eubank. “When we would come into port, sometimes there would be lines of people along the quay.” As she packs for Antarctica, Eubank will be painting with oils, pencils and below-zero ink in her sketchbooks, which will be clipped to her jacket so they don’t fly into the ocean. “It hopefully will help people look at things in a new way,” she said. The United Nations Environmental Program claims that 80% of all marine pollution is plastic, and that every year, over 8m tons of plastic ends up in the oceans. Apparently by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic than fish, just as the world’s oceans keep getting warmer. Upon returning from Antarctica, Eubank will put together a book of all her ocean paintings and open an exhibition of selected paintings on 24 May at Kwan Fong Gallery in Thousand Oaks, California. Instead of painting piles of garbage, she also hopes her viewers will relish the beauty of these bodies of water, as well. “Our own actions affect what goes into the oceans,” said Eubank. “There’s a lot we can do; like if everyone ate less meat each week, rode a bike, walked and took public transit, it would make an impact. Hang dry your clothes. People are surprised how easy it is to help the oceans and help the climate.”"
"Amid the anti-globalist chest-thumping of Brexit, Donald Trump, and the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, it may sound like the stuff of folklore. But there was a time in the recent past when all the countries of the world moved quickly to discuss a common threat, agreed an ambitious plan of action and made it work. The Montreal protocol, which came into effect 30 years ago, was drawn up to address the alarming thinning of the ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere. It was the first agreement in the history of the United Nations to be ratified by all 197 countries. Since it came into effect on 1 January 1989, more than 99% of the gases responsible for the problem have been eradicated and the “ozone hole” – which, in the late 80s, vied for headline space with the cold war, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Madonna – is receding in the sky and the memory.  According to the latest UN study, the “ozone holes” (there are actually two: one above each pole) are healing at the rate of 1% to 3% a decade and will have completely vanished in the northern hemisphere by the 2030s and the southern hemisphere by the 2060s. This is cause for back-slapping, but also frustration that the world has not been able to unite as effectively over the climate and biodiversity crises. Here are half a dozen lessons. The satellite animation of the changing atmosphere over the Antarctic first shown in 1985 appeared to show a growing “ozone hole”. This was a scientifically imprecise description of the thinning that was concentrated at both poles, but the metaphor – of the roof over our home planet being punctured – captured the public imagination and, most importantly, conveyed a sense of urgency. By contrast, many people feel distant from climate problems, which are usually illustrated with images of polar bears, filled with caveats and headlined with vague labels, such as “global warming”, which sounds benign (or even desirable for those living in cold countries), and “climate change”, which comes across as a statement of the obvious. When scientists raised the alarm about chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases, there was initially uncertainty about their impact on the atmosphere and the process, but the risks from sunlight weakly filtered by the ozone layer (cancer, crop failure, ocean ecosystem collapse) were so great that world leaders decided not to wait. Instead, they applied the “precautionary principle”: “If in doubt, cut it out.” Even before the science was settled, they started to act. This was also supposed to be the case with the climate, but lobbying to deny the validity of the science, particularly in the US, has stymied action. Governments temporarily put aside cold-war hostilities and united rapidly around a solution to the ozone problem. From the first research in 1973, it took just 16 years for the world to discuss, agree and put in place a solution that reversed the trend. By comparison, scientific warnings that carbon dioxide emissions could disrupt the climate date back to at least 1962 (and the risks were speculated on much earlier). Yet despite numerous international agreements on the subject since then (Rio 1992, Kyoto 1998, Copenhagen 2009, Paris 2015), emissions are still climbing. In the 80s, the environment was not yet the polarising issue it has become, but the dominant figures – including the US president, George HW Bush, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher – still had to overcome business interests, treasury doubts and political short-termism to protect the future health of the planet. They refused to accept the delaying tactics of chemical companies, some of which argued action should wait until the science was clearer. Today, Trump, Bolsonaro and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, represent fossil fuel interests, deny science and undermine international cooperation. The phased ban on CFCs and dozens of other ozone-depleting gases was an economic blow to chemical firms, refrigerator producers and aerosol-spray manufacturers. Rich countries dealt with the job losses, technology upgrades and other economic consequences internally, but also provided support for poorer nations to manage the transition. From 1991 to 2005, pledges totalled $3.1bn. Similar arrangements exist for climate accords, but the sums need to be far higher because the actions are so much more expensive, the responsibility of industrialised nations is so much greater, and the impact on poor countries is incalculably worse. The Montreal protocol has been updated numerous times as the science has sharpened and new climate goals have been incorporated. This month, the Kigali amendment added a plan to cut hydrofluorocarbons by more than 80% over the next 30 years, which would reduce global heating by 0.4C by the end of the century. Under the Paris climate agreement, governments are supposed to ratchet up the ambition of their pledges to cut emissions, but most governments are failing to meet even their current inadequate targets. Looking at this list, a millennial might be tempted to conclude that the Montreal protocol was possible because it came about in a golden age when leaders were smarter, politicians more representative and populations more amenable to scientific persuasion. But, as anyone alive in 1989 knows, that is far too simple an explanation. The reality is that environmental action was easier then because the world had more ecological breathing room, capitalism was less dominant and the corporate push-back – and control over politics – was weaker. The ozone layer was a relatively simple fix compared with the climate, which is the biggest, most complex, multidimensional challenge humanity has ever faced. It is one thing confronting a handful of chemical firms, quite another to take on the world’s fossil fuel companies, car manufacturers, cement-makers and agribusiness conglomerates, representing hundreds of millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and 200-odd years of industrial development. Bush, Thatcher, Gorbachev and the then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, knew this in 1989, when global temperatures were already rising at an unnaturally rapid rate. A year earlier, in a US congressional testimony reported throughout the world, the then Nasa scientist Jim Hansen had declared “with 99% confidence” that this heating was a result of human activity. They also knew the problem would be easier to solve then than 30 years in the future. Initially, Bush promised to lead a determined global response to climate change, but – as the short-term costs of a long-term solution became apparent – he balked. Instead of a comprehensive response, he merely strengthened research, paved the way for a drawn-out global negotiating process and complacently put his faith in future innovation and entrepreneurship. He may well have reassured himself that his environmental legacy was secure, thanks to action on ozone. But the climate can that he and others kicked forward 30 years ago is still clanking through the corridors of global conferences. It is a lot rustier now, but still basically the same half-response to a problem that becomes bigger and harder to solve with every year that passes. So this year’s anniversary of the implementation of the Montreal protocol should not just inspire nostalgia for 1989, but a curse on the first generation of leaders to dodge climate responsibility. And as we are already suffering the consequences of their failure, it should remind us that every day of delay has a massive and imminent cost. Each fraction of a degree of global heating that can be prevented will save lives, species and money. In our lifetimes, the ozone hole will be closed in the stratosphere while the increasingly angry beast of climate rages below. How angry is up to us. Montreal reminds us that nothing in politics is inevitable, that profits do not have to come before people, that global problems can have global solutions, that we can shape our own future. That depends on how far we are willing to push. In 1989, that wasn’t far enough. Nor has it been since. In 2003, the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, called the Montreal protocol “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date”. Sadly, that still applies today."

"With election season upon us the political commentary on electricity prices is about to dial up to 11. Why? Firstly, because in the last 15 years Australia has gone from some of the lowest electricity prices in the world to some of the highest and a good number of people are hurting. Secondly, in the 2013 election Tony Abbott played us for a fool on electricity prices and it has been a key part of the Coalition election playbook ever since. Between 2007 and 2013 electricity network companies spent about $50bn upgrading our poles and wires. That $50bn had to be paid for and it was by us, as consumers. According to the Productivity Commission this resulted in electricity prices rising by 70% over the five years to 2013. The voting public was well aware of the price hike, while being almost completely unaware of its causes. This allowed then opposition leader Tony Abbott to talk his way into the top job partly on the back of a scare campaign against carbon pricing and renewable energy.  In 2011 the Gillard government announced its Clean Energy Future Package to address Australia’s contribution to climate change. The package included a carbon price which happened to take effect just as consumers had really started to notice the price hikes caused by network overspending. This isn’t surprising since according to analysis by the Australian Electricity Market Commission, electricity prices had risen by about 40%. Abbott was able to blame the high cost of electricity on the carbon price even before it was implemented. Unlike the massive hike in network charges, the much more modest impact of the carbon price came with a compensation package that left most households better off. But this didn’t save the carbon price from taking the fall. Parts of Australia’s mainstream media either fell asleep on the job, cheered him on or found that the lax regulation of network infrastructure spending or arguments about the Weighted Average Cost of Capital didn’t make for juicy soundbites. “Axe the tax” was at the heart of Abbott’s 2013 election campaign. And the rest, as they say, is history. Cut to 2019, the Coalition is trailing in the polls and one of the major differences between the Coalition and the ALP is that the ALP has a climate policy and the Coalition doesn’t. The centrepiece of the ALP’s climate policy is a 45% emissions reduction target and a 50% renewables target both by 2030. The Coalition is already running a scare campaign that these targets will cause sky-high electricity bills. The question is will the Australian people buy the Coalition’s line and be played for a fool on electricity prices a second time? Here’s are a few things that will help you navigate the electricity price spin in 2019. Most of Australia’s remaining (and largest) coal power stations were built in 1970s and 80s. Typically, coal and gas-fired power stations are built to last 35 to 40 years and if they are looked after they might last 50 years, albeit with more frequent breakdowns. In New South Wales, four of the five coal-fired power stations are scheduled to shut down in the next 15 years and they need to be replaced with new generation. Despite what Coalition backbenchers say, the cheapest new build generation is solar and wind, backed up by storage such as pumped hydro up by storage. This fact has been stated over and over by everyone from CSIRO and the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO), to Bloomberg New Energy Finance to the federal government-owned utility Snow Hydro. AGL and the University of Technology Sydney also both found that a portfolio of new technologies dominated by renewables would be cheaper than to upgrade the 47-year-old Liddell station – currently Australia’s oldest coal power station, which is slated for closure in 2022. These analyses don’t even consider the climate impacts of burning coal. Given our generation is ageing it is important to remember that new generation, no matter what type, will generally be more expensive to run than old and written-off assets. Wholesale electricity prices were always going to rise a certain amount during this decade and the next, but with better planning they need not have risen anywhere near as much as they did. What we pay as a electricity consumer is a result of three factors – electricity prices, the amount of electricity we use and the amount of electricity we produce ourselves. The first factor – electricity prices – we individually have little control over (though we can advocate and vote for good policy solutions), the other factors are definitely in our control. We can install solar panels, buy more energy efficient appliances, turn lights and air-conditioning off when we are out of the house and if we own our own home we can also install insulation and make a number of other upgrades. All of these solutions will help lower your power bills while electricity prices continue to rise. This brings me to the issue of green schemes. If I had $1 for every time conservative politicians and pundits blamed green schemes and renewable energy for rising electricity costs, I’d be rich. The “environmental cost” component of electricity prices are those which pay for government policies like the Renewable Energy Target, energy efficiency schemes and others. According to the ACCC these account for about 7% of your bill. While the policies have costs, numerous reports show these policies help lower electricity bills either through lower wholesale costs or helping household and businesses install solar and become more energy efficient. The ACCC found that households with solar pay on average $514 less than those without. While analysis by the Green Markets Institute found that the current renewables build driven by the RET will halve wholesale electricity prices in the next four years. These policies and programs lower bills, while also lowering climate pollution – a win, win. As the impacts of climate change become more evident and the cost of clean technologies fall, the only people who are likely to look foolish this election are those that continue to deny the basic economic and environmental reality that acting on climate in the electricity sector, also helps lower our power bills.  • Nicky Ison is the founding director of the Community Power Agency and research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney.

"Sir David Attenborough has warned that humankind has the power to exterminate whole ecosystems “without even noticing”, and urged world leaders to treat the natural world with respect, during an interview with Prince William in Davos. Prince William also took world leaders to task at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, asking Attenborough why those in key positions have “taken so long” to address climate change. Attenborough said the connection between the natural world and urban societies had been “remote and widening” since the industrial revolution, meaning humans do not realise the effect their actions have on the global ecosystem. The 92-year-old broadcaster added that it was “difficult to overstate” the urgency of the environmental crisis. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  “We’re now so numerous, so powerful, so all-pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening, that we can actually exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. We have to now be really aware of the dangers of what we’re doing, and we already know that of course the plastic problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage upon marine life, the extent of which we don’t yet fully know.” He stressed that the natural world “is not just a matter of beauty, interest and wonder” but a coherent ecosystem on which we depend for “every breath we take, every mouthful of food we take.” A healthy planet, Attenborough added, is an essential part of human life. “If we don’t recognise the kind of connections I’ve been describing, then the whole planet comes in hazard, and we are destroying the natural world and with it ourselves.” William pressed Attenborough for a key message for the politicians and business leaders gathered in Davos this week. “Care for the natural world. Not only care for the natural world but treat it with a degree of respect and reverence,” Attenborough said, adding that there was a worrying tendency to waste resources. “The thing that I really care for in our ordinary daily lives is not to waste the riches of the natural world on which we depend. And it’s not just energy ,which of course is very important, but it’s also dealing with the natural world with a degree of respect. Not to throw away food, not to throw away power – just care for the natural world of which you’re an essential part.” The Duke of Cambridge started and ended the session by congratulating Attenborough for winning the Crystal award, which recognises individuals who have helped make the world a better place, at the World Economic Forum on Monday night. William added it was a “personal treat” to be asking Attenborough questions, and quipped that it was a good change of pace from being the subject of interviews himself. Asking why global leaders have taken so long to react to climate change, William said: ““Why do you think world leaders and those in key positions of leadership; why do think they’ve taken so long … there have been quite a few faltering steps to act on environmental challenges?” Comparisons were also drawn between the broadcaster’s burgeoning BBC career in the 1950s, compared with his latest project that sees him team up with Netflix and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for an upcoming series called “Our Planet” to be released on the online TV streaming site. Attenborough said his early work in the mid-1950s involved himself, one camera and one cameraman, and it was relatively “easy” to impress Britons simply by televising an armadillo. Now the systems are “unbelievable”, taking viewers to the sky and depths of the ocean in ways that 50 years ago, “people couldn’t imagine”. Prince William noted Attenborough’s late shift to environmental activism, noting that for many years the presenter “held back from speaking publicly about environmental issues”. Attenborough said that at the start of his career, it was nearly inconceivable that the environment would be in such a state of crisis and even pockets of animal extinction seemed like the exception rather than the norm. “To be truthful I don’t think there was anyone in the mid-50s who thought there was a danger that we would annihilate parts of the natural world. There were animals that were in danger, that’s true and there were animals that we could see if we didn’t do something they were going to become extinct. “And the notion that human beings might exterminate a whole species … you just hadn’t thought about it,” he said. “Now of course we’re only too well aware that the whole of the natural world is at our disposal, as it were. We can do things accidentally that exterminate a whole area of the natural world and species that live within it.” "
"Name: John CosshamAge: 52Income: £10,000Occupation: Entertainer and ecology educator I’m an enthusiastic green activist and I earn very little so I can live a low-carbon lifestyle. That’s the way I like it; I don’t want much money, because people who earn a lot have a high carbon footprint. This green lifestyle saves my family about £10,000 a year on utilities, food and travel compared to the average family of four. But that’s not the reason I do it.  I’m proud to make between £3,000 and £4,000 a year gigging as a children’s entertainer called Professor Fiddlesticks, riding a unicycle and juggling. I also give talks on climate change and other green subjects, plus I sell compost, do gardening and bike trailer removals, which adds up to about £2,000 a year. I live with my wife, Gill, who works full time as an unpaid carer, and two adult children. We bought our house outright after Gill’s mother died, with help from my dad. As a family, we get a working tax credit of £367 a month. I’m a freegan, which means I get food from bins, from foraging, or from my garden. I’m largely vegan, but eat dairy if I find it thrown away. The most unexpected thing I found in a bin was a bottle of champagne. I buy unsold fruit and veg for a penny a bag from a local food shop and get four loaves of yesterday’s bread for £1 from the local bakers. We spend about £100 a week on basics such as rice and pasta. I occasionally have a coffee or pint out, but we never go to restaurants or get takeaways. I’m frugal with water. We only pay about £280 a year for it. In the bathroom our rule is “if it’s yellow, let it mellow. If it’s brown, flush it down,” and I also have a compost toilet in the garden. I wash every day in a cup’s worth of cold water, using a flannel. I use a wood stove to cook meals as much as possible and our gas bill is about £200 a year. The electricity bill is about £340 annually with Good Energy. We have an energy-efficient fridge, freezer and washing machine and our solar panels earn almost as much as we pay for electricity. I travel by bike and sometimes by train. I haven’t flown in a plane since 1997. We don’t own a car or go on holidays. I don’t care if my T-shirt has a hole in it. However, I did get a tattoo of a compost symbol for my 50th birthday. I haven’t been able to afford a pension and I never have more than about £2,000 in the bank. I never know when money will come in, so I don’t budget. But I believe happiness is separate to your income. Aside from my sadness for the state of the planet, I’m a happy bunny. I’m always busy, either chopping wood, turning compost, or picking beans. I’m autistic, which means I’m very enthusiastic and a bit over-focused. But my focus isn’t on cleanliness, or train numbers. It’s on saving carbon and trying to promote the green agenda. I do a lot of volunteering. I help out with a group called Abundance York, picking unwanted fruit from gardens and taking it to local schools, food banks and homeless shelters. I also distribute spare freegan food and other items to places it can be recycled or reused. I give food to a friend who’s on universal credit, and to Food Not Bombs, who provide free food in town. I’ve been trying to get people to be more green for about 30 years and I am proud that I have such a low carbon footprint. However, I feel like a failure: the CO2 concentration has risen continually over this time and climate change is now an existential threat. Yet we still live in a wasteful society. I’ve had a lot of negative comments about my lifestyle over the years. Some people feel challenged by me. They ask: “Do you think what you do really makes a difference?” I tell them that an ocean is made up of lots of individual droplets. I’ll keep doing what I do for as long as I’m fit and able.

"Your article (Can we feed the world if we ditch intensive farming?, The Briefing, Journal, 28 January) highlights the hugely detrimental impact that industrial farming is having on the quality of our soils . The Campaign to Protect Rural England’s recent report on this very issue echoed many of these concerns, highlighting that soil degradation costs at least £1.2bn a year in England and Wales alone. Soil must be seen not only as a fundamental for delivering productive farming and a healthy countryside, but also critical to tackling climate change – or mitigating its worst effects. Its importance should not be understated. There are solutions, however. By scaling up and incentivising farmers to switch to nature-friendly farming techniques, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, we will create a productive farming industry that works with nature and enables farmers to reduce their costs, while still producing the food and services that we need. Rebuilding biological life in soils is vital to enabling this life-giving asset to function as it should. Our soil will once again effectively lock in carbon, store and filter water, support ecosystems and restore the health of the natural environment.Graeme WillisSenior rural policy campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England   • On page 3 of the Journal I read “the modern western diet needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe” (Eat less meat – and redraw the entire global food system, 28 January). And on page 10: “Can we feed the world if we ditch intensive farming?” Both of these concerns are predicated on a global population in excess of 10 billion people by 2050. Might it not be easier to persuade people to have slightly fewer children than it would be to move the western world on to a diet of nuts and berries? Of course it would also help to reduce our CO2 emissions and our carbon footprint.Melvyn RustSt Albans, Hertfordshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Temperature records have tumbled across South Australia, with the city of Adelaide experiencing its hottest day on record, as the second heatwave in as many weeks hit southern parts of Australia. Adelaide hit 46.6C on Thursday afternoon, the hottest temperature recording in any Australian state capital city since records began 80 years ago.  The Red Lion, a pub in the city’s Elizabeth North suburb, promised to hand out free beers if the mercury rose above 45C. By 1pm, there was a line out the door and round the block. This guy, Muoi Pham, 60, is a legend. Brought free water to those waiting in line at The Red Lion without shade. Gave me a bottle for free too. This is the Elizabeth I know. #adelaide #heatwave pic.twitter.com/t5aGdU2ejk In Port Augusta, 300km north-west, an all-time record was also set, as the city hit 49.5C. Last week, temperatures in Adelaide, home to 1.3 million people, hit 45C, sending homelessness shelters into a “code red”, and sparking fears of another mass fish death in the Menindee Lakes in the neighbouring state of New South Wales. In central and western Australia, local authorities were forced to carry out an emergency animal cull, shooting 2,500 camels – and potentially a further hundred feral horses – who were dying of thirst.  Just so we're clear, being the hottest place on Earth is not the way that I had hoped Australia would be leading the world re. #climatechange when I started working on this thing ... but it's probably what our current level of policy ambition deserves.#climatecrisis #auspol pic.twitter.com/oPnEilRpcv The hottest places in the world right now: https://t.co/IZVNXXi28R pic.twitter.com/y6D2h1FGEV On Thursday, 17 records were broken across South Australia, either of all-time temperatures or January records. Sternhouse Bay (45.6C), Port Lincoln (47C), Minnipa (47.3), and Snowtown (47.3C) were among the hottest, with Snowtown beating its previous record by 1.3C. RECORDS: Stenhouse Bay has easily surpassed its previous record of 44.0C (on 16 Jan & and 2 Feb 2014), and is now 45.6C. Adelaide Airport is also a record at 44.3C (previous record 44.1C 4th Jan 2013). Roseworthy is at 46.9 (prev record 46.7 on 28 Jan 2009). Thursday’s heat is set to spread across the states of Victoria and New South Wales, just days after an earlier record-breaking heatwave passed across the country. Last week, a dozen heat records fell, with nine alone in NSW. The small NSW outpost of Noona, around 800km west of Sydney, recorded the country’s highest ever overnight minimum temperature of 35.9C. The back-to-back heatwaves are part of a summer that the Bureau of Meteorology predicted as being hotter and drier than average, partially as a result of climate change. On Friday, Victoria will become the “hottest place in Australia”, according to Jonathan How from the bureau. The cities of Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca are set for 46C, which could break records. In Melbourne, as Novak Djokovic and Lucas Pouille settle in for the semi-finals of the Australian Open, the maximum temperature will be 43C, with 44C in some suburbs."
"The first science-based diet that tackles both the poor food eaten by billions of people and averts global environmental catastrophe has been devised. It requires huge cuts in red meat-eating in western countries and radical changes across the world. The “planetary health diet” was created by an international commission seeking to draw up guidelines that provide nutritious food to the world’s fast-growing population. At the same time, the diet addresses the major role of farming – especially livestock – in driving climate change, the destruction of wildlife and the pollution of rivers and oceans. Globally, the diet requires red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. But in specific places the changes are stark. North Americans need to eat 84% less red meat but six times more beans and lentils. For Europeans, eating 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds meets the guidelines. The diet is a “win-win”, according to the scientists, as it would save at least 11 million people a year from deaths caused by unhealthy food, while preventing the collapse of the natural world that humanity depends upon. With 10 billion people expected to live on Earth by 2050, a continuation of today’s unsustainable diets would inevitably mean even greater health problems and severe global warming. Unhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill health worldwide, with 800 million people currently hungry, 2 billion malnourished and further 2 billion people overweight or obese. The world’s science academies recently concluded that the food system is broken. Industrial agriculture is also devastating the environment, as forests are razed and billions of cattle emit climate-warming methane. “The world’s diets must change dramatically,” said Walter Willett at Harvard University and one of the leaders of the commission convened by the Lancet medical journal and the Eat Forum NGO. The report, published in the Lancet and being launched to policymakers in 40 cities around the world, also concluded that food waste must be halved to 15%. “Humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden, another author of the report. “[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution.” Farm yields in poorer nations must be improved to create a sustainable, healthy world, the report found. The planetary health diet is largely plant-based and allows an average of 2,500 calories a day. It allows one beef burger and two servings of fish a week, but most protein comes from pulses and nuts. A glass of milk a day, or some cheese or butter, fits within the guidelines, as does an egg or two a week. Half of each plate of food under the diet is vegetables and fruit, and a third is wholegrain cereals. Willett said these provide the ingredients for a flexible and varied diet: “We are not talking about a deprivation diet here; we are talking about a way of eating that can be healthy, flavourful and enjoyable. “The numbers for red meat sound small to a lot of people in the UK or US,” he said. “But they don’t sound small to the very large part of the world’s population that already consumes about that much or even less. It is very much in line with traditional diets.” The planetary health diet resembles those already known to be healthy, such as the Mediterranean or Okinawa diets, the researchers said. “The planetary health diet is based on really hard epidemiological evidence, where researchers followed large cohorts of people for decades,” said Marco Springmann at Oxford University and part of the commission. “It so happens that if you put all that evidence together you get a diet that looks similar to some of the healthiest diets that exist in the real world.” The report acknowledges the radical change it advocates and the difficulty of achieving it: “Humanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment: nothing less than a Great Food Transformation.” But it notes that major global changes have occurred before, such as the Green Revolution that hugely increased food supplies in the 1960s. Moves to tax red meat, prevent the expansion of farmland and protect swathes of ocean must all be considered, the commission said. Prof Guy Poppy, from the UK’s University of Southampton, and not part of the commission, said: “This ‘call to arms’ with its clear solutions is timely, comprehensively researched and deserves immediate attention.” “This analysis is the most advanced ever conducted,” said Prof Alan Dangour, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and also not part of the team. “But there is a major question about the ability of populations to shift to such dietary recommendations and their wider public acceptability.” Prof Nigel Scollan, at Queen’s University Belfast and part of the industry-backed Meat Advisory Panel, said: “This report tells us what we have known for millennia: an omnivorous diet is optimal. In the UK, encouraging people to eat less red meat and dairy will have little impact on the environment and is potentially damaging to people’s health.” But Richard Horton and Tamara Lucas, editors at the Lancet, said in an editorial that global changes as set out by the planetary health diet were essential: “Civilisation is in crisis. We can no longer feed our population a healthy diet while balancing planetary resources. If we can eat in a way that works for our planet as well as our bodies, the natural balance will be restored.”"

"The climate crisis is intensifying a new military buildup in the Arctic, diplomats and analysts said this week, as regional powers attempt to secure northern borders that were until recently reinforced by a continental-sized division of ice. That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle’s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations.  Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic. Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new “Defence Arctic Strategy” and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time. While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access. “Right now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,” one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the Guardian. “The unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It’s elemental.” The Arctic’s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south. Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. “We’re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,” he said. “We should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.” By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole. Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields. Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Tromsø, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it’s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. “Now we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,” the mayor, Kristin Røymo, told the Guardian. “There is also a very obvious increased naval presence.” This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today. Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. “There is no direct link between climate change and conflict,” the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. “It’s not because there is an immediate threat, it’s that, as an area becomes more important, it’s natural to have a heightened military presence.” He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. “To some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,” he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions. The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation – strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost. However, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. “Most important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,” she said. Norway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia. Russia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the Guardian the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated. “In Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?” he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an “Arctic age”. “For us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,” said Ramishvili. “The Arctic isn’t a nature resort. It’s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.” Currently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a “near-Arctic nation”, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road. The US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. “Everyone’s up there but us,” the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month. “The threat is back on. This is an area … we need to focus on,” he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. “Can you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?” he said. The prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia’s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating. Lisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity. “It’s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,” she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. “Under this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,” she said. Environmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea. “The false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,” said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. “You can’t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses. That’s completely wrong.”"
"History is littered with examples of rulers building walls to keep out undesirables, invaders and immigrants. The Great Wall of China and Hadrian’s Wall in Britain are among the best-known examples, and there is a 2,000-mile (3,200km) fence between India and Bangladesh. The earliest-known barrier for this purpose was in the cradle of civilisation in Mesopotamia about 4,300 years ago. A 110-mile wall called the “Repeller of the Amorites” was built to keep out the tribe of that name who were known as “a ravaging people with the instincts of a beast”.  This was because they did not grow grain but hunted for their food. The wall did not work, however, because the Akkadian empire was being overwhelmed by a force greater than the Amorites – climate change. A drought in the region that lasted for 300 years destroyed the empire. During that period, the whole Middle East region was subject to mass migrations as various tribes looked for greener pastures as their homelands dried up. Exactly what caused that drought is still not clear, but the effects are exactly those that are beginning to happen worldwide at the moment – an unpredictable climate forcing millions of people to migrate to survive. History teaches us walls will not solve the problem."
"Last year was the hottest ever measured, continuing an upward trend that is a direct result of manmade greenhouse gas emissions. The key to the measurements is the oceans. Oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat that results from greenhouse gases, so if you want to measure global warming you really have to measure ocean warming. There are other ways to measure climate change, but none are as convincing as the oceans. Air temperatures are most commonly reported in the media as evidence of global warming, but the problem with these is they are very erratic. While there is certainly a long-term trend of higher air temperatures, any given year may be warmer or colder than the last. So oceans are key, and they are telling us a clear story. The last five years were the five hottest on record. The numbers are huge: in 2018 the extra ocean heat compared to a 1981-2010 baseline amounted to 196,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The current rate of ocean warming is equivalent to five Hiroshima-size atomic bombs exploding every second. The measurements have been published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences in an article by Lijing Cheng, the lead author, and his colleagues from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics in China. His collaborators, of which I am one, included researchers from around the world. The article charts ocean heat back to the late 1950s, showing a steady increase. Ocean warming is incontrovertible proof of global warming, and there are real consequences to a warming ocean. Firstly, warmer water expands, and this expansion causes sea levels to rise. Approximately a third of the rise in ocean waters is a result of the heat absorbed by the oceans. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, which would be enough to displace 150 million people worldwide.  The warming waters also make storms more powerful. In the US recently, we have seen hurricanes pass over extremely warm ocean waters, which has supercharged them and increased the damage they cause. Other kinds of storms are also being made stronger. Heavier downpours of rainfall are increasing flooding around the world. Simply put, our emissions of greenhouse gases have caused loss of life and property. We are all responsible, but the people who have denied the science and the solutions own a special responsibility that history will judge harshly. It isn’t just humans that are suffering and will suffer more in the future. The heating of oceans is causing tremendous problems for sea life, particularly coral reefs. If we continue to warm the planet, we can expect to lose much of these reefs. We can also anticipate reductions in fish and sea life populations.  We scientists sound like a broken record. Every year we present the science and plead for action. Not nearly enough is being done. We can still tackle climate change, but we must act immediately. We have the means to make a difference, we lack only the will. "
