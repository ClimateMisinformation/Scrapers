Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his wissenslogs blog, sister blog of Real Climate, Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has a post attempting to find an explanation for Europe’s heavy snowfalls and cold from last month.
Part of Rahmstorf’s problem is his habit of not asking to the right questions, which is a prerequisite for getting the right answers. Or maybe it’s more him purposely asking the wrong questions to avoid getting the right answers.
He reminds me of a fly bouncing off a window. Instead of asking “How do I get through the glass?”, the fly ought to ask: “How do I get on the other side?” Flying away and out through an open door certainly works a lot better than repeatedly ramming into the glass until dropping dead.
In his post he describes the snow and cold of December and poses the question: 
Is it because of global warming, or does it have nothing to do with it?”
First he says straight out that the cold December is by no means an indication that global warming has ended or that it is taking a break, citing 2010’s high global temperature from GISS. He then asks:
In the globally warmest year since measurements began in the 19th century, we have [in Potsdam] the most amount of snow since measurements began in the 19th century. Meanwhile the Arctic sea ice cover this December is at a record low. Do these records have anything to do with each other, or is it just a coincidence?“
The fly bouncing off the window now comes to mind, and expect the bouncing to continue. He then presents the following graphic:

It shows Potsdam maximum snow depth with a 15 year-smoothing. Note the outlier high of 41 cm recorded last month. From this graph he concludes:
The year-to-year fluctuations are very large, and show no noticeable trend.
Especially over the last 40 years, during a time the global temperature rose significantly, there is no trend in the December snow depths.”
And then asserts:
These are hefty indicators that there is no relation between this year’s snow record and global warming and that it is only a coincidence.”
(That applies for snow in Europe.) Now at least he’s headed in the right direction. So what’s the cause? Rahmstorf probes further, and glances at solar activity and quickly dismisses it, saying:

Just eyeballing the the graphic, it is obvious this is not a factor of influence  – an 11 year cycle cannot be detected.”
Rahmstorf aversion to the sun is obvious, and he really has a way of selecting graphics. With that scale one can hardly discern 100 years, let alone 11. That’s the graphic he linked to: Schwabezyklus.
He then adds that it can’t be the sun because the Lockwood und Fröhlich (2010) correlation of winter temps in Europe and solar activity is too weak (correlation coefficient 0.23). 
And not only that, the record warm winter of 2006/2007 came at a time when solar activity was near a low. And the currently weak sun is similar to a stituation before 1925, at a time when there were hardly any cold winters in Germany. So it can’t be the sun, he resons. Here we see that Rahmstorf has gone back to bouncing off the window.
So what could it be, he asks?
Rahmstorf suggests that it has to be “a very non-linear mechanism” causing the unusual snow and cold, like the one suggested by Petoukhov and Semenov (2010), i.e. a connection between ice cover in the Barents-Kara-Sea and the European winter weather.
Rahmstorf does point out that one has to be cautious here because Petoukhov and Semenov is the result of model calculations with one single climate model. Rahmstorf adds:
Indeed before I would consider such a mechanism as robust, it needs to be confirmed by other independent models and ( or observation.
Indeed Petoukhov and Semenov did not make any projection for any winter in particular, rather they presented the idea of winters associated with cold Arctic air could occur more frequently. If that turns out to be the case, it cannot be seen with two or three winters, rather we have to wait for a significantly greater number of winters.”
Not long ago, a number of PIK scientists embarked on a media blitz selling it all as everything but fact in the German media. The past can be also checked out to see if there is any correlation.
Rahmstorf sums it up:
Its quite possible that this month’s extreme snowfall is just a coincidence of the weather. But on the other hand there are indications that the boundary conditions in the Arctic have changed due to the ice melt over the years that could significantly change the weather statistic in Europe. Whether this December remains an outlier or whether more of this will occur in the future cannot be said. It’s an open research question.”
I think it should be a simple matter showing the lack of robustness of the Barents-Kara-Sea / European winter weather correlation. After that we will be able to say it’s time for the warmists to stop bouncing of the window.
Time to look for that open door.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhy All The Ice In Antarctica?
By Ed Caryl
The recent fate of the MS Akademik Shokalskiy has prompted arguments from the CAGW crowd that the global warming is causing more ice around Antarctica. The problem with this argument is that there has been no warming around Antarctica.
All the trends show cooling, especially in the area where the ship is trapped. The southern ocean is cooling, and has been for a long time, especially since 1996. The latitudes in the vicinity of Commonwealth Bay have been cooling since 1980. There is more ice because Mother Nature is freezing more ice.

Figure 1 is the surface temperatures in the band from 50° south to 70° south. 

Figures 2a and 2b are the annual average temperatures at Bases Casey and Dumont D’Urville, the two closest bases in East Antarctica to Commonwealth Bay. Source GISS.
If we look at a annual temperature trend map of the globe covering the last eight years, we see cooling especially at latitudes north and south of 45°, and at the equator.

Figure 3 is the annual temperature trends from November 2005 to October 2013.
Of course, the southern ice has responded to this decreased temperature by increasing, slowly since the low of 1980, but then much faster in the last three years following the local temperatures. See Figure 4:

Figure 4 is the Southern Hemisphere sea ice anomaly chart. Note that the current Southern sea ice is 1.5 Million square kilometers above the 1979 to 2008 mean value, nearly three times the negative anomaly in the Arctic. Source here.
But for whatever peculiar reason, despite all the observations, global warming scientists insist it’s more logical to blame the extra ice on warming!
The warmists never seem to realize that Antarctica can melt only if the temperature rises above freezing there. For all practical purposes, it almost never does rise above freezing. The summer ice only reduces because the wind breaks it up and blows it away into latitudes where the sea is warm enough to melt it.
The air temperatures blowing off the continent rise high enough (to just freezing) so that the ice blowing away is not immediately replaced as it is in the Antarctic winter. Ice flows off the continent not because it is melting, but because the pressure of two-mile-thick ice behind the edges is forcing it to flow. Average air temperatures at bases on the edge of the continent rise to just freezing in January despite 24 hours of daylight. This is why it can snow off-shore at the position of the trapped ship in late December. Rain is an extremely rare event anywhere in Antarctica except the peninsula.
No global warming – it’s over
As one can see from Figure 3, there is no global warming. It’s over. Both poles are now cooling, the tropics are cooling. Ice is increasing at both ends of the earth. Over the last eight years, there were a few isolated pockets of warming, a spot in the North Pacific, the Middle East, north-eastern North America, and off the west coast of Australia. Those spots are constantly shifting, and will soon go away.

A couple of loose ends to tie up as I prepare for the Berlin Conference.
First, bitter cold and snowfall have dominated the German headlines. This kind of thing was not supposed to happen – that is until about 2 weeks ago when scientists at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research suddenly changed their minds after one of their models showed European winters would be getting cold instead (because of global warming).
So let’s look back at what the PIK said just a year ago in FOCUS magazine in a report called: “Germany Will Be Sweating“, in December, 2009, just before Copenhagen:
Less snow, dry-hot summers and mild-wet winters. Scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research show us the most important climate trends for Germany. By the middle of the century the temperature increase and the resulting evaporation in some regions could lead to water shortages.
In the Alps, winters with snow cover will be shortened.
In the western areas, there will be less and less snow cover.

Then the PIK-effect kicked in. Just 10 days after the FOCUS report had come out, i.e. during the Copenhagen conference, the worst winter in over 40 years began to besiege Germany. (H/T to a reader comment here at Readers Edition).
And here’s another one from Bild tabloid, dated 27 November 2006 titled: Winter is Becoming Extinct:

Professor Mojib Latif (52), climate scientist at the University of Kiel: ‘In a hundred years we’ll practically have no more winters.

And the warming is going to accelerate! Scientists have calculated that the average temperature in the next 100 years will increase by up to 4°C. In 20 years it will be possible to go swimming in the Baltic Sea in October and to grow peaches in Hamburg.


H/t: ef-magazin.de.
And this is what we’re getting.
Finally, WUWT brings up a new peer-reviewed paper by Ryan O’Donnell, Nicholas Lewis, Jeff Condon, and Steve McIntyre that shows claims of a warming Antarctic in a peer-reviewed paper by Steig et al were bogus.
Interesting are Anthony’s comments on how reluctant the peer reviewers appear to have been when this sceptical paper landed on their desk. If it had been a paper showing accelerated warming, melting etc., then publication would have been a lot simpler. The peer review probably would have taken only 10 minutes over a cup of coffee. “And don’t worry, we’ll even write up the press releases for you and get this published right before the next conference.”
Anyway, while I’m in Berlin, I’ll post from time to time to provide an impression of how things are going. Hope you drop by.

Share this...FacebookTwitter[Update: 6 July – The SZ has reposted its story]The left of centre German online Sueddeutsche Zeitung had, for a very short time, a quite inconvenient piece up today called, in English: News On Nature’s Respiration, which reported on findings just out from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemicals in Jena, Germany, on the earth’s CO2 cycle and possible future impacts.
Mysteriously, the SZ suddenly ripped it down from its website! Google provides the link if you punch in the original German title “Neues vom Atem der Natur“. Other news sites link to the original SZ report as well, e.g. here and here.
The SZ reported that scientists had collected and evaluated data from 60 measuring towers located in many countries and various ecosystems and presented their findings in Turin, Italy today.
The scientists determined that plants absorb 450 billion metric tonnes of CO2 through photosynthesis each year, or about one seventh of the total amount in the atmosphere. Almost 60% is absorbed by forests and savannahs in the tropics, 11% by fields for food crops.
Humans, by contrast, emit about 36 billion tonnes through their activities, of which the majority gets absorbed by the oceans and atmosphere.
And every year almost the entire 450 billion tonnes gets released by the plants through falling foliage, decay, etc.
According to the now-disappeared SZ report, researchers led by the Max Planck Institute calculated how much the amount of CO2 released would change if the temperature changed. According to the researchers, a warming of 10°C would increase the emission by 40%. According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung report:
That is considerably less than what was often assumed earlier. Earlier a doubling or a quadrupling was often discussed. And apparently this low factor applies for everything from the frozen tundra to the tropical rainforests.
The researchers of the Max Planck Institute concluded:
This dampens the fears that global warming could accelerate from more CO2 being released by savannahs and rainforests with every degree of warming.  This means that so far nature is absorbing a part of manmade CO2 year for year and stores it, thus buffering the climate effect.

Dr. Markus Reichstein of the Max Planck Institute is quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung:
Especially alarmist scenarios for feedbacks from global warming and ecosystem respiration are shown to be unrealistic.
These feedback effects were not at all accounted for in the 2007 IPCC-Report.
I’ve tried to find the findings from the Max Planck Institute at their website, but haven’t been succesful yet. I think it’s very strange the SZ report would be up for about an hour, and then taken down. Someone probably didn’t like what it said.
UPDATE: I sent an e-mail to Dr Reichstein, who was indeed very kind to reply – and provided the following explanation:
Dear Mr Gosselin,
thanks for your interest in the topic. A simple web search however reveals that you are not “just a private reader with an interest” – rather you seem to have established a blog “NoTricksZone”, or is it someone else with the same name.
In any a as matter of fact let me just state that indeed the SZ published the article – probably accidentally – before the embargo for such publication lifted (the embargo will lift at midnight tonight). Hence the article was removed temporarily. That is all.
Best regards,
Markus Reichstein
Well, I am just a private citizen doing this blog for fun as a hobby. I’m not funded by anyone except myself. In any case, could be interesting to see if anything has been sanitised. We’ll see in 75 minutes.
UPDATE 2: Embargo has been lifted, the story has been reposted. As far as I can tell, it does not deviate from anything I’ve written. – P Gosselin

We’ve been seeing similar headlines in the UK and throughout all of Scandinavia. Global warming has met its Stalingrad.
Meanwhile, the Climate Generals are sipping champagne and eating caviar in sunny Cancun, see here.
Stern magazine reports here “Deep Freeze Weather To Remain Until March”:
And its going to continue: Today most of Germany will get 20 cm of  new snow on top of what there is now. Also in the days ahead it’s going to remain cold.”
H/t: NoTricksZone reader Bernd Felsche
Right now with the bitter cold bearing down on Europe, the German media are scrambling like piglets on an ice rink.  Indeed the news of global warming coming out of Cancun are coming across as a bizarre joke. Everywhere in the media we hear something like: “Duh duh duh…it’s…er, man-made climate change induced weather extremes, or something! We can’t explain it! But hold on – wait – it’s now in our models! Yup, there it is! Just the latest sign of global warming.”

Stern Magazine: “Cold of the century”
Stern asks the German Weather Service (DWD): How long is this warming cold going to last?
For the DWD it’s sure: ‘It’s going to remain cold.’ Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday daytime highs will hover around -10″C. Temperatures at night could plummet to -25 °C. Germany will be colder than Scandinavia, Canada and Siberia. ‘We are expecting winds of up to 60 km/hr on Wednesday and Thursday. That means the windchill will be minus 30 to minus 40°C,’ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of Wetterdienst wetter.net in Wiesbaden. ‘Whoever does not dress properly, risks freezing to death.'”
Well, I don’t know about Siberia. But man it’s cold out there with that wind. Reminds me of winters in Vermont. Stern magazine warns:
Anyone hoping for just for a couple of cold winter days is out in left field. Jung says these frosty days are only a taste of what’s coming. ‘It’ll be especially cold,’ says Jung, ‘in the Northeast temperatures will fall below levels we saw last year.'”
So much for the rare but exciting snowy winters Jones told us about awhile back. Meteorologist Jung’s projection for the rest if the winter remains icy. “It will be similar to last year’s cold winter. Don’t expect temperatures to warm up much until late March.”

The media, climate activists, and reinsurers are already salivating massively.
For sure the scientists at the PIK and Mojib Latif are already practicing their lines. They’re eagerly standing by their phones, ready for the media at a second’s notice.
The end of times is approaching. We should have all reduced that carbon footprint of ours. But we didn’t, and so get ready to pay.
Most of the weather misery, however will have been caused by black carbon witchcraft…cast by the 90 or so top carbon emitters, who have now been clearly identified. Once the violent storm passes, the climate witch-hunters will be out in full force, calling for the immediate purge of the carbon witches…bonfires will be burning at almost every town square. Let’s not waste time with trials.
Powerful North Sea storm brewing
The weather models are showing that a major winter hurricane-force storm will be sweeping across northern Europe Thursday and Friday. The chart above shows it’s going to be a powerful one, and so you may want to tie down that lawn and garden furniture, etc. Forget the stroll in the forest.

Meteorologist Dominik Jung at wetter.net writes that the pressure at the storm’s centre will drop to a rock bottom 960 mb by Thursday evening. Meanwhile at the storms outer edge the pressure will be around 1023 mb. That’s a difference of 56 mb across Germany!
The hardest hit areas will be the North sea coastal areas of Holland, Germany, and Scandinavia. Jung warns that huge storm surges have to be expected.
Hopefully authorities will act more quickly this time around.
Here are some projected wind speeds for some cities:
Hamburg: up to 120 km/h
Bremen: up to 130 km/h
Helgoland: up to 150 km/h
Rostock: up to 110 km/h
Berlin: up to 100 km/h

Michael Krüger at Readers Edition has already crunched the numbers for December 2010 in Germany. It was the third coldest on record, and the coldest since 1969. 
The average temperature in December 2010 was -3.5 °C, which is -4.3°C under the 1961-1990 average of 0.8°C.
So much for warmer winters with increasingly rare snowfalls. Speaking of snowfalls, for many locations in Germany it was also the snowiest on record. Krüger writes:
DWD [German Weather Service] experts recorded new monthly records for ‘maximum snow heights’ at many stations: for example 70 cm at Gera-Leumnitz on December 26.”
The snow and cold have been especially embarrassing for the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. It’s famous Potsdam-Telegrafenberg weather station smashed a number of December records.
On December 28, 2010 a snow depth 41 cm was measured in Potsdam. Never has there been that much snow in the month of December since records began in 1893. That’s 18 cm more than the previous record of 23 cm, which was measured on 31 December, 1913.  At -4,4°C it was also the second coldest December in Potsdam since records began in 1893.”
The following chart shows snow cover for Potsdam, home of the PIK(Source: Meteorological Station Potsdam Telegrafenberg) .

All that snow and cold fly in the face of German “climate experts” who not long ago projected warmer winters for Germany. Okay, one winter does not make a trend. Well, how about three of them in a row? Krüger writes:
 The winter before last year was -0,4°C below average and last winter was -1,5°C below the longterm average.
December 2010 is the third coldest since 1900. Colder were only December 1969 and December 1933.”
And adds:
Not only December was too cold, but also the entire year 2010 in Germany was too cold. The first time in 14 years (since 1996) that a year has been colder than the long-term average (average of the years 1961-90 is 8.2°C). In 2010 the average temperature was 7.9°C.”
And finally, as Krüger’s chart at his site shows, Germany’s annual temperature trend has been cooling over the last decade.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a Der Spiegel report today:
The world community is preparing a world climate treaty – but the first reactions sound pessimistic.
About 4500 participants from all over the world have gathered in Bonn in an attempt to forge a new world climate treaty in talks that will last two weeks. But so far talks have shown that no quick solutions are in sight. Der Spiegel writes:
Delegates and observers are almost unanimous on the view that a new world climate treaty won’t be achievable in time for Cancun at the end of 2010, this after the disaster in Copenhagen. At the conference in Bonn, the target is to lay at least the cornerstones for a partial success.
Government delegates have presented a new 42-page draft with options for contents of negotiation.
Der Spiegel writes: EU climate targets on ice!
Artur Runge-Metzger, Climate Protection Director of the EU Commission, emphasized that the EU’s target of reducing GHG emissions by 30% are not off the table. But the EU will go ahead with the 30% target ONLY IF other countries do their fair share in global climate protection.
Emphasis above is mine.
The EU has also pledged €2.4 billion in immediate aid to poor countries for climate protection. It was agreed in Copenhagen that industrialised nations would pay developing countries approx. $30 billion in immediate aid between 2010 and 2012. Developing countries have complained that they haven’t received anything so far.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s another from the “do as I say, and not as I do” hypocrites department. It’s World Cup time in South Africa and the world’s biggest sporting event is attracting the world’s biggest names (and environmentalists). 
The Financial Times has a report here on air traffic congestion caused by too many private jets flying to and from Durban, South Africa, all thanks in large part to celebrities and leaders; some of whom are well-known for environmental activism. Angela Merkel for example made the flight from Germany to South Africa to watch Germany’s quarterfinal game. Bill Clinton attended some USA matches.
But Leonardo DiCaprio emerges as the World Cup champion hypocrite. Enviro-Dicaprio thinks its okay to jet-set between his mansions, sporting events and Las Vegas nightclubs with Paris Hilton, after making his bust enviro-drama documentary, which admonishes the rest of the world to live more modestly.
Can you see the solar panels? Well, neither can I. 
Indeed, congestion caused by the environmentally destructive private jet traffic in Durban got so bad that it caused additional environmentally destructive rerouting of commercial jets. According to the Financial Times: 
The situation was described as “absolute chaos” by the pilot of one British Airways flight which took off from Cape Town in mid-afternoon but was diverted to Johannesburg.

The BA pilot added: 
…that the problem was caused by the airport allowing too many private jets to land at Durban, leaving the runways clogged up and unable to accept scheduled flights. 
The BA pilot also 
…told passengers he had no choice but to take the plane to Johannesburg because the plane’s fuel was starting to run low. 
Flights had to be rerouted to Johannesburg so as not to interfere with the travelling celebrities. 
The baggage hall at OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg was filled with scores of angry fans, some of whom said they had spent up to R10,000 ($1,300) for their semi final tickets.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m beginning to wonder if Germany’s online Die Welt daily is still a serious publication. Certainly not its fiction fantasy alarmism science section, which has become an outlet for every wildly imaginable climate catastrophe scenario.
It’s become sort of a laughing stock, along with much of the rest of Germany’s established media.
Yesterday Die Welt reported here on how scientists at the University of Giessen’s Institute For Plant Ecology, based in the central German state of Hesse, have conducted experiments that have yielded “surprising and worrisome” results.
For 12 years scientists have been simulating climate change in a time lapse by pumping CO2 over a green pasture area at levels that are expected to be reached in the year 2030 (bought-and-paid-for junk science).
The results showed that the added CO2 did not lead to higher CO2 concentrations in the ground. Moreover, it led to higher emissions of nitrous oxide. The scientists found it “alarming”. In addition, the times at which plants blossom and foliage changes colours have changed. Plants have a phenological clock says Christoph Müller, Director of the Institute For Plant Ecology. He says:
One sees: The clock has shifted a little.
A little? Die Welt does not define how much “a little” actually is, but it must be enough to allow it to write:
The winters have shortened, the springs are starting earlier. According to projections, spring could begin already at the end of January after 2030.
According to Müller:

The climate in Hesse has changed. The vegetation has responded to climate change.”
That itself should not surprise anyone, unless of course one is among those who are ignorant of climatic and oceanic cycles, and who happen to believe that climate stagnation is the natural norm (when humans are not around). Maybe Müller believes this. In the Die Welt report he says 0.7°C temperature increase is something that took thousands of years to occur in earlier history. Today this is occurring in just 100 years!
Perhaps all those ice-bore proxies are wrong now. Maybe the earth needed thousands of years to come out of the ice age, and not hundreds as is thought to be the case.
And so it is in the “science” section of Die Welt.
And what can we do to avert this coming climate catastrophe? Christopher Müller demands we handle energy in a different way, and calls for another way of living.
One reader calling him/herself Impfstoffel commented at the end of the article:
This year (2010) spring 2010 didn’t not get started until the end of May – at least where I live!!
And living in northern Germany, allow me to add to that: Fall this year started already in August!
I wonder if the media and scientists realise how stupid they are making themselves look before the educated public. The Die Welt readers who have felt comments are laughing at the story by the usual 10 to 1 margin.
I’ve filed this post under a new category: “Stupid Predictions”.

When people believe they have ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE, with no test in reality, this is how they behave.
Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.

Hopefully other blogs, especially those who can really make a difference, can join in as well. We are only asking for a voice in the discussion, that’s all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s because you’ve created them yourselves, or you’ve allowed yourselves to be blindly led into them.
I admit feeling a bit of Schadenfreude, reading the warminista blogs like Climate Progress, where they are all in shock. “Tell me it can’t be true!”
Come on guys, you couldn’t see this coming? Were you all so intoxicated and hypnotised by the movement that you couldn’t see it?

Betrayed this coutnry sound bite Al Gore sound bites

This spiral of violent behaviour started long ago and you were warned time and again. But your leaders told you not to listen. They told you that we are just deniers.
Climate Progress readers, and all you AGW religious faithful, the people who made this clip are your leaders, and they’re the ones who took you to this ghastly spot. Now you don’t want to believe it – again. How many times must this happen to you before you wake up?
First it was Climategate. But they took care of that for you. They whitewashed it, 3 times even, and that was enough so that you could manage to rationalise it away and begin to believe in the cause again. And so you continued to follow. When they cued you to chant “denier!, denier!” – you did so in unison, just as they instructed. When you were asked to call sceptics flat-earthers and to put them down – you obeyed, and on it went. You were taught and instructed to hate, and so you did.
And now this. The Truth.
It felt good while it lasted, though. You felt superior. And at the same time you had all these cool, hip and enlightened friends. You belonged. And you were saving the planet. You followed and followed. It was a cause.
Not long ago they had called on you to engage in civil disobedience, and many of you did that too, or you did what you could and cheered it on.
While your leaders orchestrated your thinking, they lived high on the hog making tons of money with it, flying all over the world in private jets, living in huge mansions, and decorated each other with awards.
Then they got the kids into the movement. After all it’s the future. The planet is at the tipping point. The kids have to be in fear along with the rest of you. And so you taught your kids to be afraid, to be very afraid, and that believer kids are cool, while sceptic kids are flat-earth deniers or just ignorant rednecks.
So let’s blow them up.

There isn’t enough room on the planet for them anyway. That’s what they kept telling you. Humans are parasites when you get down to it.
And what about parents? Well, many of them are just losers, stuck in yesterday. In fact they suck, too. They just want to ruin all the fun. So don’t listen to them. Either they’re with us, or they’re against us.

And what about the bastards who don’t believe and even have the audacity to argue against us? What shall we do with them? Well, we know where they live now, and where they work. Let’s drag them before Nuremberg trials and prosecute them for climate crimes. Yeah!
Trials? Come to think about it, why bother? Let’s just blow them up too – right there on the spot!

And now that your leaders have exposed themselves, look at how they’re trying to run and hide. Look at them deny they were involved. “It wasn’t us! We think the clip is disgusting too!”
You guys made the clip. It’s your work. Nice to see you finally think it’s disgusting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Green Parliamentarians in Germany have a lot of questions to answer.
Awhile back, spooked by a visit to Germany by Fred Singer, they sent a QUERY to the ruling government in attempt to stem the rising tide of skepticism in Germany.
Their query was filled with use of the word “denier” and attempted marginalize and demonize people who had different opinion, like the Berlin Manhattan Institute, EIKE, Fred Singer and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty.
Well, the Berlin Manhattan Institute, together with the Internet blog antibuerokratieteam.net, have fired back with a query of their own addressed at the green radicals. Below it’s in English.
It has 16 questions for the Greens to answer, though don’t get your hopes up that they will.
I was surprised by the extent the Greens are just hacks of industry – see Question No. 11.
========================================================
Query to the Parliamentary Faction ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS
From:      Berlin Manhattan Institute and antibuerokratieteam.net
To:            German Green Parliamentarians
Subject: Position of the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS regarding open scientific debate and tolerating people with different views
Parliamentarians Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans-Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Oliver Krischer, Undine Kurth (Quedlinburg), Nicole Maisch, Dorothea Steiner and the faction ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS submitted an official query to the German Government (BT-Printed Document 17/3613), 3 November 2010.
This query also included an assessment of the scientific reputation of “climate denier” Prof. Fred Singer, and further asked if any peer-review works questioning the AGW hypothesis exist, and, if so, are they supported by scientific data?
The query submitted by the Greens, and especially its condescending tone, compel us to present the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS with a query of our own.
We ask the following questions to the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS:
1. Are the Greens aware that there are over 800 scientific papers that have been published and peer-reviewed, as well approx. 4000 sources of cited literature in the NIPCC Report Climate Change Reconsidered which question man-made climate change, and are all supported by scientific data? If not aware, do the Greens intend to expand their scientific knowledge so that in the future they will know the number of scientific publications out there?  And if yes, then why do the Greens deny their existence?
2. Are the members of the Green Parliamentarian faction aware that climate science is in fact still a very new scientific field that it has only begun to process the vast amounts of data collected thus far, and that it produces new surprising findings daily and is still a long way from being understood?  Are the members of the faction of Green Parliamentarians aware that scientific theories require empirical confirmation, and that their truth cannot be tested by model analyses?
3. Will the Greens even send a representative to the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy taking place in Berlin on December 3 -4 2010 with the objective of having a scientific discussion with the distinguished scientists who will be speaking there? Or will you remain hidden in your bunker?

4. If the Greens believe that the question of climate change and its possible human causes is already settled for good, then why don’t they call for the end of all the taxpayer financing of climate research work, especially when all the questions are answered? Are the Greens still aware of any redundant, needless  scientific work still taking place now that the questions are answered?
5. Are the Greens aware of any other institution, except for the Pope and their own party, that claims to be infallible?
6. The Greens cite the publications of the IPCC. Are the Greens aware of any incidents where scientific works questioning manmade climate change were either suppressed on multiple occasions in concerted actions, falsified, falsely presented, or not based on scientific research subjected to peer review (e.g. Climategate, Himalayagate, Glaciergate, Amazongate)?
7. Are you aware that the scientific career of Prof. Fred Singer, whom you characterize as unserious and unscientific, includes the following achievements and milestones? At the age of 16, Singer, as a Jew, had to leave Austria with his parents and emigrate to the United States, received a B.E.E. in electrical engineering from Ohio State University in 1943, an A.M. in physics from Princeton in 1944, taught physics at Princeton while he worked on his masters and his doctorate, obtaining his PhD there in 1948, he worked on the rocket science program of Johns Hopkins University for studying the ionosphere from 1946 to 1950, was attached to the U.S. Embassy in London as a scientific liaison officer with the Office of Naval Research from 1950 to 1953 where he studied research programs in Europe into cosmic radiation and nuclear physics, became Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and of the Center for Atmospheric and Space Physics in 1953, directed the meteorological satellite services for the National Weather Satellite Center (today at the NOAA) in 1962, was first dean of the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences at the University of Miami in 1964, was deputy assistant secretary with the U.S. Department of the Interior in Water Management from 1967 to 1971 which at the time was also responsible for Atmospheric and Oceanic affairs, was also Deputy Assistant Administrator (Policy) at the U;S. Department of Environment from 1970 to 1971, Professor for Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia in 1971, retired 1994, and is author of numerous scientific papers and books.
8. Are the Greens aware that leading American climatologist Prof. Dr. Judith Curry, Director of Georgia Tech Institute Geophysical and Atmospheric Sciences, was invited on November 17, 2010 to appear before the Congressional Energy and Environment subcommittee to testify as an expert and said: “Manmade climate change is a theory, where the basic mechanisms are well understood but because of the extent of climate change due to feedback processes, it is highly uncertain. (…) The conflict over the theory of man-made climate change is based on our lack of knowledge on natural variability”? Do the Greens regard this scientist, who has published 144 peer reviewed papers, received numerous awards and was publisher of the American Journal Society for Meteorology, as a “denier”? Or is the Green Faction ready to acknowledge that there is also much theory in the field of climatology, just like in every other area of science?
9. Is it your view that distinguishing between unserious, unscientific work and serious, scientific work is done solely by determining whether a work supports or opposes the political standards of the Green Party?
10. Do the Greens believe that it is just a lucky coincidence that no journalist has ever gotten the idea to check up on the scientific reputation of experts that are paid by the Greens?
11. What is the Greens’ position on the fact that your politics accompanies the extreme subsidies to solar and wind energy, bought by donations from, among others, IBC Solar AG, SMA Solar Technology AG, Ostwind, Umweltkontor Renewable Energy, EWO Energietechnologie GmbH, Conergy AG, Pro Vento, Nordex AG, Windpark G. W. Meerhof GmbH & Co. KG, Ersol AGder Windpark GmbH & Co. KG, Wind Project Development GmbH, Solarworld AG, SMA Technologie AG, Solon AG fir Solar Technology, AGU Energy and Electrotechnology GmbH?
12. In which renewable energy industries, which are highly subsidized by law, and to what extent, have Parliamentarians of the Green Faction invested, and thus guaranteed themselves a sure financial return at the consumers’ expense?
13. Do the Greens intend to continue their constant use of the expression “climate denier” thus directly implying “Holocaust deniers”? If yes, do the Greens intend to amend corpus delicti of sedition (§ 130 StGB), so that future statements on climate change can be punished if they fo not comply with the party line of ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS?
14. Will the Greens continue to use public money to encourage and incite others to commit of acts of crime, such as vandalizing rail tracks?
15. Will the Greens call protests at nuclear waste storage facilities only when they are in the opposition, and do the opposite when they are not?
16. Are the Greens aware of the point you’ve reached today when you have to be asked such questions?
Berlin, 30 November 2010

Don’t be disturbed by this dear readers. Really, there’s no pressure in the message here. Just a friendly little remnider from your friendly http://www.1010global.org/ that we can all do our little part to save the planet. Of course you don’t need to.

Seriously, looking at the reactions at the other sites and comments, I see a lot of people using this to put thenselves high up on the moral pedestal, overdone indignation and grandstanding. Heck, you’d think the exploding people in the video were real people reading some of the comments. Sure the clip is in bad taste. But it’s just heavy, dark humour. Arguments could be made about the underlying message.
Will the video backfire? Definitely yes.
I think the Greenpeace hooded punk video is far worse. Here we have a kid that is brainwashed and trained to really hate (no humour there at all – pure hatred). Anyway, we see an emerging pattern of violent eco-activism.

Now that’s a clip to get upset about.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany has just put out a press release in English on a new study on the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon cycle: A new balance for the global carbon balance. If anything, the report shows there remains lots of uncertainty in the science that many like to call “settled”.
In climate science the only certainty is uncertainty.
Well worth reading. Some of the main points, according to the authors:
1. In most ecosystems, the photosynthesis rate at which plants fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere changes relatively little as the temperature varies.
2. The respiration of the ecosystems, when flora and fauna release carbon dioxide again, also increases to a lesser extent than has recently often been assumed when the temperature rises.
3. Moreover, this temperature dependence is the same all over the world – even in ecosystems as different as the tropical savannah and the Finnish needleleaf forest.
4. The climate is quite temperamental: countless factors are involved and many feedback mechanisms enhance effects such as the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. This makes it difficult to make predictions, especially as many processes in the Earth system are still not completely understood.
5. Results suggest that the availability of water, in particular, plays a decisive role for the carbon cycle in ecosystems. It is often more important than temperature.
6. Particularly alarmist scenarios for the feedback between global warming and ecosystem respiration thus prove to be unrealistic.”
7. The factor which determines the acceleration of the respiration thus obviously does not depend on the local temperature conditions and the specific characteristics of an ecosystem. “We were very surprised that different ecosystems react relatively uniformly to temperature variations.”
8. “It is still not possible to predict whether this attenuates the positive feedback between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature,” says Markus Reichstein. “The study shows very clearly that we do not yet have a good understanding of the global material cycles and their importance for long-term developments.”
9. “We were surprised to find that the primary production in the tropics is not so strongly dependent on the amount of rain,” says Markus Reichstein. “Here, too, we therefore need to critically scrutinize the forecasts of some climate models which predict the Amazon will die as the world gets drier.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Zeit has a report today, Climate Scientists Advise Eating Less Meat, admonishing westerners not to eat meat and not to drink milk, otherwise climate catastrophe will strike us violently.This of course is all based on “science” from the alarmist, government-funded Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, where activists like Stefan Rahmstorf and Dr. anti-scepticism Hans Joachim Schellnhuber busily examine and analyse each and every negative  impact of each and every western lifestyle sin (at PIK there is nothing positive in western lifestyles – everything is negative).
One potentially mortal sin is the human enjoyment of meat and dairy products. This unforgivable transgression has been carefully scrutinised by PIK climate-impact researcher Dr Alexander Popp, who says:
With a return to Sundays-only meat and reduced consumption of dairy products, Germans can become healthier and do the atmosphere a big favour.
Die Zeit reports, based on PIK science:
The culprits foremost are two climate-gases: methane and nitrous oxide. The first is produced by the digestion of cows and the manure they excrete. The second, and even more potent gas, nitrous oxide, results from fertilising fields.
Popp and his colleagues have calculated that emissions of the two above-mentioned gases will increase by 76% compared to 1995 if meat and dairy product consumption continues to rise at the current rate.

Only with a  changed lifestyle, one that more often refrains from meat and milk products, and one with a climate-friendly production, do the researchers say 1995 levels can be reached.
Shaking a finger, Popp admonishes that:
Today’s emissions levels of the western lifestyle are to blame, and for that reason it is to be expected that people in rich countries be the first to make lifestyle changes. ‘It’s about fulfilling the function of setting an example.’
Popp singles out the real culprits:
The lifestyle of Americans and Europeans acts as a model in developing countries, where meat and milk are status symbols, which is how it should be again for industrial countries, says Popp. For that reason, meat and milk ought not be on the dinner table every day.
So there you have it. Our tax dollars used to fund a bunch of eggheads who have nothing better to do than to gripe and moan, and to constantly nag the rest of society.
Guess what I’m having for dinner today!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGet ready for some short-term cooling in the months ahead. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has released its latest ENSO report.
The BOM says sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific have continued to cool, and so the tropical Pacific is now generally cooler than average.
Below the surface, temperatures also remain significantly cooler than average, with some areas more than 4°C cooler than normal. Trade winds in the western Pacific remain stronger than normal and cloudiness near the date-line continues to be suppressed.
The BOM adds:
These indicators, together with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which has been positive since April, are consistent with the developing stages of a La Niña event.




Climate models also predict further tropical Pacific cooling during the coming months. Most models predict cooling beyond La Niña thresholds before the end of the southern winter.


 


So with the high global temperatures we’ve seen over the last few months fizzing out, it’s the last chance for the warmists to get a few last words in for a while. Now the question remains: How strong will the La Nina get?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWarming leads to methane emissions from wetlands, and not vice versa. Photo: Wikipedia
There still remains much dispute as to whether warming causes higher greenhouse gas concentrations, or if more greenhouse gas concentrations lead to warming. We can all recall Al Gore standing near his temperature reconstruction in AIT misleading his viewers into thinking that CO2 comes first, and then the warming.
Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) released a report about two weeks ago that sheds more light on this. The complete press release can be read here in English.
40,000 years ago there was a rapid temperature increase accompanied by a rapid methane increase. What came first? Alarmists will have you believe that GHG is the driver. The Alfred Wegener Institute and others have looked into this. What have they found? Here are the main findings:
1. 40,000 years ago rapid warming led to an increase in methane concentration.
2. Climate researchers from the Universities in Bern and Copenhagen and from the Alfred Wegener Institute now conclude that the methane increase at that time was largely due to higher methane emissions from wetlands.
3. These natural methane sources produced more methane especially in high northern latitudes in response to the warming.
4. This result refutes the theory that large amounts of methane were released from the ocean sediment and led to higher atmospheric methane concentrations and thus to rapid climate warming.

You can’t get any clearer than that. But now enter German politics.
Still, contrary to their own findings,  the government-funded AWI goes on to insist their results do not imply that methane or other greenhouse gases play no role for climate change. And so they depart from science and start smacking for funding by adding the obligatory:
Our study reflects natural climate conditions during the last ice age, long before mankind affected global climate by emitting greenhouse gases. At that time climate warming caused an increase in methane concentration, generating in turn a more substantial greenhouse effect.
Of course they don’t offer proof for this last statement.
Now if this were true, you’d enter a vicious circle that would eventually spiral out of control. Yet, this has never happened in the history of the planet, let alone the last 100,000 years. Every time some other mechanism (one that many charlatan climate scientists refuse to acknowledge) always prevented the dreaded  irreversible tipping point.
Greenland temperature last 100,000 years. 
Does it really take a rocket scientist to tell you that climate conditions today, since 10,00 years, are relatively very stable? Look at the above chart. Looks awfully stable to me.  0.5°C is not unstable.
Weren’t climate conditions far more unstable during the ice age? Did the climate ever spiral out of control in one direction or another, meaning to an unbearble hothouse or a frozen solid ice ball? The answer is of course: no.
Conclusion: It takes a “climate scientist” (quack), not a rocket scientist, to tell you that today’s climate is unstable and spiralling out of control due to man.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe all know how do-gooder governments all over Europe and USA like to spend billions of dollars on every conceivable save-the-forests program worldwide.Well, it turns out they’re also spending billions on subsidising “green” wood-based bio-energy, which in fact is having the opposite effect, and thus contributing to the accelerated mass-destruction of forests worldwide. In the kooky world called “Green”, things always seem to work as follows:
1. Conjure up a fictitious future catastrophic problem, like AGW.
2. Demand governments enact programs designed to avert the catastrophe.
3. Watch these programs inflict real, massive environmental, social and economic damage right now.
Here’s yet another perfect glittering example from the world of Green.  The Global Forest Coalition has released a damning report WOOD-BASED BIOENERGY: THE GREEN LIE, which shines much light on Europe’s latest green mega-folly.
Journalist Stephen Leahy reports on it here: Europe’s Green Energy Portfolio Up in Smoke.
Here are some excerpts:
* In Europe’s vaunted green energy revolution 68.5% of its renewable energy portfolio comes from biofuels and burning wood for energy,
*27 million tonnes of wood biomass will be needed annually to supply planned power stations in the UK (United Kingdom).
* At least one million hectares of forest annually will be needed to feed the dozens of planned wood-fired power plants in Britain alone.
* The Netherlands is burning one million tonnes of wood annually. Germany is burning up to 16.5 million tonnes – mostly imported – and plans to double this figure by 2020.
*Deforestation eats up 13 to 16 million hectares every year and is responsible for 20 percent of the global warming emissions.
Deforestation is already a big problem globally without the biofuels boom. Promoting the use of wood material for biofuel will only accelerate deforestation.

According to Anne Petermann, executive director of the Global Justice Ecology Project:
We have an enormous deforestation problem already, there is no way massive increases in wood to feed bioenergy furnaces could ever be sustainable.
Leahy writes that particulate emissions from wood-burning are worse than coal, putting public health at risk. Biomass burning emits more fine particulates than coal. These invisible particles can damage lungs and make asthma worse.
Then there is all the energy and emissions involved in cutting, processing and shipping wood many thousands of kilometres from Africa, South America and Canada.

Not only are wood-based biofuels ecologically disastrous, but they are also economically unwise:
Subsidies in Britain will cost taxpayers about three billion dollars a year for the biomass power plants now under construction or planned, reports Robert Palgrave of Biofuelwatch.
Journal Science has bioenergy lands covering half of the planet’s arable lands by 2065.
Helena Paul sums it up:
The potential for disaster is absolutely enormous if this takes off in Europe and America.
Someone ought to remind Ms Paul what led to these disastrous policies in the first place. One may suggest that it was the green movement’s overzealous drive to save the planet from a highly exaggerated manmade climate change claim, all fueled and fanned by the media and kook green groups.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs mentioned in my last post, the Greens are now getting answers to the QUERY they submitted earlier to the German Government. The query is now proving to be a futile and sad attempt to stem the rising tide of skepticism in Germany, read here.
In this query, German Greens actually asked Angela Merkel’s government to deride climate science dissent and to join in on some sort of climate-denialsim. It was really weird, to say the least.
The German Government has aince responded to the green-query. From the answers, one clearly sees a German Government that is:
1) one-sidedly informed,
2) but is open to a scientific discussion (see no. 1o below).
It is true that Angela Merkel’s coalition government has made combating climate change a crucial issue. But much of that has to do with her one-sided activist advisers, particularly the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and its head, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber – the German climate science gatekeeper. This, as you will see, is confirmed by the Government’s response to the query.
Question no. 1 and 2 (paraphrased:
Are you aware of any peer-reviewed papers that dispute man-made global warming, and is there a discussion about the cause of climate change within the Government?
The Government responds claiming it bases its position solely on the findings of the IPCC and added:
The last IPCC report of 2007 has detected a definite warming  in the climate system and has determined that it is highly likely that the warming since the middle of the 20th century was caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
The Federal Government is not aware of any works that have been peer reviewed that put the assertions in doubt.
Here the Government is stating they are not even aware of the huge body of science disputing AGW. They’ve been shielded from it. We know there are 800 peer reviewed skeptic papers out there. It’s a question of getting that body of science to them. I find the part “since the middle of the 20th century” peculiar as well. Why not the entire century?
As the Wikileaks documents show, Chancellor Merkel has far more pressing geo-political matters to attend to. For climate, she is advised by Schellnhuber and by her Environment Minister Mr. Norbert Röttgen, who, incidentally, was assessed in a Wikileak document as being just a layperson on the topic of climate science and environment. Indeed the advice Merkel is getting is one-sided and woefully incomplete.
On the questions 3-6, all concerning Fred Singer:

Fred Singer is a well-known so-called climate change skeptic because of his frequent appearances in the media worldwide.”
Again, this shows the government is not well-informed. Fred Singer is not a skeptic of climate change; he’s skeptic of the claim that today’s climate change is for the most part man-made. The Government’s response also states that it does not gather information about individual scientists or make judgements on their expertise.
On Question no. 7:
Are there any voices within the German government who question the man-made causes of climate change?
To this question, the Government flatly says that it relies solely on the IPCC – period. Here, someone needs to explain to the Government that relying on a single source for important information is not a wise idea, and is negligent. The German Government seems to believe that there is only one source of information, and that it [IPCC] is the only authority and is infallible.
On questions 8 and 9 concerning EIKE (and again Fred Singer), the German Government says it is not familiar with the organization. I doubt that’s true. But legally it’s a good answer.
QUESTION NO: 10:
Are you in favor of using public funds for spreading the claims made by climate deniers like Fred Singer?
The German Government welcomes an open scientific discussion on the importance and uncertainties of the results of climate science, as progress depends on lively and controversial discussions.”
Hardly what the green zealots and warmisnistas are calling for. It’s the exact opposite.
So we see that we have a government made up of a coalition that is woefully ill-informed, but at least goes on to say it is open to all scientific views.
Somehow we have to gently push the door open get the information in. But remember, Merkel is well-shielded. Certainly the process will take time, patience and effort, and may be much easier when the two ruling coalition parties are sitting in the offices of the opposition and the real hardcore greens and socialists are running the country into the ground.
For a copy of the Government’s response to the Query (in German), contact a spokesman at EIKE.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) features an interview here with think-tank director and top German climate advisor Dr. Oliver Geden, who has of late become Germany’s latest enfant terrible for climate activists.
Geden, a true warmist, has become exasperated by the approach used by policymakers in curbing CO2 emissions, and views goals like the 2°C target as pie-in-the-sky and counter-productive.
The FAZ asks Geden if Warsaw was a success. His answer:
No. It was a failure, even when measured by the lowest expectations.”
Geden believes the winners of the conference were the USA, India, and China “because they have succeeded in anchoring a system where every state can decide itself what it is ready to contribute“. Sovereignty sure sucks.
Among the losers he sees the EU at the head of the pack, and developing countries, who were counting on huge monetary transfers. Overall Geden believes that 2°C (450 ppm) target was a naïve goal and was doomed to fail from the start. He says that “The global emissions have risen dramatically since the beginning of the UN climate negotiations“. Moreover, rich industrial countries won’t fulfill their promises to pay poor countries, Geden asserts.

Geden also sees the chances of a meaningful international climate contract getting signed in 2015 as very slim. He says that countries within the EU are “hopelessly in disagreement” when it comes to the climate targets for 2030 and that Eastern European countries are no longer interested in taking on a leadership position on the climate issue.
He also mentions that Germany is not going to convince anyone as the country “will clearly miss its 40 percent reduction by 2040 target“. Geden adds:
In 2013 German emissions will in fact rise for the second year in a row.”
“2°C Target can still be reached!”
With a performance like that, it’s going to be awfully tough for Germany to be taken seriously as an example for the rest of the world. The FAZ then asks Geden if he thinks the 2°C target is now off the table for good. Geden sees the 2°C target as “in fact failed”. He concludes:
As nobody knows on how things are to proceed after that, we will be seeing still many more studies that will ‘verify’ that the 2°C still can be reached, even if only under the most absurd assumptions, like through ‘negative emissions’ in the second half of the century.”

Joe is just using the NOAA’s own data. Look at the NOAA’s projection for the months ahead.

You can find this chart: NOAA here
Take a good look at surface temps at the poles for early next year. It’s no wonder Joe has been predicting massive Arctic sea ice recovery starting next year, and adds:
 I mean both poles cold and then 75% of the earth under normal? Geez, I know there is cooling that is going to go on, but this is a bit drastic.
 If it’s the almighty climate models that are the reason to keep forecasting warm, and they are showing this kind of crash ( such an event could take the running 13 month temp of the earth next year to -.2 or -.3…as this La Nina, low solar cycle and cumulative volcanic activity means business, then things may be quicker than I thought.
Joe’s been predicting something like this for many months. Some people have been scoffing at his forecasts. Well now even the alarmist NOAA is confirming Joe’s forecast. I always say: If you need pretty good forecasts, then Go to Joe!

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Steven Sherwood’s newest climate crystal ball foretells that unless something drastic is done, terrible things are going to happen to our climate. And like in the regular fortune-telling business, there are plenty of customers just slurping it up.
Professor Sherwood of the University of New South Wales and a team of scientists now claim that climate models have underestimated global warming. Because clouds have not been correctly taken into account, the globe will likely heat up by close to 3° instead of 1.5°C by the end of the century. Study here.
But hyped climate fortune-telling is nothing new. The media love it. Early in the 20th century scientists had also warned of melting ice caps and rapidly rising sea levels, before warning of ice ages and extreme weather in the 1970s. And every time the scientists were almost certain and insisted action was paramount. And every time they were proved wrong.
The problem lies in that Sherwood’s claims are based on computer climate models, models that are chock full with assumptions (guesses).
Why climate models are unreliable for predicting the future of a non-linear chaotic system that is as variable as the climate is succinctly illustrated by Prof. Christopher Essex (photo right) in a presentation which I commented on here.
Because of the huge uncertainties involved in climate modeling, Prof. Essex, a leading international expert in computer modeling, calls projections for decades and centuries ahead using even today’s state of the art “Welcome to Wonderland”. The climate system is just too complex and it would take even today’s most powerful computer billions of years to run through a proper algorithm.
The results that today’s models put out are based on the crude assumptions that get fed in. When a model maker guesses that the globe is going to heat up, then that’s what his model will show.
Not only do modeling experts scoff at the claimed predictive powers of climate models, but so do some advisers to decision makers. Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s top business adviser Maurice Newman, for example, once said the world “had been held hostage by climate madness.”
In the UK Telegraph here, Newman is quoted as saying:

…the climate change establishment, led by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, remained ‘intent on exploiting the masses and extracting more money’.
‘The scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,’ he wrote in The Australian. ‘Global temperatures have gone nowhere for 17 years… If the IPCC were your financial adviser, you would have sacked it long ago.”
Global warming activists fired back, calling Newman and Abbot flat-earthers for not having faith in climate model prophesies.

All climate models projections are diverging from reality. Chart from Prof. John Christy, U of Alabama.
Yet, when one takes a closer look, the only thing that’s been flat lately are global temperatures (see chart above). Every model, most costing millions, failed to predict that global temperature would remain stagnant for almost two decades. Now it becomes obvious why experts like Essex describe them as “Welcome to Wonderland”.
Sherwood’s latest claim is in truth a profound departure from reality. In fact datasets are now even showing a slight decline underway over the last 6 to 8 years. The exact opposite is actually occurring. One has to ask what world scientists like Sherwood are really living in.
Naturally, one cannot exclude the possibility that Sherwood’s prediction may end up being right. As everyone knows: Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew IPCC report discovers the important climate factor…and ignores it!
By D. E. Koelle
According to its own statutes, the IPCC is mainly responsible for anthropogenic climate change – and much less so for natural climate change, which has been around since the Earth first appeared. That could very well be the reason why the sun gets mentioned only with respect to its solar irradiance intensity at the edge of the atmosphere. There the irradiance is 1361 W/sqm and is relatively constant, and so the role of the sun on mid-term climate change is not taken into account.
However, for the first time in the history of the IPCC reports, the 2013 AR5 report discusses the Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) as a decisively important factor (chapter 2.3.3.). Decisive for the climate and temperature changes is not the solar irradiance at the edge of the atmosphere, rather it is the amount of solar energy that makes it to the Earth’s surface.
Between the Earth’s surface and the outer edge of the atmosphere we have the atmosphere with its clouds and aerosols, which determine how much solar radiation eventually reaches the surface of the Earth. Since 1983 the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program (ISCCP) has been measuring global cloud coverage. One spectacular result was the decrease in global cloud cover between 1987 – 2000, from 69% to 64%, i.e. precisely during the period of warming that triggered the CO2 hypothesis.

Figure 1: Mid-term variation of mean global cloud coverage according to data from the ISCCP for the period 1983 to 2010.
Of course this finding did not fit well with the current popular narrative and was immediately criticized and doubted. This prevented it being adopted by the IPCC report of 2007. Indeed cloud observation and the evaluation of the data from satellites are difficult and the results are subject to interpretation. But in the meantime we have recognized that there is an objective method of determining the effects of clouds and the impact of solar dimming: by measuring the effective solar radiation at the surface of the Earth. For the first time this is discussed in the new IPCC report in Chapter 2.3.3 and is confirmed by the longest existing dataset from Stockholm. It shows a clear fluctuation of solar energy between 90 and 135 W/sqm. And the range is considerably greater at lower latitudes.

Figure 2:  Effective solar insolation at the Earth’s surface for Stockholm 1922-2010 (59° north latitude).

The data from Stockholm not only correspond to the ISCCP-results, but also to the global temperature trends. Not only do the rise of global temperature and SSR correspond between 1910 and 1940, but also for the temperature drop between 1944 and 1980, and the rise until 2000. Figure 3 shows a comparison of 10 temperature curves from 10 global weather stations, without the statistical manipulations of a so-called “global mean temperature”.

Figure 3: Real temperature measurement values from cities on the globe.
The SSR curve correlates excellently with the original GISS dataset for the US temperature history yin 1999, before it was tampered with.

Figure 4: The original GISS temperature history for the USA as it looked in 1999. It was then replaced by a new curve which moved the maximum value to the year 1998.
Even if the important SSR factor gets mentioned for the first time in an IPCC report, this does not mean it was taken into account in other chapters of the report, and especially for the temperature development – to the contrary – it was ignored. Only the CO2 hypothesis is valid. Here the entire 0.8°C temperature rise of the last 100 years, for which part or all of it gets attributed to CO2,  can be explained by the impacts of the effective solar radiation at the Earth’s surface without any CO2 effects.
Already the temperature rise of 0.6°C between 1910 and 1940 cannot be explained by the CO2 effect because the CO2 concentration increased by less than 10 ppm during the period (from 298 to 307 ppm). Then from 1940 to 1975 the temperature fell 0.2°C – and certainly not because of a CO2 drop. The renewed temperature increase of 0.6°C from 1980 to 1998 was the initiator of the CO2 hypothesis. However, the temperature increase can be better explained by the increase in SSR intensity. The fact that the predicted continued temperature increase never materialized, and that there’s been a slight drop since 2000, completely contradicts the CO2 hypothesis.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now, like the east coast of the USA, Germany is in the middle of a heat wave. Indeed the eastern parts of Germany and Poland are expected to stay hot with temperatures over 35°C (95°F) without an end in sight. Luckily I’m living in the northwest part of Germany, and here temps are expected to moderate somewhat by early next week.
Let me remind you that Joe Bastardi forecast a hot summer for Central Europe – and he’s right again. He had also forecast a cold winter 2009/10, and he hit that right on too. Who needs the Met!
Well it’s official. The first 6 months of 2010 in Germany were the coldest in 14 years, this is reported by the Readers Edition here.
The measurements go back to 1761. The first 6 months of this year (January through June) recorded an average temperature of 5.9 °C , the coldest since 1996. This value was almost 0.5°C below the longterm average of the reference value from 1961-1990 (6.4 °C).
So how does the rest of the year look for Germany and Europe as a a whole? The Readers Edition posted this graphic from the warmist NOAA. Looks like a hot July, but then cooling off.

Of course the German mainstream media hardly mentioned the cool first half year. They’re too busy complaining about the current hot weather, which most Germans rarely get and are now enjoying. And you can be sure that when August rolls around, the media will be trumpeting the “unusually hot July” as yet another sign of global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMinggu lalu kami sudah mengulas informasi mengenai tata cara bermain judi bandar dominoQQ, dan pada kesempatan kali ini kami akan sangat senang bisa membagi informasi mengenai jenis kartu spesial judi online untuk semua player yang ingin megetahui lebih dalam seperti apa jajaran kartu spesial yang bisa membawa kemenangan besar untuk setiap participant ceme. Jadi dari artikel ini kami akan menjelaskan satu per satu seperti apa kelebihan dari kartu spesial judi over the internet yang banyak diharapkan oleh para player di internet.
Mengenal Kartu Spesial DominoQQ
 	Kartu qiu qiu
Kartu spesial pertama ini terkenal dengan sebutan qiu qiu atau jika diartikan dalam angka adalah kartu dengan angka 9 yang artinya merupakan kombinasi kartu dengan nilai tertinggi. Untuk mendapatkan kartu 9 ini maka kombinasi dari dua kartu yang dibagikan memiliki nilai 9, contoh 6 + 3, 5 + 4, 7 + 2 dan sebagainya. Dengan kartu dominoQQ ini maka kemenangan akan jauh lebih besar dari taruhan yang anda pasang. Anda akan menerima bayaran 2 kali lipat dari bandar karena memiliki kartu ini, namun kalau bandar dan person sama-sama memiliki kartu 9 maka kemenangan ada pada bandar. Misal anda bertaruh 1000 rupiah dan mendapatkan kartu 9 maka bayaran yang akan anda terima sebesar 1.970. jadi kalau pasang 1 juta anda menang 1.970.000, besar bukan ?
 	Kartu murni kecil dan murni besar
Kemudian kartu spesial dari permainan situs dominoqq yang paling sering didapatan oleh kebanyakan player adalah permainan judi kartu murni kecil dan besar, kombinasi kartu ini banyak didapatkan para person yang bermain di meja 8 orang. Jadi untuk kemenangan yang didapatkan hanya 50 ribu saja dengan pembelian jackpot sebesar 1000 rupiah setiap ronde permainan. Untuk mengetahui apakah kartu anda murni kecil atau besar silahkan simak baik-baik. Kartu murni kecil ditandai dengan dua kartu yang memiliki nilai 1 – 9. Contoh kartu anda 2 + bandar 4 = 6, maka masih termasuk murni kecil. Sedangkan kartu murni besar kartu anda berjumlah 20 dan bandar juga 20. Namun anda tidak perlu bingung untuk membacanya, karena ketika anda bermain secara otomatis sistem akan mendeteksi apakah kartu bandar dan person memiliki jackpot.
 	Kartu Balak
Selanjutnya kartu spesial dalam permainan judi dominoQQ yang tidak kalah menarik adalah kartu balak yang mempunyai nilai kemenangan jauh lebih besar yaitu maksimal Rp.200.000 untuk pembelian jackpot sebesar Rp.1000 rupiah saja, kartu balak ini adalah kartu kembar yang mana kedua kartu anda memiliki kombinasi seperti  ( 2 + 2 ) dan ( 4 + 4 ), namun tidak akan berlaku jika bandar tidak memiliki kartu kembar. Sekali lagi bahwa jackpot hanya akan terjadi jika bandar dan participant memiliki kartu spesial. 
 	Kartu Spesial 6 Dewa
Terakhir kartu spesial yang paling banyak di nantikan oleh para penikmat judi online adalah kartu spesial 6 dewa. Kartu satu ini cukup langka didapatkan, biasanya per hari hanya keluar beberapa saja di meja secara acak, jadi semua peluang pemain sama untuk mendapatkan kombinasi ini. Namun seperti yang sudah kami katakan tadi bahwa jackpot hanya akan terjadi jika participant dan bandar memiliki kartu jackpot. 
Demikian informasi dari artikel mengenai jenis-jenis kartu spesial dalam permainan judi ceme on the web. Terima kasih.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate reveals periodic nature, thus no influence by CO2
Prof. H. Luedecke and C.O. Weiss
(Original German version here.)
We reported recently about our spectral analysis work of European temperatures [1] which shows that during the last centuries all climate changes were caused by periodic (i.e. natural) processes. Non-periodic processes like a warming through the monotonic increase of CO2 in the atmosphere could cause at most 0.1° to 0.2° warming for a doubling of the CO2 content, as it is expected for 2100.
Fig. 1 (Fig. 6 of [1] ) shows the measured temperatures (blue) and the temperatures reconstructed using the 6 strongest frequency components (red) of the Fourier spectrum, indicating that the temperature history is determined by periodic processes only.
On sees from Fig. 1 that two cycles of periods 200+ years and ~65 years dominate the climate changes, the 200+ year cycle causing the largest part of the temperature increase since 1870.

Fig. 1: Construction of temperatures using the 6 strongest Fourier components (red),  European temperatures from instrumental measurements (blue). It is apparent that only  a 200+ year cycle and a ~65 year cycle play a significant role.
The ~65 year cycle is the well-known, much studied, and well understood “Atlantic/Pacific oscillation” (AMO/PDO).  It can be traced back for 1400 years. The AMO/PDO has no external forcing it is “intrinsic dynamics”, an “oscillator”.
Although the spectral analysis of the historical instrumental temperature measurements [1] show a strong 200+ year period, it cannot be inferred with certainty from these measurements, since only 240 years of measurement data are available. However, the temperatures obtained from the Spannagel stalagmite show this periodicity as the strongest climate variation by far since about 1100 AD.
The existence of this 200+ year periodicity has nonetheless been doubted. Even though temperatures from the Spannagel stalagmite agree well with temperatures derived from North Atlantic sedimentation; and even though the solar “de Vries cycle”, which has this period length, is known for a long time as an essential factor determining the global climate.
A perfect confirmation for the existence and the dominant influence of the 200+ year cycle as found by us [1] is provided by a recent paper [2] which analyses solar activities for periodic processes.

Fig. 2: Spectrum of solar activity showing the 208 year period as the strongest climate variation.
The spectrum Fig. 2  (Fig. 1d of [2]) shows clearly a 208-year period as the strongest variation of the solar activity. Fig. 3 (Fig. 4 of [2]) gives us the solar activity of the past until today as well as the prediction for the coming 500 years. This prediction is possible due to the multi-periodic character of the activity.

Fig. 3: Solar activity from 1650 to present (measurement, solid line) and prediction for the coming 500 years (light gray: prediction from spectrum, dark gray: prediction from wavelet analysis). Letters M,D,G denote the historical global temperature minima: Maunder, Dalton, Gleissberg.

The solar activity agrees well with the terrestrial climate. It clearly shows in particular all historic temperature minima. Thus the future temperatures can be predicted from the activities – as far as they are determined by the sun (the AMO/PDO is not determined by the sun).
The 200+ year period found  here [2], as it is found by us [1] is presently at its maximum. Through its influence the temperature will decrease until 2100 to a value like the one of the last “Little Ice Age” 1870.
The wavelet analysis of the solar activity Fig. 4 (Fig. 1b of [2]) has interesting detail. In spite of its limited resolution it shows (as our analysis of the Spannagel stalagmite did) that the 200+ year period set in about 1000 years ago. This cycle appears, according to Fig. 4, regularly every 2500 years. (The causes for this 2500 year period are probably not understood.)

Fig. 4: Wavelet analysis of solar activity (showing which periods were active at which time). The dominant oscillations (periods between 125 years and 250 years) are clearly recognizable and recurring at 2500 years.
Summary
The analysis of solar activity proves the existence and the strength of the 200+ year periodicity which we found from historical temperature measurements, as well as from the Spannagel stalagmite data. This 200+ year cycle is apparently the one known as “de Vries cycle”.
This solar “de Vries cycle together with the AMO/PDO determine practically completely the global climate of the past  (Fig. 1) and the coming time. A significant influence of CO2 on the climate thus has to be excluded. This latter is not surprising in view of the small amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and its weak infrared absorption cross section (also in view of the various proves of NEGATIVE water feedback).

Fig. 5: Predicted global temperature of “official” models  (red) and real (measured) global temperature (green).
The present “stagnation” of global temperature (Fig. 5) is essentially due to the AMO/PDO: the solar de Vries cycle is presently at its maximum. Around this maximum it changes negligibly. The AMO/PDO is presently beyond its maximum, corresponding to the small decrease of global temperature. Its next minimum will be 2035. The temperature can expected to be then similar to the last AMO/PDO minimum of 1940. Due to the de Vries cycle, the global temperature will drop until 2100 to a value corresponding to the “little ice age” of 1870.
It accounts for the long temperature rise since 1870. One may note, that the stronger temperature increase from the 1970s to the 1990s, which is “officially” argued to prove warming by CO2, is essentially due to the AMO/PDO cycle.

In April I got just over 8000 visits, and in May almost 28,000. Thanks readers!  I think I can allow myself a little indulgence of some sherry wood finish Glenmorangie to celebrate.
I got a lot of help from Big Blog, i.e.  climatedepot, WUWT  and Bishop Hill. When these boys drop your name, you really see spikes in the traffic volume.
But I’m not doing it for the numbers (though I have to admit it feels good to see a spike).  It’s for fun, and it has been more fun than I ever imagined.
I’m gong to continue looking for stories that readers might not otherwise hear about. Repeating what the other blogs say is not my thing…though I may have done that a couple of times. I think it was Jeff Id at the Air Vent who said: to blog successfully, you have to spend a lot of time reading. THAT’S TRUE. Writing is acutally the easy part. Some bloggers have got to be going through reams of literature.
My highlight post for May was gate-blowup. It didn’t pull in the most traffic, but it’s the one I was most satisfied with. I’ll be updating it in the future.
And one more thing – not once did I have to snip a reader’s comment because of bad behaviour. To me that says a lot about the kind of readers us sceptics get. This claim that we’re all a gang of angry, belligerent malcontents is yet another warmist fantasy. Such rubbish they put out sometimes.

The DWD has issued the following storm track with projected barometric pressure.

Mi = Wednesday, Do = Thursday, Fr = Friday and Sa = Saturday, T = Low. Source: DWD_presse/status/408119086887870465.
The pressure is expected to drop to 966 hPa by Thursday as Xaver crosses southern Norway and reaches Sweden. Wind speeds could reach 180 km/hour at some North Sea coastal areas. Cities like Hamburg, Bremen and Rostock could see winds of up to 140 km/hr. The back side of the storm is expected to pump Arctic air down over Germany and causing blizzard conditions and heavy snow.

I can’t recommend the following video (below) enough: h/t: Stu, reader at Climate Progress.
I admit I’m backpedalling, and took the 1010 clip too lightly. I realise now why some people are so very upset about it. They are right to be so. The following video hits it home as to why radical anything is so dangerous.
I’m not saying that environmentalists are that far, but the intolerant, radical ones are certainly well on their way. When one starts fantasizing about blowing up children with the push of a button, something is terribly amiss.
I watched the clip below 3 times. The following passages struck me.
Look for yourself. This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers.
Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some 4 million people. And that was not done by gas.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe warmists continue to stay in denial about why the public isn’t buying the hoax, refusing to come to terms with the sloppy climate data behind the flakey AGW theory. Instead they prefer pretending that the public’s lack of acceptance is due to faulty communication, as illustrated by this video of Rutgers University professor Tony Broccoli.
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6L4jTypQKY&hl=de_DE&fs=1]
Read here at the Yale Forum On Climate Change And The Media.
It has finally dawned on the warmists that they’ve seriously underestimated the public’s ability to understand the issue. They’re dismayed that the public was smart enough as a whole not to fall for the hoax.
But they still think they can maybe turn things around by “communicating better”. which only means packaging and delivering the hoax in a diferent way. Now warm and extreme events are going to be called “teachable moments”. Cold and non-warming events will remain natural variability, I suppose.
Well, it’s not going to work.
Once a person sees through a hoax, there’s no way to make them go back and believe it. And it gets a lot harder the next time around because the trust is gone.
Finally, you just have got to love the question from Peach to Broccoli:
Let’s say I’m a journalist who knows nothing about climate science because all of the environmental reporters at my paper or station have been laid off. Do you have tips for me on how to grapple with climate change?
My advice: Wake up from the hoax and find real stories you know something about so that you yourself do not join the rest of the redundant journalists. View them as “teachable moments”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBill Dawson has a worthwhile piece at the Yale Forum on Climate Change and the Media. Over the last months the warmists have experienced setbacks and are scrambling for ways to get back on track.
One way is message change. Change the framing, branding, PR, spin, and choice of language. It might even include throwing long used visuals like polar bears under the bus. Here are some examples of the message massaging in climate communication Dawson examines.
Don’t focus on climate science
One strategy is de-emphasizing climate change. Pollster Frank Luntz says the focus has to be more on the benefits of a clean-energy bill – domestic jobs, a healthier environment, and potentially less money sent to the Middle East for oil – and less on climate science itself.
The first rule of fighting climate change: Don’t talk about climate change.
John Kerry’s recent Power America energy bill did just that and stressed the positive aspects:
‘It’s primarily a jobs bill, and an energy independence bill and a pollution reduction-health-clean air bill,’ Kerry said. ‘Climate sort of follows. It’s on for the ride.’
The language may have sounded good, but the bill flopped anyway.
New slogans for new times
Gore has been using the slogan “climate-crisis” for quite some time now. But there is a growing feeling that it too may have outlived its shelf-life, and so others are tinkering with new slogans. For example NYT columinist Thomas Friedman suggests  avoiding “global warming” and replacing it with  “global weirding.”

 The modified version better conveys scientists’ projections, he argued, ‘because that is what actually happens as global temperatures rise and the climate changes. The weather gets weird’.
Times blogger and former columnist Andy Revken prefers using “energy quest” because “climate crisis” is no longer a productive way the frame the issue.
Science communication – refine it or replace it
Warmists complain about the supposed huge gap between what scientists say and do, versus how they are portayed. NOAA director Jane Lubchenco told reporters in March:
“scientists have seriously underestimated the importance of explaining what we know about climate in a way people can understand.’
Some scientists took it to an extreme and countered critics by calling out their “McCarthyite campaign”, i.e. a letter in Science signed by 255 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
Less, not more, scientific input
Others say that less science input into politics is needed, not more. Massive amounts of data and information invariably lead to a higher likelihood of errors being discovered.
There’s a lot more in Dawson’s piece. Read it!
Gosselin’s communication advice:
Communication is important in science. But I feel that Dawson and the warmists are ignoring the real problem they have – their science is flawed. It’s the science stupid! (and not the communication).
