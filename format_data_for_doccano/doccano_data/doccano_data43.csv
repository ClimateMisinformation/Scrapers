"The former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has backed pupils who have been taking part in school strikes to protest over climate change and who are planning to join a “climate rebellion” next month, warning that the ecological crisis means “the future of the human race is now at stake”. Williams, whose stark comments come amid a growing wave of protests over the scale of the ecological crisis, said non-violent civil disobedience should have “wide and deep” support from the public.  “The nature of changes in climate and environment that we are living with threaten not only the wellbeing but also the being of our species on this planet in the long term – and in the middle term they threaten some of the most vulnerable populations on Earth,” he said. More than 100,000 pupils are planning to walk out of lessons in 60 countries on Friday as part of the schools strike movement. And in April thousands of “concerned citizens” are expected to descend on London for a campaign of mass civil disobedience designed to bring widespread disruption to the capital. In a video message in support of the April event, organised by Extinction Rebellion, known as XR, Williams said: “It is not surprising people in this urgent situation feel they have to take non-violent direct action – they have got to find a way of putting the case for the human race before those in power. That is what Extinction Rebellion [is] doing, that is what the Friday [school] strikes are doing.” XR, which has the support of hundreds of academics and scientists, is demanding the UK government tells the truth about the ecological crisis and enacts legally binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025. It also wants a citizens’ assembly to oversee the transformation to a sustainable economy. The group closed London bridges in November, and this time it intends to bring widespread disruption to London until its demands are met. There is growing evidence of the scale of the climate emergency. Last year a UN report said there were only 12 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown from floods and heatwaves to food shortages and huge numbers of climate refugees. Williams added: “I believe a wide and deep support from the public is needed to bring this matter fully to the attention of our political leaders. To show we can actually achieve democratic change for the good of everybody.”"

"The coal baron and Liberal National party donor Trevor St Baker has blasted the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Guy Debelle, for sounding the alarm on climate change, branding a significant speech on Tuesday warning of risks to Australia’s financial stability “totally inappropriate”. The politically connected founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power, who has approached the Morrison government to underwrite new coal developments in Victoria and New South Wales, including a high-efficiency plant on the site of the AGL-owned Liddell power station, told the ABC on Wednesday Debelle’s intervention was out of order.  The RBA deputy governor on Tuesday noted businesses and policymakers needed to consider climate change as a trend and not a cyclical event, and said climate change-induced shocks to the economy would be “close to permanent” if droughts were more frequent and cyclones happened more often. St Baker responded by suggesting Debelle lacked technical understanding of how the electricity market worked. He said Australia was a world leader in the uptake of wind and solar, and declared “wind and solar cannot support an electricity supply system’s voltage and frequency”. “The Reserve Bank governor, the speeches they are making, are totally inappropriate,” he said. “The fact is in an island community, you must have at least 50% at any time of the electricity demand being supported by what we call synchronous generation, that is 24/7 power: nuclear, gas, coal-fired, or baseload hydro. “We don’t have any of those except coal as an economical source that we build a business on, and for the Reserve Bank governor to be entering the debate now, at a time when we have university students supporting, schoolchildren supporting, a strike to go 100% renewable in Australia by 2030 – it’s just part of the problem – especially at election time”. In a separate interview on the ABC, the resources minister Matt Canavan – who has been a forceful advocate inside the government for new coal developments – also defied recent comments from Scott Morrison, declaring there was a “clear need for additional power in north Queensland”. Morrison said earlier in the week the government was not contemplating coal plants in Queensland – which is what a number of Queensland Nationals, including Canavan, want – because a new plant would never be approved by the state government. Canavan told the ABC: “There is a clear need for additional power in north Queensland, multiple studies have shown that, and those studies come back always saying that a Hele [high efficiency plant] or a new coal-fired power station would make a lot of sense in north Queensland”. St Baker’s company signalled it was interested in buying the ageing Liddell plant in 2017 when the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull publicly castigated AGL, the plant’s owner, for wanting to close the facility in 2022 and replace it with a combination of renewables and gas. But despite the sustained political pressure, AGL has shown no interest in selling the asset. After growing frustration with energy companies, the government last year produced the so-called “big stick” package which created a power to break up energy companies if they engaged in price gouging, which some energy experts have long suspected was a mechanism to remove Liddell from AGL’s ownership. The government was forced to pull the package because it would have to cop a Greens/Labor amendment in the House that would prohibit taxpayer support for new coal-fired power. But rebel Queensland Nationals want it back on the agenda before parliament rises. While Liberals in city seats remain concerned that the government risks losing the coming election, at least in part, because of its record on climate change, Nationals are keeping up the pressure for new coal developments. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has confirmed the Morrison government is continuing to assess new coal-generation projects despite pushback from moderate Liberals, but he says taxpayers will only support projects that are “viable”. St Baker told the ABC on Wednesday he had brought three potential projects to the government for taxpayer underwriting – a pumped storage project in South Australia, coal projects in Victoria, and a replacement power station on the Liddell site in New South Wales. St Baker said he believed replacing Liddell with a new high-efficiency plant “using all that infrastructure” was the “best solution” if Liddell had to close. He said the projects would be 70% debt financed and 30% equity. He said the government had indicated if projects could secure commercial and industrial customers on five-year contracts it would provide a taxpayer-backed guarantee for the project. Taylor told Guardian Australia on Wednesday the government would only back projects that were “viable”. Nationals have demanded the government support projects whether they have a compelling business case or not."
"Dearbhail McDonald (We need to talk about the children we’re not having, 8 March) makes some interesting points but seems to miss the essential nature of the problem, which is over, not under, population. Our species took some 200,000 years to reach its first billion individuals in the mid-1900s, then doubled that number in 70 years. By the 1960s, by which time the figure had risen to over 3 billion, a number of wise voices were raised but effectively ignored. Now we are approaching 8 billion and overall the numbers are still rising even though just about every existential threat our planet faces is either directly caused or exacerbated by our ever-swelling numbers.  Countries where a decline has set in should be adapting and celebrating what, if managed sensibly, could be the best environmental news in a century. Yes, there will be demographic problems initially. But these can be tackled with a move to a new economic paradigm that our planet needs to survive. Growth economics must be consigned to the dustbin of history and new technology, together with new status and rewards for carers, employed to ameliorate the problems of old age. To do this there needs to be a massive redistribution of wealth and selfish vainglorious politicians must stop trying to coax and con people into having more children. Will this work? Well, it should have started at least half a century ago. But it is the only hope now for our planet and therefore for all of us, because we don’t have a spare one available.Steve EdwardsWivelsfield Green, East Sussex • Yet another article fretting that a falling birth rate “is one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time”. Sure, in the UK, our pension system, housing and immigration policy need to be overhauled. But please will people face the major problems of the future. There are now more people alive than ever before. Already climate change, species extinction, pollution of seas and air, soil degradation, antibiotic resistance and sea level rise are all having an impact. These factors are global problems that can lead to famine, disease, resource wars and mass migration of climate refugees – a real humanitarian crisis.

There still remains much dispute as to whether warming causes higher greenhouse gas concentrations, or if more greenhouse gas concentrations lead to warming. We can all recall Al Gore standing near his temperature reconstruction in AIT misleading his viewers into thinking that CO2 comes first, and then the warming.
Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) released a report about two weeks ago that sheds more light on this. The complete press release can be read here in English.
40,000 years ago there was a rapid temperature increase accompanied by a rapid methane increase. What came first? Alarmists will have you believe that GHG is the driver. The Alfred Wegener Institute and others have looked into this. What have they found? Here are the main findings:
1. 40,000 years ago rapid warming led to an increase in methane concentration.
2. Climate researchers from the Universities in Bern and Copenhagen and from the Alfred Wegener Institute now conclude that the methane increase at that time was largely due to higher methane emissions from wetlands.
3. These natural methane sources produced more methane especially in high northern latitudes in response to the warming.
4. This result refutes the theory that large amounts of methane were released from the ocean sediment and led to higher atmospheric methane concentrations and thus to rapid climate warming.

You can’t get any clearer than that. But now enter German politics.
Still, contrary to their own findings,  the government-funded AWI goes on to insist their results do not imply that methane or other greenhouse gases play no role for climate change. And so they depart from science and start smacking for funding by adding the obligatory:
Our study reflects natural climate conditions during the last ice age, long before mankind affected global climate by emitting greenhouse gases. At that time climate warming caused an increase in methane concentration, generating in turn a more substantial greenhouse effect.
Of course they don’t offer proof for this last statement.
Now if this were true, you’d enter a vicious circle that would eventually spiral out of control. Yet, this has never happened in the history of the planet, let alone the last 100,000 years. Every time some other mechanism (one that many charlatan climate scientists refuse to acknowledge) always prevented the dreaded  irreversible tipping point.
Greenland temperature last 100,000 years. 
Does it really take a rocket scientist to tell you that climate conditions today, since 10,00 years, are relatively very stable? Look at the above chart. Looks awfully stable to me.  0.5°C is not unstable.
Weren’t climate conditions far more unstable during the ice age? Did the climate ever spiral out of control in one direction or another, meaning to an unbearble hothouse or a frozen solid ice ball? The answer is of course: no.
Conclusion: It takes a “climate scientist” (quack), not a rocket scientist, to tell you that today’s climate is unstable and spiralling out of control due to man.

"For once, Philip Hammond’s spring statement acknowledged the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife and insect populations around the world. But has the chancellor been swept up by the rising tide of climate activism? Has he been inspired by the courage and passion of the young people joining school strikes to defend their futures? Sadly not. In fact, his announcement of a “global review of the economic benefits of biodiversity” subverts what those activists stand for. Apparently incapable of comprehending the green stuff outside his office window, Spreadsheet Phil is embarking on a project to reduce the wonder of the natural world to a shopping list. While measuring the clarity of our streams, the vibrance of our meadows and the health of our wildlife in financial terms can help to persuade the Hammonds of the world of their value, the government must not succumb to the idea that the living systems we depend on are replaceable. Industries generating profits from destruction will never be more valuable than the skies, the rivers and the landscapes they pollute. His “global review” was just one of a string of consultations, calls for evidence and studies announced in this procrastinating spring statement – when what we need is immediate action. It’s no coincidence that school children are striking on this government’s watch, or that activists are organising as never before. It’s no accident that more than 25 local councils have declared climate emergencies in just the past few months. While the world’s top scientists warn that we have little more than a decade to prevent runaway climate change, and wildlife populations are in freefall around the world, our government is facilitating further attacks on nature. In the UK right now, almost 60% of species are in long-term decline, and one in five mammals are at risk of disappearing altogether. Globally, over the past 40 years, wildlife populations have declined by 60% on average. If ministers were serious about reversing this death spiral, Hammond would have announced urgent funding to restore peatland, forests and soils, and expand protected places where people can engage with nature. Instead, ministers have spent the past decade systematically gutting Natural England – the agency responsible for looking after our most precious habitats. They’ve slashed its budget by more than half, cut around 1,000 staff and crippled its ability to monitor protected areas. Environment secretary Michael Gove might talk a good game on threats like ocean plastics – but he, too, is in the habit of endlessly consulting on plans to consider doing something in a few years’ time. He also says all the right things on pesticides, but in practice has done nothing to stop farmers “drenching” their fields with insect-killing chemicals. On the global scale, as world leaders prepare to set new targets for protecting nature next year, the UK government missed the deadline to submit a key report to the UN on the state of our wildlife and ecosystems. Finally published this week, it admits that ministers will fail to meet all but five of the existing targets for protecting nature – setting us up to fail on the more ambitious goals we urgently need. Meanwhile, as climate chaos takes hold and threatens the wildlife and the landscapes we know and love, our government only adds fuel to the fire. Since 2010, ministers have effectively banned onshore wind energy and undermined solar power – while building a brand new fossil-fuel industry and exporting their enthusiasm for fracking around the world. They scrapped zero carbon homes targets in 2015 – yet the chancellor boasted of announcing “new” energy efficiency standards yesterday. He also said he wants travel providers to offer carbon offsets to passengers – but remains committed to building new runways. Delay, dither and contradiction – that is the government’s approach to the biggest crisis we face. Climate breakdown is happening. Toxic air is killing thousands. Animals are facing extinction. The causes and solutions to these crises are not in doubt: they are the direct result of the chancellor’s single-use, fossil-fuelled, profit-driven economy. Now is not the time for more global reviews and obfuscation – now is the time to transform our economy so it restores the natural world, instead of commodifying and consuming it. But yesterday’s announcements are a sign that ears are pricking up in Downing Street. Ministers can hear the rising voices outside – and they know they cannot be ignored. The school strikers and climate activists have attracted enough attention to warrant a fobbing-off. If they persist, they might just win the real action they’re demanding. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"Liberal senator Linda Reynolds has told ABC’s Q&A program that the passage of last month’s medevac bill for critically sick refugees made her “almost physically ill” because she “lived through terrorism and … the Bali bombings”. Reynolds had been asked, in light of the Christchurch terror attack, whether Australia’s politicians and media had built a fear of migrants and “others” over the past decade.  Her answer prompted host Tony Jones to ask the Liberal minister whether she was linking refugees with terrorism. Questioner Ray Martin had asked the panel whether politicians created the Islamophobia that allegedly motivated the Christchurch attacker, who was Australian. “Isn’t it time that our political discourse is more measured, and politicians do not exploit the fear of others, as we have for many years now?” he asked. “You look back to Tampa, children overboard and issues like that. For a generation now sadly, every election time we start talking about immigration, border security … they’ve been couched, almost for a generation, around ‘others.’” Jones then asked Reynolds to respond to reports that Scott Morrison, when in opposition, urged colleagues to use the fear of Muslim refugees to win votes. “Do you agree that fear of others has been used for political purposes?” he asked. “This is a very personal issue for me,” Reynolds replied. “The circumstances that you were talking about are things I’ve lived through. Last month, I gave probably the hardest and most personal speech I’ve ever given in the Senate. And it was in response to Labor’s amendments to the medevac bill. “I was literally almost physically ill when I saw some of my Senate and House of Representatives colleagues in the chamber cheering and high-fiving the passage of these amendments. Because I was one of the few in that chamber who has lived through terrorism and the impact, up in the Bali bombings. “I was up there, I saw, I smelt and I got to understand the commodification of human beings. There are people in our own nation and there are people overseas who want to do us harm. They don’t respect our compassion. And they certainly do not respect our way of life.” Jones interrupted, asking: “Are you drawing a link between the Bali bombings and refugees coming to Australia for medical services?” Reynolds: “What I’m saying is that having my colleagues cheer for this policy that will inevitably lead to the boat trade coming again. “There are thousands of people who are up near north, who people smugglers don’t see as human beings, but as commodities to profit from. I saw that first-hand in 2001 and 2002. I saw the consequences on those who are desperate enough to come here and they drowned the most horrendous deaths. And it happened again when Labor opened the borders.” She said Morrison had not used anti-Muslim sentiment to win votes. “The prime minister has been very clear tonight it did not happen. It simply did not happen. For anybody to politicise this issue now … is inappropriate and tacky”. Earlier Reynolds also answered a similar question that asked whether politicians such as Pauline Hanson and Nationals MP George Christensen “bear some responsibility for the rise in Islamophobia”. “Now is the time for grieving,” she said. “It is the time for support … it is a time for all of us in politics to come together. It is not a time for a politician, a commentator to make cheap political points of this issue.” But she also called on her colleagues to censure independent senator Fraser Anning. Labor MP Cathy O’Toole said Christchurch had “drawn our attention to the consequences of [our]words” and told politicians and media “to be much more mindful”. The rest of the episode then discussed the impact of the Townsville floods and climate change on rural Australia – as had been initially planned before Friday’s attack occurred. Professor Stephen Williams told the audience “climate science has been predicting an increase in extreme events [for 30 years]. “We’ve had the hottest summer on record, we’ve had the hottest year on record. My son, who is 18, 17 of his 18 years have been the hottest on record for the globe.” Williams praised the actions of the climate strikers – as did Reynolds. “How many students here went on strike and did their protest?” she asked. “Can I say I love your passion and I love your commitment. It is great you are engaging in democracy and having your say about climate change.” Reynolds told the crowd she believed in climate change, but said her ministerial responsibility was “not carbon emissions”, but “how do we look at the dumb things we’ve done to make it worse”. “How do we make sure we don’t build houses in floodplains … that the roads and infrastructure we build don’t wash away every time we get flooded,” she said. O’Toole said she was a believer in “prevention rather than reaction after the event” and criticised the government for not doing enough. When asked if Labor would give support to the Adani coalmine, O’Toole she said she would represent the community of her Queensland electorate. “People in the north do not like people in the south-east telling us what we can and can’t do,” she said. But then added: “It is not a wise community that invests all its eggs in one basket.”"

"A UK-wide campaign is being launched to persuade one of the country’s biggest high street banks to stop investing billions of pounds in the fossil fuel industry. Activists from the Labour-supporting Momentum group will team up with the environmental group People and Planet to stage more than 40 “creative direct actions” at Barclays branches in town and cities across the UK later this month.  The campaign has been inspired by the school climate strikes, in which 1.4 million young people took to the streets last weekend to voice their fears about the escalating ecological crisis. The “UK Uncut-style” protests aim to put pressure on Barclays, which organisers say is one of the leading European backers of fossil fuel projects, financing 15 fossil fuel companies with more than $30bn (£22.6bn) from 2012-17, including corporations pushing ahead the plans to develop the fracking industry in the UK. John Taylor, a member of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “Climate change is already devastating communities around the world, and fossil fuel companies and their financiers are to blame. A decade ago the banks crashed the economy, now they’re crashing the planet.” He said it was time ordinary people came together to “face the banks that fund climate breakdown head on”. He added: “Inspired by the young people participating in the youth climate strikes around the world, we’ll be organising Labour members to take action against Barclays, who have funded fossil fuel companies to the tune of $30bn between 2012 and 2017.” Barclays highlighted investments made by the bank in environmental schemes and stated that in 2018 it had “facilitated” £27.3bn in “environmental and social financing”. A spokesperson added: “Our approach balances the need to accelerate the transition away from the most carbon intensive fossil fuel sources, with ongoing financial support for clients operating responsibly in energy sectors that are expected to contribute significantly to the world’s energy mix.” However, a report out on Wednesday from the Rainforest Action Network and the BankTrack group, which tracks and analyses the investments of banks around the world, found Barclays was “the top European banker of fracking and coal [and] leads as the worst European bank, with $85bn poured into fossil fuels and $24bn into expansion”. The campaign will start on Saturday 30 March and organisers say that more than 40 actions are already planned by members and local groups across the UK. Momentum said the campaign was using organising techniques pioneered in the US by the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016, including mass conference calls to mobilise members and the use of WhatsApp groups to mobilise people locally. On Monday evening, Momentum held a conference call with more than 100 organisers around the country featuring speakers from the UK youth climate strikes. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a Der Spiegel report today:
The world community is preparing a world climate treaty – but the first reactions sound pessimistic.
About 4500 participants from all over the world have gathered in Bonn in an attempt to forge a new world climate treaty in talks that will last two weeks. But so far talks have shown that no quick solutions are in sight. Der Spiegel writes:
Delegates and observers are almost unanimous on the view that a new world climate treaty won’t be achievable in time for Cancun at the end of 2010, this after the disaster in Copenhagen. At the conference in Bonn, the target is to lay at least the cornerstones for a partial success.
Government delegates have presented a new 42-page draft with options for contents of negotiation.
Der Spiegel writes: EU climate targets on ice!
Artur Runge-Metzger, Climate Protection Director of the EU Commission, emphasized that the EU’s target of reducing GHG emissions by 30% are not off the table. But the EU will go ahead with the 30% target ONLY IF other countries do their fair share in global climate protection.
Emphasis above is mine.
The EU has also pledged €2.4 billion in immediate aid to poor countries for climate protection. It was agreed in Copenhagen that industrialised nations would pay developing countries approx. $30 billion in immediate aid between 2010 and 2012. Developing countries have complained that they haven’t received anything so far.

"Gas boilers will be replaced by low-carbon heating systems in all new homes built after 2025 in an attempt to tackle the escalating climate crisis, Philip Hammond has said. In his spring statement, the chancellor said new properties would use alternative systems, such as heat pumps, to help the UK reduce its carbon emissions.  However, Hammond appeared to row back on implementing the full recommendations from the government’s advisory committee on climate change last month, which called for new homes to have no gas for cooking or heating from 2025. The move away from gas heating in new homes was given a cautious welcome by environmental groups, although they said the chancellor had to be more ambitious, systemic and radical if the government was to get to grips with the climate emergency. Housebuilders said they supported moves to more environmentally sustainable systems, but alternative heating was often more expensive and less effective. A spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation said the ongoing “costs and comfort of homeowners was an absolute priority” for its members, pointing out that heat pumps required bigger radiators and did not work as well in cold snaps. “New technologies are increasingly being incorporated that drive down emissions and we are committed to continuing to work with government on this … [however] it must be ensured that alternative heat sources are suitably attractive, available and efficient before withdrawing existing options,” he said. The report from the committee on climate change said it would cost £4,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, but £26,300 in an existing house. Around 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions come from homes and last year emissions from housing increased – mainly from gas boilers. The committee said that to meet the UK’s existing climate targets, considered too weak by many, all homes would have to virtually eliminate emissions in the future. However, a spokesman for the Treasury said no funding had been allocated to support the move to sustainable heating systems, adding that the plan would go out to consultation later this year. Hammond’s announcement on gas boilers was one of a series of environmental measures unveiled in his statement, alongside the protection of the waters around Ascension Island in the Atlantic, a new carbon offset scheme for aviation and a comprehensive global review of the link between biodiversity and economic growth, led by Prof Partha Dasgupta. But environmental groups said the measures did not go far enough. Mel Evans, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said although the plan to end fossil fuels in new homes was vital – and she welcomed the measures to protect wildlife – tackling the climate crisis required bigger thinking. “Issues like the shoddy state of our existing housing stock and rapid adoption of electric vehicles require serious money behind serious policies,” such as banning new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, she said. Dave Timms, from Friends of the Earth, said: “The chancellor should have announced a massive programme of investment in home insulation and public transport, instead of pushing the false solution of carbon offsetting for aviation.” Prof Sam Fankhauser, from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said the move was a “welcome step towards reducing carbon emissions” that had the potential to “significantly reduce emissions, especially if these are accompanied by measures to make homes more energy efficient. “To be fully effective, stringent standards for new homes need to be complemented by more funding for energy efficiency upgrades in existing homes, such as for insulation and better boilers.”"
"The New South Wales Labor party has wheeled out the former South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, to help bolster its credentials on climate change in key seats where the issue could be the decider. Climate change is the top issue in Coogee, currently held by the Liberals on a margin of 2.9%, and Balmain, which Labor hopes to reclaim from the Greens, which holds it by 4.7%.  Weatherill said the NSW Coalition had been a barrier to getting action on climate change when states tried to achieve an agreement on pricing carbon in the face of the federal Coalition’s inaction. “I think the conservative forces have completely misapprehended the community’s demand to take action on climate change and I think there will be very substantial judgments made by the electorates,” he said. “When the states were trying to search for a mechanism to put a price on carbon in the national electricity market – just about everyone in the universe thinks it’s a good idea – [the Berejiklian government] were backing the commonwealth’s compromise,” he said. As Labor premier for six years until 2018, Weatherill put South Australia at the forefront of adopting renewable power, which now provides 50% of the state’s electricity. However, a statewide blackout in 2017 during a ferocious storm, which caused windfarms to shut down and led to a chain of events that cut the interconnectors bringing electricity from interstate, prompted federal criticism of renewable energy and questions about whether intermittent power from renewables was viable. Weatherill responded by announcing a tender for a giant battery to stabilise the system, which was won by Tesla and built in under six months. He told the Guardian that the battery has almost paid for itself in a year. “It cost us $46m over 10 years; in its first year of operation it saved people in the SA region $45m. It’s largely paid for itself in 12 months, not to mention the stabilisation services its provided to the national electricity market,” Weatherill said. Famously, the then federal minister for energy Josh Frydenberg and Weatherill locked horns at a joint press conference over SA’s energy strategy. Frydenberg accused SA of trying to “go it alone” and Weatherill of “crash-tackling” his event. Weatherill hit back, claiming the Coalition was the “most anti-South Australian commonwealth government in living history”. Elly Howse, who is attempting to unseat the Greens’ Jamie Parker in Balmain, said the problem for minor parties was delivering on the promises they make. “If we don’t win, we will have four more years of a void in this policy space, and it doesn’t matter how much your local Green might be saying about this issue,” she said. Marjorie O’Neill, Labor’s candidate for Coogee, said climate change and the environment was the issue most raised with her, followed by overdevelopment and education. She said single-use plastics was a major concern in the beachside electorate. “Every other state has banned them except NSW,” she said."

"The climate crisis that is driving sea level rises and more extreme rainfall is making deadly storms like the one that hit southern Africa more severe, according to experts. Cyclone Idai, the tropical storm that ravaged Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, has been described as the worst weather-related disaster to hit the southern hemisphere, and the UN says more than 2 million people have been affected. Storm-surge floods of up to six metres have caused widespread devastation. Experts said it was too early to draw specific conclusions from Cyclone Idai, but the rapidly changing climate meant the destructive power of such storms was only going to increase in the future. Dr Friederike Otto, of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, said: “There are three factors with storms like this: rainfall, storm surge and wind. Rainfall levels are on the increase because of climate change, and storm surges are more severe because of sea level rises.” Otto said it was important to help communities in the worst-hit areas become more resilient to storms. “The standard of housing, the size of the population and effectiveness of the early warning systems … these are the sorts of things we need to think about as we move into a world where these events become more severe.” Paulo Ceppi, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, agreed it was inevitable that climate change would lead to more severe storms. “There is a direct link between global warming and cyclone intensity. We need to make every effort to follow the Paris agreement target of remaining below 1.5C of global warming in order to minimise future increases in the severity of tropical storms, [and] to achieve the Paris goal we need to start reducing global carbon emissions now.” Dr Rebecca Emerton, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading, said her team was working with experts in the area hit by Cyclone Idai to try to improve forecasting and warning systems. “It has been an active cyclone season in the Indian Ocean this year with seven intense cyclones already, compared to an average usually of three.” She said Idai was the biggest storm in the area since 2000. “We are working with partners there to see how good the forecasting is now and what can be done to improve it. That will be crucial if we are to try and mitigate the damage these storms do,” Emerton said. Mel Evans, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said the storm was further proof that the people least responsible for the climate crisis were suffering the most. “The average CO2 emissions of a citizen of Mozambique, Malawi or Zimbabwe is a tiny fraction of a European’s or an American’s. The people who have done the least to cause climate change are at the front of the queue to receive its impacts and have far fewer resources to prepare for the storm, or repair the damage.” Evans said the disaster should be a wake-up call to governments everywhere to urgently deliver on their climate goals."
"Still, and in defiance of decades worth of scientific evidence, vast numbers of people around the world refuse to accept that we are in the process of drastically altering the climate. Vast numbers more lack the information they need to interpret what is going on. This is a global problem whose importance cannot be overstated. It has no single solution. But giving up on trying to halt the damage to life on our planet is not an option. And in this context, this week’s suggestion by the former BBC weather presenter Bill Giles, that forecasts should be adapted to include information about climate change as well as local weather conditions, is extremely welcome. Weather and climate are not the same thing, and to confuse them would be unhelpful. But the rapidly developing science of weather attribution means that experts are now able to analyse extreme events including floods and heatwaves to determine the contribution of manmade climate change. Last summer’s UK heatwave, for example, was made 30 times more likely by greenhouse gases. Findings such as this could feature in the remodelled broadcasts, and play a valuable role in increasing public understanding. So could information about globally important climate-related events, such as updates on melting ice sheets in Greenland or Antarctica.  Currently such items are treated as news, if they feature in current affairs schedules at all. But often they do not, and there is certainly no systematic effort on the part of such programmes to keep their audiences apprised of what climate scientists think is going on. If taken up, Mr Giles’s proposal could lead to a re-evaluation of weather broadcasting – and a consideration of whether it is appropriate, in the era of global warming, to treat weather as the cheery endnote, delivered by a friendly face, that viewers have learned to expect. Weather forecasting has not remained static since it was invented in the 1860s by Admiral Robert FitzRoy, whose initial aim was to prevent shipwrecks. Over the years the methodology has altered dramatically. Forecasts have become far more accurate, and local environmental information such as levels of pollen and air pollution has been incorporated. Now, given what we know, it makes sense to focus our attention more widely. Last year was the fourth warmest on record, after 2016, 2017 and 2015. The UN warns that we have only 12 years left in which to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – that is, just over half a degree higher than now.  With carbon emissions still rising and a temperature rise of 3C expected to submerge cities including Shanghai and Miami within a century, the scope of our collective political failure is yet to be absorbed. In order to prevent disaster, governments must commit to changes far more drastic than anything agreed at the UN so far. Past experience suggests this will not happen unless public pressure is brought to bear with unprecedented force. The school strikes movement is an encouraging sign that a mass mobilisation remains possible. By contrast, a shake-up of weather forecasts might sound tame. But they could play a vital role if they helped convince a majority of voters that climate change can no longer be ignored, and should be their top priority."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Steven Sherwood’s newest climate crystal ball foretells that unless something drastic is done, terrible things are going to happen to our climate. And like in the regular fortune-telling business, there are plenty of customers just slurping it up.
Professor Sherwood of the University of New South Wales and a team of scientists now claim that climate models have underestimated global warming. Because clouds have not been correctly taken into account, the globe will likely heat up by close to 3° instead of 1.5°C by the end of the century. Study here.
But hyped climate fortune-telling is nothing new. The media love it. Early in the 20th century scientists had also warned of melting ice caps and rapidly rising sea levels, before warning of ice ages and extreme weather in the 1970s. And every time the scientists were almost certain and insisted action was paramount. And every time they were proved wrong.
The problem lies in that Sherwood’s claims are based on computer climate models, models that are chock full with assumptions (guesses).
Why climate models are unreliable for predicting the future of a non-linear chaotic system that is as variable as the climate is succinctly illustrated by Prof. Christopher Essex (photo right) in a presentation which I commented on here.
Because of the huge uncertainties involved in climate modeling, Prof. Essex, a leading international expert in computer modeling, calls projections for decades and centuries ahead using even today’s state of the art “Welcome to Wonderland”. The climate system is just too complex and it would take even today’s most powerful computer billions of years to run through a proper algorithm.
The results that today’s models put out are based on the crude assumptions that get fed in. When a model maker guesses that the globe is going to heat up, then that’s what his model will show.
Not only do modeling experts scoff at the claimed predictive powers of climate models, but so do some advisers to decision makers. Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s top business adviser Maurice Newman, for example, once said the world “had been held hostage by climate madness.”
In the UK Telegraph here, Newman is quoted as saying:

…the climate change establishment, led by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, remained ‘intent on exploiting the masses and extracting more money’.
‘The scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,’ he wrote in The Australian. ‘Global temperatures have gone nowhere for 17 years… If the IPCC were your financial adviser, you would have sacked it long ago.”
Global warming activists fired back, calling Newman and Abbot flat-earthers for not having faith in climate model prophesies.

All climate models projections are diverging from reality. Chart from Prof. John Christy, U of Alabama.
Yet, when one takes a closer look, the only thing that’s been flat lately are global temperatures (see chart above). Every model, most costing millions, failed to predict that global temperature would remain stagnant for almost two decades. Now it becomes obvious why experts like Essex describe them as “Welcome to Wonderland”.
Sherwood’s latest claim is in truth a profound departure from reality. In fact datasets are now even showing a slight decline underway over the last 6 to 8 years. The exact opposite is actually occurring. One has to ask what world scientists like Sherwood are really living in.
Naturally, one cannot exclude the possibility that Sherwood’s prediction may end up being right. As everyone knows: Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany has just put out a press release in English on a new study on the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon cycle: A new balance for the global carbon balance. If anything, the report shows there remains lots of uncertainty in the science that many like to call “settled”.
In climate science the only certainty is uncertainty.
Well worth reading. Some of the main points, according to the authors:
1. In most ecosystems, the photosynthesis rate at which plants fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere changes relatively little as the temperature varies.
2. The respiration of the ecosystems, when flora and fauna release carbon dioxide again, also increases to a lesser extent than has recently often been assumed when the temperature rises.
3. Moreover, this temperature dependence is the same all over the world – even in ecosystems as different as the tropical savannah and the Finnish needleleaf forest.
4. The climate is quite temperamental: countless factors are involved and many feedback mechanisms enhance effects such as the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. This makes it difficult to make predictions, especially as many processes in the Earth system are still not completely understood.
5. Results suggest that the availability of water, in particular, plays a decisive role for the carbon cycle in ecosystems. It is often more important than temperature.
6. Particularly alarmist scenarios for the feedback between global warming and ecosystem respiration thus prove to be unrealistic.”
7. The factor which determines the acceleration of the respiration thus obviously does not depend on the local temperature conditions and the specific characteristics of an ecosystem. “We were very surprised that different ecosystems react relatively uniformly to temperature variations.”
8. “It is still not possible to predict whether this attenuates the positive feedback between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature,” says Markus Reichstein. “The study shows very clearly that we do not yet have a good understanding of the global material cycles and their importance for long-term developments.”
9. “We were surprised to find that the primary production in the tropics is not so strongly dependent on the amount of rain,” says Markus Reichstein. “Here, too, we therefore need to critically scrutinize the forecasts of some climate models which predict the Amazon will die as the world gets drier.”

"The New South Wales opposition leader, Michael Daley, has backed the state’s schoolchildren striking and attending rallies on climate change, saying it was a democratic right to protest and “an important way to realise their own personal power”. Speaking at a National Press Club event in Sydney, Daley said he supported the rallies on Friday, even though he might soon be the premier and responsible for ensuring children attend school. “Education is also bigger than the classroom. It is based on life experience. That is, in part, the importance of being confident and passionate enough to form beliefs and being prepared to stand up for them,” he said. “They don’t have a microphone or money like the big end of town. But they do have their democratic right to assembly. I support that right to protest especially when it comes to climate change and our fragile environment. “And more importantly in this inert digital age, of acting on that belief. Of standing up and taking action for what you believe in – it is called leadership.” Labor has sought to distinguish itself from the Coalition by promising more rapid action on climate change, including installing seven gigawatts of regional solar farms and establishing a rebate scheme to encourage households to install a further two gigawatts of rooftop solar. Daley has also promised to review the state’s water-sharing laws that are being blamed in part for fish deaths at Menindee Lake, and to repeal the Coalition’s more liberal native vegetation laws that have allowed an increase in clearing. He foreshadowed more announcements on the environment before the 23 March election. Daley’s solo appearance at the press club was initially planned as a debate, but the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was unable to attend as she was campaigning in northern NSW. Daley backed the call from his shadow treasurer, Ryan Park, for higher wages growth for the state’s 400,000 public servants, amid concerns from the Reserve Bank about sluggish wages growth nationally and community concerns about the cost of living. Park said he would like wages growth “with a three in front of it”. In 2011 the Coalition government introduced a 2.5% cap on annual public sector wage increases, with higher increments possible only if offset by productivity savings. Daley said he would introduce an independent umpire, so that workers such as paramedics would be able to argue they had increased their skills and deserved a higher pay rise. But he refused to say how much a pay rise of 3% or more would cost the state budget. Although he has been campaigning on overdevelopment in several Sydney electorates, Daley said he would not be taking a significantly different path from the government, and would keep the Greater Sydney Commission, which sets targets for levels of new housing in each area. However, he has promised to abolish “spot rezonings” – where developers can ask for particular sites to be rezoned – and promised to return more power to councils to ensure “fairness and certainty” in the planning system. He said there had been political interference in the housing targets set by the Greater Sydney Commission which meant Woollahra, in Liberal heartland, has a target of only 300 new dwellings, while western Sydney has borne the brunt of accommodating new housing."

"Your editorial in defence of the humanities (13 March) is well timed and well argued. The UK needs the contribution of Stem graduates and that made by graduates with knowledge, skills and understanding gained through study of the humanities and wider social sciences. And geography, a subject that is a humanity, a social science and has part Stem designation in higher education, is well placed to make such a contribution. For example, the cabinet office’s geospatial commission estimates that UK plc can gain £11bn through the better use of the geospatial data held by organisations including the Ordnance Survey, Land Registry and the Hydrographic Office. Yet this can only be achieved if we have enough graduates trained to understand how such data can be used to benefit our communities, environments, businesses, and policy decisions – training which is provided through the study of geography.  The political tectonic plates will continue to clash and remodel our political landscapes. However, we should celebrate how study of the humanities can help us all to understand our own and other cultures, explore the connections of the wider world, and satisfy our innate curiosity about the world’s people, places and environments. Professor Joe SmithDirector, Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) • The Guardian’s view on the risks of cutting access to arts, humanities and social science courses is entirely and dismayingly correct. The decline in the number of students taking subjects including English, history and foreign languages is deeply concerning, and it could not be happening at a worse time. The UK faces many historic challenges and, whether it’s Brexit, climate change, or an ageing society, the insights of the humanities and social sciences are essential as we navigate our way through an uncertain present into what we hope will be an exciting and prosperous future. For over a century, the Academy has stood up for our disciplines, and it is greatly reassuring to know that we can rely on the Guardian’s support.Professor Sir David CannadinePresident of the British Academy • It is good to see support for the humanities at universities expressed in your leader but it does not follow as you suggest that by maintaining the current fee regime, with all that is wrong with it, universities will of their own volition protect these areas if demand slackens. A reduction of fees could be accompanied by funded initiatives such as protection for endangered subjects and reward for proven success in improving the prospects for disadvantaged students, just as support is currently provided for high-cost Stem subjects. Demand for subjects can wax and wane – some time ago mathematics and physics were in trouble but demand is now increasing. However, once a department is closed it is unlikely to be revived. It takes years to build a good department and a casual decision to close based on the “market” for it to be gone for ever. There is a national interest and responsibility to ensure a wide spectrum of disciplines is available within the system which cannot be left to the so called “market”.Professor Norman GowarLondon • Your editorial on humanities courses in UK universities is sadly correct for a perhaps less obvious reason. The major problem facing the world is climate change, which is ultimately caused by people. It is therefore notable that one of the world’s top universities, Harvard, has stated that “perspectives from across the university are required to provide leadership on how we can manage the impacts and limit the risks.” As a result, “Harvard faculty from economics, public policy, business, law, architecture, the arts and humanities all provide critical insights for how to proceed with tackling one of the greatest challenges of our time.” As your editorial concludes: the humanities matter too – the clue is in the name.Emeritus Professor Henry LeeseWindermere, Cumbria • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Strikes at schools around the world on 15 March are the latest in a snowballing global youth movement calling for action on climate change that began in Sweden in 2018 and now crosses continents. Activity across 51 nations, including the first such nationwide strike in the US, where almost 500 events are listed under the banner FridaysForFuture, comes four months since Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, told students taking part there to go home and “be less activist”. Thousands of pupils from Japan, Germany, Belgium and the UK among others have already walked out of lessons in recent months. In 2018 a landmark UN report said there were 12 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown from floods and heatwaves to food shortages and huge numbers of climate refugees. Now, the students striking from schools around the world have issued an uncompromising letter stating: “We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not.” We’d like to hear from young people around the world who are taking part in events on Friday, as well as parents and teachers, and find out more about the day from your perspective. Are you taking part? If so, what are your reasons for doing so and what specifically does it involve where you live? If you’re a parent or teacher, do you support the strikes?

"Tens of thousands of Australian school students are expected to walk out of class on Friday to demand governments take action on climate change. The Australian strikes are part of a global campaign by students for greater urgency from politicians in tackling what they see as the greatest threat to their future. Here’s a guide to what’s happening. Friday’s strikes are part of a global day of protest in 100 countries. More than 1,500 strike events are planned around the world. As of Thursday afternoon, strikes were planned at 60 locations in Australia, most of them regional areas. There will be strikes in every state and territory and every capital city. Sydney: 12 noon at Town Hall Canberra: 12 noon at Garema Place Melbourne: 12 noon at the Old Treasury Building Hobart: 12 noon at Parliament House Brisbane: 1pm at Queen’s Gardens Adelaide: 11am at Parliament House Perth: 11am at St George’s Cathedral Darwin: 12 noon at Parliament House The full list of strike locations is here. School students, their parents and friends. Faith and human rights groups will attend, along with representatives for the health sector. More than 20 unions have endorsed the strike, including the Australian Education Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and United Voice. Eight hundred academics have expressed solidarity for the students. The 2019 Australian of the Year, Craig Challen, wrote this week that he felt it was his duty to support the students. He will attend the strike in Sydney. The students have been inspired by Swedish school student Greta Thunberg, who has been striking every Friday outside the Swedish parliament since last August. Her determination has sparked a global movement. In November, thousands of Australian school students went on strike. This time there are more locations and organisers are expecting the number of students attending to be at least double what it was in November. Because they are tired of waiting for adults to make the massive changes necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change. They see climate change as an existential threat and fear for their futures.  They have lived through Australia’s recent record-breaking extreme weather and know climate change is already happening and time is running out to do something about it. They are speaking up because for years Australia’s political leaders have failed them. They have written a list of demands here . Manjot Kaur, 17, is one of the organisers of the Sydney strike. “The action of striking is so important,” she said. “Students are so afraid, so upset, so worried about their future that they’re literally sacrificing their education to show how serious this problem is. “Because right now we aren’t treating it as a crisis. The act of striking is us saying this needs to be treated as an emergency.”"

Michael Krüger at Readers Edition has already crunched the numbers for December 2010 in Germany. It was the third coldest on record, and the coldest since 1969. 
The average temperature in December 2010 was -3.5 °C, which is -4.3°C under the 1961-1990 average of 0.8°C.
So much for warmer winters with increasingly rare snowfalls. Speaking of snowfalls, for many locations in Germany it was also the snowiest on record. Krüger writes:
DWD [German Weather Service] experts recorded new monthly records for ‘maximum snow heights’ at many stations: for example 70 cm at Gera-Leumnitz on December 26.”
The snow and cold have been especially embarrassing for the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. It’s famous Potsdam-Telegrafenberg weather station smashed a number of December records.
On December 28, 2010 a snow depth 41 cm was measured in Potsdam. Never has there been that much snow in the month of December since records began in 1893. That’s 18 cm more than the previous record of 23 cm, which was measured on 31 December, 1913.  At -4,4°C it was also the second coldest December in Potsdam since records began in 1893.”

All that snow and cold fly in the face of German “climate experts” who not long ago projected warmer winters for Germany. Okay, one winter does not make a trend. Well, how about three of them in a row? Krüger writes:
 The winter before last year was -0,4°C below average and last winter was -1,5°C below the longterm average.
December 2010 is the third coldest since 1900. Colder were only December 1969 and December 1933.”
And adds:
Not only December was too cold, but also the entire year 2010 in Germany was too cold. The first time in 14 years (since 1996) that a year has been colder than the long-term average (average of the years 1961-90 is 8.2°C). In 2010 the average temperature was 7.9°C.”
And finally, as Krüger’s chart at his site shows, Germany’s annual temperature trend has been cooling over the last decade.

"Americans should not be fooled by the Stalinist tactics being used by the White House to try to discredit the findings of mainstream climate science. The Trump administration has already purged information about climate change from government websites, gagged federal experts and attempted to end funding for climate change programmes.  Now a group of hardcore climate change deniers and contrarians linked to the administration is organising a petition in support of a new panel being set up by the National Security Council to promote an alternative official explanation for climate change. The panel will consist of scientists who do not accept the overwhelming scientific evidence that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are behind climate change and its impacts. The petition is being circulated for signature by Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a lobby group for “free market” fanatics which has become infamous for championing climate change denial. It does not disclose its sources of funding, but is known to have received money from ExxonMobil and conservative billionaires such as the Koch brothers. Mr Ebell, who has no expertise whatsoever in climate science – or any kind of science for that matter – was a member of Donald Trump’s presidential transition team and diverted the focus of the Environmental Protection Agency towards weakening and removing policies that limit pollution by companies, including President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The creation of the new panel of climate change deniers, and the recruitment of supporters to provide it with a veneer of legitimacy, echoes the campaign by Joseph Stalin’s regime to discredit the work of geneticists who disagreed with the disastrous pseudo-scientific theories of Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko wrongly believed that acquired traits could be passed on by parents to their offspring. Stalin embraced lysenkoism as the basis for Soviet agricultural policy, while also denouncing and persecuting Lysenko’s scientific critics. The Trump administration’s “climate lysenkoism” is being led by William Happer, a retired professor from Princeton University who was hired by the National Security Council in September 2018 as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for emerging technologies. Media reports suggest that Professor Happer and his fellow propagandists will target the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which was prepared by leading researchers in the United States, and concluded last November: “The impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country.” Although the report was subjected to rigorous review by America’s top experts at the National Academy of Sciences, it was rejected by President Trump, who told journalists: “I don’t believe it.” Professor Happer, who has not published any research on climate change in a reputable science journal, has been celebrated for many years by climate change contrarians and deniers around the world. He was formerly a trustee of the George C Marshall Institute, which received funding from ExxonMobil and other companies to spread doubt inside and outside the United States about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It disappeared in 2015 and was replaced by the CO2 Coalition, which was co-founded by Professor Happer. The website for the Coalition makes many inaccurate and misleading assertions, such as: “Readily available data from both governmental and non-governmental sources confirms that extreme weather events in recent years have not happened more often or with greater intensity.” In fact, the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in 2013, concluded: “Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950.” A recent leak of the Coaliton’s tax filing showed that its largest donors are conservative groups, such as the Mercer Family Foundation and the Sarah Scaife Foundation, which have a long track record of funding climate change denial. Professor Happer has also collaborated with climate change deniers in other countries, such as the United Kingdom. In 2010, he joined the “Academic Advisory Committee” of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was set up by Lord Lawson to campaign against polices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels. He stepped down from the committee when he was hired by the White House. The foundation published a pamphlet by Professor Happer in August 2011 which disputed the scientific evidence that greenhouse gases are causing climate change. In July 2014, Professor Happer caused controversy during an interview on CNBC television in the United States when he claimed that “the demonisation of carbon dioxide is just like the demonisation of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews.” He was also forced to defend himself after Greenpeace revealed an exchange of email messages during which Professor Happer discussed writing reports to promote climate change denial in exchange for a secret fee paid to the CO2 Coalition. Americans should not be conned by the Trump administration’s climate lysenkoism and should instead place their trust in the robust findings of climate researchers who place the public interest ahead of political ideology.

"The meat on Richard Vines’s Wild Beef stall at Borough Market in London is purple. Puce, really; a cartoonish shade that old men sometimes go when they are really angry. Meat that is an unexpected hue would typically raise an eyebrow, but for Wild Beef’s devoted customers it’s the reason they come here. “The colour comes from the protein that’s been in the ground, the deep-rooted grasses, it gives that flavour of sweetness and that bit of fat taste as well,” explains Vines, who has 40 acres of wild pasture in Devon, on which he keeps Devon cattle and Welsh Blacks. “Dartmoor is mineral-rich country, God-given for cattle farming. Washed by the Gulf Stream, grass grows most of the year and there’s a lot of freedom for the cattle once they are up on the moor.” For the carnivore, the chilled cabinet at Wild Beef is the promised land. There are all the familiar cuts (steaks, ribs), alongside parts of the cow you don’t see so often (cheeks and a giant, lolling tongue that is practically black). And, if you get there early and ask nicely, Vines will slip you a bag of bones from under the counter. “One thing that’s changed: people don’t sit down for Sunday lunch any more,” he says. “Just doesn’t happen, we don’t sell many joints. But I’m working out ways of making steaks all the time. Last year we did flat iron steaks; I didn’t know what they were but they sell. And 20 years ago, we used to waste buckets of liver and such like, which nobody wanted. Now the offal all goes before the meat.”  On this Thursday morning in early February, business is brisk – perhaps surprisingly so. There are many reasons why, right now, you might be thinking hard about how much meat you eat. That you believe eating less meat will improve your health. Or that you’ve read the increasingly ominous projections: like those in the Guardian article from December titled “Why eating less meat is the best thing you can do for the planet in 2019”. Another record-breaking Veganuary has ended with 250,000 people taking part globally, one-third more than 2018. In many ways, our consumption of meat – and especially beef – has become the food issue of our times. By 2050, it’s estimated that the world’s population will be almost 10 billion, a rise of a third from today. Meanwhile, global meat consumption steadily, relentlessly grows at about 3% a year. (Growth in Europe and the US is slowing or even declining: the US reached “peak meat” in 2004 when an average of 83 kilograms was consumed by each person in a year. In the UK, we’re eating more chicken, less lamb, and about the same amount of beef. However, demand in the likes of China and Brazil continues to rise. In China, they now eat 55kg of meat a year, compared to 14kg per head in the early 1970s.)  Chicken might be the world’s most popular meat – 65 billion birds are consumed each year – but beef is by some margin the hardest to defend. Raising livestock is notoriously inefficient: last year an article in the journal Science found that meat and dairy provides just 18% of our calories and 37% of our protein while taking up 83% of farmland. Cattle are responsible for an unholy proportion of agriculture’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The controversial “planetary health diet” published in the Lancet in January – a three-year project compiled by 37 scientists in 16 countries – advised that global consumption of red meat needs to reduce by half. The recommended changes would be particularly severe in Europe and the US: Europeans should eat 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds to meet the guidelines, while Americans should cut back on red meat by 84%. Vines, 76, has heard all these arguments. “It’s disproportionate,” he says. “How many people are there in the air at any one time? And what’s that doing to the environment? When you offset the fact that animals on the ground have a part to play in nature’s cycle as well.” Sometimes people suggest to Vines that his land could feed many more people if it was covered in plants not cows. “Would that be more efficient?” he counters, more curious than argumentative. “It wouldn’t in our case because you couldn’t have vegetables on Dartmoor; there are too many rocks and blocks.” Vines’s sales are pretty consistent, and in fact this January they were up on previous years. As we talk, he gives potted biographies for some his regulars: “the paleo boys”, a German composer, a BBC radio presenter, a chap with tattoos and chains who is vegetarian but buys three or four bags of casserole steak every week for his dog. They are people who care about where their food comes from, who believe they are making an informed, considerate choice and are willing to pay extra for that. Wild Beef describes its meat as “beyond organic”. “All governments want cheap food and you cannot do what we do at an affordable price for people on low incomes,” Vines acknowledges. “It becomes a lifestyle choice and people who have money to spend on preferential food will shop from us.” For all the media discussion of Greggs’ new vegan sausage roll and the coverage of Beyoncé and Jay-Z offering free tickets “for life” – well, for 30 years – to their concerts for a fan if they pledge to eat more plant-based meals, change is taking place slowly. Vines’s anecdotal experience of demand is, perhaps surprisingly, backed up by the statistics. Although veganism receives considerable attention, a 2018 study found that only 0.2% of the British population stopped eating meat in the previous year. It’s hard to be exact, but it’s estimated that vegans make up 2% of the population, vegetarians are 7% and flexitarians – those choosing not to eat meat for one or more meals a week – hover around 20%. Still, nine out of 10 British households regularly buy red meat. Should we be alarmed by the slow progress? Simon Fairlie has spent much of the past three decades thinking about our consumption of meat and asking whether it can ever be ethical and sustainable. He was a co-editor of the Ecologist and now edits a magazine called The Land; he’s also the author of a book, Meat: A Benign Extravagance, a thoughtful and rigorous trawl through the evidence. He was a vegetarian for six years and now he runs a microdairy with Jersey cows at Monkton Wyld Court, a commune in Dorset, and makes and sells Austrian scythes. For Fairlie, it’s inarguable that we should all eat less meat: it’s not a great cornerstone for a diet and it’s harming the planet. But none? He doesn’t think so. Meat is a luxury, he argues, but so too are strawberries or coffee and any number of foods: also, meat can lay claim to being a “luxury staple” in that it provides protein, fat, vitamins and carbohydrate.  “The main problem we face is climate change and over two-thirds of global warming is caused by fossil fuels and industrial processes,” says Fairlie, citing US Environmental Protection Agency figures from 2014. “If the whole world went vegan it wouldn’t stop global warming. To do that, we have to stop using fossil fuels; and when we do we almost certainly won’t be able to produce as much meat as we do now, because of a lack of artificial fertilisers and the need to use land for biofuels, and diets will change accordingly.” This is a topic that is both intensely tribal and resistant to simplification. In an unexpected recent development, avocados are now almost as vilified as red meat (sample headline from the Daily Mail about the Duchess of Sussex: “Is Meghan’s favourite snack fuelling drought and murder?”). How, the line goes, can having a small portion of pasture-fed beef raised by a local British farmer be worse – practically or morally – than eating an avocado, imported from Mexico, picked by low-paid, immigrant workers on land linked to illegal deforestation? “Technically, a vegan diet probably is sustainable, but it is not sensible,” says Fairlie. “A diet with modest amounts of dairy, fish and meat requires less land than a completely vegan diet because a substantial proportion of livestock are fed on waste products. We also keep grazing animals for maintaining biodiversity, preventing forest fires, and keeping land clear for amenity use or renewable energy generation. Their populations have to be controlled, and if we are to cull them, we might as well eat them. “A vegan diet is wasteful because it cannot use this valuable source of protein; whereas a high-meat diet is wasteful because it relies on feeding livestock inefficiently with grain that humans could eat.” What makes this issue so hard to resolve is that, in Britain, we expect food to be cheap. We spend an average of 8% of household expenditure on food to eat at home. That’s lower than any country except for the US and Singapore (in Nigeria, for example, the figure is close to 60%). It’s also lower than it has ever been: go back 60 years and Britons spent twice as much on food, in relative terms, as we do now. And, much like fast fashion, when you come to expect a price for a product – whether it’s a T-shirt or a 99p burger – it is difficult to turn back the clock. The most effective way to reduce our meat intake, in Fairlie’s view, is to charge more for it. (This is also the logic behind the sugar tax on soft drinks brought in last April: it is expected to raise £240m for the Treasury, which will be invested in school sports and breakfast clubs.) He would ideally prefer a swingeing tax on fossil fuels, but feels the only pragmatic way is to add VAT directly to meat that is sold in supermarkets, especially animals from industrial farms, though he would like to see small producers and farmers markets exempt. An unprecedented time has led to some unprecedented proposals. One of these is lab-grown meat. Engineered or “clean” meat has some stigmas to overcome: in a recent survey only a quarter of people found the idea “very” or even “somewhat appealing”. But there’s considerable money behind it: Google co-founder Sergey Brin has backed Dutch-based Mosa Meat, while Tyson, the US food giant, funds Future Meat Technologies. (Tyson is also investing heavily in Beyond Meat, a California-based company best known for its plant-based burgers and new facilities for rearing organic poultry: no one seems sure which horse to back.) Optimistic estimates suggest that lab-grown meat will be in shops and restaurants by 2021. One person who doubts the immediate impact of engineered meat is Abi Aspen Glencross, a farmer and chef whose PhD at King’s College, London had the grand aim to create “steak without cows”. After a degree in chemical engineering, Glencross, 27, decided she wanted to work in food, and lab-grown meat seemed a “no-brainer”. She secured funding from a big charity in the US and became one of only a handful of researchers globally looking into cultured meat. But after 18 months, Glencross became disillusioned with the project and quit. “It just felt like an ego trip, thinking you were saving the world,” she says. “I was trying to create a new product and it was going to cost a lot of time, money and resources. Or we could all be more vegetarian. And that’s already there, it’s feasible and socially accepted. So why aren’t we doing that? It kept ringing in my head. “We might never be able to grow a steak in a lab, we don’t know yet,” she goes on. “That’s a long way off. We can hardly vascularise a small piece of tissue that big” – her fingers are about a centimetre apart – “so a steak is a very far-fetched thing.” Part of the reason Glencross abandoned her PhD was that she read chef Dan Barber’s 2014 book The Third Plate, which lays down a blueprint for a new food system, where vegetables dominate each dish and meat is merely a sauce or a seasoning. She spent a few months working at Barber’s farm and restaurant, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in upstate New York. There, she became interested in heritage and alternative grains and now grows them on a small farm in Hertfordshire. Duchess Grains currently only supplies E5 Bakehouse in east London, but will soon sell more widely. Glencross is also co-founder of a supper club called the Sustainable Food Story. She’s not vegetarian, as it happens, and jokingly calls herself a “bad vegan”. “At the Sustainable Food Story, we use offcuts, offal, even byproducts of cheese-making in our dinners,” she says. “Last time we did blood pudding, using back fat and blood, and there’s a whole conversation to be had about that. It seems you’re one thing or the other: either you eat meat and you’re proud or you’re vegan. Well, some weeks I eat vegan, and some weeks I don’t.” It is perhaps a forlorn hope, but Glencross would like to see less focus on the turf war, often vicious, between farmers and vegans, and more information – for people who care about such things and can afford to pay for them – about where food comes from, how it was grown. “Quite often farmers will get attacked when you really want to be attacking factory farming,” she says. “But they’re faceless and you can’t shout at them, so you shout at the farmer killing pigs on his farm. Which is sad. Or, vice versa: people shout at vegans, because they are angry and hairy or whatever it always used to be said. Again, you’re still fighting the wrong people. I feel we should be anti-industrial farming as much as possible.” A Bureau of Investigative Journalism/Guardian report from 2017 found there were at least 789 megafarms in the UK, many of them owned by foreign multinationals. (A megafarm, by the US definition, houses at least 125,000 broiler chickens, 82,000 laying hens, 2,500 pigs, 700 dairy or 1,000 beef cattle; in the UK, a farm is described as “intensive” if it has at least 40,000 poultry birds or 2,000 pigs grown for meat or 750 breeding sows.) Two of the biggest operators in the UK are the US-owned Cargill, with more than 100 farms, and Moy Park, based in Northern Ireland but backed by a Brazilian company. Another Bureau/Guardian investigation last year discovered that American-style intensive cattle farms, where livestock have restricted or no access to pasture, were becoming more common in the UK. The largest farms fatten up to 6,000 cattle a year on “feedlots”. Such practices receive only a fraction of the coverage of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. But at the same time, there is something unsettling about meat becoming mainly available to the well off, whether it’s due to the price of “beyond organic” beef or an extra tax. There is much that is disturbing about intensive farming; at the same time it would seem nostalgic and questionable to return to a system where only an elite stratum of society has access to animal protein. Already, lower-income households in Britain spend more on food, as a percentage of their income, than the better off: 14% of their annual spend. As a concerned individual, it’s not always clear what to do next. Foodies can cut back on their meat intake, and make sure what they do eat is either offcuts or of impeccable provenance. Vegetarians and vegans will likely continue to grow in both numbers and influence, and the sharing of recipes on sites such as Instagram will inspire more people to eat differently. All of us can lobby our politicians for better standards and monitoring of intensive farms. We’re told that the stories of chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-pumped beef are “inflammatory and misleading”, by the US ambassador to Britain, but post-Brexit, there will be new concerns over food safety and animal welfare. And, in the end, we might have to accept that, on a personal level, our efforts feel insubstantial. “It’s difficult, because if you look at history, the biggest changes in our diet have come through things like war or natural disasters,” says Glencross. “It’s interesting to think: ‘Unless something really big happens, are we drastically going to change?’” She shakes her head and sighs, “Which is slightly worrying.” Something that both Glencross and Simon Fairlie would like to see is more smallholdings, farmed organically. Fairlie has worked out that we would have to eat half the meat we currently consume to cut emissions, but the production of dairy would remain similar. At present, it is difficult and expensive for a farmer to certify as organic; Fairlie would like to see those methods as the standard, while farms that want to use chemicals on their land pay a premium. It sounds like a utopia, but for Richard Vines trying to do things the right way has turned into a decent business. He launched Wild Beef in 1993 with very low expectations. He didn’t set out to be a high-end producer: “It was forced on me. I was going down the tubes otherwise.” Vines was 50, his marriage had just broken down, he’d lost his job and was “unemployable”, in his words. “I had a Land Rover, a Yorkshire terrier, 20 cows and 20 acres,” he recalls, as the wind whips through a frigid Borough Market. The owner of the local abattoir predicted that Wild Beef wouldn’t last three weeks. “Well, that was 26 years ago,” chuckles Vines. Back then the conventional wisdom was that if you wanted to make serious money in farming, you had to operate on the biggest scale possible. Now, Vines believes, there is an alternative, more ethical model. Thanks to farmers’ markets and selling direct to consumers online, a farm can be compact, small-scale and focus on quality rather than quantity. Discerning consumers are out there who care about taste and actively seek out good welfare practices. Vines admits that he relied on luck as much as good judgment when he was starting out, but the modern farmer can choose what kind of operation he or she aspires to run. He smiles and says, “There’ll always be people who want to eat good food.”"
"Australia’s annual carbon emissions have reached a new high and drops in emissions from the electricity sector have been wiped out by increases from other industries, according to new data. Ndevr Environmental, an emissions-tracking organisation that releases quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data, said on Thursday that annual emissions for the year up to December 2018 increased to 558.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. It was the highest level on record when excluding unreliable land use data. Ndevr’s data showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris target of a 26-28% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels and that carbon pollution was increasing across most sectors of the economy. The Morrison government has repeatedly claimed Australia will meet its targets “in a canter” and was criticised earlier this month for falsely claiming emissions were decreasing. The Ndevr report said emissions in the December quarter decreased by 1.4m tonnes on the September quarter. But it also highlighted that emissions increased by 0.9m tonnes on the same quarter a year ago. Emissions fluctuate seasonally, with the September quarter typically recording the highest emissions levels within each year. “This quarter rounds out the calendar year for 2018 and what it shows is that emissions have increased again to a record high,” Matt Drum, Ndevr’s managing director, said. The report shows emissions from the electricity sector continue to decline due to large-scale renewable energy projects. But those gains were cancelled out by increases in emissions from all forms of transport, stationary energy (fuels burnt in equipment or plants not involved in electricity generation) and fugitive emissions (leaks from other activities such as methane from a coalmine). “Over 2018 electricity emissions decreased by about 7m tonnes but those three sources together increased by more than 12.5m tonnes,” Drum said. Climate scientists have warned policymakers that emissions outside of the power sector account for the majority of Australia’s carbon pollution. Australia is lagging behind other countries in setting new national vehicle emissions standards and transitioning to electric cars. “It’s something we’ve been screaming from the rooftops for a long time now,” Drum said. “The electricity sector is not the problem. The problem is all other sectors that aren’t subject to any real binding carbon emissions reduction target or policy.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Zeit has a report today, Climate Scientists Advise Eating Less Meat, admonishing westerners not to eat meat and not to drink milk, otherwise climate catastrophe will strike us violently.This of course is all based on “science” from the alarmist, government-funded Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, where activists like Stefan Rahmstorf and Dr. anti-scepticism Hans Joachim Schellnhuber busily examine and analyse each and every negative  impact of each and every western lifestyle sin (at PIK there is nothing positive in western lifestyles – everything is negative).
One potentially mortal sin is the human enjoyment of meat and dairy products. This unforgivable transgression has been carefully scrutinised by PIK climate-impact researcher Dr Alexander Popp, who says:
With a return to Sundays-only meat and reduced consumption of dairy products, Germans can become healthier and do the atmosphere a big favour.
Die Zeit reports, based on PIK science:
The culprits foremost are two climate-gases: methane and nitrous oxide. The first is produced by the digestion of cows and the manure they excrete. The second, and even more potent gas, nitrous oxide, results from fertilising fields.
Popp and his colleagues have calculated that emissions of the two above-mentioned gases will increase by 76% compared to 1995 if meat and dairy product consumption continues to rise at the current rate.

Only with a  changed lifestyle, one that more often refrains from meat and milk products, and one with a climate-friendly production, do the researchers say 1995 levels can be reached.
Shaking a finger, Popp admonishes that:
Today’s emissions levels of the western lifestyle are to blame, and for that reason it is to be expected that people in rich countries be the first to make lifestyle changes. ‘It’s about fulfilling the function of setting an example.’
Popp singles out the real culprits:
The lifestyle of Americans and Europeans acts as a model in developing countries, where meat and milk are status symbols, which is how it should be again for industrial countries, says Popp. For that reason, meat and milk ought not be on the dinner table every day.
So there you have it. Our tax dollars used to fund a bunch of eggheads who have nothing better to do than to gripe and moan, and to constantly nag the rest of society.
Guess what I’m having for dinner today!

"The worsening effects of climate change and hotter, longer, drier summers are having an effect on our big summer outdoor festivals. There are the usual concerns: is there enough drinking water, sunscreen? What about shaded areas and ventilation in tents? But climate change has changed how large-scale public events run in previously unforeseen ways. Take Adelaide festival, for example, which wrapped up on Sunday. In recent years, the festival has run a venue on the River Torrens – The Palais, a floating pontoon, a nod to Adelaide’s 1920s floating dancehall, Palais de Danse, that sank in 1928. This year, the Palais was hosting events including a morning coffee and papers forum, as well as live music such as Washington and Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever.  But Rob Brookman, the festival’s executive director, says that the hot, dry summer and preceding dry winter has caused the water levels in the Torrens to fall – and that’s a worry for the pontoon. “If the level drops too far, the Palais could become bogged on the bottom and be unusable,” Brookman tells Guardian Australia. “On the other hand there is another recent climate-change related development of algal blooms in the Torrens. The only way to deal with the blooms is for the Department of Environment and Water to flush the river, which of course lifts the [water] level. So in a bizarre way we are almost hoping for an algal bloom so that the river is flushed and our pontoon stays afloat.” The opening weekend of Adelaide festival this year was marked by a heatwave, with temperatures hitting 41C. That did not deter thousands of people converging on festival sites, as well as the venues of other events such as the circus tents of the Fringe festival, trackside at Clipsal 500 or in the relatively cool, air conditioned climate of the Concert Hall. Brookman says climate change-proofing a festival does not happen overnight. “Climate change continues to be a boiling frog situation,” he says. “It’s far more gradual. The festival has dealt with all kinds of weather over the years but increasingly what we are dealing with is a less predictable pattern.” For most festivals, adjusting to climate change means managing the increasing likelihood of extreme heat. Laneway festival, an outdoor music festival that runs in Australia’s capital cities at the height of summer, has a range of measures in place to deal with extreme heat. Organiser Danny Rogers says to combat the effects of extreme weather, the festival provides free drinking water taps, “additional shade”, misting fans, “additional first aid resources”, water at stages, hoses at stages and “patron and staff messaging with weather updates, sun protection and appropriate clothing via socials, screens and staff induction pre- and during event.” Perth had a relatively mild summer but the Perth festival director, Wendy Martin, says she has been careful in her programming to account for more extreme temperatures. Five Short Blasts, an outdoor performance in Fremantle, took place at sunrise and sunset. “We do that for the beauty of the light,” Martin says. “But you don’t want to be on an open boat on a river in the middle of the day. It’s too hot and the sun is too sharp.” The festival has a large outdoor venue, the Chevron Gardens, which Martin says is only used at night. “You have to be mindful of the incredible heat when you are building venues,” she says. At the Perth writers’ festival, which occurs in February as part of Perth festival, author talks mostly take place in lecture theatres and tents in shady, tree-lined grounds of the University of Western Australia. The tents used to be air conditioned, Martin says, but the festival made the decision to use less carbon, so the tents are now open to encourage cross breezes and natural airflow. Likewise at the Byron Bay writers’ festival. Even though it’s held in winter, the weather has become increasingly unpredictable. Artistic director Edwina Johnson says, “We did make a decision to increase shaded area capacity in 2017 – more to keep our audience comfortable in all weather.” Martin says artists themselves are also tackling the themes of climate change in their shows. But not yet on the cards for Australia’s major festivals is reducing their carbon footprint by cutting the number of international acts that fly to Australia to perform. “Air travel is one of the gnarliest problems, in terms of ethical issues,” Brookman says. “Eliminating international travel would have a really deleterious effect. It would mean our world shrinks in terms of communication of culture and across borders. I always believed if you are prepared to listen to another culture’s music and read their literature it’s a lot harder to demonise and see them as the other.”"
"Extractive industries are responsible for half of the world’s carbon emissions and more than 80% of biodiversity loss, according to the most comprehensive environmental tally undertaken of mining and farming. While this is crucial for food, fuel and minerals, the study by UN Environment warns the increasing material weight of the world’s economies is putting a more dangerous level of stress on the climate and natural life-support systems than previously thought.  Resources are being extracted from the planet three times faster than in 1970, even though the population has only doubled in that time, according to the Global Resources Outlook, which was released in Nairobi on Tuesday. Each year, the world consumes more than 92b tonnes of materials – biomass (mostly food), metals, fossil fuels and minerals – and this figure is growing at the rate of 3.2% per year. Since 1970, extraction of of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) has increased from 6bn tonnes to 15bn tonnes, metals have risen by 2.7% a year, other minerals (particularly sand and gravel for concrete) have surged nearly fivefold from 9bn to 44bn tonnes, and biomass harvests have gone up from 9bn to 24bn tonnes. Up until 2000, this was a huge boost to the global economy, but since then there has been a diminishing rate of return as resources become more expensive to extract and the environmental costs become harder to ignore. “The global economy has focused on improvements in labour productivity at the cost of material and energy productivity. This was justifiable in a world where labour was the limiting factor of production. We have moved into a world where natural resources and environmental impacts have become the limiting factor of production and shifts are required to focus on resource productivity,” says the study. The economic benefits and environmental costs are broken down by sector. Land use change – mostly for agriculture – accounts for over 80% of biodiversity loss and 85% of water stress as forests and swamps are cleared for cropland that needs irrigation. Extraction and primary processing of metals and other minerals is responsible for 20% of health impacts from air pollution and 26% of global carbon emissions. The biggest surprise to the authors was the huge climate impact of pulling materials out of the ground and preparing them for use. All the sectors combined together accounted for 53% of the world’s carbon emissions – even before accounting for any fuel that is burned. “I would never have expected that half of climate impacts can be attributed to resource extraction and processing,” said Stefanie Hellweg, one of the authors of the paper. “It showed how resources are hiding behind products. By focusing on them, their tremendous impact became apparent.” The paper highlights growing inequalities. In rich countries, people consume an average of 9.8 tonnes of resources a year, the weight of two elephants. This is 13 times higher than low incomes groups. Much of this is unseen because huge amounts of materials are often needed for a small end product, such as a mobile phone. Izabella Teixeira, former environment minister of Brazil, said the report highlighted how rich consumer nations have exported environmental stress to poor producing countries. With this model now hitting climate and biodiversity boundaries that affect everyone on the planet, she said it was time for change. “Currently decisions are being based on the past but we need to base them on the future. That means leadership.” Where leadership could come from is difficult to see in the current political environment. The US and Brazil are slashing existing environmental regulations. China has moved ahead on renewables and pollution, but its growth is even more material-intensive than developed nations. According to the report, Asia is driving the fastest demand for minerals among upper-middle income countries, which now – because of their big populations – have a greater combined material weight than wealthy nations. The authors said it was essential to decouple economic growth from material consumption. Without change, they said resource demand would more than double to 190bn tonnes a year, greenhouse gases would rise by 40% and demand for land would increase by 20%. However, they said this dire scenario could be avoided if there is a faster transition towards renewables, smarter urban planning to reduce the demand for concrete, dietary changes to lower the need for grazing pastures and cut levels of waste (currently a third of all food), and a greater focus on creating a cyclical economy that re-uses more materials. They also called for a switch of taxation policies away from income and towards carbon and resource extraction. “It is possible to grow in a different way with fewer side-effects. This report is clear proof that it is possible and with higher growth,” said Janez Potočnik, co-chair of International Resource Panel and former environment commissioner for the European Union. “It’s not an easy job to do, but believe me the alternative is much worse.”"
"Greta Thunberg cut a frail and lonely figure when she started a school strike for the climate outside the Swedish parliament building last August. Her parents tried to dissuade her. Classmates declined to join. Passersby expressed pity and bemusement at the sight of the then unknown 15-year-old sitting on the cobblestones with a hand-painted banner. Eight months on, the picture could not be more different. The pigtailed teenager is feted across the world as a model of determination, inspiration and positive action. National presidents and corporate executives line up to be criticised by her, face to face. Her skolstrejk för klimatet (school strike for climate) banner has been translated into dozens of languages. And, most striking of all, the loner is now anything but alone. On 15 March, when she returns to the cobblestones (as she has done almost every Friday in rain, sun, ice and snow), it will be as a figurehead for a vast and growing movement. The global climate strike this Friday is gearing up to be one of the biggest environmental protests the world has ever seen. As it approaches, Thunberg is clearly excited. “It’s amazing,” she says. “It’s more than 71 countries and more than 700 places, and counting. It’s increasing very much now, and that’s very, very fun.” A year ago, this was unimaginable. Back then, Thunberg was a painfully introverted, slightly built nobody, waking at 6am to prepare for school and heading back home at 3pm. “Nothing really was happening in my life,” she recalls. “I have always been that girl in the back who doesn’t say anything. I thought I couldn’t make a difference because I was too small.” She was never quite like the other kids. Her mother, Malena Ernman, is one of Sweden’s most celebrated opera singers. Her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor and author (named after Svante Arrhenius, the Nobel prize-winning scientist who in 1896 first calculated how carbon dioxide emissions could lead to the greenhouse effect). Greta was exceptionally bright. Four years ago, she was diagnosed with Asperger’s. “I overthink. Some people can just let things go, but I can’t, especially if there’s something that worries me or makes me sad. I remember when I was younger, and in school, our teachers showed us films of plastic in the ocean, starving polar bears and so on. I cried through all the movies. My classmates were concerned when they watched the film, but when it stopped, they started thinking about other things. I couldn’t do that. Those pictures were stuck in my head.” She has come to accept this as part of who she is – and made it a motivating force instead of a source of paralysing depression, which it once was. At about the age of eight, when she first learned about climate change, she was shocked that adults did not appear to be taking the issue seriously. It was not the only reason she became depressed a few years later, but it was a significant factor. “I kept thinking about it and I just wondered if I am going to have a future. And I kept that to myself because I’m not very much of a talker, and that wasn’t healthy. I became very depressed and stopped going to school. When I was home, my parents took care of me, and we started talking because we had nothing else to do. And then I told them about my worries and concerns about the climate crisis and the environment. And it felt good to just get that off my chest. “They just told me everything will be all right. That didn’t help, of course, but it was good to talk. And then I kept on going, talking about this all the time and showing my parents pictures, graphs and films, articles and reports. And, after a while, they started listening to what I actually said. That’s when I kind of realised I could make a difference. And how I got out of that depression was that I thought: it is just a waste of time feeling this way because I can do so much good with my life. I am trying to do that still now.” Her parents were the guinea pigs. She discovered she had remarkable powers of persuasion, and her mother gave up flying, which had a severe impact on her career. Her father became a vegetarian. As well as feeling relieved by the transformation of their formerly quiet and morose daughter, they say they were persuaded by her reasoning. “Over the years, I ran out of arguments,” says her father. “She kept showing us documentaries, and we read books together. Before that, I really didn’t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted,” he says. “She changed us and now she is changing a great many other people. There was no hint of this in her childhood. It’s unbelievable. If this can happen, anything can happen.” The climate strike was inspired by students from the Parkland school in Florida, who walked out of classes in protest against the US gun laws that enabled the massacre on their campus. Greta was part of a group that wanted to do something similar to raise awareness about climate change, but they couldn’t agree what. Last summer, after a record heatwave in northern Europe and forest fires that ravaged swathes of Swedish land up to the Arctic, Thunberg decided to go it alone. Day one was 20 August 2018. “I painted the sign on a piece of wood and, for the flyers, wrote down some facts I thought everyone should know. And then I took my bike to the parliament and just sat there,” she recalls. “The first day, I sat alone from about 8.30am to 3pm – the regular schoolday. And then on the second day, people started joining me. After that, there were people there all the time.” She kept her promise to strike every day until the Swedish national elections. Afterwards, she agreed to make a speech in front of thousands of people at a People’s Climate March rally. Her parents were reluctant. Knowing Thunberg had been so reticent that she had previously been diagnosed with selective mutism, they tried to talk her out of it. But the teenager was determined. “In some cases where I am really passionate, I will not change my mind,” she says. Despite her family’s concerns, she delivered the address in nearly flawless English, and invited the crowd to film her on their mobile phones and spread the message through social media. “I cried,” says her proud dad. People with selective mutism have a tendency to worry more than others. Thunberg has since weaponised this in meetings with political leaders, and with billionaire entrepreneurs in Davos. “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act,” she told them. Such tongue-lashings have gone down well. Many politicians laud her candidness. In return, she listens to their claims that stronger climate policies are unrealistic unless the public make the issue more of a priority. She is unconvinced. “They are still not doing anything. So I don’t know really why they are supporting us because we are criticising them. It’s kind of weird.” She has also been withering about leaders in the US, UK and Australia who either ignore the strikers or admonish them for skipping classes. “They are desperately trying to change the subject whenever the school strikes come up. They know they can’t win this fight because they haven’t done anything.” Such blunt talk has found a broad audience among people jaded by empty promises and eager to find a climate leader willing to ramp up ambition. Thunberg’s rise coincides with growing scientific concern. A slew of recent reports has warned oceans are heating and the poles melting faster than expected. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelled out the dangers of surpassing 1.5C of global warming. To have any chance of avoiding that outcome, it said, emissions must fall rapidly by 2030. That will require far more pressure on politicians – and nobody has proved more effective at that over the past eight months than Thunberg. The girl who once slipped into despair is now a beacon of hope. One after another, veteran campaigners and grizzled scientists have described her as the best news for the climate movement in decades. She has been lauded at the UN, met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, shared a podium with the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and has been endorsed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. No, I am not more hopeful than when I started. The emissions are increasing You may think this would put the weight of the world on the 16-year-old’s shoulders, but she claims to feel no pressure. If “people are so desperate for hope”, she says, that is not her or the other strikers’ responsibility. “I don’t care if what I’m doing – what we’re doing – is hopeful. We need to do it anyway. Even if there’s no hope left and everything is hopeless, we must do what we can.” In this regard, her family see her Asperger’s as a blessing. She is someone who strips away social distractions and focuses with black-and-white clarity on the issues. “It’s nothing that I want to change about me,” she says. “It’s just who I am. If I had been just like everyone else and been social, then I would have just tried to start an organisation. But I couldn’t do that. I’m not very good with people, so I did something myself instead.” While she has little time for chit-chat, she gets satisfaction from speaking to a big audience about climate change. Regardless of the size of the crowd, she says she does not feel the least bit nervous. She seems incapable of the cognitive dissonance that allows other people to lament what is happening to the climate one minute, then tuck into a steak, buy a car or fly off for a weekend break the next. Although Thunberg believes political action far outweighs individual changes to consumer habits, she lives her values. She is a vegan, and only travels abroad by train. At its best, this sharpness can slice through the Gordian knot of the climate debate. It can also sting. There are no comfortable reassurances in her speech, just a steady frankness. Asked whether she has become more optimistic because the climate issue has risen up the political agenda and politicians in the US and Europe are considering green New Deals that would ramp up the transition to renewable energy, her reply is brutally honest. “No, I am not more hopeful than when I started. The emissions are increasing and that is the only thing that matters. I think that needs to be our focus. We cannot talk about anything else.” Some people consider this a threat. A handful of fossil fuel lobbyists, politicians and journalists have argued Thunberg is not what she seems; that she was propelled into prominence by environmental groups and sustainable business interests. They say the entrepreneur who first tweeted about the climate strike, Ingmar Rentzhog, used Thunberg’s name to raise investment for his company, but her father says the connection was overblown. Greta, he says, initiated the strike before anyone in the family had heard of Rentzhog. As soon as she found he had used her name without her permission, she cut all links with the company, and has since vowed never to be associated with commercial interests. Her family says she has never been paid for her activities. In a recent interview, Rentzhog defended his actions, denied exploiting Greta and said that climate change, not profit, was his motive. On social media, there have been other crude attacks on Thunberg’s reputation and appearance. Already familiar with bullying from school, she appears unfazed. “I expected when I started that if this is going to become big, then there will be a lot of hate,” she says. “It’s a positive sign. I think that must be because they see us as a threat. That means that something has changed in the debate, and we are making a difference.” She intends to strike outside parliament every Friday until the Swedish government’s policies are in line with the Paris climate agreement. This has led to what she calls “strange contrasts”: balancing her maths homework with her fight to save the planet; listening attentively to teachers and decrying the immaturity of world leaders; weighing up the existential threat of climate change alongside the agonising choice of what subjects to study in high school. It can be gruelling. She still gets up at 6am to get ready for school. Interviews and writing speeches can leave her working 12- to 15-hour days. “Of course, it takes a lot of energy. I don’t have much spare time. But I just keep reminding myself why I am doing this, and then I just try to do as much as I can.” So far, this does not appear to have affected her academic performance. She keeps up with homework and is in the top five in her class, according to her father. And now that she is active on climate, she is no longer lonely, no longer silent, no longer so depressed. She is too busy trying to make a difference. And enjoying herself. This Friday, when she takes her usual spot outside the Swedish parliament, she will be joined by classmates and students from other schools. “It’s going to be very, very big internationally, with hundreds of thousands of children going to strike from school to say that we aren’t going to accept this any more,” she says. “I think we are only seeing the beginning. I think that change is on the horizon and the people will stand up for their future.” And then the activist slips back into being a teenager. “I’m looking forward to it and to see all the pictures the day afterwards. It’s going to be fun.” • This article was amended on 11 March 2019 to revise an explanation of mutism. An earlier version of the piece said: “People with selective mutism typically do not suffer from an inability to talk; rather, they choose not to engage in conversations they do not consider worthwhile.” This is not the accepted definition. The National Health Service, for example, notes: “Selective mutism is a severe anxiety disorder where a person is unable to speak in certain social situations , such as with classmates at school or to relatives they don’t see very often … A child or adult with selective mutism doesn’t refuse or choose not to speak, they’re literally unable to speak.”"
"In his shoddy manifesto, the accused shooter in Christchurch identified as an “eco-fascist”. Over the weekend Kellyanne Conway seized on the term – which is unfamiliar to many – to lump him in with so-called “eco-terrorists”, saying “He’s not a conservative. He’s not a Nazi.” No doubt she was banking on common understandings of contemporary environmentalism to draw a link to the political left.  Unfortunately for Conway, Nazism and a twisted version of ecological thinking are joined in the minds of a share of rightwing extremists. In social media and the more secretive spaces of the online far right, eco-fascists are proselytising for genocidal solutions to environmental problems. On Twitter, the “pine tree gang”, which journalist Jake Hanrahan describes as “less a cohesive movement than a loosely connected online subculture”, have been promoting ideas that blend a sense of impending environmental catastrophe with themes taken from white nationalism. This subculture – which so far appears to be small in number – is frequently drawn to a so-called “terror wave” aesthetic, which elevates images of terrorist insurgency; promotes a specific, martial fashion imagery; and fantasies about armed conflict in the wake of environmental and social collapse.Terror wave forums and threads are full of men in balaclavas, brandishing high-powered weaponry, wearing various combinations of tactical gear, combat uniforms and cheap athleisure wear. Images from the 1990s-era conflicts in the Balkans seem to have a particular appeal. You can browse terror wave images anywhere from Reddit to Imgur to YouTube or Twitter. Eco-fascist groups have also been associated with terrorism-promoting neo-Nazi umbrella groups such as The Base, whose alarming online rhetoric was reported on by Vice in 2018. Of course, the vast majority of contemporary environmentalists – those engaged in the noble, desperate struggle to save the planet from the consequences of human recklessness – are political progressives, and even radical leftists. They are not responsible for the co-optation of environmental thought by the far right, and nor should we conflate their position with that of white nationalists. But eco-fascism is a longstanding political ideology that is currently undergoing a revival in the fetid culture of the contemporary extremist right. In general, unlike many on the political right, eco-fascists concede the reality of looming ecological catastrophe. But the “solutions” they propose are frankly genocidal. Eco-fascists have lamented the despoliation of nature, which they associate with modernity and an industrial society which they feel has diminished the connections between race and territory. One of their principal concerns tends to be what they see as human overpopulation, and the tendency of migration and multiculturalism to move races out of their homelands. This line of thought can ultimately be traced back to figures such as Thomas Malthus, who at the end of the 18th century claimed that population growth was outstripping the capacity for food production, and advocated population control as a solution. Nothwithstanding the bad-faith “Hitler was a vegetarian” smears of conservatives, a strain of ecological thought was present in Nazism. In one of the most important modern accounts of eco-fascism, Janet Biehl and Peter Staudenmaier say that Nazi ecology was “linked with traditional agrarian romanticism and hostility to urban civilization”, and that ecological ideas were an “essential element of racial rejuvenation”. The Nazi slogan “blood and soil” was coined by their foremost ecological thinker, Richard Walter Darré, who meant it to capture a mystical link between race and a particular territory. In the decades since the rise of the modern environmental movement, the far right has continued its efforts to co-opt ecological thoughts and corrupt environmental movements. Some of the most important research on eco-fascism has come from people seeking to resist their entry into the environmental movement. At the same time, a small number of ecological thinkers have allowed themselves to canvass openly anti-human, eliminationist viewpoints that offer a ready basis for authoritarian, genocidal responses to ecological disaster. This is especially true in segments of the so-called “deep ecology” movement. Contemporary eco-fascists are inspired by a number of key figures. One is “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, whose terrorist campaign against what he called “industrial society” combined violence, misanthropy and a self-dramatising manifesto. Kaczynski’s apocalyptic account of a doomed, destructive civilisation – further expounded in his voluminous prison writings – and his willingness to act as a self-appointed executioner of his adversaries is a central inspiration for the would-be terrorists in the eco-fascist movement. Some, including Hanrahan, claim that the Netflix drama, “Manhunt: Unabomber”, aided the growth spurt of contemporary eco-fascism. Another figure who gets a lot of play in contemporary eco-fascist circles is Finnish deep ecologist writer Pentti Linkola, who openly calls for an end to immigration, the reversion to pre-industrial life ways, and authoritarian measures to keep human life within strict limits. Linkola is responsible for one of the starkest presentations of so-called “lifeboat ethics”, the idea that in the context of ongoing environmental collapse, some people should simply be allowed to die. “What to do,” Linkola writes in Can Life Prevail, “when a ship carrying a hundred passengers suddenly capsizes and there is only one lifeboat? When the lifeboat is full, those who hate life will try to load it with more people and sink the lot. Those who love and respect life will take the ship’s axe and sever the extra hands that cling to the sides.” Inspirations such as these have fuelled an online subculture that looks forward to, and even talks about accelerating the end of industrial civilisation. It dreams of a return to a blood and soil relationship between peoples and territories, and of a post-collapse society which will restore the authority of white men. Some of the people involved in this subculture also venerate dramatic images of insurgency and terror. It’s still hard to know how much of the alleged shooter’s manifesto to take seriously, but an eco-fascist inspiration is plausible enough to consider as we wait for more information to emerge from his trial and surrounding investigations. It’s hard to know exactly how many people are immersed in this milieu, but we have seen the damage just one man can do. What else might this ideology inspire? More broadly, while conservatives (like Trump) are fixated on denialism, parts of the radical right not only acknowledge environmental collapse, but welcome it as an opportunity to re-order society along their preferred lines, and to cleanse the Earth of those they despise. This makes a democratic, just, and global response to climate change all the more urgent. We must save our planet, and we must not create even the smallest opportunities for fascists. • Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia"
"My name is Hugh Hunter. I am 15 years old and I live on a farm in Gunnedah in regional NSW. This Friday, I am joining hundreds of thousands of students around the world to strike from school and call for urgent political action to stop the climate crisis. Our message to politicians is simple: if you care about us, our kids and their kids, then please treat climate change for what it is – a crisis – and take urgent action to stop it.  That means stopping Adani’s monstrous coal mine, saying no to all new fossil fuel projects and rapidly transitioning Australia to 100% renewable energy by no later than 2030. My principal doesn’t want me to join the strike, and I do see his point of view. But it wasn’t until I heard about the school strike that I felt I could do something about the climate crisis. When I walk out those gates on Friday I will be creating hope for myself and my generation. I am only at school for another two years but I will be feeling the effects of climate change for the rest of my life. It’s not only Gunnedah that is grappling with climate change. I see the impacts everywhere: the crippling drought that is pushing farmers to the brink, sea levels rising and increasing catastrophic events, yet still many people deny it is happening. The evidence is everywhere, and ignoring it isn’t going to make it go away. But this crisis isn’t just about us. It’s about the people and countries that are too poor to change or don’t have the right to ask for it. These are also the people we are standing up for because we all have to share this world, and at the moment some countries are suffering the worst when they contributed the least to the problem. The climate crisis is not a vague future threat. It is here and it is hurting people right now. The cause of all this is short term thinking. Our government wants what they think is good for Australia; however, this means profits come first and it seems that not much thought is given to the repercussions and long term impacts. I have friends and family that work in coal mining, and I don’t want to risk their livelihoods. But our governments must put in place strategies to transition to 100% renewables immediately. We have the sun and the space for renewables – and they don’t risk our water, communities and climate the way that fossil fuels do. In NSW, 14 new and expanding coal mine projects are in the approvals pipeline. This includes one right near me on the banks of the Namoi River. According to analysis by Lock the Gate these projects would together produce more carbon pollution than Adani’s mega mine proposed for Queensland, and contaminate our valuable water sources. Meanwhile, politicians are discussing the Narrabri Gas Field which is likely to open up our farms to more across the state. Why are these projects and Adani’s coal mine even up for discussion? Communities like mine are already grappling with climate change. Us young people shouldn’t have to go to bed each night worrying about how much worse off we’ll be if all these new coal and gas projects go ahead. As school students, we can’t vote yet. But it’s us who will have to clean up the mess that our politicians are leaving behind. This is not fair, and that is why we are striking. The scientists tell us we have just over a decade to turn the climate crisis around. I will not even be 30 by then. My whole life will be ahead of me, as will the lives of today’s almost 2 billion children. So on 15 March we strike – in over 50 locations across Australia and over 70 countries around the world. And then we go back to our communities to continue the hard work moving Australia beyond fossil fuels to a brighter future for everyone. See you at the strike! • Hugh Hunter is 15 years old and lives in Gunnedah"

Prof. H. Luedecke and C.O. Weiss
(Original German version here.)
We reported recently about our spectral analysis work of European temperatures [1] which shows that during the last centuries all climate changes were caused by periodic (i.e. natural) processes. Non-periodic processes like a warming through the monotonic increase of CO2 in the atmosphere could cause at most 0.1° to 0.2° warming for a doubling of the CO2 content, as it is expected for 2100.
Fig. 1 (Fig. 6 of [1] ) shows the measured temperatures (blue) and the temperatures reconstructed using the 6 strongest frequency components (red) of the Fourier spectrum, indicating that the temperature history is determined by periodic processes only.
On sees from Fig. 1 that two cycles of periods 200+ years and ~65 years dominate the climate changes, the 200+ year cycle causing the largest part of the temperature increase since 1870.

Fig. 1: Construction of temperatures using the 6 strongest Fourier components (red),  European temperatures from instrumental measurements (blue). It is apparent that only  a 200+ year cycle and a ~65 year cycle play a significant role.
The ~65 year cycle is the well-known, much studied, and well understood “Atlantic/Pacific oscillation” (AMO/PDO).  It can be traced back for 1400 years. The AMO/PDO has no external forcing it is “intrinsic dynamics”, an “oscillator”.
Although the spectral analysis of the historical instrumental temperature measurements [1] show a strong 200+ year period, it cannot be inferred with certainty from these measurements, since only 240 years of measurement data are available. However, the temperatures obtained from the Spannagel stalagmite show this periodicity as the strongest climate variation by far since about 1100 AD.
The existence of this 200+ year periodicity has nonetheless been doubted. Even though temperatures from the Spannagel stalagmite agree well with temperatures derived from North Atlantic sedimentation; and even though the solar “de Vries cycle”, which has this period length, is known for a long time as an essential factor determining the global climate.
A perfect confirmation for the existence and the dominant influence of the 200+ year cycle as found by us [1] is provided by a recent paper [2] which analyses solar activities for periodic processes.

Fig. 2: Spectrum of solar activity showing the 208 year period as the strongest climate variation.
The spectrum Fig. 2  (Fig. 1d of [2]) shows clearly a 208-year period as the strongest variation of the solar activity. Fig. 3 (Fig. 4 of [2]) gives us the solar activity of the past until today as well as the prediction for the coming 500 years. This prediction is possible due to the multi-periodic character of the activity.

Fig. 3: Solar activity from 1650 to present (measurement, solid line) and prediction for the coming 500 years (light gray: prediction from spectrum, dark gray: prediction from wavelet analysis). Letters M,D,G denote the historical global temperature minima: Maunder, Dalton, Gleissberg.

The solar activity agrees well with the terrestrial climate. It clearly shows in particular all historic temperature minima. Thus the future temperatures can be predicted from the activities – as far as they are determined by the sun (the AMO/PDO is not determined by the sun).
The 200+ year period found  here [2], as it is found by us [1] is presently at its maximum. Through its influence the temperature will decrease until 2100 to a value like the one of the last “Little Ice Age” 1870.
The wavelet analysis of the solar activity Fig. 4 (Fig. 1b of [2]) has interesting detail. In spite of its limited resolution it shows (as our analysis of the Spannagel stalagmite did) that the 200+ year period set in about 1000 years ago. This cycle appears, according to Fig. 4, regularly every 2500 years. (The causes for this 2500 year period are probably not understood.)

Fig. 4: Wavelet analysis of solar activity (showing which periods were active at which time). The dominant oscillations (periods between 125 years and 250 years) are clearly recognizable and recurring at 2500 years.
Summary
The analysis of solar activity proves the existence and the strength of the 200+ year periodicity which we found from historical temperature measurements, as well as from the Spannagel stalagmite data. This 200+ year cycle is apparently the one known as “de Vries cycle”.
This solar “de Vries cycle together with the AMO/PDO determine practically completely the global climate of the past  (Fig. 1) and the coming time. A significant influence of CO2 on the climate thus has to be excluded. This latter is not surprising in view of the small amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and its weak infrared absorption cross section (also in view of the various proves of NEGATIVE water feedback).

Fig. 5: Predicted global temperature of “official” models  (red) and real (measured) global temperature (green).
The present “stagnation” of global temperature (Fig. 5) is essentially due to the AMO/PDO: the solar de Vries cycle is presently at its maximum. Around this maximum it changes negligibly. The AMO/PDO is presently beyond its maximum, corresponding to the small decrease of global temperature. Its next minimum will be 2035. The temperature can expected to be then similar to the last AMO/PDO minimum of 1940. Due to the de Vries cycle, the global temperature will drop until 2100 to a value corresponding to the “little ice age” of 1870.
It accounts for the long temperature rise since 1870. One may note, that the stronger temperature increase from the 1970s to the 1990s, which is “officially” argued to prove warming by CO2, is essentially due to the AMO/PDO cycle.

"Today, American students from all 50 states are taking part in what could be one of the largest environment protests in history: a global school strike to demand that adults take action on climate change. In addition to a major rally at the US Capitol and more than 70 events around the country, the actions included an 11-minute school walkout at 11am ET to draw attention to a recent UN report warning that we have just 11 years to avoid a climate change catastrophe.  To support the students, and highlight the global emergency, the Guardian devoted our entire US front page – containing more than 40 stories – to climate change coverage from 11am to 11.11am ET. You can view our complete climate front page here.  The Guardian is also providing 24 hours of live coverage of the global student strikes as they travel across countries and time zones. The coverage began last night with our colleagues in Australia and has included reports from correspondents in Thailand, the UK, Belgium, Sweden, France, Spain, the US and many more. Throughout the day, the Guardian will highlight the voices of young people from the US and around the world who have never known a world where the climate isn’t rapidly heating. And in the coming year, and particularly in our 2020 election coverage, the Guardian will strive to feature the voices of young people in our climate reporting to ensure that those whose lives will be most affected by climate policy over the next century are part of the conversation. We hope you will consider making a contribution to support the Guardian’s independent journalism and our unique commitment to climate reporting.  In solidarity with the students joining today's global climate strike, Guardian US is devoting its homepage to climate change for the duration of the walkout, between 11:00 and 11:11am. The 11 minutes represents the number of years the UN has predicted the planet has before a global climate catastrophe. A post shared by  The Guardian US (@guardian_us) on Mar 15, 2019 at 8:03am PDT"
"It’s always unwise to call peak farce when we are dealing with Australia’s torturous climate and energy debate, so perhaps we can just categorise the following incident as mildly surreal. Scott Morrison was in Melbourne for much of this past week. On Wednesday he was out on the hustings with Daniel Andrews, one of the most progressive political leaders in the country, and a premier who has recently secured an emphatic mandate from the people. By stapling himself to Andrews, by cooperating mightily in a state where the Liberals are in deep political trouble, perhaps Morrison was hoping for a small measure of reflected goodwill. Whatever his aspirations, Morrison was asked about coal, as he has been every day since a group of Queensland Nationals decided to go to war with their leader Michael McCormack. The brawl that has fractured the government was unleashed just over a week ago, and it relates to McCormack’s failure to shirt-front the Liberals on coal plants and on divestiture powers to break up energy companies. For some of the rebels, this is a proxy war about Barnaby Joyce returning to the leadership (yes, really). For others, coal and energy really is the burning issue. Reporters inquired on Wednesday how Morrison could tolerate the Nationals defying his leadership by banging on relentlessly about wanting new coal plants. He calmly mouthed the responses prime ministers mouth in trying situations. Morrison noted that Joyce (“a passionate fellow”) had returned the red cordial to the fridge and was now sequestered, spent after a spell of thrashing, on the time-out step. Joyce had “settled” the insurrection, Morrison said, by acknowledging it had been a “misstep” to describe himself as the “elected deputy prime minister”. Having declared peace in our time (and I deploy that phrase in the Neville Chamberlain sense), Morrison then rolled around to energy projects. He said the government was about “supporting the development of commercially viable and feasible baseload power all around the country”. These projects could be “gas, it could be hydrogen … it could be hydro”. There’s a word missing there, right? It starts with c and ends in l. The prime minister declined to utter the word coal. As well as gas, hydrogen and hydro, Morrison noted there could be “other traditional sources”. C-o-a-l could not pass his lips. This omission would be of only glancing interest, or perhaps zero interest, had the prime minister not been the same bloke who, seemingly five minutes ago, had brought a lump of coal into the Australian parliament and brandished it lustily during question time, in one of the most boneheaded performances ever to grace the bear pit. “This is coal,” the then treasurer declared triumphantly in February 2017, brandishing his prop as if he’d just stumbled across an exotic species previously thought to be extinct. “Don’t be afraid,” Morrison said, soothingly, to his political opponents, waving the black rock kindly supplied by the Minerals Council of Australia. “Don’t be scared.” Just for the record, no one was scared then – except perhaps members of the voting public transiently in the visitors galleries of the House of Representatives witnessing the sudden onset of shark-jumping as a parliamentary sport. But perhaps the strange coal seance of 2017 was all a harbinger, more omen than stunt, because it’s pretty clear that Morrison, to borrow from himself, is a bit scared now. Being trepidatious is entirely reasonable, because it’s clear to anyone watching that there is a schism inside the government. Put simply, the schism is this. The Nationals want Morrison to produce a shortlist that commits the Coalition to supporting new coal projects. They want an explicit commitment made in public before the federal election, because they believe that commitment pays political dividends in central Queensland. To underscore this point, Joyce noted during one of his interventions that he was intent on protecting the interests of his regional heartland, and didn’t give a stuff about the climate-induced anxieties of voters in Melbourne. (In case you are wondering, this isn’t the normal Joyce word salad; this is a deliberate smack at the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. The Nationals believe Frydenberg is running most of the internal interference on this issue, because he’s worried about his inner city seat, and others like it.) The Liberals have made it equally clear that they do n-o-t (underlined) want the government to put taxpayers on the hook by supporting coal before the election, because that is the equivalent of cordially inviting their small-l liberal heartland to take out their baseball bats and start swinging come May – not just in Melbourne, but right around the country. If you are Morrison, that’s not an easy difference to split. Unless there’s some grand bargain in the offing – Morrison supporting a north Queensland coal project, then sealing the border allowing any Liberals south of Noosa plausible deniability – this is a straight win/loss proposition. Either the Nationals win, or the Liberals win, and while this unresolved roiling persists (and I predict the Nationals will persist), the bottom line is the government loses. While the priority is internal death match politics, the government makes its own compelling case for why Australian voters should show it the door. Just to summarise the general ludicrousness, in the space of seven months the government has gone from rolling Malcolm Turnbull in large part because he was too progressive on climate change, and dumping the national energy guarantee that might have given them all a measure of electoral protection on this issue, to the prime minister being unable to utter the word coal in public, for fear of offending voters worried about climate change. As the kids say, life comes at you fast. You wouldn’t believe it had you not seen it with your own eyes. Meanwhile, as the numpty show rolled on, and on, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank stood amid the clamour of the week and said what anyone with any respect for facts and evidence now says: climate change is real. It’s not cyclical, it’s a trend, and if we don’t start factoring it into our policy settings and our business decisions (meaning the prudent management of carbon risk), then Australia’s financial stability is at risk. It was an important speech from Guy Debelle, both in terms of the content, and in terms of the signal. Debelle speaks for an institution apparently intent on telling the public it does not intend to drop the ball on this most important of policy issues, which might give the students who demonstrated around the country on Friday some measure of comfort that the failure of their parents isn’t absolute. Eyes will also be on Labor over the coming weeks. The party that wants to form the next government is expected to release the remaining elements of its policy on climate change: what it will do to reduce pollution from heavy emitters, in transport and agriculture. Given the diabolical history of this issue, there is nervousness in Labor’s ranks about the onset of yet another cheap scare campaign once the policy is subjected to scrutiny, and the policy will be heavily scrutinised, not only by journalists but also by the stakeholders now assuming Labor wins the contest in May. Polling, both private and public, makes clear that a majority of Australians want action on climate change. Many voters see the cheapjack opportunism of the past decade as symptomatic of a political system that has lost its way. While political actors who favour rational action on climate change have the wind at their back in a way I haven’t seen since the federal campaign of 2007, there’s only one way to get a mandate to decarbonise the Australian economy. It’s not complicated. You have to seek one, and be brave enough to do that without fudges or strategic omissions or weasel words. -Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"
"They have a national reach that most climate campaigners would die for. They are familiar and respected experts on the science of meteorology. And they have prime-time slots at the end of almost every TV news bulletin, morning, noon and night. But the weather forecasters who guide everything from our clothing choices to our weekend plans seldom – if ever – mention the issue that is increasingly shaping our beloved British weather: climate change. This week, former BBC weatherman Bill Giles broke cover, and called for the BBC and other major broadcasters to overhaul their approach to forecasts, and add in information about the crucial context of climate change to their predictions about the daily weather.  While the weather can’t always straightforwardly be equated with a changing climate, the impacts of climate change are no longer a hypothetical concern, or a discussion for the future. Climate change is with us now, and is manifesting through rising temperatures, more violent and unpredictable storms, and heavier rainfall. What Giles rightly highlighted is that while weather forecasting continues to operate in a vacuum while the climate changes around us, it is abdicating its duty to provide accurate, scientifically-grounded meteorological advice to the public. Don’t people have a right to know how their climate is changing? And aren’t weather forecasts the obvious place to alert us to these new risks that we face? In fact, the UK is lagging far behind many other countries in terms of integrating what we know about climate change with the information provided to the public about the weather. In the notoriously polarised US, a brilliant programme led by George Mason University in Virginia and Climate Central has supported more than 600 TV meteorologists to contextualise their weather forecasts with information about the changing climate. Similar successes have been seen in Australia, where a programme run out of Monash University provides localised climate information in their weather segments. In Belgium, the weather forecaster Jill Peters has made a career from campaigning on climate change. So the silence from British broadcasters is troubling, and Giles’s intervention is long overdue. In a sense, the broadcasters’ nervousness is understandable – for a long time, it simply wasn’t possible to make definitive statements about the relationship between weather and climate. Communicators were faced with a catch-22 situation: make speculative statements about extreme weather and climate change, or sit on their hands while the very changes scientists had been predicting for decades materialised around them. But the science of ‘‘attributing’’ weather events to climate change has accelerated rapidly. It is now possible to say with confidence how much more likely (or how much more intense) a storm, or a heatwave, was made by climate change. Statements about the links between weather and climate still need to be made carefully, and in line with the science. But this kind of probabilistic, risk-based guidance is the bread and butter of TV weather forecasters, and they’re the perfect people to give audiences an insight into how the climate is changing. None of this means that accurate information about the risks of climate change is a panacea for public engagement on climate change. Its now well understood (and more than ever in thisera of “fake news”) that accurate evidence alone is unlikely to move the dial for people who don’t want to hear it. And simply hammering people with information about the risks of climate change could be counterproductive. The social science of climate communication points to the importance of striking a motivating balance between hope and fear in public messages. In practice, this means not only raising the alarm about the often terrifying consequences of a changing climate, but also providing advice and support on what people can do to save more energy, waste less food, or lobby their MP to prioritise climate change. Clearly, our humble weather forecasters can’t do this all on their own. But the inspiring rise of the school strike movement is proof of the frustration and urgency with which young people view the issue that will define their lives, and suggests the era of side lining climate change as something that environmentalists worry about, while the rest of us get on with our lives, may finally be coming to an end. From the way we eat, travel and heat our homes, to the conventions that govern our weather forecasts, climate change needs to move from the margins and into the mainstream – and fast. A daily public narrative that joins the dots between the weather patterns we see outside our windows, and the unprecedented changes now under way in the global climate, is one crucial piece of this puzzle. • Adam Corner is the research director at Climate Outreach and an honorary research fellow in the School of Psychology, Cardiff University"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis morning major media outlets are warning that a major Atlantic storm (Xaver) is brewing East of the southern tip of Greenland.
The DWD has issued the following storm track with projected barometric pressure.

Mi = Wednesday, Do = Thursday, Fr = Friday and Sa = Saturday, T = Low. Source: DWD_presse/status/408119086887870465.
The pressure is expected to drop to 966 hPa by Thursday as Xaver crosses southern Norway and reaches Sweden. Wind speeds could reach 180 km/hour at some North Sea coastal areas. Cities like Hamburg, Bremen and Rostock could see winds of up to 140 km/hr. The back side of the storm is expected to pump Arctic air down over Germany and causing blizzard conditions and heavy snow.

"Brexit is reversible. Article 50 can be juggled, delayed, and bounced around until the government decides to reboot and restart the process. In the meantime, another meaningless “meaningful vote” could happen in the next few days – while we ignore the only threat that truly matters. The effects of climate change are irreversible. That’s why it’s a crisis. The UN’s warning last year lays bare the dangers of this emergency. And these are dangers that we can only attempt to predict, because Earth has never faced a disaster of this nature before: the future is volatile on an unprecedented scale, with famines, floods, and droughts looming over us.   An urgent re-evaluation of our government’s priorities is imperative, morally and fundamentally, for everyone’s sake. The only members of our parliament who seem to have recognised this are the handful who showed up to the climate change debate that followed the last youth strikes. What could have been a revolutionary debate on our future, an opportunity for change and development of our climate policies, was instead just another disappointing instalment in the disheartening saga of government and parliamentary inactivity. What governments all over the world need to realise is that we still have an opportunity to take action. Nothing is as important as tackling climate change. It is our government’s duty to tackle the air pollution crisis, rapidly switch to renewable energy and make our economy more sustainable. We must take advantage of our connected, global community to create change in climate legislation around the world. In the US the Green New Deal spearheaded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which could cut American greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2030, is the very definition of what we must and can achieve as a collective, working together to end corporate climate tyranny. The implementation of similar strategies across the globe, by people united in the aim of saving our planet from ourselves, currently stands as our only solution. There is strength in numbers. The youth strikes have been a testament to the power of international solidarity. We will face our global environmental demise together – we will fight it together. But the dynamic, unified efforts of my generation to effectively save our planet should not be torn apart by nationalism; that would be an affront to all of us. We are going on strike because we are desperate to make the changes necessary for our survival. The only way we can is by cooperating with other countries – particularly European countries, our neighbours, friends, and allies – to legislate new, stricter regulations on the greatest polluters and contributors to global warming, namely, the oil and gas giants, that operate across the continent. Leaving the EU will only exacerbate our climate problems, and Brexit is the distraction climate deniers have longed for. To allow our government to play into their hands is a betrayal of ourselves and our planet – and of every young striker across the globe. The time for isolationism has passed. Instead, as a global collective, we must follow the lead of the younger generations, for their unity is a concrete affirmation of the only option we have left: international action. • Noga Levy-Rapoport, 17, led the London climate strike march on 15 February and has since become a core organiser at UK Student Climate Network"
"I want to say to all the climate strikers today: thank you so much for being unreasonable. That is, if reasonable means playing by the rules, and the rules are presumed to be guidelines for what is and is not possible, then you may be told that what you are asking for is impossible or unreasonable. Don’t listen. Don’t stop. Don’t let your dreams shrink by one inch. Don’t forget that this might be the day and the pivotal year when you rewrite what is possible.  What climate activists are asking for is a profound change in all our energy systems, for leaving fossil fuel in the ground, for taking action adequate to the planet-scale crisis of climate change. And the rules we are so often reminded of by those who aren’t ready for change are not the real rules. Because one day last summer a 15-year-old girl sat down to stage a one-person climate strike, and a lot of adults would like to tell you that the rules say a 15-year-old girl cannot come out of nowhere, alone, and change the world. Sweden’s Greta Thunberg already has. They will tell you the rules are that those we see in the news and the parliaments and boardrooms hold all the power and you must be nice to them and perhaps they will give you crumbs, or the time of day, or just a door slammed in your face. They will tell you that things can only change in tiny increments by predictable means. They’re wrong. Sometimes you don’t have to ask for permission or for anything because you hold the power and you yourselves decide which way the door swings. Nothing is possible without action; almost anything is when we rise up together, as you are doing today. I am writing you in gratitude and enthusiasm as someone who has lived for almost six decades, which has been time enough to see extraordinary change. To see what had been declared impossible happen over and over again. To see regimes topple when ordinary people rise up in nonviolent direct action. To see dramatic expansions of rights in both law and imagination. To see what were once radical new ideas about gender and sexual orientation and race, about justice and equality, about nature and ecology become ordinary accepted ideas – and then to see people forget how our minds were changed, and how much that process matters too. The world I was born into no longer exists. The role of women has changed extraordinarily since then, largely for the better. The entire Soviet empire collapsed suddenly 30 years ago, a few years after the east bloc of communist countries liberated themselves through the actions of people who were themselves supposed to be powerless to topple regimes backed by great militaries and secret police. I saw apartheid fall in South Africa, and a prisoner doing life become its president. I was born into a world where to be gay or lesbian or trans was criminalized, and I watched those laws and attitudes be change in states, in my country, the US, and in many countries. I saw wind and solar power go from awkward, ineffectual, expensive technologies only 20 years ago to become the means through which we can leave the age of fossil fuel behind. I have seen a language to recognize the Earth’s environmental systems arise in my lifetime, a language that can describe how everything is connected, and everything has consequences. Through studying what science teaches us about nature and what history teaches us about social forces I have come to see how beautiful and how powerful are the threads that connect us. Here’s one. Who did Greta Thunberg describe as a key influence on her actions? Rosa Parks. That a black woman born in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1913 would influence a white girl born in Sweden 90 years later to take direct action about climate change is a reminder that everything is connected and your actions matter even when the results aren’t immediate or obvious. The way Rosa Parks broke the rules and lived according to her ideals still matters, still has power, still has influence beyond what she could have imagined, beyond her lifetime, beyond her continent, beyond her particular area of activism. The rules are the rules of the obvious, the easy assumptions that we know who holds power, we know how change happens, we know what is possible. But the real lesson of history is that change often comes in unpredictable ways, power can suddenly be in the hands of those who appear out of what seems to the rest of us like nowhere. I did not see Thunberg coming, or the Sunrise Movement or Extinction Rebellion or Zero Hour. When I went to Standing Rock I never dreamed this indigenous-led uprising against an oil pipeline would inspire Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for office. Nor that she would go on to win a victory that broke all the rules and become the great spokesperson for a Green New Deal. I didn’t dream it, but I knew that something powerful, magical, alive with possibility was happening. That’s why I wasn’t surprised when it did, and why I don’t assume we have seen all of what that gathering in 2016 achieved, either. It is not over, any more than Rosa Parks’s impact is over. Good work matters. Acting on your ideals matters. How it matters is not always immediate or obvious. What I see all around me is what I call climate momentum: people from New Zealand to Norway stepping up their response to climate change. I see pipeline blockades in Canada and the US, I see investors backing off from fracking and coal, I see universities and pension funds divesting from fossil fuel, I see solar farms and wind turbines going in all over the world and engineers working to make the technologies better, I see lawsuits against oil companies and coal companies, I see politicians, newspaper editorialists, businesspeople and others who have power under the usual rules getting on board in a way they never have before. There is so much happening, in so many ways, to respond to the biggest disaster our species has ever faced. It is not yet enough, but it is a sign that more and more are facing the catastrophe and are doing something about it. I don’t know what will happen, because what will happen is what we make happen. That is why there’s a global climate strike today. This is why I’ve started saying, Don’t ask what will happen. Be what happens. Today, you are what is happening. Today, your power will be felt. Today, your action matters. Today in your individual action you may stand with a few people or with hundreds, but you stand with billions around the world. Today you are standing up for people not yet born, and those ghostly billions are with you too. Today you are the force of possibility that runs through the present like a river through the desert.

"Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders: act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency. These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders: we are in a race for our lives, and we are losing. The window of opportunity is closing – we no longer have the luxury of time, and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial.  My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry. Despite years of talk, global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is the highest it has been in 3m years. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3-4°C in the last 50 years. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. Thankfully, we have the Paris agreement – a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action. That is why I am bringing world leaders together at a climate action summit later this year. I am calling on all leaders to come to New York in September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over the next decade, and to net zero by 2050. The summit will bring together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organisations to develop ambitious solutions in six areas: renewable energy; emission reductions; sustainable infrastructure; sustainable agriculture and management of forests and oceans; withstanding climate impacts; and investing in the green economy. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and limit global warming to 1.5C. But if we continue along our current path, the consequences are impossible to predict. While climate action is essential to combat an existential threat, it also comes with costs. So action plans must not create winners and losers or add to economic inequality: they must be fair and create new opportunities for those negatively impacted, in the context of a just transition. Business is on our side. Accelerated climate solutions can strengthen our economies and create jobs, while bringing cleaner air, preserving natural habitats and biodiversity, and protecting our environment. New technologies and engineering solutions are already delivering energy at a lower cost than the fossil-fuel driven economy. Solar and onshore wind are now the cheapest sources of new bulk power in virtually all major economies. But we must set radical change in motion. This means ending subsidies for fossil fuels and high-emitting agriculture and shifting towards renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate-smart practices. It means carbon pricing that reflects the true cost of emissions, from climate risk to the health hazards of air pollution. And it means accelerating the closure of coal plants and replacing jobs with healthier alternatives so that the transformation is just, inclusive and profitable. Momentum is building, people are listening and there is a new determination to unleash the promise of the Paris agreement. The climate summit must be the starting point to build the future we need. I will close with a message for those who marched on Friday. I know young people can and do change the world. Many of you are anxious and fearful for the future, and I understand your concerns and your anger. But I know humankind is capable of enormous achievements. Your voices give me hope. The more I see your commitment and activism, the more confident I am that we will win. Together, with your help and thanks to your efforts, we can and must beat this threat and create a cleaner, safer, greener world for everyone. • António Guterres is secretary general of the United Nations"

"From Australia to America, children put down their books on Friday to march for change in the first global climate strike. The event was embraced in the developing nations of India and Uganda and in the Philippines and Nepal – countries acutely impacted by climate change - as tens of thousands of schoolchildren and students in more than 100 countries went on “strike”, demanding the political elite urgently address what they say is a climate emergency. In Sydney, where about 30,000 children and young people marched from the Town Hall Square to Hyde Park, university student Xander De Vries, 20, said: “It’s our time to rise up. We don’t have a lot of time left; it’s us who have to make a change so I thought it would be important to be here and show support to our generation.” Coordinated via social media by volunteers in 125 countries and regions, the action spread across more than 2,000 events under the banner of Fridays for Future. As dusk fell in the antipodes, the baton was passed to Asia, where small groups of Indian students went on strike for the first time. In Delhi, more than 200 children walked out of classes to protest against inaction on tackling climate change, and similar protests took place on a smaller scale in 30 towns and cities. Vidit Baya, 17, who is in his last year at MDS public school in Udaipur, said: “In India, no one talks about climate change. You don’t see it on the news or in the papers or hear about it from government. “This was our first strike as a nation and there were young people taking strike action in many cities. It is a fledgling movement but we are very happy with our action today. We are trying to get people to be more aware of climate change and the need to tackle it.” Across Africa, there were strikes in several countries. In Uganda, Kampala international student Hilda Nakabuye addressed striking students in the capital.

The children of St James Preparatory in Johannesburg, South Africa, add their voices to the world #FridaysforFuture #ClimateStrike #Greenpeace pic.twitter.com/yK8IlRU7Gp In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. In Sweden, youngsters gathered in Stockholm’s central square to hear 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the girl whose single-minded determination has inspired millions of people around the world and earned a nomination this week for the Nobel peace prize. When she appeared, the crowd chanted her name and she earned cheers and applause by telling them: “We have been born into this world and we have to live with this crisis, and our children and our grandchildren. We are facing the greatest existential crisis humanity has ever faced. And yet it has been ignored. You who have ignored it know who you are.” Political leaders in some countries criticised the strikes. In Australia, the education minister, Dan Tehan, said: “Students leaving school during school hours to protest is not something that we should encourage.” The UK’s education secretary, Damian Hinds, claimed the disruption increased teachers’ workloads and wasted lesson time. But young people brushed off the criticism. Jean Hinchcliffe, 14, striking in Sydney, said on the Today programme: “I have been really frustrated and really angry about the fact I don’t have a voice in politics and I don’t have a voice in the climate conversation when my politicians are pretty much refusing to do anything … So I decided to strike and … suddenly us kids are being listened to and that’s why we continue to strike and feel it’s so important.” In the UK, where an estimated 10,000 young people gathered in London and thousands more took to the streets in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as other towns and cities, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, broke ranks with Hinds and praised the action in a video message with other Conservative MPs. “Collective action of the kind you’re championing can make a difference and a profound one,” Gove said. “Together we can beat climate change. “It will require us to change the way in which our energy is generated, change the way in which our homes are built, change the way in which our land is managed and farming operates. But that change is absolutely necessary.” In Tokyo, young people had earlier marched through the city’s Shibuya scramble crossing as part of the climate strike. About 130 people – including school and university students and other supporters – joined in the march, which started at the United Nations university and wound its way through the streets of the capital, including the busy Omotesando shopping street. One of the organisers, Ten Maekawa, 20, led the crowd in chants of: “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!” Maekawa said he believed it was important for youth to mobilise on the issue: “In 2030, the Earth will be in danger because of climate change. They’re responsible for the future, so it’s very important for the young generation to speak up about climate change.” In Florida, Marcela Mulholland, a 21-year-old student who in her lifetime has witnessed how rising sea levels are threatening her home and community, urged young people across the world to continue their campaign. “There’s no better way to find hope and meaning in this trying time than working alongside fellow people who share my grief for the world,” she said. Elsewhere in the United States, young people carried hand painted signs sporting their own slogans: “Denial is not a policy” and “fight now or swim l8r”. More than a hundred students marched across the Capitol’s lawn in DC, chanting “What do we want? Climate action. When do we want it? Now,” and were urged on by speakers organised by the Youth Climate Strike US. “It is time the world listens to these young people and pays attention to what we’re asking for,” said 16-year-old Maddy Fernands, the group’s press director. The speakers included Minneapolis resident Isra Hirsi, the 16-year-old daughter of Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018. “Yes, we are at a dark moment in our history, but we are the light that can bring change,” Hirsi told the crowd. “We must end the extraction of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world and keep it in the ground.” - Additional reporting by David Crouch in Sweden "
"Extinction Rebellion is an environmental direct action group  If you had told me a few years ago that I would be involved in an environmental movement, I would have thought you were joking. I was far more interested in social inequality and minority rights. But I came to realise that the environment crisis is the biggest threat to us all, and it is people from my background – more disadvantaged, ethnic minority – who are going to bear the brunt of what is coming. The environment is often seen as a white, middle-class issue, while people from my demographic have other things to worry about, such as putting food on the table and paying the bills. But I went along to the first Extinction Rebellion meetings and found that they were organised and people were prepared to do what it takes to make a change: sleeping on office floors, working until 4am, or running around London in the rain, blocking roads – all of which I have done. Being part of that is incredibly inspiring – after a successful action, you can really feel the electricity in the room. But it is also emotionally draining. I was involved in the swarming protests blocking roads, and I saw that we were making life harder for people who were just trying to get to work. But when I raised that point, my voice was heard, and so we are working hard to take actions that only directly impact the elite, who are complicit in creating environmental harm . We have a huge movement building towards Rebellion Day on 15 April and it is incredibly exciting to see it come together. I want to let people know that this is their fight too. Climate justice is tied up with fights for equality and our wider rights – if we don’t take this on, then everything else will be lost. We cannot afford to stand by and do nothing. MT Founded the Ella Roberta Family Foundation, in memory of her nine-year-old daughter who died in 2013. She is campaigning for a new inquest into her daughter’s death, which she believes is linked to air pollution. My daughter suffered terribly – she would stop breathing, have seizures and I would take her to A&E – but no one could explain why it was happening. When she died, I wanted answers. I wanted to know how she became so ill, so quickly; how she died so quickly. She died of an asthma attack, but all the doctors could come up with as a trigger was “something in the air”. She was allergic to pollen, but the consultant said there was no way that her seizure was an allergy to pollen. The first inquest did not come up with any answers. I did not think of air pollution. This was new to me. If you’re a scientist and this is your specialist area, it might not be surprising, but I didn’t know about particulates and nitrogen dioxide. Awareness is key, and so is education – I would say that, as I am a teacher. We should be told more about monitoring air pollution. We have a right to know. So many children are at risk – we believe that the deaths of 16 children in the past 18 months are linked to air pollution. Children continue to get ill, to die. Voices are not being heard. If parents could speak about their experiences – telling a politician not just, “I am worried about my children”, but that “My child had to be resuscitated in A&E last night” – it might make a difference. Two weeks ago, my friend went to buy a new car, and they tried to sell her a diesel car – they told her it was “green”. Who is allowing people to say this in 2019? I continue to be devastated [by Ella’s death], it is still unbearable. What I am learning is how I can use what I have been through to help other young children. I don’t feel like giving up. I feel very strongly that people should shout about this. FH The Lancashire Nanas are a group of women who have been opposing fracking at Preston New Road since 2011. I hadn’t even heard of fracking until 2011. That’s when the energy firm Cuadrilla started fracking, just outside Blackpool, and caused a series of small earthquakes. I had been busy bringing up my three daughters – and latterly, my four grandchildren – and hadn’t really been paying much attention to where my electricity or gas came from. Then I saw an advert in the Blackpool Gazette inviting people to a meeting to learn more about fracking. I went along with my sister and the more we heard, the more concerned we became. Everything we read convinced us that fracking was not a safe or well managed industry. Around that time I was made redundant from my IT job and so my husband and I agreed I would focus on campaigning full-time, and we would just tighten our belts. The idea of the Nanas came because we realised that the media liked to portray people raising these concerns as tree-huggers. We were just normal, everyday women concerned about something on our doorstep. There were 25 to 30 of us at the start, aged between 30 and 70. Now, there are Nanas in their 80s. Not everyone is actually a nana. We just liked the idea of portraying ourselves as matriarchs: you don’t mess with your grandma, do you? It was absolutely devastating in October 2016 when the government gave Cuadrilla the go-ahead to frack at Preston New Road. But we didn’t give up. We were at the gates every day, doing what we could to prevent or slow down vehicles entering the site. The funniest day was when a group of women sat in the road, knitting. It all looked so innocent. The police didn’t notice until it was too late that the women were knitting themselves together. It was a total farce, watching 50 Lancashire police officers try to cut them apart, tripping over wool and pulling them left and right. Fracking didn’t go as Cuadrilla hoped. The drilling produced seismic tremors that breached legal limits. They planned to do more than 40 fracks but only managed two. I would say I am cautiously optimistic they won’t be back. Shares in Cuadrilla’s parent company are down and finally more Tory MPs are coming out against it. And if we can end it here, we might be able to end it everywhere. HP The #FridaysForFuture global school strike takes place tomorrow, inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg It took about a month to persuade my parents that striking was a good idea. I’m 13 and I had seen a video of Greta Thunberg on Twitter, and I thought that was something I could do too. I asked some of my friends, but only one joined me; now we’re averaging about four students and 15 adults . At the first strike, it was quite scary because I didn’t know what people’s reactions would be. It really helped having my friend there. We tried to ignore the people in cars, sitting and pointing at us, but there were a lot of people beeping in support. My mum phoned my headteacher about a week before I started. He can’t support it and he says my school has a lot of climate and environmental education, but I don’t think it does. I get laughed at quite a bit. I’ve met quite a few climate-deniers in school. It makes me really annoyed because people don’t understand, or they don’t care when you try to explain it to them. I’m surprised at how the movement has taken off. Education is valued and if children are sacrificing that, it must be important. The government’s response has been pitiful. At the climate change debate, 610 MPs skipped it – that’s a shocking representation of how little our political leaders care about the very existence of life on this planet. I think there will be hundreds of thousands [of children striking on the 15th]. I wish people knew that we can’t change this unless everyone is working together. ES Manchester Animal Action is an organisation aiming to change society’s attitude towards animals I grew up on a little family farm in the Czech Republic and when I was a kid I was taught to kill animals. It was absolutely normal. I also worked in a chicken slaughterhouse in England when I was 25 to earn some money. That was like hell on earth. I started reading about climate change. One day I learned that there is massive environmental damage and climate change caused by animal agriculture – 80% of deforestation is caused by agriculture. All my illusions about being an environmentalist disappeared. I thought: “I just can’t be this person any more.” I became a vegan six years ago. Every Sunday, we have a stall on Market Street in Manchester – we put out lovely vegan food and leaflets. The ethical aspect doesn’t seem to worry people. So I try to switch the discussion to the environment – people are often shocked and start googling. I also emailed all the [500] employees at my work explaining my views. I got plenty of positive feedback; I did also get people ridiculing it, but I was not offended. The fact is that laughing is better than ignorance. My children have never eaten meat. We used to get their blood tested every six months for iron, vitamins D and B12 etc, but the doctor said we should stop coming back as the results were always perfect. My advice to people who want to talk about veganism would be: stay calm, don’t be judgmental, and never give up trying to help people see there are good reasons for being vegan. In the future, our children will thank us. DC Chief executive of the charity Surfers Against Sewage, who turned their focus to plastic pollution 10 years ago My love of the shoreline and ocean really spans back to the great tidal banks of the Thames, where my father used to take me mudlarking, and exploring UK beaches on family holidays. It is there that the fascination with flotsam and jetsam started. I’ve been surfing in one form or another since I was about 10. Surfing is a perfect nexus between my passion for the environment and my love of sport. In 1991, I entered the Surf to Save competition in Polzeath, which supported NGOs, including the newly formed Surfers Against Sewage. I met some of the founder members – gas mask-wearing, surfboard-waving activists taking to the streets of London. The early days were a true wave of people power that coincided with brilliant new European legislation to clean up our ocean from sewage pollution. The past 30 years have seen water quality at beaches improve dramatically. But the public have been shielded from the growing extent of plastic pollution We have worked for a decade auditing plastic on our beaches, running beach cleans, calling for legislation and industry action. Blue Planet II had only 14 minutes on plastic, out of seven hours of broadcasting, but it changed how the world sees plastic. It helped to propel our work to a bigger stage. Now, a dynamic movement of people, which we describe as #GenerationSea, has come together to help us call for new government policy and legislation, and changes within industry. FH Sheffield Tree Action Groups formed to stop Sheffield council felling as many as 17,500 trees in the city. In the past five years, 5,500 have been chopped down by contractors for the Labour council. When they started taking the trees down, it took a while for people to realise the extent of it. It is so upsetting to see these magnificent trees felled; it has turned me and others into a city of environmental activists. I have taken more direct action in the past few years than I have ever done before. About four of us are older women; we call ourselves the Tree Sisters. People say we chain ourselves to the trees, but we stand under them. Around Christmas 2017, we were on watch for trees we knew were going to be felled. It meant getting up very early – you never know when they are going to come – and being on the lookout all day long, in the winter cold, to get out there before the contractors reached the tree. It was just punishing hours and it was shit. The advantage was you could see them arriving to put barriers around the trees. They employ security men, who were previously bouncers, and the police can get involved. In a lot of cases, 60 men will arrive to fell one tree. This time it was just the barrier men and a team of security. The security man was trying to tell me it was illegal for me to be there – it wasn’t. I didn’t move and they put the barriers up around me. I was feeling a bit shaken because it is a scary situation, and I am 66 and a pensioner. But friends were gathering round to support me, and it was cold, so I thought: “Let’s sing some carols.” I started singing The 12 days of Christmas, replacing the words with: “A goldfinch in a plane tree and 12 barrier men.” In the end, when they left without felling the tree, one of the men said to me: “Thank you, we have really enjoyed that.” SL Grow Heathrow is an eco-squat on 30 acres of land, adjacent to the site of the proposed third runway. I grew up on a small farm in the Gower, Wales, which is a really beautiful place and so I have always been connected to nature. But my first direct action was marching against student cuts. It was the first time I got really angry and realised that the people in charge are not always right, they don’t always know the answers and I needed to get my voice heard out there. Two years ago, I went to my first mass action, protesting about the coal mining in a massive area of the Rhineland, Germany. Our group stopped a train from delivering to a power plant. We linked our arms and sat down on the train track. You have an adrenalin rush like you have never felt before. It was there that I heard about the Grow Heathrow camp. Living here gives me the freedom to get involved in lots of environmental campaigns, anti-fracking and protests against open cast coal mining in the Pont Valley. We are all one movement, united in fighting for environmental justice. The way society is living now is not sustainable. We have to act now or regret it later. SL Works with ClientEarth charity that uses the law to protect the planet and the people who live on it I don’t feel I am a hero. I’m a lawyer. I use the law to protect the environment and people’s health. We are a legal NGO that works on climate litigation and strategic cases that can help to develop the law, to compel governments to put proper environmental measures in place. I didn’t start out this way. I used to be a defence lawyer, representing companies that were sued. Now, I have changed sides. We are working at the cutting edge of the law. Things are moving rapidly. Before I joined ClientEarth four years ago, people I knew thought climate litigation was far-fetched. But now cases are being brought in the US, the Philippines and Europe. In the UK, our biggest victory was over air pollution, which is closely linked to emissions cuts. The first case went all the way to the supreme court and the European court of justice. Climate change is so amorphous that it affects everything – how much food we can grow, whether our homes are flooded, what damage payouts insurance companies have to make. All these areas involve legal risks. In the future, I think you will see more individuals seeking to hold governments to account to reduce emissions. You could see more claims against companies for not doing enough. And there will be more challenges related to human rights, by the people impacted by climate change. Lawyers will be busy. The past four years has made me very concerned about the need to drive down CO2 emissions and how interesting and helpful the law can be. Used incisively and carefully, it can deliver change and major shifts in thinking. I’ve learned that there are opportunities to be creative. You don’t expect that with the law, do you? JW A birder and activist from the Chew Valley, she campaigns for endangered wildlife and organises nature camps for inner city minority ethnic teenagers  I’m 16 and my parents have taken me birdwatching since I was a baby. It has always been part of my life. When I was seven, my parents heard that the first ever eastern crowned warbler had been seen in Britain. Luckily, I had a day off school, and we drove five hours to see it. It was around the edge of a huge quarry like an amphitheatre and I was amazed to see so many people cared about this little brown bird. I’ve been very lucky to travel around the world. During half-term in Spain recently, I saw my 5,000th bird species in the world. It was a rock bunting, which is a brilliant bird. My parents have always been very open about what is going on in the world. I was 12 or 13 and had built up a relatively large online following when I started campaigning. The first proper campaign I launched was to save the spoonbill sandpiper in Bangladesh, where my mum is from. I also campaigned over the 2014 oil spill in the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. In 2015, I read an American Birdwatching Association article about how the environmental sector is incredibly white. It made me stop and think. I knew I was the only one like me as a kid. I just felt sad because others should have that opportunity. Since then I’ve campaigned to bring diversity into wildlife conservation. In three-and-a-half years, I’ve seen so much change. People forget that we are animals, too. The NHS has started prescribing going out into nature because it is good for our mental health. If we care for nature, it’s not entirely altruistic. We get benefits, too. PB"
"Greta Thunberg, the founder of the Youth Strike for Climate movement, has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize, just before the biggest day yet of global action. Thunberg began a solo protest in Sweden in August but has since inspired students around the globe. Strikes are expected in 1,659 towns and cities in 105 countries on Friday, involving hundreds of thousands of young people. “We have proposed Greta Thunberg because if we do nothing to halt climate change it will be the cause of wars, conflict and refugees,” said Norwegian Socialist MP Freddy André Øvstegård. “Greta Thunberg has launched a mass movement which I see as a major contribution to peace.” “[I am] honoured and very grateful for this nomination,” said Thunberg on Twitter. Tomorrow we #schoolstrike for our future. And we will continue to do so for as long as it takes.” She has already challenged leaders in person at the UN climate summit in late 2018 and at Davos in January. “Change is coming whether they like it or not,” she said. National politicians and some university professors can nominate candidates for the Nobel peace prize, which will be awarded in December. There are 301 candidates for the 2019 prize: 223 individuals and 78 organisations. In 2014, the peace prize was awarded to 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai, “for the struggle ... for the right of all children to education”. She survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012. While some politicians have opposed the school strikes, many have supported them, including Germany’s Angela Merkel and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar. The mayors of Paris, Milan, Sydney, Austin, Philadelphia, Portland, Oslo, Barcelona and Montreal added their backing on Thursday. “It is truly inspiring to see young people, led by brilliant young women, making their voices heard and demanding urgent climate action. They are absolutely correct that our actions today will determine their futures,” said Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris and chair of the C40 group of cities. “My message to young citizens is clear: it is our responsibility as adults and political leaders to learn from you and deliver the future you want.” The strikes have also been supported by the former head of the Anglican church Rowan Williams and the head of Amnesty International, Kumi Naidoo. “Children are often told they are ‘tomorrow’s leaders’. But if they wait until ‘tomorrow’ there may not be a future in which to lead,” said Naidoo. “Young people are putting their leaders to shame with the passion and determination they are showing to fight this crucial battle now."

"A Senate committee examining whether to lift the current cap on water buybacks has heard evidence that it would be cheaper to buy more water from farmers and then inject savings into rural communities to create other types of jobs than opt for water-savings projects – but the federal government has never explored the option. The committee is examining legislation, backed by Labor, the Greens and independents to repeal the cap that prevents more than 1,500 gigalitres of water being bought back from agriculture to assist the environment.  Instead, the government wants the balance of the 2,750-gigalitre target for environmental water to be achieved through efficiency and on-farm projects, in order to avoid what it says will be serious economic impacts of withdrawing water from farms in rural areas. But under questioning this week, departmental officials said they had not looked into whether it would be more efficient to invest in basic services such as education, health or other activities in affected regions, rather than pour money into “supply and efficiency measures” which include projects such as lining irrigation channels to reduce evaporation. “It’s a gaping ‘waterhole’ in the government’s due diligence and policy,” said Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick. Evidence presented to the committee shows that the cost of past river “infrastructure projects” has come in at 2.7 times more per megalitre (returned the river) than simply buying back water entitlements, and could be even higher, depending on accounting methods used. “On the latest numbers from the Australian government data that’s available, the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers,” Prof Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford school at ANU, told the committee. The committee heard this week that a study by professorial fellow Glyn Wittwer showed that spending on health, education and basic services produced three to four times more jobs than the same level of expenditure on irrigation infrastructure investment. Both the Department of Agriculture and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority conceded they had never examined that approach. The first assistant secretary of the agriculture department’s water division, Paul Morris, said government policy was to “focus on infrastructure”. “I find this almost unbelievable and most irresponsible,” Patrick said. “The government has a low-risk option that creates more jobs and it’s not taking it. Indeed, it hasn’t even investigated it”. The difference between buying back water and efficiency projects is looming large in water policy because the next stage of the Murray-Darling basin plan relies much more heavily on efficiency projects to achieve 605GL of water for the environment. Most of the easier projects have already been implemented, meaning that governments will now have to back more risky and untested projects. One of these is the Menindee Lakes project put forward by NSW, which aims to save 105GL by reducing evaporation. This involves shrinking the lakes and managing them differently. The project has been heavily criticised for its lack of work on environmental impact, particularly in the wake of the fish kills in the Menindee Lakes area."
"Toyota and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) will kick in $7.4m to transform part of the carmaker’s decommissioned car manufacturing site in Altona into a commercial-grade hydrogen production and refuelling site. The new centre will demonstrate the processes required to produce hydrogen from renewable sources through electrolysis, and then the subsequent compression and storage.  Arena says the centre, once operational, will produce at least 60kg of renewable hydrogen each day, with onsite solar PV and battery storage providing electricity to support the energy requirements of the project. The president and chief executive of Toyota Australia, Matt Callachor, says the new centre on the Altona site will contribute to the carmaker meeting its target of zero CO2 emissions from sites and vehicles by 2050. “Hydrogen has the potential to play a pivotal role in the future because it can be used to store and transport energy from wind, solar and other renewable sources to power many things, including vehicles like the Toyota Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle,” Callachor said. “Right now, the biggest factor to the success of hydrogen being widely available is the lack of infrastructure,” the Toyota chief said. “The sooner we move to a zero-emissions society, the better, and Toyota is committed to making this a reality.” The Morrison government has opened public consultations on a national hydrogen strategy, after engaging Australia’s chief scientist to develop a roadmap with the cooperation of Canberra and the states. The Coalition’s move follows a commitment from Labor in January to set aside $1bn in funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for clean hydrogen development, and to invest up to $90m from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for research, demonstration and pre-commercial deployment of hydrogen technologies. Hydrogen is being promoted as a replacement for natural gas. It is being used overseas in the transport sector and in electricity generation. Last December, the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, recommended state and federal energy ministers take three immediate steps to develop the industry. He recommended work to allow up to 10% hydrogen in the domestic gas network, including making the required regulatory changes and implementation of technical standards. He said governments should scope potential for building hydrogen refuelling stations in every state and territory, focused on heavy transport, and undertake what he termed “co-ordinated international outreach to keep building Australia’s profile with major trading partners as a potential supplier”. Finkel said heavy vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells could meet increasing demand for zero-emissions transport, and replacing natural gas with hydrogen was an economical way of decarbonising direct combustion. The Arena chief executive officer, Darren Miller, said on Tuesday the demonstration of low-cost hydrogen production and distribution on the Altona site “is key to the uptake of hydrogen-powered electric vehicles in areas such as truck, bus and government fleets”. Miller welcomed Toyota’s decision to invest in local hydrogen infrastructure. “Australia holds a competitive advantage to play a global role in the emerging hydrogen export market due to our existing expertise and infrastructure,” the Arena chief said. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, said Australia had the potential to be a “world leader in hydrogen” because of abundant energy resources and proximity to emerging export markets in north Asia. Toyota’s electrolyser and hydrogen refuelling station is expected to be fully operational by late 2020."

"The young people taking to the streetsfor the climate strike are right: their future is being stolen. The economy is an environmental pyramid scheme, dumping its liabilities on the young and the unborn. Its current growth depends on intergenerational theft. At the heart of capitalism is a vast and scarcely examined assumption: you are entitled to as great a share of the world’s resources as your money can buy. You can purchase as much land, as much atmospheric space, as many minerals, as much meat and fish as you can afford, regardless of who might be deprived. If you can pay for them, you can own entire mountain ranges and fertile plains. You can burn as much fuel as you like. Every pound or dollar secures a certain right over the world’s natural wealth. But why? What just principle equates the numbers in your bank account with a right to own the fabric of the Earth? Most people I ask are completely stumped by this question. The standard justification goes back to John Locke’s Second Treatise of Government, published in 1689. He claimed that you acquire a right to own natural wealth by mixing your labour with it: the fruit you pick, the minerals you dig and the land you till become your exclusive property, because you put the work in. This argument was developed by the jurist William Blackstone in the 18th century, whose books were immensely influential in England, America and elsewhere. He contended that a man’s right to “sole and despotic dominion” over land was established by the person who first occupied it, to produce food. This right could then be exchanged for money. This is the underlying rationale for the great pyramid scheme. And it makes no sense. For a start, it assumes a Year Zero. At this arbitrary point, a person could step on to a piece of land, mix their labour with it, and claim it as theirs. Locke used America as an example of the blank slate on which people could establish their rights. But the land (as Blackstone admitted) became a blank slate only through the extermination of those who lived there. Not only could the colonist erase all prior rights, he could also erase all future rights. By mixing your labour with the land once, you and your descendants acquire the right to it in perpetuity, until you decide to sell it. You thereby prevent all future claimants from gaining natural wealth by the same means. Worse still, according to Locke, “your” labour includes the labour of those who work for you. But why should the people who do the work not be the ones who acquire the rights? It’s comprehensible only when you realise that by “man”, Locke means not all humankind, but European men of property. Those who worked for them had no such rights. What this meant, in the late 17th century, was that large-scale landrights could be justified, under his system, only by the ownership of slaves. Inadvertently perhaps, Locke produced a charter for the human rights of slave holders. Even if objections to this could somehow be dismissed, what is it about labour that magically turns anything it touches into private property? Why not establish your right to natural wealth by peeing on it? The arguments defending our economic system are flimsy and preposterous. Peel them away, and you see that the whole structure is founded on looting: looting from other people, looting from other nations, looting from other species, and looting from the future. Yet, on the grounds of these absurdities, the rich arrogate to themselves the right to buy the natural wealth on which others depend. Locke cautioned that his justification works only if “there is enough, and as good, left in common for others”. Today, whether you are talking about land, the atmosphere, living systems, rich mineral lodes or most other forms of natural wealth, it is clear there is not “enough, and as good” left in common. Everything we take for ourselves we take from someone else. You can tweak this system. You can seek to modify it. But you cannot make it just. So what should take its place? It seems to me that the founding principle of any just system is that those who are not yet alive will, when they are born, have the same rights as those who are alive today. At first sight, this doesn’t seem to change anything: the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”. But this statement is almost meaningless, because there is nothing in the declaration insisting that one generation cannot steal from the next. The missing article might look like this: “Every generation shall have an equal right to the enjoyment of natural wealth.” This principle is hard to dispute, but it seems to change everything. Immediately, it tells us that no renewable resource should be used beyond its rate of replenishment. No non-renewable resource should be used that cannot be fully recycled and reused. This leads inexorably to towards two major shifts: a circular economy from which materials are never lost; and the end of fossil fuel combustion. But what of the Earth itself? In this densely populated world, all land ownership necessarily precludes ownership by others. Article 17 of the Universal Declaration is self-contradictory. It says, “Everyone has the right to own property.” But because it places no limit on the amount one person can possess, it ensures that everyone does not have this right. I would change it to this: “Everyone has the right to use property without infringing the rights of others to use property.” The implication is that everyone born today would acquire an equal right of use, or would need to be compensated for their exclusion. One way of implementing this is through major land taxes, paid into a sovereign wealth fund. It would alter and restrict the concept of ownership, and ensure that economies tended towards distribution, rather than concentration. These simple suggestions raise a thousand questions. I don’t have all the answers. But such issues should be the subject of lively conversations everywhere. Preventing environmental breakdown and systemic collapse means challenging our deepest and least-examined beliefs. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

"The Guardian asked student environmentalists from groups including the Youth Climate Strike US, the Sunrise Movement, Zero Hour, and Youth v. Apocalypse to explain why they are going on strike. Here are some of the responses we received, but you can read more on our 24-hour Climate Strike edition of our live blog.  I am 17 and cannot vote. Young people are not given social or legal agency over their own lives. We are often marginalized in adult spaces, and I’ve spent many conversations waiting for an invitation to speak because the adults talking took automatic authority. When generations of elected leaders have failed to take action on a crisis clearly and undeniably present, it falls on the shoulders of young people to make change happen. My generation has the solutions, and I am joining the Youth Climate Strike to break the pattern of adults silencing youth voices. I am a descendant of Holocaust victims, and I was born in New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. These tragic events allowed for my birth and made my loved ones and me who we are. Because of this, I recognize that terrible things can create good. When I feel overwhelmed by fear about the future, I fight it by remembering that the climate crisis is a chance to create lasting justice, from overpowering greedy corporations to demanding change for people of color who are disproportionately impacted by environmental issues. Supporting the Green New Deal, which prioritizes the most at-risk people and provides alternatives to those corporations, helps me know I’m doing good, not just preventing bad. I’m striking Friday because I live in Philadelphia, a city I love with my whole heart. Philadelphia is one of the most polluted major cities in the United States. In Philadelphia, at least 50% of our air pollution comes from fossil fuel projects around the city, most of which are located in low-income communities and communities of color. In Philadelphia, public schools missed five days of school in August and September this year due to excessive heat. In Philadelphia, 156,000 people, or 10% of our population, will be displaced by sea level rise if we don’t make drastic changes to our carbon emissions. I’m striking because I feel like I have run out of ways to communicate to my elected officials, that inaction on the climate crisis is violence, and that it is my life and air and future, and the lives and air and futures of every other 17-year-old girl – every young person – that are on the line. There is no planet B for my generation to escape the consequences of climate change. As a 17-year-old environmental justice activist, I fight for climate protection and a world run without pollution from fossil fuels. As I became more involved in the Zero Hour movement, I learned that where I live, in Riverside county, California, has some of the worst air quality in our country. Online and multinational corporations have built mega-developments and warehouses next to homes and schools across the inland region of southern California. The carbon emissions produced from the gas and diesel trucks, power plants and diesel trains contribute to the horrendous air quality that kills 15 people a day in California’s South Coast Air District. These deaths come in the form of intense allergies and asthma, chronic bronchitis, cancer and even heart attacks, according to the California Air Resources Board. Although that is our current reality, we, the youth of America, have the power to change the current policies that allow this. This is why I am working with youth leaders to start organizing climate strikes across California. Climate strikes are just one tactic to raise awareness and call people to action. Our network is working on increasing accessibility to striking. Not all students are able to strike, many who come from low-income communities of color cannot afford to miss school for climate justice. We must do better to reach our masses, show solidarity, and advocate by any means necessary. I am striking Friday, March 15th for my community and for those that cannot be present. This global movement is determined to make a difference on a mass scale towards clean air, energy, and zero emission from pollution. You can read more statements from young climate activists on our 24-hour live blog documenting the global climate strikes."
"Tim Flannery laments that young Australians today will never be able to experience in the same way the natural wonders he enjoyed in his youth. He grew up in Melbourne on remnants of the sandplain flora, “one of the great floristic gems of Australia,” he says. Once smothered in flowers in springtime, it has now largely been lost through development and altered burning regimes. Flannery, 63, spent his youth swimming and scuba diving in northern Port Phillip bay, which he says is now also gravely deteriorated.  He further points to the Great Barrier Reef, which suffered unprecedented mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and the “serious questions” about whether it can now be saved. “Something like 70% of the reef that was there a century ago is now dead,” he says. But without detailed records on species distributions, it’s impossible to map the losses due to climate change, explains Flannery, who recently returned to the 192-year-old Australian Museum in Sydney, where he was principal mammalogist from 1984–1999. Rather than being “a fusty old relic” the museum is playing a vital role in this, he says. “The collections that say where things were, and when, are here – and that’s the most important asset we’ve got to understand the response of biodiversity to climate change … The people of New South Wales need to understand what a valuable asset they have.” Flannery – who has named more than 30 new mammals over his career and was the Australian government’s climate commissioner from 2011–2013 – relocated to Sydney in January for the year-long role as a distinguished research fellow. This position, as the museum’s de facto climate change ambassador, was funded by anonymous private donors. While species loss is heartbreaking, Flannery says what keeps him awake at night worrying are the human impacts. “Global hunger has increased for the last three years because of extreme weather events, and that follows many decades of improvement,” he says. “To see that going backwards is terrifying, quite frankly. Nothing is more important than global food security.” Bringing attention to the plight of those suffering the effects of climate change, such as Australia’s Pacific Islander neighbours, is one of a series of goals he has set for his time at the museum. In 2018, Flannery sailed from the Solomon Islands to Vanuatu and the story was the same nearly everywhere. “Village after village was going underwater,” he says. Impacts ranged from lost soccer fields and crops through to devastation of villages and coral reef resources. Younger islanders understand “Australia is partly to blame because we have done so little, and they are quite angry”, says Flannery. The goal, he says, is “a better understanding in Australia of the often-catastrophic impacts that climate change is having on our near neighbours – and with government and individual awareness we can start doing something”. Inadequate action by governments has been brought into focus by ever-more alarming reports about the rate of warming, such as the recent long-term forecast from the UK Met Office that we might temporarily exceed 1.5C of average warming over preindustrial levels in the next five years. Preventing warming from exceeding 1.5C in the long term was one of the targets agreed by the world’s nations in the UN’s 2015 Paris agreement. “Sadly, I’ve been aware of [the urgency of] this for a long time,” says Flannery, who believes that breaching that threshold is inevitable in the next few decades, and that we are probably already committed to 2C of warming, “which is towards the catastrophic end of things”. Instead of getting “dismayed and depressed”, he suggests we focus on damage that’s still within our power to avoid. “We have to reduce emissions as hard and fast as possible … [and] develop technologies that will get gigatons of carbon dioxide out of the air by 2050.” Technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – such as giant seaweed farms and processes to accelerate weathering of silicate rocks – have been a focus of his of late. “We can claw back some of the damage. We will go through 2C, but hopefully come out the other side.”  While the debate over the science of climate change is long settled in Europe, political inertia has dogged Australia and the US, which notably pulled out the Paris accord following the election of Donald Trump. But Flannery sees a shift in the air – particularly in the wake of climate-linked disasters including the mass bleaching events; mass fish kills on the Darling River; and droughts, heatwaves and bushfire seasons that are all increasing in duration and intensity. “The speed and scale of impacts have been something that is really shocking,” says Flannery, who was on the Australian Academy of Science’s expert panel investigating the Darling River fish kills, and which this week laid the blame on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority for ignoring scientific advice and the threat from climate change. “People are shocked, but … they should be angry,” he adds. “The consequences will grow year by year, and stuff we were warning people about 20 years ago is now coming to fruition and is impossible to deny, unless you are wilfully blind. “Bullshit baffles brains, but only temporarily and we’ve gone through a period in Australia and the US where people have been able to lie … But we’re in a different world now, a world where people are living with climate change consequences, and bullshit is no longer baffling brains, and so we are about to see a big shift.” One transformation he’s seen is farmers changing from being deniers to advocates for action. “People see extreme weather events and don’t just think this is an odd occurrence, they see it as part of the longer-term trajectory of change that’s going to bring about more and more adverse consequences unless something is done,” he says. Earlier this year the Australian government formally noted the world’s first species to suffer extinction at the hands of climate change – the Bramble Cay melomys, a Torres Strait rodent that washed away in a storm surge caused by rising sea levels. Australia’s museums have a critical role to play in research and keeping collections and records that inform us about species such as this, so we can map changes and losses. Despite this, a lack of investment has plagued many of our museums, including the Australian Museum, which put a freeze on capital expenditure in December to help cover costs of renovations to take larger touring exhibits, including one on Tutankhamun, slated for 2021. Research staff numbers have fallen here and at other museums in recent decades “but the sort of skills that museums specialise in have never been more needed”, says Flannery, who was also previously the director of the South Australian Museum. Examples of crucial records held at the Australian Museum include that there were once “rock wallabies on Middle Head, rufous bettongs at Rose Bay and – until the 1970s – eastern quolls at Vaucluse, the last colony on mainland Australia”, Flannery says. He now hopes to muster the power of citizen scientists to gather data on the effects of climate change on the New South Wales environment. “Looking at the timing of when things happen – when plants bloom and when insects pupate … is one of the best ways of measuring climate change, and people can do it in their gardens,” he says."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThese are just some of the key headline words Europeans can expect to see and hear by Thursday and Friday.
The media, climate activists, and reinsurers are already salivating massively.
For sure the scientists at the PIK and Mojib Latif are already practicing their lines. They’re eagerly standing by their phones, ready for the media at a second’s notice.
The end of times is approaching. We should have all reduced that carbon footprint of ours. But we didn’t, and so get ready to pay.
Most of the weather misery, however will have been caused by black carbon witchcraft…cast by the 90 or so top carbon emitters, who have now been clearly identified. Once the violent storm passes, the climate witch-hunters will be out in full force, calling for the immediate purge of the carbon witches…bonfires will be burning at almost every town square. Let’s not waste time with trials.
Powerful North Sea storm brewing
The weather models are showing that a major winter hurricane-force storm will be sweeping across northern Europe Thursday and Friday. The chart above shows it’s going to be a powerful one, and so you may want to tie down that lawn and garden furniture, etc. Forget the stroll in the forest.

Meteorologist Dominik Jung at wetter.net writes that the pressure at the storm’s centre will drop to a rock bottom 960 mb by Thursday evening. Meanwhile at the storms outer edge the pressure will be around 1023 mb. That’s a difference of 56 mb across Germany!
The hardest hit areas will be the North sea coastal areas of Holland, Germany, and Scandinavia. Jung warns that huge storm surges have to be expected.
Hopefully authorities will act more quickly this time around.
Here are some projected wind speeds for some cities:
Hamburg: up to 120 km/h
Bremen: up to 130 km/h
Helgoland: up to 150 km/h
Rostock: up to 110 km/h
Berlin: up to 100 km/h
Hanover: up to 100 km/h
Cologne: up to 80 km/h
Frankfurt/Main: up to 70 km/h

"I am going on strike today because I don’t want to live in a world without wilderness. I have been lucky enough to grow up in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The place I call home is one of red rock and prickly pear cactus, dust and juniper trees and rattlesnakes, yet it is the state with the fourth highest species diversity in the country. Here, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, I was brought up by the Chamisa desert, aspen groves and pine forests that all so miraculously coexist. The harsh contrast of sharp rock and vast, echoing, azure sky have taught me everything I know about being human. I am blessed by this land every day, and I am ashamed that my kind have neglected to care for the livelihood of river otter, black bear, wolf, the smell of the desert after a rain. These are what make my life worth living. And they are diseased, as is the Earth, as is our own culture. I am sick to my stomach at the already catastrophic loss of beauty we have caused. I am brokenhearted and sad. Most of all, I am angry. I am enraged at the inaction of our leaders, not only in regards to the extinction of species and decimation of wild places, but also at the blatant disrespect for human life and the survival of future generations in a livable world. It is time to be terrified, enraged, heartbroken, grief-stricken, radical. It is time to act We are living in the sixth mass extinction. Ice is melting. Forests are burning. Waters are rising. And we do not even speak of it. Why? Because admitting the facts means admitting that we are committing crimes of epic proportions just by living our daily lives. Because counting the losses means being overpowered by grief. Because allowing the scale of the crisis means facing the fear of swiftly impending disaster and the fact that our entire system must change. But now is not the time to ignore science in order to save our feelings. It is time to be terrified, enraged, heartbroken, grief-stricken, radical. It is time to act. That is why I have spent the last month frantically organizing a climate strike event in New Mexico. My future is at stake, as are the futures of my friends and family, and whatever next generations we might bring into the world. But our present is also at stake. And whoever is alive at this very moment must have a hand in this fight and a voice in this conversation. So come strike with us! This is home we are talking about! This is Earth! I am in love with this enchanted land; I cannot live without its wilderness, and neither can you. Hannah Laga Abram, 18, is the state lead organizer for US Youth Climate Strike in Santa Fe, New Mexico"
"On Friday 15 March young people around the world will be walking out of their classrooms to strike for action to save the planet from climate change. As part of our global coverage of this extraordinary event, we have invited some of the young campaigners to be available online for a discussion with readers and with Guardian columnist and environmental campaigner George Monbiot.  George has written about how the campaign requires the support of all generations to succeed, but how does that work in practice? What does success mean and how can it be achieved?.  If you have questions for the youth campaigners or for George Monbiot about this growing movement or about how to become involved more generally in climate activism you can share them below. Ask your question in the form below before Friday 15 March. We would like to hear from readers of all ages so please let us know how old you are and where you live, but if you’re under 16 you’ll need to get your parents’ permission before you send a response to us. We will get in touch to confirm this with you. If you are taking part in the climate strike you can also get in touch via our dedicated callout here. If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here."

"Since we made headlines in February with the UK’s first school strike, we’ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers, parents, carers, politicians and other people from all walks of life. It seems that most people know we’re in a mess, but they just didn’t know what we can to do to get out of it. This is where the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) stepped in, not necessarily out of choice, but necessity. There’s no time left for the “adults in the room” to solve the climate crisis. The politicians and powerful actors have failed us. Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we’re emerging as one of the most powerful forces, demanding urgent and radical change.  The time for words is over, we need an era for action to stop impending climate breakdown. Pay attention, listen to us and, importantly, listen to the voices of those around the world already suffering the devastating effects of climate change. We may be young, but we’re fierce and we understand the challenges ahead of us. However, if we’re to be successful and create a world that remedies the situation we’re confronted with, everyone needs to step up and demand a better world. A world free from the inequalities of climate change, a world free from the economic disparities created by the system that is to be held responsible for the climate crisis. Climate change is the unifying issue of this generation. We’re united under the banner of “system change, not climate change”. We’re forging a vision for a better world, one aligned with climate justice as a primary value, not a tokenistic phrase to throw around with little thought for its meaning. We need you to support us in forging this world out of the ashes of our current one. Here’s how: Join the UK Student Climate Network and organise with us. Strike in your towns and cities. We’re a caring, thoughtful community, breaking down old prejudices and fighting for a more just world. You can set up a branch of UKSCN in your area and start doing weekly, fortnightly or monthly strikes. You can find information on how to get started on our website by clicking here. To get involved wherever you are in the world, head to the Fridays for Future website to find your nearest strike action. If there isn’t one nearby, register, start talking to friends, family, neighbours and everyone else. You’re joining a global movement and everyone has a part to play. If you aren’t able to give your time, why not make a financial contribution to support our fight? We have no illusions that change won’t be difficult to achieve, but we’re going to give it our best shot! We all need to take positive action and put pressure on our elected representatives, no matter which party they belong to. For too long our governments and others in positions of power have failed to take the necessary action and have relied upon delaying, denying and drowning out the voices of those who want to tackle the climate crisis. If those in power fail to enact the necessary changes, we need to give them the boot and elevate the voices that will stand up for people and planet. We need real leadership now. We’re not learning about climate breakdown. How we are to prepare for a drastically different world, or even properly fight for a different one if knowledge is being withheld? If you’re a teacher in a school or college or a lecturer in university you can put pressure on your institution to make the change. However, don’t just wait for change to happen, we need you to weave climate change into the educational fabric of our learning experience to give us the right tools for the fight! Society has atomised us from one another, hampering our ability to create change. We need to start talking, have conversations with one another, engage with people about the climate crisis. We’re all going to be affected, some worse from others. We can learn from each others’ experiences and create a world that works for all, not just the privileged few. This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s a good place to start. To create a better, safer world, free from the devastation of climate change and ecological collapse, we need to reimagine the way our societies work. We need to challenge the status quo wherever we can and forge our own set of rules. There’s a whole world to create, so let’s not be bound by the stifling and disenfranchising politics of the current system. Support us to create our own. • UK Student Climate Network is a small group of volunteers who were inspired by the powerful and direct protests made by young people against climate inaction across the rest of Europe"
"There’s no mistake that the UK is living in uncertain times. We all anxiously await the fate of Brexit and how the changes will impact our economy, our industries, our friends. But there exists an even graver threat to our daily existence – we are on course to run short of water in 25 years. And it is our economic structures and big corporations that are to blame. The demands of population growth and the threat of climate change have had a significant impact on our water supply. But these effects are exacerbated by the greed of the water industry that has prioritised profit over the people. Public services like water should be nationalised. That’s what campaigners such as Cat Hobbs from We Own It and more than three-quarters of the British public have been saying for years. Privatisation has failed. Water is the most essential resource on our planet. Our bodies are comprised of 70% water. . Without it, no life on this planet can survive and therefore it must be protected as a basic human right.  Yet during a time when our most precious resource grows more scarce and household bills continue to rise as private firms monopolise the water industry in different parts of England and Wales, they continue to receive tax breaks and windfall profits. According to a study from the National Audit Office, water bills have increased at a rate of 40% above inflation since the industry was privatised in 1989. Since 2010, shareholder dividends have soared upwards of £13.5bn in payouts, almost the amount the companies raked in in pre-tax profits. While these companies continue to profit from their customers, they carelessly waste our water supply by refusing to plug 3bn litres of leaks across the country. Private firms monopolise the water industry in England and Wales. We simply turn on our tap and use water from whatever company operates in our area. That means companies have little incentive to make the service better. They’ve grown greedy and unsustainable as a result – choosing to line their shareholders’ pockets, instead of reducing bills for ordinary people. Water is a human right and should be accessible to all. That principle is under threat. This is precisely why we must advocate to bring the water supply back into public ownership. Campaigners against privatisation, We Own It, along with SumOfUs have between us gathered more than 69,000 signatures calling for the nationalisation of Britain’s water industry. By nationalising our water supply, we can turn the tide and prevent a devastating water shortage. Private water corporations running public contracts, like Carillion, have already proven they’re not fit to run our public services. The catastrophic collapse of the giant construction firm once again came at a high cost for tax-paying consumers resulting in £148m in estimated losses. Our water supply belongs to all of us. Having our water industry run by public servants who are elected and are accountable to voters means that we can reinvest money in technologies, maintenance and systems that will ensure our water supply’s viability – instead of giving huge payouts to shareholders. Nationalising the UK water industry is what works best for consumers and what will ensure the conservation of our water supply for the next 25 years – and beyond. • Sondhya Gupta is a UK-based campaign manager at SumOfUs, an organisation using people power to hold the biggest companies in the world to account"
"As Africa climate week unfurls in Ghana, the countries of Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe count the costs of Cyclone Idai, which ripped through villages and towns, taking hundreds of lives and leaving a trail of destruction. For a continent already racked by the effects of the climate crisis, Idai is another chilling reminder of the destructive power of the kind of storms that will become more common as the world warms up. The cyclone made landfall on 14 March, the same day that the One Planet Summit started in Nairobi, called by French president Emmanuel Macron. After picking up speed, with winds of 195km/h (120mph) accompanied by lashing rains, Idai caused flooding and landslides, ruining crops and roads, and has already affected millions of people. The city of Beira in Mozambique was hit the hardest, with nearly 80% of homes and public infrastructure destroyed. While the most vulnerable communities are facing the real impact of climate change on the ground, national leaders at the One Planet Summit kept their talk inside comfortable and acclimatised rooms. During the summit, Macron encouraged global collaboration towards ensuring sustainable preservation of forests, and President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya made a pledge to achieve at least 10% forest cover in the next three years. These commitments would be laughable if it were not so tragic. Africa needs to do a lot more than that to build climate resilience. Cyclone Idai is another powerful demonstration of this. While many countries appear to be already reducing carbon emissions and moving towards an energy transition, Africa’s coalfields are open for business. Along with a few Asian countries (Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh in particular), our continent continues to be an El Dorado for the coal cheerleaders and big business determined to carry on its coal-onisation. New plants are being planned from South Africa to Senegal, from Kenya to Mozambique, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Côte d’Ivoire. Most of them are co-financed by the African Development Bank, on whose board sit members of African, European, North and South American and Asian governments. This is the case for the coal-fired power plant projects in Bargny (in the suburbs of Dakar, Senegal), San-Pédro (Côte d’Ivoire), Lamu (Kenya), or the Thabametsi power station in Limpopo province, South Africa, near the border with Botswana. The situation is pretty similar for the oil industry, a source of energy that continues to attract investors in Africa, a continent that accounts for 8% of global production, with 7.5m barrels a day. Despite the drop in the price of oil over the last five years, new players are added yearly to the list of majors companies, such as Total, Shell, Exxon, BP and Eni. In Uganda, for example, a new field will be exploited, the fruit of the cooperation between Total, the Chinese company CNOOC, and the British company Tullow Oil. Perenco, a French-British company, has just set up in Gabon and DRC and plans to produce half a million barrels a day. In February 2019, Total announced the huge offshore discovery of gas-condensate and light oil in South Africa, which could contain 1bn barrels of total resources. Even though Africa is estimated to produce just 4% of global carbon emissions – compared to 80% by the most industrialised countries (G20), it is the continent that pays the highest price. For us, climate change is not a future risk, it’s already a reality evident in wrecked families, lands and livelihoods, and hopeless children and young people who have no choice but to seek a future by migrating. Everywhere on the continent, communities fear losing their land as each season hits one country after another with exceptional floods, unexpected storms and increasingly long droughts. Fauna and flora reserves have been running out, access to water has become a privilege, and extreme weather events have become more numerous and left families without homes or livelihoods. Some assume that increasing forest cover or granting new billions in funding to governments plagued by bad governance and corruption will prevent such disasters from happening and solve the issue of global warming. This is an insult to people facing untold suffering in every corner of the continent, while new coal and mining infrastructure and carbon commodification continue to be allowed. The proliferation of fossil-fuel projects is happening at the expense of people’s health, the climate and ecosystems. Yet the solutions to this crisis are also well known. They include ending coal extraction and mining, stopping the funding of new coal infrastructure – mines or power plants – and accelerating the investment in renewables. International cooperation and funding from industrialised economies are necessary to combat climate change. And such efforts should start by not promoting or funding any fossil fuel projects anywhere in the world. But before money, energy transition is a matter of vision and leadership. African countries have to step up efforts against environmental degradation and greenhouse gas emissions, for instance, by decentralising energy supply systems, and by promoting tax policies that favour solar and wind energy investments. African governments must do a better job of protecting their people, but fossil fuel companies must also be held accountable for the impact that decades of unregulated exploitation of coal, oil and gas have had on the continent, including before courts. Tired of vain promises and empty slogans, students and pupils around the world, including in South Africa, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda, organised a series of rallies and events last week asking their governments to take, without delay, the decisions needed to contain climate destabilisation. This organic mobilisation is likely to continue and grow until real action is taken. While regional leaders and development partners are gathered in Accra for the 2019 Africa climate week, they should refrain from promoting more false solutions or making empty promises while thousands of innocent citizens are perishing. Ending the extraction and use of coal and other fossil fuels in Africa is a decision that cannot be delayed any longer. The brutality of Cyclone Idai is another stark reminder that millions of lives depend on it. • Landry Ninteretse is the Africa lead for 350.org, which campaigns on climate change"
"It wasn’t long ago that Theresa May stated boldly that she wanted “the Britain of the future to be a truly global Britain, which is a force for good in the world. Steadfast in upholding our values – not least our fierce commitment to protecting the natural environment”. Not everyone was fooled – least of all the thousands of young people striking from school today to call on world leaders to finally take the climate crisis seriously.  The UK government likes to be seen as a climate leader. But while it continues to make some slow progress in decarbonising its economy at home, companies continue to take advantage of the UK’s “light-touch” corporate regulation to commit climate atrocities abroad. The current generation of schoolchildren have a much more global perspective than any before. Social media and the internet have made the world feel much smaller, and well-informed young people are quick to challenge governments over activities built on global injustices, past and present. That’s why stories like DeSmog’s Empire Oil investigation resonate with so many of those taking to the streets today. The six-month investigation by DeSmog reporter Chloé Farand showed how a group of companies listed on London’s junior stock exchange – the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) – were taking advantage of the UK’s lackadaisical regulation to exploit fossil fuel resources across Africa. Her stories showed that beneath London’s green veneer lies some dirty business. AIM was set up to make it easy for companies to raise capital, with much lighter oversight than they would experience on the larger London Stock Exchange. Some household names have grown extremely fast thanks to this model – fashion retailers Asos and Boohoo, and posh tonic water company Fever-Tree, for example. There is no suggestion that those companies have done anything wrong, and they are regularly held up as shining examples of how a lack of government interference can stimulate innovation. But there is a darker side to this system. AIM’s approach to regulation has also allowed dozens of small oil and gas companies to raise capital with the aim of exploiting Africa’s natural resources – all with minimal oversight. Many of these companies are registered in tax havens. And the organisations tasked with overseeing the activities of AIM-listed companies – known as nominated advisers or Nomads – are allowed to have a financial stake in the companies they are meant to regulate. All of this leads to flawed oversight and a web of conflicts of interest. In the background of all this is a neocolonialist agenda that this new generation of social activists are quick to recognise. They understand that there is something unjust about western companies based in Mayfair offices prospecting for oil and gas in countries that until recently would have been described as “colonies”. And they are quick to highlight the government’s hypocrisy in calling for global action on climate change while tacitly encouraging activities that will lock developing nations into high-carbon industries for decades. The school strikers, unlike many of the adults they feel have let them down, are not scared to point out this injustice. “How is it,” the strikers ask, “that the UK can claim to be a climate leader when it continues to encourage a system that allows companies to explore for fossil fuels in some of the world’s most politically unstable regions with minimal oversight?” In 2019, that seems a legitimate question. The UK government’s resistance to walking the walk on climate action goes beyond encouraging private companies to get out there and drill, however. Its own agencies are also complicit. Perhaps the best example of this is UK Export Finance (UKEF), a government credit agency that works to secure Britain’s economic interests abroad. In the past four years, UKEF has put up financial support for a massive new oil refinery in Oman, invested millions in offshore oil and gas development in Ghana and Brazil, and provided credit for coal-mining equipment in Russia, to name but a few projects. A joint investigation between Greenpeace and Private Eye calculated that UKEF had provided fossil fuel companies with £6.9bn in financial support between 2000 and 2017. MPs have finally cottoned on to this conflict between the government’s positive words and less-than-stellar international action. Parliament launched an enquiry into UKEF in December 2018. UKEF’s actions certainly seem a long way from what David Cameron was promising on the podium in Paris, days before hundreds of world leaders signed a landmark climate change agreement in December 2015, when he declared: “Instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.” Well, those children have now marched out of school to make it clear that the all-too-familiar excuses for inaction will be accepted no more – today, tomorrow, or at any time in their future. • Mat Hope is editor of investigative journalism platform DeSmog UK"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe all know how do-gooder governments all over Europe and USA like to spend billions of dollars on every conceivable save-the-forests program worldwide.Well, it turns out they’re also spending billions on subsidising “green” wood-based bio-energy, which in fact is having the opposite effect, and thus contributing to the accelerated mass-destruction of forests worldwide. In the kooky world called “Green”, things always seem to work as follows:
1. Conjure up a fictitious future catastrophic problem, like AGW.
2. Demand governments enact programs designed to avert the catastrophe.
3. Watch these programs inflict real, massive environmental, social and economic damage right now.
Here’s yet another perfect glittering example from the world of Green.  The Global Forest Coalition has released a damning report WOOD-BASED BIOENERGY: THE GREEN LIE, which shines much light on Europe’s latest green mega-folly.
Journalist Stephen Leahy reports on it here: Europe’s Green Energy Portfolio Up in Smoke.
Here are some excerpts:
* In Europe’s vaunted green energy revolution 68.5% of its renewable energy portfolio comes from biofuels and burning wood for energy,
*27 million tonnes of wood biomass will be needed annually to supply planned power stations in the UK (United Kingdom).
* At least one million hectares of forest annually will be needed to feed the dozens of planned wood-fired power plants in Britain alone.
* The Netherlands is burning one million tonnes of wood annually. Germany is burning up to 16.5 million tonnes – mostly imported – and plans to double this figure by 2020.
*Deforestation eats up 13 to 16 million hectares every year and is responsible for 20 percent of the global warming emissions.
Deforestation is already a big problem globally without the biofuels boom. Promoting the use of wood material for biofuel will only accelerate deforestation.

According to Anne Petermann, executive director of the Global Justice Ecology Project:
We have an enormous deforestation problem already, there is no way massive increases in wood to feed bioenergy furnaces could ever be sustainable.
Leahy writes that particulate emissions from wood-burning are worse than coal, putting public health at risk. Biomass burning emits more fine particulates than coal. These invisible particles can damage lungs and make asthma worse.
Then there is all the energy and emissions involved in cutting, processing and shipping wood many thousands of kilometres from Africa, South America and Canada.

Not only are wood-based biofuels ecologically disastrous, but they are also economically unwise:
Subsidies in Britain will cost taxpayers about three billion dollars a year for the biomass power plants now under construction or planned, reports Robert Palgrave of Biofuelwatch.
Journal Science has bioenergy lands covering half of the planet’s arable lands by 2065.
Helena Paul sums it up:
The potential for disaster is absolutely enormous if this takes off in Europe and America.
Someone ought to remind Ms Paul what led to these disastrous policies in the first place. One may suggest that it was the green movement’s overzealous drive to save the planet from a highly exaggerated manmade climate change claim, all fueled and fanned by the media and kook green groups.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his wissenslogs blog, sister blog of Real Climate, Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has a post attempting to find an explanation for Europe’s heavy snowfalls and cold from last month.
Part of Rahmstorf’s problem is his habit of not asking to the right questions, which is a prerequisite for getting the right answers. Or maybe it’s more him purposely asking the wrong questions to avoid getting the right answers.
He reminds me of a fly bouncing off a window. Instead of asking “How do I get through the glass?”, the fly ought to ask: “How do I get on the other side?” Flying away and out through an open door certainly works a lot better than repeatedly ramming into the glass until dropping dead.
In his post he describes the snow and cold of December and poses the question: 
Is it because of global warming, or does it have nothing to do with it?”
First he says straight out that the cold December is by no means an indication that global warming has ended or that it is taking a break, citing 2010’s high global temperature from GISS. He then asks:
In the globally warmest year since measurements began in the 19th century, we have [in Potsdam] the most amount of snow since measurements began in the 19th century. Meanwhile the Arctic sea ice cover this December is at a record low. Do these records have anything to do with each other, or is it just a coincidence?“
The fly bouncing off the window now comes to mind, and expect the bouncing to continue. He then presents the following graphic:

It shows Potsdam maximum snow depth with a 15 year-smoothing. Note the outlier high of 41 cm recorded last month. From this graph he concludes:
The year-to-year fluctuations are very large, and show no noticeable trend.
Especially over the last 40 years, during a time the global temperature rose significantly, there is no trend in the December snow depths.”
And then asserts:
These are hefty indicators that there is no relation between this year’s snow record and global warming and that it is only a coincidence.”
(That applies for snow in Europe.) Now at least he’s headed in the right direction. So what’s the cause? Rahmstorf probes further, and glances at solar activity and quickly dismisses it, saying:


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





Just eyeballing the the graphic, it is obvious this is not a factor of influence  – an 11 year cycle cannot be detected.”
Rahmstorf aversion to the sun is obvious, and he really has a way of selecting graphics. With that scale one can hardly discern 100 years, let alone 11. That’s the graphic he linked to: Schwabezyklus.
He then adds that it can’t be the sun because the Lockwood und Fröhlich (2010) correlation of winter temps in Europe and solar activity is too weak (correlation coefficient 0.23). 
And not only that, the record warm winter of 2006/2007 came at a time when solar activity was near a low. And the currently weak sun is similar to a stituation before 1925, at a time when there were hardly any cold winters in Germany. So it can’t be the sun, he resons. Here we see that Rahmstorf has gone back to bouncing off the window.
So what could it be, he asks?
Rahmstorf suggests that it has to be “a very non-linear mechanism” causing the unusual snow and cold, like the one suggested by Petoukhov and Semenov (2010), i.e. a connection between ice cover in the Barents-Kara-Sea and the European winter weather.
Rahmstorf does point out that one has to be cautious here because Petoukhov and Semenov is the result of model calculations with one single climate model. Rahmstorf adds:
Indeed before I would consider such a mechanism as robust, it needs to be confirmed by other independent models and ( or observation.
Indeed Petoukhov and Semenov did not make any projection for any winter in particular, rather they presented the idea of winters associated with cold Arctic air could occur more frequently. If that turns out to be the case, it cannot be seen with two or three winters, rather we have to wait for a significantly greater number of winters.”
Not long ago, a number of PIK scientists embarked on a media blitz selling it all as everything but fact in the German media. The past can be also checked out to see if there is any correlation.
Rahmstorf sums it up:
Its quite possible that this month’s extreme snowfall is just a coincidence of the weather. But on the other hand there are indications that the boundary conditions in the Arctic have changed due to the ice melt over the years that could significantly change the weather statistic in Europe. Whether this December remains an outlier or whether more of this will occur in the future cannot be said. It’s an open research question.”
I think it should be a simple matter showing the lack of robustness of the Barents-Kara-Sea / European winter weather correlation. After that we will be able to say it’s time for the warmists to stop bouncing of the window.
Time to look for that open door.

"In 1980, at the age of 15, I led a student protest that got me expelled. Every day that I went to Durban city centre, I could see that the schools for white children were different to mine. Even though adults told us that we could not make a difference, once our eyes were opened to this injustice, there was no alternative. My friends and I were determined to make a stand against the glaring inequality in South Africa. Those who lived under apartheid know exactly what it means to live with an inherent threat to your existence. But rather than give in to the fear that it was too big to take on, we had no choice but to trust in the power of our individual actions. There are many lessons here for the climate change movement.  I was devastated to have been expelled from my school, but it did not stop me from demanding change. I knew I was not alone. Schools across South Africa became a powerful site for struggle after a student protest in Soweto in 1976 ended with extreme police brutality. Young people, who for all their lives had been told they were not equal and had no power, organised major protests and boycotts at their schools, which garnered national and international attention. Throughout history, our societies have owed a debt to young people who have recognised that sometimes you need to break the rules to create space for change. It was the strategy of civil disobedience, led by young people, that set South Africa on the path to ending apartheid. The “defiance campaign” of 1952 represents the best of this: 8,000 black South Africans – led by the likes of a young Nelson Mandela – deliberately broke discriminatory laws to court arrest. Their aim was to fill the jails to overflowing. While the authorities eventually crushed the campaign, it raised the visibility of this important justice movement and galvanised mass support. Just like South Africa’s youth leaders did decades ago, I believe young people striking for climate action today are building exactly the kind of mass movement needed to pressure leaders into acting. There have been multiple misguided attempts by politicians to patronise, belittle or discredit the teenagers leading these strikes. But for all their attempts at deflection, nothing can hide the fact that our leaders are failing to stop climate change. In fact they continue to spread lies, fund the fossil fuel industry and wrongfully claim that it will be too expensive to act. Meanwhile, we have fully entered the climate crisis and left behind a stable environment that enabled humanity to thrive. The kind of warming we see today, where wildfires, heatwaves, floods, droughts and storms are getting worse and worse, is only the beginning. If you feel immobilised by fear at the thought of this, imagine how it must feel for a child. And yet, as throughout history, young people have shown us that it is possible to overcome our fears by standing up for our rights. In August 2018, fires raged in forests of the Arctic Circle in Sweden, and Greta Thunberg decided to start her strike outside the Swedish parliament. These school strikes for climate have snowballed and on Friday more than 1,300 strikes are expected in nearly 100 countries around the world. We should be hanging our heads in shame that it has fallen on young people and children to miss school and take on the overwhelming burden of fighting this threat to human survival. But we have no time for that. We now have 11 years to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and work towards bringing them down to net zero by 2050 to give us a chance for survival. This is not an invitation to procrastinate, but an impetus to act. If our leaders and indeed other adults are still clueless as to what they can do, my one piece of advice is: act like the kids. • Kumi Naidoo is the Secretary General of Amnesty International. He was formerly executive director of Greenpeace and the launch director of Africans Rising"
"More than 1.4 million young people around the world took part in school strikes for climate action, according to environmental campaigners. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish student whose solo protest last August prompted the global movement, said: “We proved that it does matter what you do and that no one is too small to make a difference.” Children walked out of schools on Friday in 2,233 cities and towns in 128 countries, with demonstrations held from Australia to India, the UK and the US, according to the Fridays for the Future website. Further strikes are planned for 12 April. Eyal Weintraub, an 18-year-old from Argentina who took part in the protests, said: “We have reached a point in history when we have the technical capacities to solve poverty, malnutrition, inequality and of course global warming. “The deciding factors for whether we take advantage of our potential will be our activism and our international unity.” The strikes inspired by Thunberg drew widespread praise, with UN Women saying on Twitter: “She is proof that we need to listen to the young generation for a sustainable future.” The executive director of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, said: “Our children are walking out of school saying we have failed them. This is the kind of clarity and energy we need now.” However, education ministers in the UK and Australia condemned the strikes and some commentators were critical. Madeline Grant, formerly of the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, asked: “Just how kind is it to shower praise on children who are fundamentally wrong?” Thunberg posted a response on Facebook to “people who wants us to go back to school”. “The favourite argument here in Sweden, and everywhere else, is that it doesn’t matter what we do because we are all too small to make a difference. [But] Friday was the biggest day of global climate action ever, according to 350.org,” she said. “People keep asking me ‘What is the solution to the climate crisis?’. They expect me to know the answer. That is beyond absurd, as there are no ‘solutions’ within our current systems. “We need a whole new way of thinking. The political system that you [adults] have created is all about competition. You cheat when you can because all that matters is to win. That must come to an end. “We need to start cooperating and sharing the remaining resources of this planet in a fair way. We are just passing on the words of the science. Our only demand is that you start listening to it, and then start acting.” • This article was amended on 20 March 2019. An earlier version referred to the next planned strike date as 15 April. The correct date is Friday 12 April."

We’ve been seeing similar headlines in the UK and throughout all of Scandinavia. Global warming has met its Stalingrad.
Meanwhile, the Climate Generals are sipping champagne and eating caviar in sunny Cancun, see here.
Stern magazine reports here “Deep Freeze Weather To Remain Until March”:
And its going to continue: Today most of Germany will get 20 cm of  new snow on top of what there is now. Also in the days ahead it’s going to remain cold.”
H/t: NoTricksZone reader Bernd Felsche
Right now with the bitter cold bearing down on Europe, the German media are scrambling like piglets on an ice rink.  Indeed the news of global warming coming out of Cancun are coming across as a bizarre joke. Everywhere in the media we hear something like: “Duh duh duh…it’s…er, man-made climate change induced weather extremes, or something! We can’t explain it! But hold on – wait – it’s now in our models! Yup, there it is! Just the latest sign of global warming.”

Stern Magazine: “Cold of the century”
Stern asks the German Weather Service (DWD): How long is this warming cold going to last?
For the DWD it’s sure: ‘It’s going to remain cold.’ Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday daytime highs will hover around -10″C. Temperatures at night could plummet to -25 °C. Germany will be colder than Scandinavia, Canada and Siberia. ‘We are expecting winds of up to 60 km/hr on Wednesday and Thursday. That means the windchill will be minus 30 to minus 40°C,’ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of Wetterdienst wetter.net in Wiesbaden. ‘Whoever does not dress properly, risks freezing to death.'”
Well, I don’t know about Siberia. But man it’s cold out there with that wind. Reminds me of winters in Vermont. Stern magazine warns:
Anyone hoping for just for a couple of cold winter days is out in left field. Jung says these frosty days are only a taste of what’s coming. ‘It’ll be especially cold,’ says Jung, ‘in the Northeast temperatures will fall below levels we saw last year.'”
So much for the rare but exciting snowy winters Jones told us about awhile back. Meteorologist Jung’s projection for the rest if the winter remains icy. “It will be similar to last year’s cold winter. Don’t expect temperatures to warm up much until late March.”

"The Morrison government, which is battling a persistent internal fracture on energy policy, is attempting to foment divisions between Labor and the union movement over the opposition’s 45% emissions reduction target in the run up to the election. The energy minister Angus Taylor, has written to trade union leaders claiming the 45% economy-wide emissions reduction target will lead to wages being cut by $9,000.  The source for Taylor’s claim is a summary of as yet unreleased modelling by BAEconomics about the impact of the 45% target, which was handed to The Australian newspaper in late February. The summary of the unreleased modelling says the government’s target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030 will reduce average real annual income for a full-time worker by around $2,000. Under the high target, the summary points to a projected fall in real annual wages of “around $9,000 per year by 2030”. In the new form letters to union officials, Taylor advises them to to seek “urgent clarification” from Bill Shorten about the impact of a 45% target on the wages outcomes of their members. Taylor says the Labor leader has elected to make the coming federal election a “referendum on wages”, but the opposition’s climate policies will have an negative impact on earnings. “Every Australian worker deserves to know how Labor is going to reach their economy wrecking targets,” the energy minister said. While the government has grabbed the as yet unreleased modelling as a tool to try to increase political pressure on Labor over its policy offering, climate policy experts have already questioned whether the modelling also takes into account the costs of climate change, which a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank highlighted starkly in a speech this week when he warned climate change poses risks to financial stability. Erwin Jackson, the director of policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change, has also pointed out that previous modelling indicates that the economy continues to grow even with ambitious pollution targets, just at a slightly slower rate. The summary from BAEconomics suggests the economy will continue growing under a 45% target at around 2.3% per year over the decade to 2030 compared to a rate of 2.9%. While there has been no sign union leaders are troubled by a 45% target, there have been public tensions between Labor and the union movement over the party’s position on the Adani coal mine. Labor will come under increasing scrutiny as it prepares to release the remainder of its climate change policies, which are expected in the coming weeks. Labor has already released its policy on the energy sector. The opposition is expected in the coming weeks to confirm specific measures to reduce pollution in heavy industry, transport and agriculture, and to outline whether it intends to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto period to meet the Paris 2030 target, and whether it will use permits to help with the abatement task. The government’s attempts to apply political pressure to Labor comes as divisions continue within the Coalition about whether the government should sign up to taxpayer underwriting of new coal plants. The backdrop to the running battle is escalating voter concern about the impact of climate change, which is clear in major party polling. School students are expected to strike on Friday to draw attention to the climate issue. The issue has blown up spectacularly in government ranks over the past week, with Nationals brawling with Liberals and among themselves about what projects should be supported by the government underwriting program. Taylor has confirmed the Morrison government is continuing to assess new coal-generation projects despite strong pushback from moderate Liberals, but he says taxpayers will only support projects that are “viable”. Nationals want the government to produce a shortlist of projects before the election, but many Liberals are completely opposed to the government nominating taxpayer support for a new coal project before the coming election, fearing it will cost them electoral support. On Thursday, the government’s most senior conservative, Peter Dutton, joined Liberal colleagues in arguing the Morrison government should not be in the business of building coal-fired power stations, and he put a question mark over whether taxpayers should support upgrades to existing plants. Dutton said the government was not opposed to providing support to coal projects, but he was opposed to building them, because money to build that infrastructure would take away opportunities to build new roads and tunnels. “We’ve got taxpayers’ money to spend, the question is whether the federal government should be building a coal-fired power station. I don’t agree with that. I don’t think we should be,” Dutton said. While saying the government was not opposed to assisting coal, Dutton also indicated he wasn’t in favour of assisting projects with upgrades. “You’ve got power stations now that will be asking for taxpayers’ money, to upgrade. “The question is whether people want to pay more taxes or whether you are going to use taxpayer money, instead of building that new road or that tunnel.” The Greens on Friday will also release a new policy to promote the uptake of batteries for storage. The party will propose household battery storage incentives of up to $7,000 per battery tapering down annually to July 1, 2023."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew IPCC report discovers the important climate factor…and ignores it!
By D. E. Koelle
According to its own statutes, the IPCC is mainly responsible for anthropogenic climate change – and much less so for natural climate change, which has been around since the Earth first appeared. That could very well be the reason why the sun gets mentioned only with respect to its solar irradiance intensity at the edge of the atmosphere. There the irradiance is 1361 W/sqm and is relatively constant, and so the role of the sun on mid-term climate change is not taken into account.
However, for the first time in the history of the IPCC reports, the 2013 AR5 report discusses the Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) as a decisively important factor (chapter 2.3.3.). Decisive for the climate and temperature changes is not the solar irradiance at the edge of the atmosphere, rather it is the amount of solar energy that makes it to the Earth’s surface.
Between the Earth’s surface and the outer edge of the atmosphere we have the atmosphere with its clouds and aerosols, which determine how much solar radiation eventually reaches the surface of the Earth. Since 1983 the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program (ISCCP) has been measuring global cloud coverage. One spectacular result was the decrease in global cloud cover between 1987 – 2000, from 69% to 64%, i.e. precisely during the period of warming that triggered the CO2 hypothesis.

Figure 1: Mid-term variation of mean global cloud coverage according to data from the ISCCP for the period 1983 to 2010.
Of course this finding did not fit well with the current popular narrative and was immediately criticized and doubted. This prevented it being adopted by the IPCC report of 2007. Indeed cloud observation and the evaluation of the data from satellites are difficult and the results are subject to interpretation. But in the meantime we have recognized that there is an objective method of determining the effects of clouds and the impact of solar dimming: by measuring the effective solar radiation at the surface of the Earth. For the first time this is discussed in the new IPCC report in Chapter 2.3.3 and is confirmed by the longest existing dataset from Stockholm. It shows a clear fluctuation of solar energy between 90 and 135 W/sqm. And the range is considerably greater at lower latitudes.

Figure 2:  Effective solar insolation at the Earth’s surface for Stockholm 1922-2010 (59° north latitude).

The data from Stockholm not only correspond to the ISCCP-results, but also to the global temperature trends. Not only do the rise of global temperature and SSR correspond between 1910 and 1940, but also for the temperature drop between 1944 and 1980, and the rise until 2000. Figure 3 shows a comparison of 10 temperature curves from 10 global weather stations, without the statistical manipulations of a so-called “global mean temperature”.

Figure 3: Real temperature measurement values from cities on the globe.
The SSR curve correlates excellently with the original GISS dataset for the US temperature history yin 1999, before it was tampered with.

Figure 4: The original GISS temperature history for the USA as it looked in 1999. It was then replaced by a new curve which moved the maximum value to the year 1998.
Even if the important SSR factor gets mentioned for the first time in an IPCC report, this does not mean it was taken into account in other chapters of the report, and especially for the temperature development – to the contrary – it was ignored. Only the CO2 hypothesis is valid. Here the entire 0.8°C temperature rise of the last 100 years, for which part or all of it gets attributed to CO2,  can be explained by the impacts of the effective solar radiation at the Earth’s surface without any CO2 effects.
Already the temperature rise of 0.6°C between 1910 and 1940 cannot be explained by the CO2 effect because the CO2 concentration increased by less than 10 ppm during the period (from 298 to 307 ppm). Then from 1940 to 1975 the temperature fell 0.2°C – and certainly not because of a CO2 drop. The renewed temperature increase of 0.6°C from 1980 to 1998 was the initiator of the CO2 hypothesis. However, the temperature increase can be better explained by the increase in SSR intensity. The fact that the predicted continued temperature increase never materialized, and that there’s been a slight drop since 2000, completely contradicts the CO2 hypothesis.

A couple of loose ends to tie up as I prepare for the Berlin Conference.
First, bitter cold and snowfall have dominated the German headlines. This kind of thing was not supposed to happen – that is until about 2 weeks ago when scientists at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research suddenly changed their minds after one of their models showed European winters would be getting cold instead (because of global warming).
So let’s look back at what the PIK said just a year ago in FOCUS magazine in a report called: “Germany Will Be Sweating“, in December, 2009, just before Copenhagen:
Less snow, dry-hot summers and mild-wet winters. Scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research show us the most important climate trends for Germany. By the middle of the century the temperature increase and the resulting evaporation in some regions could lead to water shortages.
In the Alps, winters with snow cover will be shortened.
In the western areas, there will be less and less snow cover.

Then the PIK-effect kicked in. Just 10 days after the FOCUS report had come out, i.e. during the Copenhagen conference, the worst winter in over 40 years began to besiege Germany. (H/T to a reader comment here at Readers Edition).
And here’s another one from Bild tabloid, dated 27 November 2006 titled: Winter is Becoming Extinct:

Professor Mojib Latif (52), climate scientist at the University of Kiel: ‘In a hundred years we’ll practically have no more winters.

And the warming is going to accelerate! Scientists have calculated that the average temperature in the next 100 years will increase by up to 4°C. In 20 years it will be possible to go swimming in the Baltic Sea in October and to grow peaches in Hamburg.


H/t: ef-magazin.de.
And this is what we’re getting.
Finally, WUWT brings up a new peer-reviewed paper by Ryan O’Donnell, Nicholas Lewis, Jeff Condon, and Steve McIntyre that shows claims of a warming Antarctic in a peer-reviewed paper by Steig et al were bogus.
Interesting are Anthony’s comments on how reluctant the peer reviewers appear to have been when this sceptical paper landed on their desk. If it had been a paper showing accelerated warming, melting etc., then publication would have been a lot simpler. The peer review probably would have taken only 10 minutes over a cup of coffee. “And don’t worry, we’ll even write up the press releases for you and get this published right before the next conference.”
Anyway, while I’m in Berlin, I’ll post from time to time to provide an impression of how things are going. Hope you drop by.

"For all the skittishness of Australian politics through the years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments there’s been one factor that has been remarkably consistent. Amid leadership coups, cultural offensives and the revolving door of energy policy acronyms, the Australian public has remained steadfast in its belief that more needs to be done to address climate change. Whether the focus has been an ETS, an ERF, a CET or a Neg or just a big stick, the majority of the voting public has not moved from its view that meaningful action is required by government. After the craziness of another fortnight of Coalition energy policy where our fossil-fondling PM has whipped up some new renewable buzzwords while his National party partners are baying for taxpayers to fund new coal projects, it’s worth reminding ourselves of this baseline. Because it explains so much of why this government’s condition has reached terminal status. For the past decade the Essential poll has asked two benchmark questions when it comes to climate change. The first is around whether people believe the climate science. Over the past decade this split has been stable. Granted, it dipped into the high 50s at the height of Tony Abbott’s attack on the Gillard government’s so-called carbon tax, but that was after Labor had spent the best part of a term faffing around on the issue. What’s most striking in these numbers is the disconnection between the climate sceptics within the government and Coalition voters. Indeed, on the science they are much more aligned with One Nation and conservative independent voters who make up the “other” cohort of voters. As for younger voters, the Coalition comes across every bit as much a fossil as the fuel they seek to dig up. The second question we have regularly asked is whether people believe Australia is doing enough to address climate change. Again, a majority – including one-third of Liberal voters – say they are not. All of which makes Barnaby Joyce’s entreaty for an election fought on coal appear delusional, as some of the more tethered members of the government have felt compelled to point out in recent days. These words of moderation come too late. Joyce’s indulgence will only provide further impetus to the swathe of moderate independents challenging the Liberal heartland in more affluent areas of Sydney and Melbourne where Sky after dark does not rate. Meanwhile, as the Coalition’s self-inflicted wounds fester, Labor simply holds its line with a commitment to 50% renewables by 2030 and aggressively promotes battery storage. Yes, there are calls for a more rapid phaseout of coal from the left, but all the pressure on policy is currently on the Coalition. As a separate table in this week’s report shows, one of Labor’s core brand advantages over the Coalition, alongside wages and workplace conditions, is climate change. While Scott Morrison will blow his foghorn on taxes and boats, it is the climate change policy failure that leaves his government condemned in the eyes of so many of its own. Perhaps it’s the ultimate revenge on a government that came to power through a cynical attempt to deny the need for climate action. As the summers have got warmer and warmer, the public’s anger at the inaction has got hotter. The failure of this government has not just been the toppling of its leaders. It’s been the reason for the topplings, which has been more than the blind pursuit of power, but power in the name of energy. And even in its dying days, key members of the government continue in this state of denial. Not just of the science, nor the need for meaningful action, but denial that this is the sort of leadership elected governments are expected to exhibit. The reckoning is coming and it will be harsh. And it can’t come soon enough. • Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now, like the east coast of the USA, Germany is in the middle of a heat wave. Indeed the eastern parts of Germany and Poland are expected to stay hot with temperatures over 35°C (95°F) without an end in sight. Luckily I’m living in the northwest part of Germany, and here temps are expected to moderate somewhat by early next week.
Let me remind you that Joe Bastardi forecast a hot summer for Central Europe – and he’s right again. He had also forecast a cold winter 2009/10, and he hit that right on too. Who needs the Met!
Well it’s official. The first 6 months of 2010 in Germany were the coldest in 14 years, this is reported by the Readers Edition here.
The measurements go back to 1761. The first 6 months of this year (January through June) recorded an average temperature of 5.9 °C , the coldest since 1996. This value was almost 0.5°C below the longterm average of the reference value from 1961-1990 (6.4 °C).
So how does the rest of the year look for Germany and Europe as a a whole? The Readers Edition posted this graphic from the warmist NOAA. Looks like a hot July, but then cooling off.

Of course the German mainstream media hardly mentioned the cool first half year. They’re too busy complaining about the current hot weather, which most Germans rarely get and are now enjoying. And you can be sure that when August rolls around, the media will be trumpeting the “unusually hot July” as yet another sign of global warming.

"The Greens will use the resumption of parliament for the looming budget session to try to extract documents associated with the Morrison government’s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto period to meet the Paris 2030 target. The move by the Greens to extract documents relevant to the decision is an effort to keep the spotlight both on the Coalition’s decision to count a 367-megatonne contribution from carry-over credits, and also on Labor, with the opposition yet to take a decision on whether it will follow suit. Carry-over credits are an accounting system that allows countries to count credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said it was important to chase documents because the public deserved to know “whose idea it was to use dodgy credits instead of actually cutting pollution” – and he noted other countries had declined to use carry-overs for Paris. Bandt said he was concerned Labor was leaving its options open, but argued it was possible the ALP was leaving its options option because it could be forced to rely on credits and permits to meet its target of a 45% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. The Greens say Labor’s decision to apply their economy-wide target of 45% to the electricity sector, instead of forcing steeper abatement in electricity, where it is comparatively cheaper to cut pollution, meant it would have to chase more expensive abatement in sectors like heavy industry, transport, agriculture and waste. Bandt contends Labor may not be able to meet its target “without relying on Scott Morrison’s accounting trick”. “If you stick with low targets in electricity, where it is much cheaper and easier to reach zero pollution, you just shift the burden onto other sectors like agriculture,” he said. The government confirmed it would bank the 367-megatonne contribution from carry-overs as part of a recent pivot on climate change policy. Morrison released a carbon budget detailing the emissions reductions from various programs that will be required to meet the Paris target. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has said his “bias is to steer clear of cop-outs and accounting tricks”, but Labor wants to consult with stakeholders before resolving whether carry-overs are in or out under its climate policy. Labor has already unveiled some of its climate change initiatives for the coming federal election, but there is more policy to come, including a likely trading scheme for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year – and also vehicle emissions standards to bring down pollution in transport. It is unclear whether Labor will release a carbon budget as the government has done, quantifying abatement in specific sectors. The Investor Group on Climate Change, a group that represents institutional investors such as super funds, with total funds under management of about $2tn, over the weekend warned against using carry-over credits as part of the emissions reduction toolkit for Paris. “The use of carryover to weaken Australia’s emissions commitments is also fundamentally at odds with limiting warming in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement and driving global momentum for coordinated, and increased ambition,” the IGCC said. “This could threaten to spread a low ambition contagion in the international system by further encouraging other countries like Russia to use carryover to delay emissions reductions.” The group pointed out if Labor ultimately uses the same accounting as the government, factoring in the 367-megatonne contribution in its carbon budget, it’s 45% emissions reduction target would become a 35% target. Emissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors. The trend of rising emissions has been in evidence since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price Labor legislated during the 43rd parliament."
"Long-haul flights, tons of guns and a bagpipe flamethrower: such are the special demands of his career that James Bond has never been considered a poster boy for an eco-friendly lifestyle. But next year’s 25th Bond film looks set to have Ian Fleming’s hero make his first concession to climate change, by driving an electric Aston Martin – albeit one which retails at £250,000. According to reports, the film – whose working title of Shatterhand was recently debunked – will see Daniel Craig’s 007 behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Rapide E, one of only 155 electric cars being built by the British manufacturer.  The Sun reports that director Cary Joji Fukunaga has spearheaded the change, with their source describing him as “a total tree-hugger”. “This is something Cary pushed for and Daniel and the producers are going along with. Everybody is afraid of Bond getting labelled ‘too PC’ but they all felt the time was right to put him in a zero-emission vehicle.” Aston Martin’s relationship with the spy franchise began in 1964, when Sean Connery drove a DB5 sports car in Goldfinger.  Shooting on the new film is expected to start in April, after a series of delays involving the replacement of Danny Boyle as director following reported “creative differences” between he and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson. No more has officially been revealed as to the nature of such differences, but many suggested Boyle and his long-standing co-writer, John Hodge, were eager to bring Bond up to date with a plot including nods to the #MeToo movement – and, potentially, 007’s own death. More recently, last-minute script alterations pushed the release date back a further three months, to April 2020. Rami Malek – who won an Oscar last month for his performance as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody – is reported to be in final negotiations to take on the role of the chief villain. The Guardian has contacted distributors Universal for comment."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGet ready for some short-term cooling in the months ahead. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has released its latest ENSO report.
The BOM says sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific have continued to cool, and so the tropical Pacific is now generally cooler than average.
Below the surface, temperatures also remain significantly cooler than average, with some areas more than 4°C cooler than normal. Trade winds in the western Pacific remain stronger than normal and cloudiness near the date-line continues to be suppressed.
The BOM adds:
These indicators, together with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which has been positive since April, are consistent with the developing stages of a La Niña event.




Climate models also predict further tropical Pacific cooling during the coming months. Most models predict cooling beyond La Niña thresholds before the end of the southern winter.


 


So with the high global temperatures we’ve seen over the last few months fizzing out, it’s the last chance for the warmists to get a few last words in for a while. Now the question remains: How strong will the La Nina get?

"The disaster to hit Mozambique is reported as one of the worst tropical cyclones to visit the southern hemisphere, with hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands more needing urgent assistance. I note the Guardian was the only major newspaper to lead with this story on Wednesday (Race to find survivors after deadly cyclone, 20 March). People suffering in Mozambique and neighbouring countries didn’t create the climate crisis, but they are dying from more intense weather events like Cyclone Idai.  In the immediate instance, the people of central Mozambique need emergency relief. But what will help them, and large numbers of people across the planet, in the longer term is for rich countries to stop funding fossil-fuel extraction. It is this activity that contributes to a warming planet, increasing the likelihood and intensity of these extreme weather events. Climate scientists are clear: storms, cyclones and floods will worsen as the planet warms. Do we sit by inertly, safe in the knowledge that cyclones don’t yet cause deaths in Britain? Something can be done to make disasters of this scale less likely. The question is: will political leaders do it? In the UK this means stopping fracking, ending coal, not expanding Heathrow: these are the activities that worsen the climate crisis now affecting Mozambique. We need to join these up, and act.Craig BennettCEO, Friends of the Earth • Weather is how most of us experience climate change, and Bill Giles’s proposal to integrate global warming into UK weathercasts would offer a compelling way for people to connect the dots (Weather reports need climate change slots, says TV veteran, 19 March). A successful model for that essential undertaking already exists. Across the US, hundreds of TV weathercasters discuss climate change in their weather segments – in accessible, locally relevant terms. That’s thanks to Climate Central’s Climate Matters initiative, a project launched in 2012 in collaboration with researchers across the country that delivers climate-related media packages to US weather reporters – typically pegged to current news hooks, with data customised to each city. Polling shows that viewers trust their weathercasters to tell them the truth. Climate Matters’ rapid expansion has shown that weathercasters are eager to deliver it, helping to end the “TV news desert” around global warming. And access to Climate Matters isn’t restricted to weathercasters. Anyone can receive its free weekly bulletins. TV coverage of climate change need not make for heavy weather.Bernadette Woods PlackyChief meteorologist and climate matters director, Climate Central • How can we campaign for the BBC to do more to highlight climate change following the call by former weatherman Bill Giles for there to be a climate-change slot in its weather reports? If we only have 12 years left to try to limit the effects of climate change, the BBC and other broadcasters need to do much more.Caroline EvansWest Ealing, London  • Your editorial (Rising temperatures are no reason to be cheerful. Forecasts should face the facts, 20 March) advocates the inclusion of information on climate change in weather forecasting. However, it goes on to discuss weather forecasts as if there wasn’t one within the pages of the paper. It would be a simple matter for the Guardian to take the lead and include a “carbon counter to counter carbon”, to show the daily measurements from the Mauna Loa observatory (currently 411 parts per million) against the safe level of 300ppm.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, Oxfordshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard, young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation. They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn’t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis.  Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it’s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a “green industrial revolution”. We have the plans to create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs in the renewable energy sector. That will help meet our target of 60% of energy to come from low-carbon sources within 12 years. The next generation will be trained in the skills needed to work in offshore wind, tidal lagoons and solar energy. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in public transport and cycle paths we will reduce our reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles. All new homes built will be zero-carbon too. The UK is home to some of the least populated areas of Europe, and under a green industrial revolution they will be allowed to thrive, not destroyed. Every national and local park in this country has been a victory won by communities through struggle. In the 1930s, working-class people staged a mass protest fighting their way up Kinder Scout in Derbyshire to fight for the “right to roam”, paving the way for the establishment of our national parks years later by a Labour government. And it was Labour’s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee who said that the countryside was not just “a means of producing food, but part of our great national heritage of beauty”. Building on this legacy, a Labour government will ensure that farming conserves and creates safe habitats for birds, insects and other wild animals, and encourages the growth of wildflowers. Labour has a strong record of international leadership on the environment, and action on climate change will be at the heart of our development and trade policies. We have a role not just in protecting and promoting biodiversity in the UK but protecting it in other countries and in the oceans that connect us. It’s past time all of us stopped looking the other way, learn from the passion and wisdom of young people and join them in actively organising for a better future. • Jeremy Corbyn is MP for Islington North and leader of the Labour party The Conservative party was invited to participate, but declined. Climate change is the most serious issue facing the world and is a truly global challenge. We have a moral responsibility to do what we can to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change for future generations. Scotland has been praised as a world leader for the action we are taking to address the issue. We have introduced a new climate change bill that contains the most ambitious statutory targets of any country in the world for 2020, 2030 and 2040, and will mean Scotland is carbon neutral by 2050. However, the urgency of climate change means it is right that we are all challenged to constantly reassess our approach and to see where we can do more. It is of course extremely important that school pupils attend their lessons, and as first minister, I could not condone repeated absences during term time. But in Scotland our schools teach and encourage our young people to engage in public debate and to learn about the issues that concern them. Lowering the voting age to 16 as we have done since 2014 has only enhanced our political debate and in 2018 we celebrated the Year of Young People. The year gave young people new opportunities for their voices to be heard in all parts of our society and helped foster better understanding, cooperation and respect between generations. On a matter of such importance as climate change, it is inspiring that young people are engaged, interested and ready to take action themselves to hold world leaders and governments to account. Later this month I will be meeting a group of young people from across Scotland who have been active climate change campaigners to discuss the issue and hear their concerns. We must listen to the voice of the next generation and involve them in decision-making and policy development. It is their planet to inherit, and their passion to protect it should inspire us all. • Nicola Sturgeon is first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP The students who are taking part in this climate strike are right to highlight what is the most serious issue facing any of us. Just as with Brexit, young people will be most acutely affected, and it’s our responsibility to support them. Liberal Democrats invested heavily in a cleaner environment during our period in government, setting up the Green Investment Bank, encouraging homes to cut emissions through the Green Deal, and cutting plastic bag usage by 85% through the 5p levy. Since Liberal Democrats left government the Conservatives have abandoned the positive record of the coalition. They have effectively banned onshore wind turbines, slashed subsidies to solar power, pursued an ideological obsession with fracking, cut incentives for electric vehicles, scrapped zero-carbon homes, cancelled rail electrification projects and approved a new runway at Heathrow. The hostility now levelled at young people who are taking a stand on this issue demonstrates that these strikes are noticed by those in power. It’s now up to Westminster to act responsibly – coming together across parties – to act on the demands of those who care about our planet. The failing Brexit project has crowded out too many important issues over the last three years, and it’s time our political system addressed itself once again to climate change. The Liberal Democrats will continue to be the greenest party in Westminster, and to argue that climate action can best be achieved at a European and international level – working with our neighbours rather than turning our backs. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business If I were a school pupil today I would be striking against climate change and would make sure the whole school was striking with me. The reason couldn’t be simpler: time is running out. Time is running out to make the changes to our way of life, how we produce and use energy, how we travel around this Earth, how we build and warm our homes, how we use our natural resources. The threat is bleak: whole states disappearing underwater because of increases in sea level; not just more drought, but more starvation on an international level; widespread disappearance of species and an environment that is far more challenging to life on this Earth. We’re not just on the brink of ecological catastrophe, we’re in the middle of one. But what I’ve seen so clearly by these school strikers so far is that from speaker after speaker, young person after young person there is such an outpouring of eloquence, of vision, of positivity. To stand up and fight for the Earth is the noblest of all causes. Climate change faces humanity as a whole. It should be the main discussion across chambers, but Brexit has sucked the oxygen from our politics. It feels as if we should skip a generation in politics. Young people are demonstrating the vision and determined leadership to make is possible to make significant and swift progress towards a low-carbon existence. To follow their lead means that we can’t wait until Westminster wakes up. We all must be brave. The small town of Machynlleth in mid-Wales has been one of the very few towns in the world to declare a climate emergency, with ambition to make its buildings eco-friendly, encourage renewable energy developments and ensure its pension fund divested from fossil fuels. What got Machynlleth to make the commitment? It was a petition signed by 500 local people; a small community-sized step with a worldwide impact. • Adam Price is leader of Plaid Cymru Hope. That was what I felt when I entered Parliament Square last month to be greeted by hundreds of young people at the first Youth Strike 4 Climate in Britain. That day one young person carried a sign that read: “We are missing our lessons to teach you.” The question now is whether Westminster will listen to the wisdom of youth. Last year the UN warned we have a limited window of opportunity until 2030 to take positive action to limit climate catastrophe. Since then, councils across the country have declared a climate emergency with many committing to gold-standard climate action – often prompted by Green councillors. But parliament is still dragging its heels. This week, the chancellor tried to fob off the rising tide of youth activism with token policies that don’t go far enough. He said he plans to make travel companies offset carbon, yet is still building new runways. He talked about biodiversity, but kept quiet about his devastating cuts to Natural England. And his government is doing nothing to break the toxic hold fossil-fuel bosses have on our lawmakers. Youth strikers across the world know the planet can’t wait. I’m proud it’s my colleague in parliament, Caroline Lucas, demanding the government launch a Green New Deal with money ploughed into thousands of new green jobs and transformed local energy and transport networks. If ministers are serious about securing the planet for our children, they will act now. As a Green elected to represent millions of young Londoners, it’s amazing to see them make these demands of me and my political colleagues. It will be a privilege to stand beside our young people again today as they strike for their futures – I implore those in power to listen to their demands. • Siân Berry is co-leader of the Green party"

In April I got just over 8000 visits, and in May almost 28,000. Thanks readers!  I think I can allow myself a little indulgence of some sherry wood finish Glenmorangie to celebrate.
I got a lot of help from Big Blog, i.e.  climatedepot, WUWT  and Bishop Hill. When these boys drop your name, you really see spikes in the traffic volume.
But I’m not doing it for the numbers (though I have to admit it feels good to see a spike).  It’s for fun, and it has been more fun than I ever imagined.
I’m gong to continue looking for stories that readers might not otherwise hear about. Repeating what the other blogs say is not my thing…though I may have done that a couple of times. I think it was Jeff Id at the Air Vent who said: to blog successfully, you have to spend a lot of time reading. THAT’S TRUE. Writing is acutally the easy part. Some bloggers have got to be going through reams of literature.
My highlight post for May was gate-blowup. It didn’t pull in the most traffic, but it’s the one I was most satisfied with. I’ll be updating it in the future.
And one more thing – not once did I have to snip a reader’s comment because of bad behaviour. To me that says a lot about the kind of readers us sceptics get. This claim that we’re all a gang of angry, belligerent malcontents is yet another warmist fantasy. Such rubbish they put out sometimes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi here gives us a heads-up on what the planet has in store for us in the months ahead, warning:
…wait till you global temp watchers get a load of what is coming.
Joe is just using the NOAA’s own data. Look at the NOAA’s projection for the months ahead.

You can find this chart: NOAA here
Take a good look at surface temps at the poles for early next year. It’s no wonder Joe has been predicting massive Arctic sea ice recovery starting next year, and adds:
 I mean both poles cold and then 75% of the earth under normal? Geez, I know there is cooling that is going to go on, but this is a bit drastic.
 If it’s the almighty climate models that are the reason to keep forecasting warm, and they are showing this kind of crash ( such an event could take the running 13 month temp of the earth next year to -.2 or -.3…as this La Nina, low solar cycle and cumulative volcanic activity means business, then things may be quicker than I thought.
Joe’s been predicting something like this for many months. Some people have been scoffing at his forecasts. Well now even the alarmist NOAA is confirming Joe’s forecast. I always say: If you need pretty good forecasts, then Go to Joe!

"Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, has announced a radical plan to meet the “existential threat” of climate change by constructing a new section of Manhattan , extending hundreds of feet out into the narrow East river, in order to protect Wall Street and other downtown areas.  Plans to fund the scheme, however, are far from firm. He said the project, which would cost an estimated $10bn, will aim to be funded partly by private development “if federal funds are not available”. “If there’s federal money in play it probably looks one way,” De Blasio said. “If there’s not federal money in play, we have to get some private money into it and there has to be some development.” Officials have been developing schemes to fortify New York’s waterfront since Superstorm Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, and took more than 50 lives in the city, in 2012. De Blasio said it will cost about $500m to fortify most of lower Manhattan from future effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and intense precipitation, by providing grassy berms and removable barriers. But planners determined that protecting the lowest-lying area, including South Street Seaport and the adjacent financial district at the tip of Manhattan, will require adding more land over several years. De Blasio, who is contemplating joining the crowded field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, said the $10bn landfill project should be supported by federal funds, but that’s unlikely to happen during the administration of Donald Trump. “Lower Manhattan is one of the core centers of the American economy,” he said. “It’s where the financial capital of the United States is. The security of lower Manhattan should be a national priority. The fact is it is not. And it’s incomprehensible to me that there’s no sense of urgency from the federal government,” he said. The plan to extend the coastline will go through the city’s environmental review process, De Blasio said, but he hopes to avoid “the endless dragging on that usually accompanies something of this scale”. De Blasio admitted that the Trump administration is unlikely to support dishing out money for the plan. A new president could bring possibility, especially if the Green New Deal is passed, he said. But the prospect of private development on the newly built land is expected to meet resistance from downtown Manhattan community members. City council member Margaret Chin, who represents the area, said a more resilient plan to combat climate change “cannot be paid for by private real estate development that would destroy the waterfront neighborhoods that we are trying to protect”. De Blasio announced the so-called climate resilience plan at a news conference on Thursday. He said a study undertaken by his office and others has determined that if the city does not prepare for climate change, rising seas will expose 20% of lower Manhattan to daily flooding by 2100. “This is the existential threat,” De Blasio said. “This is the core issue we all must face as aggressively as humanly possible.” Efforts to protect New York from the next big storm have been studied for years. Existing initiatives, like stone revetments and solar-powered streetlights in flood-prone areas, have already been implemented across the city. Lower Manhattan has been the subject of much attention. In 2014, the city adopted the “Big U” – a plan to flood-proof lower Manhattan through measures such as storm barriers along walkways and elevated green spaces. Some New Yorkers were skeptical that the proposal represented the best use of the city’s resources in light of other problems the city faces. Mackenzie Montagna, a 24-year-old Battery Park City resident, said she doesn’t trust the plan because other similar projects have been “just a waste of money”. She said: “They could’ve instead focused on other issues we have like subway improvement.”"
"Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young, such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement, which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents’ generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on. In comparison, the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change. The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years, but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency. The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires, floods and hurricanes. Today’s children, as they become more politically aware, will be much more radical than their parents, simply because there will be no other choice for them. This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise. The Green New Deal (GND), a term presently most associated with 29-year-old US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the “pro free market” wing, who argue that it’s a Trojan horse, nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation. The criticism feels ridiculous. Partly because the GND is far from truly radical and already represents a compromise solution, but mainly because the radical economics isn’t a hidden clause, but a headline feature. Climate change is the result of our current economic and industrial system. GND-style proposals marry sweeping environmental policy changes with broader socialist reforms because the level of disruption required to keep us at a temperature anywhere below “absolutely catastrophic” is fundamentally, on a deep structural level, incompatible with the status quo. Right now we can, with a massive investment of effort by 2030, just about keep the warming level below 1.5C. This is “bad, but manageable” territory. Failing to put that effort in sees the world crossing more severe temperature barriers that would lead to outcomes like ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, mass desertification, and coastal cities being flooded into inhabitability. We will simply have to throw the kitchen sink at this. Policy tweaks such as a carbon tax won’t do it. We need to fundamentally re-evaluate our relationship to ownership, work and capital. The impact of a dramatic reconfiguration of the industrial economy require similarly large changes to the welfare state. Basic incomes, large-scale public works programmes, everything has to be on the table to ensure that the oncoming system shocks do not leave vast swathes of the global population starving and destitute. Perhaps even more fundamentally, we cannot continue to treat the welfare system as a tool for disciplining the supposedly idle underclasses. Our system must be reformed with a more humane view of worklessness, poverty and migration than we have now. Unfortunately for our children, the people they have to convince of all this are the people who have done very well out of this system, and are powerfully incentivised to deny that it is all that bad. Already, Joke Schauvliege, a Belgian environment minister, has been forced to resign after falsely claiming that she had been told by Belgian state security services that “ghosts” behind the scenes were behind demonstrations in Belgium. This conspiracism of the elite, these claims that genuine mass movement can’t possibly really exist and must be in some way being guided by agents provocateurs, is just one of the ways in which those currently running things have resorted to a kind of political gaslighting in an attempt to maintain their grip on power. Gaslighting is a term I don’t use lightly, because it describes a genuine form of emotional abuse, where an abuser will deny reality in an attempt to get their victim to literally doubt their own sanity, and this should not be diluted by overuse. Yet I struggle to think of another word that adequately sums up the way in which “sensible” adults are doubling down on their tactic of manufacturing a political reality which bears no relationship to the world we see around us. It’s the Marxism of Groucho rather than Karl: “Who are you going to believe? The serious political professionals or your own lying eyes?” US Senator Dianne Feinstein’s meeting with schoolchildren petitioning her to take action over the issue went viral because of the way she condescended to them for, basically, asking her to leave them a planet behind to live on. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” she said, “I know what I’m doing.” The obvious response is, of course, that messing something up for 30 years is quite long enough, thanks. Long tenure without results is not the same thing as expertise. This is a tough and bitter pill to swallow for the political professionals whose feet are firmly under the table. It is increasingly obvious that all their tactics have done almost nothing except run down the clock, but still they insist that it’s the young who just don’t get it and that things aren’t that simple. They’re the living embodiment of the famous New Yorker cartoon, with a suited man sat in a post-apocalyptic landscape telling his young audience “Yes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.” This is reality v the vested interests of the powerful. Any meaningful policy has to upset the established power base and the political donor class. Any policy that doesn’t upset these people will be useless. To pretend that we can compromise our way through this while we wait for a magical, technological bullet that will keep temperatures down without costing us anything is beyond wilful ignorance now. It is a question of basic morality. Many of today’s climate strikers won’t even be 30 by the time the 1.5C deadline comes around in 2030. They are asking us to consider a simple question: is their future worth more than preserving our reputations? What will our response to them be? • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"
"It is high school students who have helped reinvigorate the climate change debate in Australia and they are preparing to march again this week. The effect they have had is similar to the reaction created by the Green New Deal in the United States in the last month. Last month newly elected congressional representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought a new proposal to the Congress: a 14-page vision for a Green New Deal. More statement than legislative proposal (it was a non-binding resolution), the Green New Deal outlined the total economic transformation required to respond to escalating climate change, then combined that action plan with a values proposition – that the economic and social transition must be just (indeed the resolution began by outlining the combined challenges of climate change and inequality). The Green New Deal released a rocket into the US climate change debate. Until very recently climate change was not seen as a vote winner. Rather most Democrats saw it as a kind of fringe, green issue that only moved small-liberal middle-class people living in gentrified inner-city pockets of a few “blue” cities. While climate campaigners would shout about how this was wrong, especially after the IPCC’s 2018 dire predictions of rapidly rising temperatures, they struggled to change the conversation. Enter the Green New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez, surrounded by the youth-run Sunrise Movement, has in one month demonstrated that not only is climate change a planet changer, but that climate action is a vote winner. How do we know? They shifted Chuck Schumer. Schumer is the Democratic leader in the Senate and a politician known for his middle-of-the-road positions. He shares much in common with some senior leaders in the Australian Labor party. But last week in a tremendous shift that responded entirely to the rise of the Green New Deal, Schumer has embraced a bold new path on climate. He hasn’t backed the Green New Deal. But he has called for new bold climate action that he wants use to frame the Democrats agenda in the lead up to the 2020 election. Schumer says that one of the reasons for his change of heart is that he is a new grandparent. But let’s be clear, he is a politician – he is doing this because he is an astute observer of polls. Like most of the 2020 presidential candidates, who have also embraced the Green New Deal, what the last month in the US has unearthed is that climate action will be a vote winner for any Democrat who gets on board. So what does this mean for Australia? The Australian Labor party doesn’t have to wait until 2020 to run an election on bold climate action, and they would do well to listen to Schumer’s argument. Schumer has said that the reason the Democrats need to act on climate is to build trust with millennials. Schumer can see that if the Democrats demonstrate that they care for the climate, that they might build a loyal relationship with young voters. The Democrats know that the Republicans are climate sceptics but also that young people don’t trust politicians. To create a relationship of trust they need to go big on climate. That might be hard, but the rewards are big – if they can go bold they might take a generation of voters with them, for life. The ALP has the same opportunity. Young people, like those who will strike on Friday, are worried about the climate because they will have to learn to live with climate change. But the ALP’s “small target” approach will not build trust. In Australia bold action requires the ALP to saying how they will stop the Adani coalmine. And that kind of leadership might also do wonders for Shorten’s personal approval ratings, like it did for Bob Hawke when he stopped the Franklin Dam. The Green New Deal has done more to shift climate politics in one month than more moderate campaigning has done in years There are also lessons for Australian social movements. The Green New Deal is a “big”, almost boundless proposal for progressive policy goodness. Wrapped up in the resolution are not only proposals for energy, agriculture and transport (key causes of climate change) but a vision for healthcare for all. In one sense, it’s a manifestation of Naomi Klein’s argument that climate change is “about everything” and solutions to it need to not only technically fix carbon emissions but also create greater social justice. That’s exciting. For those involved in Australian social movements who are curious about what a similar policy mix looks like for Australia, a bunch of work is needed. In the US a network of movements like Sunrise, thinktanks (led by New Consensus) and academics have worked on this proposal. Building the Green New Deal has at times been divisive, there are splits between some labour unions around the policy. Building a grand coalition of interests isn’t easy, and perhaps it could have been done better slower. But beginning this conversation quickly generated success. Arguably the Green New Deal has done more to shift American climate politics in one month than more moderate campaigning has done in years. But the Green New Deal has only just begun, and hopefully as it builds it is able to take on some of the strengths of the original New Deal. One of the most lasting legislative reforms in the 1930s were the changes made to labour law, where Roosevelt in effect “changed the rules” in how unions could organise. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act removed many of the restrictions on union organising – arguing that in order to get wages growth, workplaces needed more economic democracy (sound familiar?). Over the next two decades workplaces transformed, industrial unions grew, wages increased and the economy became stronger. Fundamentally the New Deal wasn’t just about the state acting to “fix” the economy but the state creating space for people to act collectively to improve the economy for themselves. It’s food for thought in modern-day Australia. Our two most significant social movements are arguably the climate movement and the union movement. What would it take for them, and others, to forge an unusual alliance that connected the joint needs of climate action and a just economy? And what other civil society organisations might participate? And what would be the place for researchers and thinkers – the modern-day Keynes – in a Green New Deal? Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution calls for consultation with all these groups, but imagine if in Australia this was stronger – a glorious unusual, robust coalition of activists and academics, workers and student strikers who together could handle their differences and prosecute a vision for the country in this moment of uncertainty. And what if through this same moment we could see bolder leadership from our politicians too. • Amanda Tattersall is a postdoctoral fellow on social change strategy and a research lead at Sydney Policy Lab.

"It started in front of the Swedish parliament, on 20 August – a regular school day. Greta Thunberg sat with her painted sign and some homemade flyers. This was the first school climate strike. Fridays wouldn’t be regular schooldays any longer. The rest of us, and many more alongside us, picked it up in Australia, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, New Zealand, Uganda. Today the climate strike will take place all around the world. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. We knew there was a climate crisis. Not just because forests in Sweden or in the US had been on fire; because of alternating floods and drought in Germany and Australia; because of the collapse of alpine faces due to melting permafrost and other climate changes. We knew, because everything we read and watched screamed out to us that something was very wrong. That first day of refusing to go to school was spent alone, but since then a movement of climate strikers has swept the globe. Today young people in more than 100 countries will walk out of class to demand action on the greatest threat humankind has ever faced. These strikes are happening today – from Washington DC to Moscow, Tromsø to Invercargill, Beirut to Jerusalem, and Shanghai to Mumbai – because politicians have failed us. We’ve seen years of negotiations, pathetic deals on climate change, fossil fuel companies being given free rein to carve open our lands, drill beneath our soils and burn away our futures for their profit. We’ve seen fracking, deep sea drilling and coalmining continue. Politicians have known the truth about climate change and they’ve willingly handed over our future to profiteers whose search for quick cash threatens our very existence. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on global warming could not have been clearer about the extreme dangers of going beyond 1.5C of global warming. To have any chance of avoiding that extreme danger emissions must drop rapidly – so that by the time we will be in our mid- and late-20s we are living in a transformed world. The students who are striking in cities, towns and villages around the world are uniting behind the science. We are only asking that our leaders to do the same. If those in power today don’t act, it will be our generation who will live through their failure. Those who are under 20 now could be around to see 2080, and face the prospect of a world that has warmed by up to 4C. The effects of such warming would be utterly devastating. Rivers would flood, storms would wreak havoc on coastal communities and coral reefs would be eliminated. Melting polar ice caps would lead to dramatically higher sea levels, flooding coastal areas. Places on Earth will become uninhabitable. Scientists have also shown us that burning fossil fuels is “the world’s most significant threat to children’s health”. Nine out of every 10 children around the world are breathing dangerous air. Our lives are being compromised before we are born. Toxic particles from exhaust fumes pass through the lungs of pregnant women and accumulate in the placenta. The risk of premature birth, low birth weight and cognitive dysfunction this causes is a public health catastrophe. Pollution from diesel vehicles is stunting the growth of our lungs, leaving us damaged for life. Toxic air from burning fossil fuels is choking not only our lungs but our hopes and dreams. And the worst effects of climate change are disproportionately felt by our most vulnerable communities. This is not just about cutting down emissions, but about equity – the system we have right now is failing us, working only for the rich few. The luxury so few of us enjoy in the global north is based on the suffering of people in the global south. We have watched as politicians fumble, playing a political game rather than facing the facts that the solutions we need cannot be found within the current system. They don’t want to face the facts – we need to change the system if we are to try to act on the climate crisis. This movement had to happen, we didn’t have a choice. The vast majority of climate strikers taking action today aren’t allowed to vote. Imagine for a second what that feels like. Despite watching the climate crisis unfold, despite knowing the facts, we aren’t allowed to have a say in who makes the decisions about climate change. And then ask yourself this: wouldn’t you go on strike too, if you thought doing so could help protect your own future? So today we walk out of school, we quit our college lessons, and we take to the streets to say enough is enough. Some adults say we shouldn’t be walking out of classes – that we should be “getting an education”. We think organising against an existential threat – and figuring out how to make our voices heard – is teaching us some important lessons. Other adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But we don’t want your hope. We don’t want you to be hopeful. We want you to panic and we want you to take action. We want you to join us. We’ve relied on adults to make the right decisions to ensure that there is a future for the next generation – surely we don’t have all the answers. But what we do know is that we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, phase out subsidies for dirty energy production, seriously invest in renewables and start asking difficult questions about how we structure our economies and who is set to win and who is set to lose. And we are no longer alone. Tens of thousands of scientists from around the world have released statements in support of the strikes by children. The scientists have been very clear about what we need to do to tackle climate change. We are uniting behind the scientists. We are only asking that our leaders do the same. It is so important that this happens now. The kind of changes that need to happen mean everyone recognising that this is a crisis and committing to radical transformations. We strongly believe that we can fight off the most damaging effects of climate change – but we have to act now. There is no grey area when it comes to survival. There’s no less bad option. That’s why young people are striking in every corner of the globe, and it’s why we are asking that older people join us on the streets too. When our house is burning we cannot just leave it to the children to pour water on the flames – we need the grownups to take responsibility for sparking the blaze in the first place. So for once, we’re asking grownups to follow our lead: we can’t wait any longer. This movement had to happen. And now, you adults have a choice. • Greta Thunberg is a youth climate strike leader in Sweden, Anna Taylor in the UK, Luisa Neubauer in Germany, Kyra Gantois, Anuna De Wever and Adélaïde Charlier in Belgium, Holly Gillibrand in Scotland, and Alexandria Villasenor in USA"
"A deputy governor of Australia’s central bank has issued a stark warning that climate change poses risks to financial stability, noting that warming needs to be thought of by policymakers and business as a trend and not a cyclical event. As a debate over coal and energy fractures the Morrison government, Guy Debelle warned a forum hosted by the Centre for Policy Development on Tuesday that climate change created risks for Australia’s financial stability in a number of different ways.  “For example, insurers may face large, unanticipated payouts because of climate change-related property damage and business losses,” he said. “In some cases businesses and households could lose access to insurance. “Companies that generate significant pollution might face reputational damage or legal liability from their activities, and changes to regulation could cause previously valuable assets to become uneconomic. “All of these consequences could precipitate sharp adjustments in asset prices, which would have consequences for financial stability.” Debelle noted Australia had traditionally come at the climate change debate largely through the prism of its impact on agriculture, but he said the changing climate created “significant risks and opportunities for a broader part of the economy than agriculture – though the impact on agriculture continues to be significant”. He said policymakers and businesses needed to “think in terms of trend rather than cycles in the weather”. “Droughts have generally been regarded, at least economically, as cyclical events that recur every so often. In contrast, climate change is a trend change. The impact of a trend is ongoing, whereas a cycle is temporary.” He said there was a need to reassess the frequency of climate change events, and “our assumptions about the severity and longevity of the climatic events”. He said the insurance industry had already recognised the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones and hurricanes in the northern hemisphere had changed, and this reassessment had prompted the sector to reprice how they insure and reinsure against such events. “We need to think about how the economy is currently adapting and how it will adapt both to the trend change in climate and the transition required to contain climate change,” Debelle said. He said the transition path to a less carbon-intensive world was “clearly quite different depending on whether it is managed as a gradual process or is abrupt”. “The trend changes aren’t likely to be smooth. There is likely to be volatility around the trend, with the potential for damaging outcomes from spikes above the trend.” Debelle noted the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had provided “strong evidence” that another half degree of warming was likely in the next 10 to 30 years. He said work from the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO pointed to an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, and noted “extreme events may well have a disproportionately large physical impact”. “There is also a greater possibility of compound events, where two or more climatic events combine to produce an outcome that is worse than the effect of one of them occurring individually,” Debelle said. “Combined with the increased volatility, this increases the likelihood of nonlinear impacts on the economy.” Debelle said assessed through that lens, climate change-induced shocks to the economy would be “close to permanent” if droughts were more frequent and cyclones happened more often. “That situation is more challenging to assess and respond to.” He said the impacts of climate change on the economy were mixed both domestically and in terms of export earnings. The deputy governor pointed to the huge transition under way in Australia’s energy sector where the levelised cost of generating electricity had declined in the case of wind and solar “to the point where they are now cost-effective sources of generation”. But he said the massive shift in the direction of rooftop solar had consequences for the cost of electricity transmission and also the efficacy of current infrastructure. He said the RBA was paying close attention to developments in the energy market, “given the importance of the cost of electricity in inflation both directly to households and indirectly as a significant input to businesses”. Debelle noted there was a move in China to transition to cleaner energy sources. In the short run this had benefitted Australian coal exports, because the product was higher quality. But as China transitions away from coal, “natural gas is expected to account for a larger share of its energy mix and Australia is well placed to help meet this increase in demand”. He said Australia had prospects as an exporter of materials used in the production of renewable energy, including lithium, which is necessary for the batteries used in storage."
"Since August 2018 a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, has sat outside her country’s parliament building every Friday rather than in a classroom. She is there to demand that the government takes climate action by implementing the 2015 Paris agreement. While some thought she would give up her strike, her resolve could not be broken by the cold, heat or disapproval from adults.  Last Friday children in 72 countries joined what have come to be known as the school strikes against climate change. It is important to note that one of the pillars on which the strike hangs is the Paris climate accord globally endorsed in 2015 at the 21st conference of parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taken alongside the UN sustainable development goals, the hope is that global temperature rises above preindustrial levels can be kept at 1.5C or “well below” 2C. It is also hoped that with the development goals poverty and hunger can be terminated by 2050. Are these attainable targets? Negotiations on pathways of implementing the Paris climate agreement underscore the fact that there is a global agreement that countries must take action. But the indications of how this would be achieved are not at the level of ambition needed to counter, slow or stop the looming climate chaos. The problem with voluntary emissions reduction by nations is that such actions would only achieve the targets if the key polluters do their fair share of cutting emissions at source. This is not the scenario that is playing out, however. A special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicated that the current ambition as set out until 2030 will likely result in a global warming of about 3C by 2100 and that this warming would continue. Unless the most polluting nations raise their emissions reduction ambitions, we are on track towards the literal incineration of the planet. Extreme weather events are already wreaking havoc on many regions. Small-island developing nations are at extreme risk of being swallowed up by the oceans. Nigeria and other African nations are at risk of highly challenged agricultural systems and intensified poverty regimes. Even with the best socioeconomic improvements in our nations, the consequences of 1.5C or 2C temperature increase will mean elevated health risks, water stress, human insecurity, damaged livelihoods and lowered levels of wellbeing. Temperature rises will lead to increased desertification, higher ocean acidification and migration of marine species to higher latitudes. The impacts on my home country, Nigeria, will be dire. Water stress will be higher in the Sahelian area and this will compel a higher rate of southward migration of pastoralists and farmers. Ocean acidification and coastal erosion, on the other hand, will force coastal communities to relocate into the hinterland. This is a scenario that will breed conflict. The strike for climate action is a significant step by children and teenagers, especially because it is their future that is at stake. Thunberg has been clear in her many speeches to policymakers and leaders. She insists that nations must wake up and that their sluggishness is a mark of laziness and irresponsibility. At the UN climate change conference in Katowice in December, she pointedly stated: “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.” One of the clear ways to apply that brake is to quickly phase out the dependence on fossil fuels for energy production and transportation. The truth is that the world must abandon fossil fuels within this century. The decline in use of this dirty energy must happen now. Rather than take this pathway, politicians lend their ears to fossil fuel corporations even in the corridors of the UN climate change conferences. Rather than cut emissions, the tendency is towards what is termed net-zero emissions. This means a polluter can keep polluting once they buy a licence for the actions by showing that an equivalent amount is being absorbed by trees in a poor community’s forest or that similar amounts are absorbed by the oceans or are reflected back into space through geoengineering. Sadly, Nigeria keeps flaring gas in the Niger Delta – a major local contributor of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our government’s deadline for ending gas flaring in 2020 does not appear achievable given progress on the ground. When children call adults immature, we must be attentive. It is not an insult. It is a plea for us to think of the future of our children. They insist that if there is no future there is no reason to sit in a classroom. We must listen to the children. Children of the world must unite in this struggle to force adults away from short-term measures predicated on profit, political gains and their lack of concern for the planet and the future. • Nnimmo Bassey is director of the ecological thinktank Health of Mother Earth Foundation"
"Jaguar Land Rover has been forced to recall more than 44,000 cars for repairs after UK regulators found some models were emitting more carbon dioxide than previously thought. The Vehicle Certification Agency found 10 models for the Land Rover and Jaguar brands were emitting more greenhouse gases than had been certified initially. JLR then informed the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which handles recalls, of the findings.  Britain’s largest carmaker will have to carry out free repairs on the models. JLR’s cars “may emit excessive levels of CO2 and may not conform with the certified condition”, according to the European commission’s rapid alert system. Recalls of cars to fix safety defects happen fairly often, but full product recalls because of exhaust emissions are rare. It is thought to be the first carbon dioxide-related recall for JLR. It will affect versions of the Land Rover Discovery, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Sport, Velar and Evoque made between 2016 and 2019. Jaguar models affected include the E-Pace, F-Pace, F-Type, XE and XF. Petrol and some diesel models will be part of the recall. The repairs could include software updates as well as physical alterations, and some Range Rover Evoque models will need new tyres, a JLR spokesperson said. Vehicle emissions have come under increased scrutiny in recent years following Volkswagen’s diesel scandal, in which it was found to have installed software to trick emissions tests. At the same time, international agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions has prompted multiple governments to announce plans to ban the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars, with the UK to do so from 2040. European manufacturers are under pressure to reduce the average emissions of their new cars from 118.5g of CO2 per kilometre to less than 95g by 2021. Neil Barlow, DVSA’s head of vehicle engineering, said: “DVSA’s priority is to protect everyone from unsafe drivers and vehicles. This includes vehicles that are damaging our environment.” JLR’s recall is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s finances, but comes at a challenging time for the carmaker. JLR posted a record quarterly loss in February and announced about 4,500 job cuts the previous month. In a statement, JLR said: “Affected vehicles are being rectified to ensure the correct CO2 performance is dependably achieved. The modifications made to affected vehicles will be made free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out.”"
"The United States and Saudi Arabia have hamstrung global efforts to scrutinise climate geoengineering in order to benefit their fossil fuel industries, according to multiple sources at the United Nations environment assembly, taking place this week in Nairobi. The world’s two biggest oil producers reportedly led opposition against plans to examine the risks of climate-manipulating technology such as sucking carbon out of the air, reflective mirrors in space, seeding the oceans and injecting particulates into the atmosphere.  Deeper analysis of the risks had been proposed by Switzerland and 12 other countries as a first step towards stronger oversight of potentially world-altering experiments that would have implications for food supply, biodiversity, global inequality and security. Some have been tried, but as yet none deployed at a scale that would affect the climate. This call for caution was supported by the president of the assembly, Siim Kiisler, Estonia’s environment minister, “We need to talk about governance of geoengineering. We need an international agreement on this in the future. Just ignoring the issue does not help. We need to talk about it and how to govern those technologies in the future.” But sources involved with the talks said the initiative was blocked, initially by the US and Saudi Arabia, then by Japan and other countries. Once dismissed as reckless science fiction, geoengineering has risen up the political agenda of some nations as the climate crisis has become more apparent. The petrochemical industry sees it as a way to justify further expansion of fossil fuel industries. Chevron, BHP and other high-emitting companies have invested in companies that are pushing ahead with experiments to pull CO2 out of the air. US academics at Harvard are also poised to conduct the biggest outdoor test of stratospheric aerosol injection, which simulates the cloaking effect of a volcano eruption. The researchers say this test, known as Scopex, will probably take place in New Mexico. One of the leading US scientists behind such research, David Keith, published a paper this week claiming the risks of geoengineering are not as great as previously feared. Opponents counter that earlier, more thorough studies show serious impacts on Asian monsoon cycles, African droughts, tropical cyclones and extreme temperatures. They want the UN to impose a moratorium on outdoor experiments using this form of technology. “More than a scientific test, this is a political test. It’s a way to establish the technology,” warned Silvia Ribeiro of the industry watchdog ETC Group. “Stratospheric aerosol injection would cause huge imbalances in the climate. We think it will also exacerbate geopolitical unfairness.” Many climate scientists argue such research is a distraction from proven methods of mitigating emissions through tree planting and a switch to renewable energy. Jacqueline McGlade, professor of sustainable development at University College London, said she supported certain types of locally appropriate land-based geoengineering but was extremely concerned about efforts to play with the stratosphere. “If we mess around with particulate matter, it could potentially affect everyone. As far as atmospheric physics are concerned, we don’t know everything.” Currently, the main prohibition on testing is the Convention on Biological Diversity, which the US is the only country not to have ratified. There are also provisions in the London Protocol, which forbids ocean seeding – another form of geoengineering, which aims to increase the capacity of sea water to absorb CO2. The question now is whether to strengthen the controls, by tightening rules and broadening oversight, or to narrow them down. The US argues that geoengineering should be left to climate forums, such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This week, consensus proved impossible. On Wednesday evening, the Swiss delegation withdrew their resolution and expressed regret that “some countries” were reluctant to move forward. “Our motivation was to get more information to inform discussions,” the head of the delegation Felix Wertli said. “Governance of geoengineering is an important topic today, and even more tomorrow. The topic is not off the table. It is the start of a further conversation.” This was seen as a defeat for the “precautionary principle”, under which nations are supposed to put safety first when faced with uncertain but potentially catastrophic risks. Campaigners warned future debates on the subject are now more likely to focus narrowly on science and politics, rather than other species, food supply, water use, inequality and peace. “It is regrettable that efforts to strengthen existing UN governance on geoengineering met with resistance from a handful of high-emitting oil-producing countries,” said Lili Fuhr of the Heinrich Böll Foundation. “This task is now more important than ever as we see real-world experiments and public support for these technologies growing in exactly those countries, like the USA and Saudi Arabia, that were blocking progress on this issue this week in Nairobi.” This was not the only agenda item in Nairobi that Trump administration diplomats were accused of watering down; they were also accused of undermining efforts to ensure strong environmental governance. “They are trying to remove all targets and timelines,” said one senior delegate. An ambitious Indian resolution to phase out single-use plastics by 2025 has been diluted to resolving to “significantly reduce” them by 2030, said another delegate. The US was supported by Brazil and at least four other countries in pushing back the deadline and making the language more vague. On marine waste, a Norwegian proposal to build an effective global strategy for dealing with plastics that enter the oceans has also met with resistance from the US. “They want to postpone measures so they can protect their industry,” said an ambassador from a large developing country. Approached by the Guardian, a US official denied his country was playing an obstructionist role. This could prove to be the last time the UK is part of the European Union delegation at an international conference, and there is speculation that after Brexit the British position may be realigned with the economy-first, environment-second approach of Washington."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Green Parliamentarians in Germany have a lot of questions to answer.
Awhile back, spooked by a visit to Germany by Fred Singer, they sent a QUERY to the ruling government in attempt to stem the rising tide of skepticism in Germany.
Their query was filled with use of the word “denier” and attempted marginalize and demonize people who had different opinion, like the Berlin Manhattan Institute, EIKE, Fred Singer and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty.
Well, the Berlin Manhattan Institute, together with the Internet blog antibuerokratieteam.net, have fired back with a query of their own addressed at the green radicals. Below it’s in English.
It has 16 questions for the Greens to answer, though don’t get your hopes up that they will.
I was surprised by the extent the Greens are just hacks of industry – see Question No. 11.
========================================================
Query to the Parliamentary Faction ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS
From:      Berlin Manhattan Institute and antibuerokratieteam.net
To:            German Green Parliamentarians
Subject: Position of the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS regarding open scientific debate and tolerating people with different views
Parliamentarians Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans-Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Oliver Krischer, Undine Kurth (Quedlinburg), Nicole Maisch, Dorothea Steiner and the faction ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS submitted an official query to the German Government (BT-Printed Document 17/3613), 3 November 2010.
This query also included an assessment of the scientific reputation of “climate denier” Prof. Fred Singer, and further asked if any peer-review works questioning the AGW hypothesis exist, and, if so, are they supported by scientific data?
The query submitted by the Greens, and especially its condescending tone, compel us to present the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS with a query of our own.
We ask the following questions to the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS:
1. Are the Greens aware that there are over 800 scientific papers that have been published and peer-reviewed, as well approx. 4000 sources of cited literature in the NIPCC Report Climate Change Reconsidered which question man-made climate change, and are all supported by scientific data? If not aware, do the Greens intend to expand their scientific knowledge so that in the future they will know the number of scientific publications out there?  And if yes, then why do the Greens deny their existence?
2. Are the members of the Green Parliamentarian faction aware that climate science is in fact still a very new scientific field that it has only begun to process the vast amounts of data collected thus far, and that it produces new surprising findings daily and is still a long way from being understood?  Are the members of the faction of Green Parliamentarians aware that scientific theories require empirical confirmation, and that their truth cannot be tested by model analyses?
3. Will the Greens even send a representative to the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy taking place in Berlin on December 3 -4 2010 with the objective of having a scientific discussion with the distinguished scientists who will be speaking there? Or will you remain hidden in your bunker?

4. If the Greens believe that the question of climate change and its possible human causes is already settled for good, then why don’t they call for the end of all the taxpayer financing of climate research work, especially when all the questions are answered? Are the Greens still aware of any redundant, needless  scientific work still taking place now that the questions are answered?
5. Are the Greens aware of any other institution, except for the Pope and their own party, that claims to be infallible?
6. The Greens cite the publications of the IPCC. Are the Greens aware of any incidents where scientific works questioning manmade climate change were either suppressed on multiple occasions in concerted actions, falsified, falsely presented, or not based on scientific research subjected to peer review (e.g. Climategate, Himalayagate, Glaciergate, Amazongate)?
7. Are you aware that the scientific career of Prof. Fred Singer, whom you characterize as unserious and unscientific, includes the following achievements and milestones? At the age of 16, Singer, as a Jew, had to leave Austria with his parents and emigrate to the United States, received a B.E.E. in electrical engineering from Ohio State University in 1943, an A.M. in physics from Princeton in 1944, taught physics at Princeton while he worked on his masters and his doctorate, obtaining his PhD there in 1948, he worked on the rocket science program of Johns Hopkins University for studying the ionosphere from 1946 to 1950, was attached to the U.S. Embassy in London as a scientific liaison officer with the Office of Naval Research from 1950 to 1953 where he studied research programs in Europe into cosmic radiation and nuclear physics, became Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and of the Center for Atmospheric and Space Physics in 1953, directed the meteorological satellite services for the National Weather Satellite Center (today at the NOAA) in 1962, was first dean of the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences at the University of Miami in 1964, was deputy assistant secretary with the U.S. Department of the Interior in Water Management from 1967 to 1971 which at the time was also responsible for Atmospheric and Oceanic affairs, was also Deputy Assistant Administrator (Policy) at the U;S. Department of Environment from 1970 to 1971, Professor for Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia in 1971, retired 1994, and is author of numerous scientific papers and books.
8. Are the Greens aware that leading American climatologist Prof. Dr. Judith Curry, Director of Georgia Tech Institute Geophysical and Atmospheric Sciences, was invited on November 17, 2010 to appear before the Congressional Energy and Environment subcommittee to testify as an expert and said: “Manmade climate change is a theory, where the basic mechanisms are well understood but because of the extent of climate change due to feedback processes, it is highly uncertain. (…) The conflict over the theory of man-made climate change is based on our lack of knowledge on natural variability”? Do the Greens regard this scientist, who has published 144 peer reviewed papers, received numerous awards and was publisher of the American Journal Society for Meteorology, as a “denier”? Or is the Green Faction ready to acknowledge that there is also much theory in the field of climatology, just like in every other area of science?
9. Is it your view that distinguishing between unserious, unscientific work and serious, scientific work is done solely by determining whether a work supports or opposes the political standards of the Green Party?
10. Do the Greens believe that it is just a lucky coincidence that no journalist has ever gotten the idea to check up on the scientific reputation of experts that are paid by the Greens?
11. What is the Greens’ position on the fact that your politics accompanies the extreme subsidies to solar and wind energy, bought by donations from, among others, IBC Solar AG, SMA Solar Technology AG, Ostwind, Umweltkontor Renewable Energy, EWO Energietechnologie GmbH, Conergy AG, Pro Vento, Nordex AG, Windpark G. W. Meerhof GmbH & Co. KG, Ersol AGder Windpark GmbH & Co. KG, Wind Project Development GmbH, Solarworld AG, SMA Technologie AG, Solon AG fir Solar Technology, AGU Energy and Electrotechnology GmbH?
12. In which renewable energy industries, which are highly subsidized by law, and to what extent, have Parliamentarians of the Green Faction invested, and thus guaranteed themselves a sure financial return at the consumers’ expense?
13. Do the Greens intend to continue their constant use of the expression “climate denier” thus directly implying “Holocaust deniers”? If yes, do the Greens intend to amend corpus delicti of sedition (§ 130 StGB), so that future statements on climate change can be punished if they fo not comply with the party line of ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS?
14. Will the Greens continue to use public money to encourage and incite others to commit of acts of crime, such as vandalizing rail tracks?
15. Will the Greens call protests at nuclear waste storage facilities only when they are in the opposition, and do the opposite when they are not?
16. Are the Greens aware of the point you’ve reached today when you have to be asked such questions?
Berlin, 30 November 2010
=======================================================
Lots of questions for the Greens to answer. We’re all holding our breaths!

"Four months on, 17-year-old Doha Khan says the school climate strikers have learned a lot. On Friday, thousands of primary and high school students are again planning to walk out of class across the country, protesting against the government’s inaction on climate change, and what they see as the destruction of their future.  Up to 50 rallies, in scores of regional towns, are planned for 15 March. This time, the students will be joined by others in America and Europe, in what has become a global movement. At the November protests, thousands took to the streets. In Canberra, they met Greens senators, Labor MPs and the independent MP Rebehka Sharkie. They were told by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to “go to school”, and by the resources minister, Matt Canavan, that they were “learning to join the dole queue”. More recently, the New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, told students to stay in class because “you can’t strike if you don’t have a job”. But the leaders of Friday’s strike say the movement has only grown, gained momentum, and become smarter. “We really did take into account a lot of the criticism that came out of last year,” says Khan, who goes to the Glenunga International high school in Adelaide. “There were claims that the kids were just striking and didn’t have any demands. So this time around we’ve made our demands a lot clearer. “We have them set out on all banners: stopping the Adani coalmine. No new fossil fuel projects, 100% renewables by 2030.” This year, the number of rally points has grown, mostly in regional areas. There are 18 in New South Wales alone – from Bowral to Byron Bay – and Khan feels enthusiasm has risen, rather than quietened down. “This time our response rate has doubled,” she says. “Last time, a week before the strike, we had 1,000 responses on Facebook. This week we are over 2,300. We are now getting a hundred responses a day. That’s pretty cool – and this is just the Adelaide strike.” Shellie Joseph, a year 12 student from St Patrick’s College in Gympie, Queensland, is one of those regional students joining the protest for the first time. “Last year, I was so busy with work and school and extra-curricular things, I just couldn’t do it,” she says. “But after I heard about the impact it had, I really regretted not getting involved. “As soon as I heard there was another one this year, I called [the Australian Youth Climate Council] and said ‘Look I’d love to be part of this and organise a bus down to Brisbane or something’. They said ‘Why don’t you organise one for the Sunshine Coast?’” She says what has happened is “a dream come true”. “The reason for me declining initially [last year] was that I live in such a rural area. I live in Gympie. I thought I would really be by myself. I thought, ‘What’s the point?’. “I was so wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by the support from all of my peers and people from different schools, parents and teachers. We’ve got over 900 going or interested on our Facebook event. “I think the misconception is that we are bludging. [That] we are having the day off school for something that isn’t that important. I think people need to understand the science of it a bit more. “At school at the moment I do all the science subjects. I’m really passionate about science and I’m passionate about facts and passionate about our future … We’ve been forced into this by our government’s inaction. We shouldn’t have to be doing this.” Khan says she is confident there will be a big turnout. “Just this week I put together a little Instagram chat with school strikers in my school,” she says. “There’s 40 kids, and they’re just the ones I know. I’m sure they are going to bring their own friends.”"
"Sharp and potentially devastating temperature rises of 3C to 5C in the Arctic are now inevitable even if the world succeeds in cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement, research has found. Winter temperatures at the north pole are likely to rise by at least 3C above pre-industrial levels by mid-century, and there could be further rises to between 5C and 9C above the recent average for the region, according to the UN. Such changes would result in rapidly melting ice and permafrost, leading to sea level rises and potentially to even more destructive levels of warming. Scientists fear Arctic heating could trigger a climate “tipping point” as melting permafrost releases the powerful greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere, which in turn could create a runaway warming effect. “What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic,” said Joyce Msuya, the acting executive director of UN Environment. “We have the science. Now more urgent climate action is needed to steer away from tipping points that could be even worse for our planet than we first thought.” The findings, presented at the UN Environment assembly in Nairobi on Wednesday, give a stark picture of one of the planet’s most sensitive regions and one that is key to the fate of the world’s climate. Last year’s stark warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, setting out the dramatic impacts of 1.5C of global warming, did not include the impacts of potential tipping points such as melting permafrost. If melting permafrost triggers a tipping point, the likely results would be global temperature rises well in excess of the 2C set as the limit of safety under the Paris agreement. Nearly half of Arctic permafrost could be lost even if global carbon emissions are held within the Paris agreement limits, according to the UN study. Even if all carbon emissions were to be halted immediately, the Arctic region would still warm by more than 5C by the century’s end, compared with the baseline average from 1986 to 2005, according to the study from UN Environment. That is because so much carbon has already been poured into the atmosphere. The oceans also have become vast stores of heat, the effect of which is being gradually revealed by changes at the poles and on global weather systems, and will continue to be felt for decades to come. The assembly heard that there was still a need to fulfil the aims of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change and to take further action that could stave off some of the worst effects of warming in the near term. “We need to make substantial near-term cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, black carbon and other so-called short-lived climate pollutants all over the world,” said Kimmo Tiilikainen, Finland’s environment minister. Making drastic cuts to black carbon and short-lived pollutants such as methane could reduce warming by more than 0.5C, according to previous research."
"It’s been a while since we saw images of smog-obscured Beijing landmarks in the news. A United Nations report explains this. In four years, sulphur dioxide in the city was reduced by 70% and particle pollution by 36% by tackling the problem at source. Initially, old coal-powered industry and power stations were fitted with air pollution abatement systems before being replaced by cleaner facilities built to run on natural gas.  Cleaner road fuels, scrapping old vehicles and reducing solid fuel home heating helped too; all from an investment programme that reached 18bn yuan per year (£2bn) in 2017. But China’s efforts have not stopped there. Particle pollution in the 62 Chinese cities tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) dropped by an average of 30% between 2013 and 2016. Beijing still has a long way to go to comply with WHO guidelines. Tackling the remaining air pollution requires new, smarter policies but the Chinese example shows what can be achieved with sufficient political will. In the UK, progress has been slower. Air pollution from traffic alongside some London roads worsened between 2010 and 2016. This underlines the need for stronger action such as the new ultra-low emission zone."
"It was a very long list. When we first considered the idea of a new investigative series looking at Australia’s less-scrutinised environmental issues, we knew we had to speak to those on the frontline. We discussed the idea with Australia’s top scientists and environmentalists and it became clear there were many issues needing urgent attention.  They were deeply worried about our fragile environment – our rivers, oceans, forests, flora and fauna were in trouble. When we launched Our wide brown land, this list of environmental concerns seemed to grow.  More animal and plant species than ever are under threat with little attention from those in power, native flora and fauna continue to be threatened by invasive species and our commitment to protecting the land through national parks is waning. We are in midst of a land-clearing crisis, the hard fought for forestry agreements are under threat, and, as highlighted by the recent fish kills, and communities running out of water, the Murray-Darling basin plan is falling apart. And Australia’s environmental protections are shrinking. There was more. The emissions reduction fund, which was set up to help cut greenhouse gases, has been used to upgrade fossil-fuelled power plants or to pay for cuts that would have happened anyway, while the increase in natural gas production means these emissions will cancel out any recent savings anyway. The recycling crisis has deepened and a lack of funding is stymying solutions, but plastic is now so ubiquitous it has been found in ocean floor sediment in one of Australia’s most isolated marine environments. Plus we’re lagging behind the rest of the world in the switch to electric cars. Fortunately there were also a few bright spots: Port Augusta, a former coal mining town, is leading the way in Australia with a raft of renewable energy projects. And citizen scientists are increasingly lending a hand to collect data for underfunded research projects. Our reporting helped to shape the debate. Some of the highlights include environment reporter Lisa Cox’s work on the questionable use of government funding earmarked for threatened species, which led to the launch of a national Senate inquiry. The issue was also raised during Senate estimates and forced the environment department and government to correct its record on threatened species spending. It has led to calls from scientists, environment groups and volunteers for an overhaul of Australia’s environment laws. Our articles on the renewal of the regional forest agreements caused a stir, and New South Wales Labor refused to sign off on the proposed extensions to the NSW RFAs because the government “knows the science underpinning the RFAs is out of date and incomplete”. And our extensive coverage of the crisis in the Murray-Darling basin plan helped to speed up the implementation of the royal commission. The team of journalists who worked on this section of our series won a 2018 UN day media award for the promotion of climate action. Yet clearly more work needs to be done. Only by highlighting these issues will they get the attention they deserve. So now we need to turn the spotlight on the growing climate crisis and its devastating impacts – some seen, some unfolding out of sight. This is why we are launching a new investigative series: The Frontline: Australia and the climate emergency. And once again we need your help to support our journalism and continue to raise awareness of these issues that we know you care so deeply about. If you would like to send us an idea, email us at thefrontline@theguardian.com."
"The veteran weatherman Bill Giles is calling on the BBC and other major broadcasters to radically overhaul their forecasts to incorporate information about climate change. The former head of BBC weather presenters has said more needs to be done by broadcasters to highlight climate change to face the “reality more squarely and openly”.  Giles, who presented weather forecasts at the corporation for nearly two decades, is urging TV channels to come up with a “radical approach to keep viewers properly informed”. In a piece for Radio Times, Giles, 79, writes: “The hourly forecasts that we now see do an excellent job in giving us the likely weather events over the coming few days, and this must continue. But to properly explain the underlying changes to climate they will need to look much further afield at the weather across the world, reporting and analysing extremes on a daily basis. “So I am calling on the BBC and the other major broadcasters to incorporate an additional five- to 10-minute slot into the forecast that focuses properly and honestly on the Earth’s changing climate. “This climate change slot should air at least once a week and would use our technical ability to show weather everywhere in the world to explain in clear, ‘non-jargony’ or technical terms the reasons why our climate is changing – largely due to human influences – and the effects of this on us and all other animals.” The forecaster, who says he has been highlighting the effects of climate change since the 1980s, warns: “If our mathematics are correct, then a 2C change will mean that the London summer climate in 2050 would be similar to that of southern France of today – and by 2100 similar to that of Athens.” A BBC spokesman said: “BBC Weather is already looking at climate change very carefully to see how we can communicate its impacts, particularly on extreme weather events both in the UK and around the world.” Asked whether it backed Giles’s calls, the Met Office said it “welcomes any opportunities to raise awareness and promote the science of climate change”. A spokesman added: “As our climate changes, so will the weather we experience on a day to day basis. Working with the media to increase understanding of the science behind how the likelihood of heatwaves, floods or storms may change in the future should be welcomed.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitter[Update: 6 July – The SZ has reposted its story]The left of centre German online Sueddeutsche Zeitung had, for a very short time, a quite inconvenient piece up today called, in English: News On Nature’s Respiration, which reported on findings just out from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemicals in Jena, Germany, on the earth’s CO2 cycle and possible future impacts.
Mysteriously, the SZ suddenly ripped it down from its website! Google provides the link if you punch in the original German title “Neues vom Atem der Natur“. Other news sites link to the original SZ report as well, e.g. here and here.
The SZ reported that scientists had collected and evaluated data from 60 measuring towers located in many countries and various ecosystems and presented their findings in Turin, Italy today.
The scientists determined that plants absorb 450 billion metric tonnes of CO2 through photosynthesis each year, or about one seventh of the total amount in the atmosphere. Almost 60% is absorbed by forests and savannahs in the tropics, 11% by fields for food crops.
Humans, by contrast, emit about 36 billion tonnes through their activities, of which the majority gets absorbed by the oceans and atmosphere.
And every year almost the entire 450 billion tonnes gets released by the plants through falling foliage, decay, etc.
According to the now-disappeared SZ report, researchers led by the Max Planck Institute calculated how much the amount of CO2 released would change if the temperature changed. According to the researchers, a warming of 10°C would increase the emission by 40%. According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung report:
That is considerably less than what was often assumed earlier. Earlier a doubling or a quadrupling was often discussed. And apparently this low factor applies for everything from the frozen tundra to the tropical rainforests.
The researchers of the Max Planck Institute concluded:
This dampens the fears that global warming could accelerate from more CO2 being released by savannahs and rainforests with every degree of warming.  This means that so far nature is absorbing a part of manmade CO2 year for year and stores it, thus buffering the climate effect.

Dr. Markus Reichstein of the Max Planck Institute is quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung:
Especially alarmist scenarios for feedbacks from global warming and ecosystem respiration are shown to be unrealistic.
These feedback effects were not at all accounted for in the 2007 IPCC-Report.
I’ve tried to find the findings from the Max Planck Institute at their website, but haven’t been succesful yet. I think it’s very strange the SZ report would be up for about an hour, and then taken down. Someone probably didn’t like what it said.
UPDATE: I sent an e-mail to Dr Reichstein, who was indeed very kind to reply – and provided the following explanation:
Dear Mr Gosselin,
thanks for your interest in the topic. A simple web search however reveals that you are not “just a private reader with an interest” – rather you seem to have established a blog “NoTricksZone”, or is it someone else with the same name.
In any a as matter of fact let me just state that indeed the SZ published the article – probably accidentally – before the embargo for such publication lifted (the embargo will lift at midnight tonight). Hence the article was removed temporarily. That is all.
Best regards,
Markus Reichstein
Well, I am just a private citizen doing this blog for fun as a hobby. I’m not funded by anyone except myself. In any case, could be interesting to see if anything has been sanitised. We’ll see in 75 minutes.
UPDATE 2: Embargo has been lifted, the story has been reposted. As far as I can tell, it does not deviate from anything I’ve written. – P Gosselin

"Hundreds of thousands of children are expected to walk out of their classrooms on Friday for a global climate strike amid growing anger at the failure of politicians to tackle the escalating ecological crisis. Children at tens of thousands of schools in more than 100 countries are due to take part in the walkouts which began last year when one teenager – Greta Thunberg – held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Since then the climate movement has snowballed with schoolchildren on every continent except Antarctica taking part. Friday’s strike is expected to be the biggest yet as evidence mounts of the climate emergency facing the planet. Amnesty International has warned that the failure of world governments to tackle the crisis could amount to “one of the greatest intergenerational human rights violations in history”. Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said: “It’s unfortunate that children have to sacrifice days of learning in school to demand that adults do the right thing. However, they know the consequences of the current shameful inaction both for themselves and future generations. This should be a moment for stark self-reflection by our political class.” Young people are expected to take to the streets in cities across Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the US on Friday. In the UK more than 10,000 children walked out of class last month and organisers expect Friday’s event to be even bigger with about 100 events taking place involving thousands of schools across the country. Anna Taylor, 17, who co-founded the UK student climate network, said: “Young people in the UK have shown that we’re angry at the lack of government leadership on climate change. “Those in power are not only betraying us, and taking away our future, but are responsible for the climate crisis that’s unfolding in horrendous ways around the world.” Taylor said the UK had been relatively shielded from the effects of the crisis so far, adding that “those least responsible for contributing to climate change are already suffering the worst effects”. She added: “It is our duty to not only act for those in the UK and our futures, but for everyone. That’s what climate justice means.” In Scotland, the Guardian is aware of strikes planned in 19 different locations, from South Uist in the Outer Hebrides to St Andrews on the east coast, with large gatherings expected in Glasgow’s George Square and outside the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. One of the UK’s most prominent school strikers, Holly Gillibrand, will be taking part, after staging a weekly action outside her school in Fort William, in the Scottish Highlands.  “It’s going to be quite impressive,” said Gillibrand of the School Strike for Climate movement, “and it’s incredibly inspiring that it all started with Greta striking on her own”. Asked whether she feels optimistic about the potential of Friday’s protest, Gillibrand replied: “I wouldn’t say optimistic is quite the right word. It shows there are thousands of students out there who care very deeply about the environment and are willing to miss school to demand that politicians take this ecological crisis seriously.” World leaders may listen to the school pupils taking part in one of the largest global climate change protests ever, but the key test is whether they take action, said the 13-year-old. According to the Scottish Green party, nine councils – which cover 16 of the 21 Scottish locations understood to have schoolchildren involved in protests – have indicated in response to letters from their MSPs that they will not pursue punitive action against young people taking part. Méabh Mackenzie is organising a protest with about 30 fellow pupils from Daliburgh primary school on the island of South Uist, with the express purpose of standing in solidarity with other threatened island communities across the globe. The 11-year-old explained: “I just wanted to share what I believe in. Uist is really low lying and I really love the place and don’t want it to disappear.” Some friends are “not into it at all”, she suspects because they do not want to go out in the cold – the forecast is for hail on Friday. “I think all the striking around the world will let politicians and lawmakers know that they have to do something because it is falling down the list of priorities. They are arguing about things like Brexit but we need them to act now on climate change. because in 12 years we can’t turn anything back.” In Belgium, thousands of workers will be striking to join the school students’ protest in locations such as Antwerp, Bruges and Liège, before travelling to Brussels for a large demonstration. Blue- and white-collar workers are being mobilised across the Flemish-Francophone divide, after an appeal from the Youth For Climate campaign, which has organised weekly demonstrations of up to 35,000 youths since January. Gina Heyrman, a spokeswoman for the 1.6 million-strong socialist trades union ABVV-FGTB, noted “similarities” with the Paris protests of 1968. She said: “This is the first time we have had a political strike together with young people. Maybe we’re at the beginning of a new era. I hope so. Everyone talks about the climate now. Everyone is aware of it, thanks to the students.” The rival CSC Christian trade union is also planning a “massive mobilisation”, although some of its workers cannot strike because of a strike notification law. The CFDT union in France is also calling for every member to participate in Friday’s climate action. Earlier this year Thunberg, who started the movement, told a gathering of political leaders and billionaire entrepreneurs in Davos: “I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.”"

"As soon as Blythe Pepino got together with her partner Joshua two years ago, she felt “this overwhelming urge to create a family with him”, she says. “I think it was the fifth day after having met him, I said: ‘I’ve got to meet your parents.’ He was like: ‘You’re mad.’” Then, late last year, she attended a lecture held by the direct action group Extinction Rebellion, which set out starkly the catastrophic reality of the changing climate. That galvanised Pepino, an activist and musician (she is the former singer of Vaults, now Mesadorm), to do research of her own and, eventually, to have a series of sad conversations with Joshua. “I realised that even though I wanted to have a family at that point, I couldn’t really bring myself to do it,” she says. “I had to say to him: ‘I don’t know if I can do this, considering what we know – if there isn’t a political will to fix this, we really don’t stand much of a chance.’” Pepino, who turns 33 today, found that other women – especially those in climate-conscious circles – were struggling with the same question, but were “too afraid to talk about it” for fear of judgment or ridicule. The US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave voice to their concerns last month, pointing to the increasingly dire scientific consensus and widespread government inaction: “It does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK still to have children?” And so Pepino decided to publicly announce her decision – strategically making the personal political – by setting up BirthStrike, a voluntary organisation for women and men who have decided not to have children in response to the coming “climate breakdown and civilisation collapse”. In doing so, she hopes to channel the grief she feels about her decision “into something more active and regenerative and hopeful”. In just two weeks, 140 people, mostly women in the UK, have declared their “decision not to bear children due to the severity of the ecological crisis”, says Pepino. “But we have also had people get in touch to say: ‘Thank you for speaking out about something that I didn’t feel I could even talk to my family about,’” she adds. Many of these BirthStrikers are involved with Extinction Rebellion, which on Saturday threw buckets of red paint outside Downing Street to symbolise “the death of our children” from climate change. Pepino says that BirthStrike is distinct from the antinatalist movement (which says that having children is morally wrong because sentient life is so awful), and its aim is not to discourage people from having children, or to condemn those who have them already, but to communicate the urgency of the crisis. It is a “radical acknowledgment” of how the looming existential threat is already “altering the way we imagine our future”. “We’re not trying to solve it through BirthStrike,” she says. “We’re trying to get the information out there.” In fact, she says, population reduction has been shown to be an ineffective strategy. A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA explored various scenarios for global human population change by adjusting fertility and mortality rates. It found that even imposing one-child policies worldwide and “catastrophic mortality events” would not significantly reduce the global population by 2100. It proposes instead that “more immediate results for sustainability would emerge from policies and technologies that reverse rising consumption of natural resources”. “Even with drastic, draconian, eugenic policies of population reduction – which are completely immoral,” says Pepino, “we wouldn’t save ourselves. We have to change the way we live.” A different 2017 study did find that having one fewer child was the most effective way a person could cut their own carbon emissions – but there is damning evidence that the crisis is well past the point of being able to be mitigated by the choices of individuals. Hannah Scott, 23, works for an environmental charity. She says that even climate activists are in denial about the gravity of the situation, with her own BirthStrike eliciting responses such as “maybe it won’t be so extreme and apocalyptic” and “life is about having children”. She believes it is already too late to claw back the damage done. “That’s why I am not having one – because I feel so desperately that it would be bringing a life into a future that does seem ever more desolate. Every time a friend tells me they’re pregnant, or planning on having children, I have to bite my tongue.” BirthStrike, she says, “is about saying: ‘It is OK to make this choice, but it’s not OK to have to make this choice.’ We should never be in a situation where we are genuinely scared to bring life into the world.”  BirthStrike is as much a support group as it is a political statement, says spokeswoman Alice Brown, a 25-year-old charitable campaigns manager from Bristol. As a former nanny and support worker, having children of her own had been on Brown’s “to-do list for life” until one of the girls she used to care for developed allergies which, Brown says, was as a result of pollution. Her decision was cemented with last month’s report on the “catastrophic” impact of plummeting insect numbers, and the increasingly “panicked, emergency language” of the scientific community. “We are hurtling towards disaster, and if I can bring awareness to the situation by sharing this personal choice that I’ve made, I’m willing to do it. It is sort of desperation. I don’t know if I’ll regret being so public about it one day.” Brown is especially concerned about the potential toll her decision may have on her relationship, which she is reluctant to speak about beyond confirming that – were it not for the state of the planet – children would likely have been part of the conversation. She is keen to adopt, but worries that the option may be removed from her: she was arrested last year for civil disobedience for spraying chalk paint on the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy during a protest with Extinction Rebellion. “I hate telling people that, it sounds so childish,” she says, but she worries that further direct action campaigns could land her with a criminal record. “I’m just so terrified of what my child will be facing when they are my age,” she says. “It’s not just about the ideology – will they be born into a world where things are fair, where things are safer – it’s the practical side of it: will they actually be in survival mode?” There are infinite unknowns about the future, Brown agrees. She is reading the US journalist David Wallace-Wells’s apocalyptic page-turner The Uninhabitable Earth, which explores many of them – but none, she says, have persuaded her that it would be right to have a child of her own. “I understand many people may think it’s a strange response. Someone said to me the other day: ‘People still have children in war zones.’ I can only say that it is totally personal and probably no one – certainly not me – is qualified to decide what would make it worthwhile and what wouldn’t.” But it was nonetheless a relief, she says, when Ocasio-Cortez said it was “legitimate” for millennials to consider not having children because of the state of the earth. “It makes me feel more confident and maybe more legitimate in what I’m talking about – that somebody who is in the public eye, who is taking the crisis as seriously as it should be taken, is saying the same thing.” Yet Wallace-Wells, whose book begins “It is worse, much worse, than you think”, goes on to write about the birth of his daughter. In interviews, he has said that he wanted to have children “for reasons independent of climate … Most people do. I don’t think this is an impulse we need to disavow before we have finished the final act of this story. I think it is a reason to fight.” If calamity proves a catalyst for change, “the greatest story ever told … may well have a happy ending”, he concludes in The Uninhabitable Future. The 10,000 young people in the UK alone who went on strike from school over climate last month and activists such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg suggest his daughter’s generation may play a pivotal role. Pepino, at least, takes a similarly optimistic view of BirthStrikers’ approach. It is, she says, “in a sense a very hopeful act. We’re not just making this decision, hiding it and giving it up. We’re politicising that decision – and hoping that will give us the chance to change our minds.”"
"The world is slaughtered by walls. Our walls aren’t made of stone, but constructed from something different. February saw record-high winter temperatures in the UK, defined by the burning of Saddleworth Moor and our supposed leaders truanting during the first climate change debate in two years. Juxtaposing these events reveals this country’s moral blindspot. While we still give airtime to climate deniers and delayers, fuelling debate as though the concrete causes of climate change are no longer based in science, we fail to stare at the real wounds festering around us.  We built walls around our empire, constructed out of colonialism, exploitation and imperial greed, with little regard for the enclosures we created. But history is permeable. It isn’t bound to classrooms, but something we are exposed to every day. We absorb the global narrative our country refuses to recognise, through the shared lives of activists, environmentalists and anyone with a phone and a voice. This narrative is composed from interweaving stories, the voices of a movement unrestricted by walls. Through this lens we are able to reshape our history, but only by first addressing our present. To remain ignorant is to remain immune to blame. It creates disconnection. This is why we need climate justice. There is a reason why teenagers and children have been chanting, “System change, not climate change”. The system is fundamentally at fault, and our leaders fail to recognise that. They are trapped behind yet another wall of their own construction. It prevents them from seeing the connection between our actions and their leadership. The Youth Strike 4 Climate movement isn’t just unprecedented, it’s also reforging fractured connections. Going across borders, trespassing upon political nuance laid out by generations before us, young people from around the world are weaving a new social fabric in which climate justice is our connecting force – a sledgehammer to the walls around us. Connections like these form as we reclaim our social media spaces. By building platforms for young activists to share their stories – whether they be of those living among cyclones in the Pacific or political danger in Brazil – the internet can be restored as a place for unfiltered intimacy with things that matter, revealing the reality of climate change for those living it. And, in creating a social network based on the values of internationalism and solidarity, we subvert the system of competition and separation permeating our lives. In ant colonies, large populations are sustained through the interactions between individual ants. There is little centralised authority in the most resilient colonies. On social media, teenagers have also been swept up in self-organisation, spreading their message from group to group, country to country, with the only central authority being the collective fear we all share. We are redefining political space and challenging the idea that social media platforms are only uncontrollable forces beyond our control. Instead, we’re creating tools to change the world, but on our own terms. As the power of far-right groups grows online, the digital presence of the Youth Strikes campaign fosters a sense of community that is more like systems of interdependence in the natural world than the walled enclosure of traditional politics. The self-organising power of the strikes and our closeness to others miles from us provides a new alternative. We’re not separate from each other and we are not separate from nature. We need those in power to act with urgency and new ideas, but we also implore them to address the causes of the crisis. In order to truly repair the climate, we must recognise the system of inequality that has caused its collapse. Britain, while it might not be the biggest carbon emitter in the world, has a responsibility to act, given its historical role in creating the crisis we find ourselves in. Our society is built on the coal-fuelled industrial revolution; we now export our consumerist emissions abroad while providing lines of credit and finance to the destructive industries ravaging through other lands. Our economic model is parasitic, with little regard for people or the planet. Competition, consumerism and separation fundamentally disrupt the patterns of nature. They are the causes of its impending collapse. Until we recognise our role in climate justice, we will be forever controlled by these forces. Our governments must look to the Youth Strike movement to learn a new way forward. Our movement is fuelled not only by anger, passion, fear and intelligence, but also by a deep understanding of the connectivity of all humans – and humanity’s relationship with the planet. In breaking down the walls of communication, new voices have emerged to define a politics for the future.

"There will be another large-scale school climate strike tomorrow, following a controversial walkout by pupils last month. I say controversial; the reaction in much of the grownup media was perhaps better described as a reluctant obligation to be adult about the whole thing, while secretly cheering them on. Even prominent Conservatives struggled to feign disapproval of this wanton act of civic engagement by the next generation. Energy minister Claire Perry wistfully told the BBC she would have joined the walkouts in her younger years. She may take a different line if the kids keep it up – it is, after all, her department they are protesting against. To my surprise, the most ardent voices of dissent have come from educators. In opposing the protests, education reformers such as Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, and Toby Young, the free schools evangelist, seem to have missed the point of efforts over the past decade to raise education standards. For what does excellence in education look like if it’s not pupils being engaged enough on issues such as climate change to do something about them? Rather than calling schoolchildren truants when they show up for society in a way that puts the rest of us to shame – we should be using the strikes as a measure of school performance. In my book, any secondary school that doesn’t have pupils informed enough to join the protests is underachieving. Perhaps that sounds like irresponsible, progressive nonsense. But it is fully in line with the education policies that those opposing the strikes have spent the last decade championing in schools. Under this government, the Department for Education has been zealous about the importance of promoting “character” in schools. This is the idea that, alongside formal learning, schoolchildren need to be developing traits such as courage, resilience, and determination in order to thrive in adult life. In lockstep with this agenda, the education sector has been near universal in its support over the past six years of a government-backed campaign to promote social action in schools as a way of building these traits and skills. Educators had it right then. Social action – practical action to achieve social change – is shown to have a huge range of educational benefits for children who take part from a young age. It cultivates skills that are highly sought after by employers and aids wellbeing, while tapping into the natural motivations of young people, who care about social issues more than any other generation. This is why any truly responsible teacher out there should be supporting and encouraging their pupils to walk out of school. It is a golden learning opportunity – for the whole school, on an issue that can be drawn into subject teaching. The real problem with the climate strike is not a conflict between education and campaigning. Schools have been doing campaigns for decades. The problem is that this time, the children mean it – and this time, they’re doing it on their own terms. You see, politicians and grownups love the idea of young people being “active citizens” – as long as it is in a way that is obedient and upholds the status quo. Get your Duke of Edinburgh award. Pick up some litter. Do it at the weekend. What they can’t stomach is the idea that schoolchildren should have real power and agency on the issues they care about. Greta Thunberg, who instigated the climate strikes, is 16 years old. Yet she has more acumen and conviction than the entire generation of adults who are supposed to be educating her. This is not how power is supposed to work. But she is not an outlier. As the director of Generation Change, I have seen primary school pupils as young as five and six debate the refugee crisis before deciding how they make a difference. I’ve seen teenagers on programmes such as Envision and City Year tackle social problems that politicians from all parties have failed to solve for decades. This is what education can look like when we don’t have such pitifully low expectations about the role young people can play in society. In an age where children and teenagers have the same tools of achieving change as the rest of us, we will continue to see them take up power on the big issues of our time. This leave us with a choice. We can either redesign education so that change-making is a normal part of growing up; or we can keep pushing young people to the sidelines of society and hope they’ll leave things to the grownups. Given the state of the world today, why on earth would we want that? • David Reed is director of Generation Change, a charity that promotes youth social action in the UK"
"A relief teacher at a New South Wales high school, who is also a Greens candidate, is being investigated by the Department of Education over remarks made at a candidates’ forum about the upcoming student climate strike. Will Douglas, who has worked casually at Moruya high school on the state’s south coast since 2006, has been told he will not be offered any more shifts at the school while the investigation takes place.  It comes as the principal of a Victorian Catholic school warned students that striking was an “unapproved” absence that could lead to a zero if they missed any official tests on the day. Inspired by Swedish student Greta Thunberg, the movement calls on students to partially strike from school to protest government inaction on fighting climate change. More than 50 rallies, in Australian capital cities and regional towns, are planned for 15 March. Douglas, who is contesting the seat of Bega in the upcoming state election, appeared at a lunchtime candidates’ forum organised by Youth Action at the Moruya golf club last Thursday, alongside local Liberal MP Andrew Constance and Labor candidate Leanne Atkinson. Douglas said he attended the forum with the knowledge of his superiors at the school. During the forum, which was attended by students from a range of high schools, Douglas said “please don’t forget March 15 the climate strike … if there’s something happening at your school will you please get online and register because there’s a whole community out there wanting to support you guys, young people, in that strike”. The remarks were published in News Corp’s Daily Telegraph on Monday, in an article that also revealed a complaint had been made to the department and that an investigation was under way. Douglas told Guardian Australia he had no knowledge of any investigation until contacted by the newspaper and he did not know who had made the complaint. He said the principal told him this week he would not be working any more shifts at the school until the investigation was complete. “I was speaking on my own time in my lunch break as a Greens candidate at a youth forum,” he said. “Now I don’t have any work. It shouldn’t be this hard to speak up for climate action.” Douglas said Moruya high was a wonderful school, and that he had been treated with nothing but respect by the principal. However he believed the complaint itself was “politically motivated”. A spokeswoman for the department said they were making inquiries into the matter but that it would be inappropriate to comment on the employment status of an individual teacher. “While the department understands students may be passionate about a range of issues, all students who are enrolled at school are expected to attend that school whenever instruction is provided,” she said.  “Staff members providing advice contrary to departmental policies may be subject to allegations of misconduct.” Meanwhile in Victoria, the principal of Catholic girls school Siena College sent a letter to students and parents last week warning that striking students could receive a zero if they missed official tests and assignments on the day. “We acknowledge the students’ right to give voice to their very genuine concerns regarding the federal government’s record on climate change,” the principal, Gaynor Robson-Garth wrote. “Attendance at the strike will however be an ‘unapproved’ absence from school. If a student chooses to participate in the strike, VCE school-assessed coursework and other assessment tasks will be recorded as not assessed (NA) and no alternative opportunity will be provided to complete any missed assessments. “The decision to participate in the strike is entirely a decision for parents and students. The strike is not endorsed by the college.” Last November, thousands of Australian students walked out of school to attend rallies across the country. Since then, strikes have been organised in the UK and the United States, and 15 March has been billed as a global day of action, with further strikes organised for the US and Europe on the same day. In February, the NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, told students that they “should be at school” on the day. Student Doha Khan from Adelaide told Guardian Australia on Monday the students had three demands: stopping the Adani coalmine, no new fossil fuel projects and 100% renewables by 2030."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s another from the “do as I say, and not as I do” hypocrites department. It’s World Cup time in South Africa and the world’s biggest sporting event is attracting the world’s biggest names (and environmentalists). 
The Financial Times has a report here on air traffic congestion caused by too many private jets flying to and from Durban, South Africa, all thanks in large part to celebrities and leaders; some of whom are well-known for environmental activism. Angela Merkel for example made the flight from Germany to South Africa to watch Germany’s quarterfinal game. Bill Clinton attended some USA matches.
But Leonardo DiCaprio emerges as the World Cup champion hypocrite. Enviro-Dicaprio thinks its okay to jet-set between his mansions, sporting events and Las Vegas nightclubs with Paris Hilton, after making his bust enviro-drama documentary, which admonishes the rest of the world to live more modestly.
Can you see the solar panels? Well, neither can I. 
Indeed, congestion caused by the environmentally destructive private jet traffic in Durban got so bad that it caused additional environmentally destructive rerouting of commercial jets. According to the Financial Times: 
The situation was described as “absolute chaos” by the pilot of one British Airways flight which took off from Cape Town in mid-afternoon but was diverted to Johannesburg.

The BA pilot added: 
…that the problem was caused by the airport allowing too many private jets to land at Durban, leaving the runways clogged up and unable to accept scheduled flights. 
The BA pilot also 
…told passengers he had no choice but to take the plane to Johannesburg because the plane’s fuel was starting to run low. 
Flights had to be rerouted to Johannesburg so as not to interfere with the travelling celebrities. 
The baggage hall at OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg was filled with scores of angry fans, some of whom said they had spent up to R10,000 ($1,300) for their semi final tickets.

"It is no surprise that the government’s strategy on fracking has been deemed unlawful (Fracking guidance illegally ignores climate change, 7 March). Gas may be more fuel efficient than coal when burnt, but shale gas is 95% methane, and methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. According to the IPCC it has a global warming potential (GWP) 85 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. Misleadingly, HMG have relied on an obsolete figure of 36 for the GWP of methane, dating back to 2013. Methane levels plateaued in the late 1990s, but have started to increase again over the past decade and have now reached 1,900 parts per billion, against a pre-industrial level of 700. Fracking is the obvious culprit. Satellite data over the US has shown that methane leakage exceeds 5% of shale gas production, an observation that fits with more recent studies by Nasa showing that fossil fuels are the major contributor to the continuing rise in atmospheric methane.  Despite this evidence, the government’s energy strategy is to forge ahead with fracking while reducing environmental safeguards and providing tax incentives for its development. The government claim that gas is better than coal from a climate change perspective is only sustainable if fugitive emissions of methane are ignored. Let us hope that the high court judgment means that fracking will be abandoned in the UK as it has been elsewhere in Europe.Dr Robin Russell-Jones Scientific adviser to the all-party parliamentary group on air pollution (APPG) Geraint Davies MP Chair, APPG • Although I agree that climate change needs to be tackled, it is too simplistic for the Committee on Climate Change to suggest not connecting all new-build schemes to the gas grid from 2025 (Call for ban on gas hobs and boilers in new homes by 2025, 21 February). If the committee gets its way and all new builds are off-gas, then electricity for solutions such as heat pumps still needs to come from somewhere. Unless the electricity comes from a zero-carbon source, it defeats the object. If the whole of the country came off gas, we would need the power of about 30 nuclear power stations, and currently we have eight! Also, if we do switch to hydrogen gas then these homes without a gas connection could not be connected in the future and would miss the other benefits that hydrogen gas could deliver such as carbon-free cooking. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has already acknowledged that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the decarbonisation of heating. Instead, different solutions should be working together. A hybrid system that uses a heat pump up to a certain temperature, which is then supported by a gas boiler, would be very effective not only in new build but many existing homes as well. Carbon emissions will be even lower if the gas boiler is run on hydrogen gas. Instead of advocating for unreasonable promises from government, the CCC should be supporting the research that is already under way into new “no carbon fuels”. I’d even like to extend an invitation to the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, to a prototype demonstration we have planned later in the year, where we will show how a 100% hydrogen boiler will run.Carl Arntzen CEO, Worcester Bosch Group; chairman, the Domestic Heat Strategy Group  • Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change. Jason Hickel suggests that the solution is “about changing the way our economy operates” (Climate breakdown is coming. The UK needs a Greener New Deal, theguardian.com, 5 March). Encouragingly, the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre[1] shows that attempting to achieve the socio-economic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation. The research team tested three other scenarios and the only one that met all goals was the one that implemented systemic transformational change. A key element in the model was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income. We have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us – with little choice but to engage.Stephen Martin Visiting professor, University of West of England Stephen Sterling Emeritus professor of sustainability education, Plymouth University • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) features an interview here with think-tank director and top German climate advisor Dr. Oliver Geden, who has of late become Germany’s latest enfant terrible for climate activists.
Geden, a true warmist, has become exasperated by the approach used by policymakers in curbing CO2 emissions, and views goals like the 2°C target as pie-in-the-sky and counter-productive.
The FAZ asks Geden if Warsaw was a success. His answer:
No. It was a failure, even when measured by the lowest expectations.”
Geden believes the winners of the conference were the USA, India, and China “because they have succeeded in anchoring a system where every state can decide itself what it is ready to contribute“. Sovereignty sure sucks.
Among the losers he sees the EU at the head of the pack, and developing countries, who were counting on huge monetary transfers. Overall Geden believes that 2°C (450 ppm) target was a naïve goal and was doomed to fail from the start. He says that “The global emissions have risen dramatically since the beginning of the UN climate negotiations“. Moreover, rich industrial countries won’t fulfill their promises to pay poor countries, Geden asserts.

Geden also sees the chances of a meaningful international climate contract getting signed in 2015 as very slim. He says that countries within the EU are “hopelessly in disagreement” when it comes to the climate targets for 2030 and that Eastern European countries are no longer interested in taking on a leadership position on the climate issue.
He also mentions that Germany is not going to convince anyone as the country “will clearly miss its 40 percent reduction by 2040 target“. Geden adds:
In 2013 German emissions will in fact rise for the second year in a row.”
“2°C Target can still be reached!”
With a performance like that, it’s going to be awfully tough for Germany to be taken seriously as an example for the rest of the world. The FAZ then asks Geden if he thinks the 2°C target is now off the table for good. Geden sees the 2°C target as “in fact failed”. He concludes:
As nobody knows on how things are to proceed after that, we will be seeing still many more studies that will ‘verify’ that the 2°C still can be reached, even if only under the most absurd assumptions, like through ‘negative emissions’ in the second half of the century.”

"There are other things around which Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, could craft his stump speech. He could talk about how he dropped out of Stanford and moved into his parents’ basement because he couldn’t afford tuition. He could tell voters he was the first governor to challenge Donald Trump’s Muslim travel ban.  These things are mentioned when he talks to voters as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. But from its announcement at a Seattle solar panel installation company, his campaign has remained laser-focused on fighting climate change. The 68-year-old says climate change is the reason he is running for president and he speaks of it as an imminent threat to the US and the world. Other issues matter but Inslee says America cannot afford to have another leader who does not have climate change as their top priority. “We have exactly one chance left to defeat climate change – and that’s during the next administration,” he told a crowd in a living room in Bedford on Saturday morning. “And when you have one chance at survival, we ought to take it.” Climate change is not a fringe issue in the Democratic party. While other candidates may not devote the majority of their speeches to it, they all speak of it as an urgent if not existential issue that must be tackled in the next administration. Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke has compared those fighting climate change to the troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy and warned Iowa voters that the planet has just 12 years left to avert disaster. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro has said his first executive order will be to return the US to the Paris climate accord. When New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced her Green New Deal legislation, many candidates lined up to support it. Inslee says climate change cannot just be a box to be ticked – that if climate change is not the top priority, nothing will be done. “I wonder the difference between talk and action,” he said on Saturday. “Between bumper stickers and productive accomplishments. It can’t be just one of those things on your to-do list. It has to be a full-scale, full-throated commitment to get this job done.” Asked by the Guardian if the election of another Democrat would mean the US would miss its “one chance” to fight climate change, he said: “If it’s not job one, it won’t get done. And I’m the only candidate that’s saying that right now.” In his pitch to voters, Inslee leans heavily on his experience as governor, painting himself as a man who knows how to lead and who has overseen an economic boom and environmental reform. “I’ve been a governor,” he told a crowd at a town hall meeting in Exeter, later on Saturday. “And I’ve actually got things done instead of just talking about it. I’ve learned that getting things done is different than giving speeches. What I’ve learned is that executive experience is something that is really important when it comes to getting things done.” Inslee says fighting climate change offers economic promise, that clean energy will create millions of jobs. In Bedford, he told voters the “vast bulk” of money invested in clean energy will come from private equity markets, not taxpayers. “What we need to do is embrace policies that will help drive private equity into these industries,” he said. Such investment and job creation is already happening in Washington state, he said, as it pushes towards clean energy. Inslee has not just set himself apart from other Democrats by being a single-issue candidate. He has also broken ranks on a hot-button congressional issue. To successfully fight climate change, Inslee says, the Senate must eliminate the filibuster, which allows senators to require a 60-vote supermajority to pass legislation. He says the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has turned it into a “weaponised system to prevent progressive change”. Other candidates have either declined to endorse instituting the nuclear option or have said they oppose it. Furthermore, as candidates have largely patted one another on the back so far, even when they disagree on policies, without naming names Inslee has appeared to suggest some of his competitors’ commitments to combating climate change will not result in action. He also breaks with other candidates in his willingness to accept money from Super Pacs, organisations that can provide unlimited funding so long as they do not coordinate with candidates. Other candidates pledge not to take money from Super Pacs but Inslee has said he will not turn down funds from those which really want to fight climate change. He has pledged, however, not to accept any money from the fossil fuel industry or corporate political action committees. Last month, the Super Pac Act Now on Climate was formed to support Inslee’s run. So far, it has spent more than $1m on ad buys. Inslee lacks name recognition and barely registers in the polls, so such assistance could give him a much needed leg-up in early primary states. But it also runs the risk of opening him up to attacks as Democrats try to outdo one another in presenting their campaigns as unbeholden to outside groups. His decision to accept Super Pac money was condemned by the group End Citizens United. In a letter directed at Inslee, the group called single-candidate Super Pacs like Act Now on Climate “even worse than Super Pacs themselves”. In Bedford, Harlan Cutshall, 25, had driven from Boston to see Inslee speak. “I appreciate his focus on climate change and making that the centrality of his campaign,” he said. “I think that’s really needed in this debate in 2020. I think this is the defining issue of our time … everyone needs to be taking it very seriously and talking about it sensibly.” Jennifer Stitt, 55, said she was impressed but wanted to learn more about Inslee’s position on other subjects. “I want to hear how he truly intends to approach foreign affairs and cutting our debt,” she said. “I want to see him being able to respond to a more complete platform with a little bit more detail.” In Exeter, Barbara Berman, 66, said Inslee’s climate change message could prove powerful. “If he can roll it into improving the infrastructure and all that, we might have a winner,” she said. “It kind of sets him apart.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs mentioned in my last post, the Greens are now getting answers to the QUERY they submitted earlier to the German Government. The query is now proving to be a futile and sad attempt to stem the rising tide of skepticism in Germany, read here.
In this query, German Greens actually asked Angela Merkel’s government to deride climate science dissent and to join in on some sort of climate-denialsim. It was really weird, to say the least.
The German Government has aince responded to the green-query. From the answers, one clearly sees a German Government that is:
1) one-sidedly informed,
2) but is open to a scientific discussion (see no. 1o below).
It is true that Angela Merkel’s coalition government has made combating climate change a crucial issue. But much of that has to do with her one-sided activist advisers, particularly the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and its head, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber – the German climate science gatekeeper. This, as you will see, is confirmed by the Government’s response to the query.
Question no. 1 and 2 (paraphrased:
Are you aware of any peer-reviewed papers that dispute man-made global warming, and is there a discussion about the cause of climate change within the Government?
The Government responds claiming it bases its position solely on the findings of the IPCC and added:
The last IPCC report of 2007 has detected a definite warming  in the climate system and has determined that it is highly likely that the warming since the middle of the 20th century was caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
The Federal Government is not aware of any works that have been peer reviewed that put the assertions in doubt.
Here the Government is stating they are not even aware of the huge body of science disputing AGW. They’ve been shielded from it. We know there are 800 peer reviewed skeptic papers out there. It’s a question of getting that body of science to them. I find the part “since the middle of the 20th century” peculiar as well. Why not the entire century?
As the Wikileaks documents show, Chancellor Merkel has far more pressing geo-political matters to attend to. For climate, she is advised by Schellnhuber and by her Environment Minister Mr. Norbert Röttgen, who, incidentally, was assessed in a Wikileak document as being just a layperson on the topic of climate science and environment. Indeed the advice Merkel is getting is one-sided and woefully incomplete.
On the questions 3-6, all concerning Fred Singer:

Fred Singer is a well-known so-called climate change skeptic because of his frequent appearances in the media worldwide.”
Again, this shows the government is not well-informed. Fred Singer is not a skeptic of climate change; he’s skeptic of the claim that today’s climate change is for the most part man-made. The Government’s response also states that it does not gather information about individual scientists or make judgements on their expertise.
On Question no. 7:
Are there any voices within the German government who question the man-made causes of climate change?
To this question, the Government flatly says that it relies solely on the IPCC – period. Here, someone needs to explain to the Government that relying on a single source for important information is not a wise idea, and is negligent. The German Government seems to believe that there is only one source of information, and that it [IPCC] is the only authority and is infallible.
On questions 8 and 9 concerning EIKE (and again Fred Singer), the German Government says it is not familiar with the organization. I doubt that’s true. But legally it’s a good answer.
QUESTION NO: 10:
Are you in favor of using public funds for spreading the claims made by climate deniers like Fred Singer?
The German Government welcomes an open scientific discussion on the importance and uncertainties of the results of climate science, as progress depends on lively and controversial discussions.”
Hardly what the green zealots and warmisnistas are calling for. It’s the exact opposite.
So we see that we have a government made up of a coalition that is woefully ill-informed, but at least goes on to say it is open to all scientific views.
Somehow we have to gently push the door open get the information in. But remember, Merkel is well-shielded. Certainly the process will take time, patience and effort, and may be much easier when the two ruling coalition parties are sitting in the offices of the opposition and the real hardcore greens and socialists are running the country into the ground.
For a copy of the Government’s response to the Query (in German), contact a spokesman at EIKE.

"As the news of the Christchurch mosque massacre broke and I scoured the news, I came across a map showing that the Friday morning climate strike in Christchurch was close to the bloodbath. I felt terrible for the young people who showed up with hope and idealism, wondered whether the killer or killers chose this particular day to undermine the impact of this global climate action. It was a shocking pairing and also a perfectly coherent one, a clash of opposing ideologies. Behind the urgency of climate action is the understanding that everything is connected; behind white supremacy is an ideology of separation. Of separation as the idea that human beings are divided into races, and those in one race have nothing in common with those in others. Of separation as the idea that though white people have overrun the globe, nonwhite people should stay out of Europe, North America, and now even New Zealand and Australia, two places where white settlers came relatively recently to already inhabited places – as a fantasy of resegregating the world. Of a lot of ideas and ideals of masculinity taken to a monstrous extreme – as ideas of disconnection, of taking matters into your own hands, of feeling no empathy and exhibiting no kindness, of asserting yourself as having the right to dominate others even unto death. And of course, of guns as the symbols and instruments of this self-definition. Climate change is based on science. But if you delve into it deeply enough it is a kind of mysticism without mystification, a recognition of the beautiful interconnection of all life and the systems – weather, water, soil, seasons, ocean pH – on which that life depends. It acknowledges that everything is connected, that to dig up the carbon that plants so helpfully sequestered in the ground over eons and burn it so that returns to the sky as carbon dioxide changes the climate, and that this changed climate isn’t just warmer, it’s more chaotic, in ways that break these elegant patterns and relationships. That chaos is a kind of violence – the violence of hurricanes, wildfires, new temperature extremes, broken weather patterns, droughts, extinctions, famines. Which is why climate action has been and must be nonviolent. It is a movement to protect life. Fighting against climate change is the equivalent of fighting against hatred That includes human life whether it’s the people of Central America impacted by failed harvests or of the Gulf Coast by hurricanes or the Arctic and their traditional relationships to seals, caribou and other species in crisis from climate change or the people of California, like the 82 killed in the inferno that in one day destroyed the town of Paradise last year. And it includes all life, because human beings are not separate from the fate of insects, of birds, of the life in the sea, of the forests that sequester carbon, of the diseases that will thrive on a warmer planet. I know a lot of climate activists, and I know what motivates them: it’s love. For the whole planet, for the most vulnerable people on it, for the idea of a livable future. It’s no accident that climate denial is integral to rightwing thinking, that Republicans in the US have been freaking out about the Green New Deal, that maximizing fossil fuel development and profit seems to be a cornerstone of their libertarian-capitalist ideology. To acknowledge that everything is connected is to acknowledge that our actions have consequences and therefore responsibilities they are unwilling to shoulder. Also that the solutions to climate change require cooperative work at all levels from local energy transition to national policies that stop subsidizing fossil fuels to international agreements to set emissions goals. In contrast, so much of rightwing ideology now is about a libertarian machismo in the “I can do anything I want” vein. It’s the pro-gun myth that we can each protect ourselves with a weapon when in reality we’re all safer with them out of our societies. It’s the idea that we can deregulate the hell out of everything and everyone can just look out for themselves whether it’s food safety or infrastructure safety or air and water quality. To kill someone you have to feel separate from them, and some violence – lynching, rape – ritualizes this separateness. Violence too comes out of a sort of entitlement: I have the right to hurt you, to determine your fate, to end your life. I am more important than you. It seems like, among other things a miserable mindset, one that aggrandizes your ego but withers your soul. Climate action has been and must be nonviolent. It is a movement to protect life To oppose it means in part standing up for those under attack – black churchgoers in Charleston, Jews in Pittsburgh, Muslims in Christchurch, among them. But it also means being the opposite of their ideals and their actions. It means generosity, respect, inclusion, nonviolence. I asked Hoda Baraka, who is both Muslim and 350.org’s global communications director, how it all looked to her in the wake of the climate strike and the massacre, and she said “In a world being driven by fear, we are constantly being pitted against the very things that make this world livable. Whether it’s people being pitted against each other, even though there is no life without human connection, love and empathy. Or fear pitting us against the very planet that sustains us, even though there is no life on a dead planet. This is why fighting against climate change is the equivalent of fighting against hatred. A world that thrives is one where both people and planet are seen for their inextricable value and connectedness.” Our work as climate activists arises from the recognition that acts have consequences, and consequences come with responsibilities, and we are responsible for the fate of this earth, for all living things now and in the future we are choosing with our actions– or inactions – in the present. But also from the recognition that ecological connectedness contains a deep beauty tantamount to love. Our goal as climate activists is to protect life. Those children and youth standing up for the future in Christchurch and in more than 1,700 other cities around the world were already the answer we needed.

"England is set to run short of water within 25 years, the chief executive of the Environment Agency has warned. The country is facing the ‘‘jaws of death”, Sir James Bevan said, at the point where water demand from the country’s rising population surpasses the falling supply resulting from climate change.  However, this could be avoided with ambitious action to cut people’s water use by a third and leakage from water company pipes by 50%, he says, along with big new reservoirs, more desalination plants and transfers of water across the country. “Around 25 years from now, where those [demand and supply] lines cross is known by some as the ‘jaws of death’ – the point at which we will not have enough water to supply our needs, unless we take action to change things,” Bevan told the Guardian, before a speech on Tuesday at the Waterwise conference in London. “We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea,” he said. In the speech, Bevan says: “Water companies all identify the same thing as their biggest operating risk: climate change.” By 2040, more than half of our summers are expected to be hotter than the 2003 heatwave, he says, leading to more water shortages and potentially 50-80% less water in some rivers in the summer. The population of the UK is expected to rise from 67 million to 75 million in 2050, increasing the demand for water. But Bevan says the average person’s daily water use of 140 litres could be cut to 100 litres in 20 years by more efficient use in homes and gardens. Currently, about a third of water is lost to leaks or wastage. The most controversial change needed to increase supply is building new mega-reservoirs, such as that proposed near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. “We have not built a new reservoir in the UK for decades, largely because clearing all the planning and legal hurdles necessary is so difficult and local opposition so fierce,” Bevan says. The government plans to streamline the planning process. “That will be controversial, but it’s the right thing to do,” says Bevan. More water will also need to be transferred across the country to water-stressed areas, such as the south-east, Bevan says, via pipelines or canals. Just 4% of current supplies are transferred between individual water companies, but there are plans for 20 new transfer projects. More desalination plants, such as Thames Water’s Beckton plant, will also be needed to turn seawater into drinking water, he says. “While there will be political challenges, there should be less difficulty over the economics,” Bevan says. “That’s because the investment needed to increase our resilience is modest compared with the cost of not doing it. While a severe drought would cost each household more than £100, the cost per household of the investment that would greatly reduce the risk is only £4 a year.” Water companies are required by the regulator Ofwat to cut leakage by 15% by 2020, although some have incurred huge fines in the past for failing to meet targets. Michael Roberts, the chief executive of Water UK, which represents the water companies, said: “As well as planning increasing investment, water companies have publicly committed to cut leakage by 50% by 2050.” “We’re also working with government and regulators to find ways to make it easier for people to reduce their daily water use, and if we all work together on this we can make sure the country continues to get the water it needs,” said Roberts. “A twin-track approach is the right way to go, reducing demand for water at the same time as increasing supply.” It is also vital that wildlife and natural habitats are protected from excessive water abstraction, said Tom Lancaster, at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which is part of the Blueprint for Water coalition of 18 NGOs. “Government proposals to reform water abstraction and improve water management are necessary if we are to balance the needs of people and the natural environment,” he said. “This should start with government placing a duty on water companies to restore and enhance nature.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBill Dawson has a worthwhile piece at the Yale Forum on Climate Change and the Media. Over the last months the warmists have experienced setbacks and are scrambling for ways to get back on track.
One way is message change. Change the framing, branding, PR, spin, and choice of language. It might even include throwing long used visuals like polar bears under the bus. Here are some examples of the message massaging in climate communication Dawson examines.
Don’t focus on climate science
One strategy is de-emphasizing climate change. Pollster Frank Luntz says the focus has to be more on the benefits of a clean-energy bill – domestic jobs, a healthier environment, and potentially less money sent to the Middle East for oil – and less on climate science itself.
The first rule of fighting climate change: Don’t talk about climate change.
John Kerry’s recent Power America energy bill did just that and stressed the positive aspects:
‘It’s primarily a jobs bill, and an energy independence bill and a pollution reduction-health-clean air bill,’ Kerry said. ‘Climate sort of follows. It’s on for the ride.’
The language may have sounded good, but the bill flopped anyway.
New slogans for new times
Gore has been using the slogan “climate-crisis” for quite some time now. But there is a growing feeling that it too may have outlived its shelf-life, and so others are tinkering with new slogans. For example NYT columinist Thomas Friedman suggests  avoiding “global warming” and replacing it with  “global weirding.”

 The modified version better conveys scientists’ projections, he argued, ‘because that is what actually happens as global temperatures rise and the climate changes. The weather gets weird’.
Times blogger and former columnist Andy Revken prefers using “energy quest” because “climate crisis” is no longer a productive way the frame the issue.
Science communication – refine it or replace it
Warmists complain about the supposed huge gap between what scientists say and do, versus how they are portayed. NOAA director Jane Lubchenco told reporters in March:
“scientists have seriously underestimated the importance of explaining what we know about climate in a way people can understand.’
Some scientists took it to an extreme and countered critics by calling out their “McCarthyite campaign”, i.e. a letter in Science signed by 255 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
Less, not more, scientific input
Others say that less science input into politics is needed, not more. Massive amounts of data and information invariably lead to a higher likelihood of errors being discovered.
There’s a lot more in Dawson’s piece. Read it!
Gosselin’s communication advice:
Communication is important in science. But I feel that Dawson and the warmists are ignoring the real problem they have – their science is flawed. It’s the science stupid! (and not the communication).

"We’re the UK Student Climate Network. We’re young, we’re students and we’re calling for change. Our movement started in February when tens of thousands of young people took to the streets in towns and cities around Britain, in an unprecedented emergence of a youth climate justice movement. We’ve joined a movement that’s spreading rapidly across the world, catalysed by the actions of one individual in taking a stand in August last year. Greta Thunberg may have been the spark, but we’re the wildfire and we’re fuelled by the necessity for action.  The climate is in crisis. We will be facing ecological catastrophe and climate breakdown in the very near future if those in power don’t act urgently and radically to change our trajectory. Scientists have been giving increasingly dire warnings about the state of our planet for years, with the urgency and severity of their message escalating in recent times. It’s abundantly clear: change is needed, and it’s needed now! Previous generations and those in positions of power have failed to protect us, they’ve failed to ensure we’ve got a future to look forward to. Not only this, those elected to lead and govern have betrayed countless people across the world already suffering the devastating impacts of climate change. The burden for creating the change we need to see in the world has sadly fallen upon us and our peers around the world, unified in our common struggle to address the climate crisis. Failure is not an option, that’s why we’re demanding the following: The government must declare a climate emergency and prioritise the protection of life on Earth, taking active steps to achieve climate justice. We must realign our economy along environmental principles to protect not only the planet, but also to create an equitable world for all people. Our education system is failing us. We’re not being adequately taught about the climate crisis in our classrooms. Schools are not preparing us for the world we’re about to enter, yet still prepare us for jobs and a society based on the system that caused the crisis. We must urgently reform the national curriculum and learn to address the ecological crisis as an educational priority. The government must also communicate to the general public the severity of the ecological crisis and the necessity to act now. The population cannot be expected to hold those in power to account without the necessary information. Our environment is being destroyed and we have a right to know the facts. The government must recognise that us, young people have the biggest stake in the future. Legislation must be immediately adopted to lower the voting age to 16 and incorporate youth views into policy making. For too long we’ve been disenfranchised and frozen out of the political system. It’s clear that politics isn’t working. We can’t keep operating within these failing models of civic engagement. Without reconfiguring the way decision making takes place, we’ll be incapable of addressing the climate crisis. We need you to listen, we need you to support us. This is a common struggle. It encompasses all people, and will require action across all of society. There’s no longer time for those who want to deny or delay. We need to continue demonstrating, we need to keep rising up and we need to disrupt the status quo. If the politicians and those in power won’t make the changes we need to see in the world, then it’s time they step aside or else we’ll remove them to put those in power that will. • UK Student Climate Network is a small group of volunteers who were inspired by the powerful and direct protests made by young people against climate inaction across the rest of Europe"

By Ed Caryl
The recent fate of the MS Akademik Shokalskiy has prompted arguments from the CAGW crowd that the global warming is causing more ice around Antarctica. The problem with this argument is that there has been no warming around Antarctica.
All the trends show cooling, especially in the area where the ship is trapped. The southern ocean is cooling, and has been for a long time, especially since 1996. The latitudes in the vicinity of Commonwealth Bay have been cooling since 1980. There is more ice because Mother Nature is freezing more ice.

Figure 1 is the surface temperatures in the band from 50° south to 70° south. 

Figures 2a and 2b are the annual average temperatures at Bases Casey and Dumont D’Urville, the two closest bases in East Antarctica to Commonwealth Bay. Source GISS.
If we look at a annual temperature trend map of the globe covering the last eight years, we see cooling especially at latitudes north and south of 45°, and at the equator.

Figure 3 is the annual temperature trends from November 2005 to October 2013.
Of course, the southern ice has responded to this decreased temperature by increasing, slowly since the low of 1980, but then much faster in the last three years following the local temperatures. See Figure 4:

Figure 4 is the Southern Hemisphere sea ice anomaly chart. Note that the current Southern sea ice is 1.5 Million square kilometers above the 1979 to 2008 mean value, nearly three times the negative anomaly in the Arctic. Source here.
But for whatever peculiar reason, despite all the observations, global warming scientists insist it’s more logical to blame the extra ice on warming!
The warmists never seem to realize that Antarctica can melt only if the temperature rises above freezing there. For all practical purposes, it almost never does rise above freezing. The summer ice only reduces because the wind breaks it up and blows it away into latitudes where the sea is warm enough to melt it.
The air temperatures blowing off the continent rise high enough (to just freezing) so that the ice blowing away is not immediately replaced as it is in the Antarctic winter. Ice flows off the continent not because it is melting, but because the pressure of two-mile-thick ice behind the edges is forcing it to flow. Average air temperatures at bases on the edge of the continent rise to just freezing in January despite 24 hours of daylight. This is why it can snow off-shore at the position of the trapped ship in late December. Rain is an extremely rare event anywhere in Antarctica except the peninsula.
No global warming – it’s over
As one can see from Figure 3, there is no global warming. It’s over. Both poles are now cooling, the tropics are cooling. Ice is increasing at both ends of the earth. Over the last eight years, there were a few isolated pockets of warming, a spot in the North Pacific, the Middle East, north-eastern North America, and off the west coast of Australia. Those spots are constantly shifting, and will soon go away.

"I first encountered Barry Lopez’s work in 1997, buying a copy of Arctic Dreams from a Vancouver bookshop because I was attracted by the picture of an iceberg on the cover, and intrigued by its subtitle: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape. I subsequently read it while walking the west coast of Vancouver Island over several days. Arctic Dreams was to me – as it has been to so many others – a revelation. It was a life-changing book. Its braiding of cultural and natural history, archaeology, ethnography, philosophy and something very like prose-poetry was both audacious and graceful. Lopez broke open for me the possibilities of what we still weirdly call “non-fiction” (thereby defining it only in negative and restricting relation to fiction). I was only, of course, catching up with what millions of readers had known for a decade: Arctic Dreams was recognised as a landmark work immediately on publication in 1986, winning a National Book award and staying in the US bestseller lists for months. It has never been out of print and now, in our fast-warming world, reads as a premonitory elegy for a vanishing Arctic. Like many who came to Lopez first through Arctic Dreams, I sought out much of his other work, compelled by its stylistic adventure, its ethical address and the secular spirituality of land that it advanced – evident especially in its deference to traditional ecological knowledge, and to animals as tutelary presences. I read Of Wolves and Men (1978), as well as Crossing Open Ground (1988) and About This Life (1998) – two slender essay collections that are, to my mind, stone-cold classics – and I explored Lopez’s fiction, from Desert Notes (1976) to The Grace Note of the Canyon Wren (1994). All the while I waited impatiently for his next full-length work of non-fiction – the follow-up to Arctic Dreams. For almost two decades I waited. Still it did not come. Would it ever? Then I began to hear whispers; there was a title, Horizon. There was a huge typescript, 30 or more years in the travelling and writing, undergoing meticulous revisions.  Now, at last, that book has sailed into view. Anticipation often leads to overdetermination, and overdetermination to disappointment. Not so in this case. Horizon is magnificent; a contemporary epic, at once pained and urgent, personal and oracular. It is being described as Lopez’s “crowning achievement”, but I prefer to see it less teleologically as a partner to Arctic Dreams, and the late enrichment of an already remarkable body of work. In his memoir Berlin Childhood Around 1900, Walter Benjamin reflected on the possibility of representing one’s life cartographically. Horizon comes as close as any book I know to realising this ambition. It tells the story of Lopez’s life through six main landscapes – from Cape Foulweather on the Oregon coast to the Queen Maud Mountains of Antarctica, by way of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic, the Turkana Uplands of East Africa and Port Arthur in Tasmania. Place becomes the means of fathoming time; the book also moves over its course from Lopez as an “unsuspecting boy, a child beside himself with his desire to know the world, to swim out farther than he can see”, to Lopez now – an “elder” who carries a huge cargo of wisdom but is unsure how best to land it or what good it might do. The life journey told here is one from “longing to go” to “having gone”; it may also theologically be characterised as one from hope to doubt. It has always been among Lopez’s great powers as a writer to bring the natural world to resonate metaphysically, without treating it as just another form of resource. Throughout Horizon, matter is present both as itself and as metaphor – from the great storm that threatens Cape Foulweather in the first chapter, to the tiny, ancient flakes of “debitage” (knapped and discarded flint) over which he stoops in the Thule region of the Canadian Arctic. Again and again, phenomenal presences – birds, elk, rocks, ice – ring like struck bells in the mind. Of these, the most recurrent is that of the horizon itself. Ralph Waldo Emerson described the horizon as the “point of astonishment”, mischievously converting it to a thing that it is not. For a horizon is always a line and never a point. The word comes from the Greek hóros, meaning “boundary”; whether that boundary seals the eye in or summons it on depends on circumstance. Early on, Lopez describes setting up a telescope on Cape Foulweather and “working the ocean’s horizon from right to left … the beckoning line where the dark edge of the ocean trembled against the sky”. The sweep he makes is a probing of space, but we understand it also to be a prospecting of the future. To look to the horizon has long been – for mariners, explorers and fieldworkers of all kinds – the simplest form of augury. What weather is coming? The Anthropocene answer to that is, of course: “the worst imaginable – and fast”. The event horizon of climate change is swiftly narrowing its noose. Lopez’s writing throughout this book is pulled taut between his need to register the extreme urgency of the environmental crisis, and his long-held belief in time, patience and the careful observation of other cultures as the basis for a fix: “As time grows short, the necessity to listen attentively to foundational stories other than our own becomes imperative.” “One of the penalties of an ecological education,” the US conservationist Aldo Leopold famously noted, “is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.” The wounding has intensified drastically since Leopold’s remark, but the loneliness has decreased. Environmental anxiety – “psychoterratica” in Glenn Albrecht’s jagged term – is now widespread; at least one has company for one’s fears. Lopez quotes the Polish poet Adam Zagajewski on “the mutilated world”, and speaks himself of “the throttled Earth” that “is now our home”. Horizon is a deeply wounded book. It grieves for harm done and harm ahead. “I want everyone here to survive what is coming,” Lopez says. A lifetime’s training in listening to others has left him vastly empathic – blessed and burdened with a love for all. A poetry of pity is present here that is recognisable from Arctic Dreams. What is new is the fury. In a startling passage, he excoriates “the hedge fund manager who amasses material wealth with no thought for the fate of the pensioner he cheats”, calling him “a kind of suicide bomber”. Lopez sets forth a running argument with free-market capitalism and fiduciary duty, for causing us to “characterise other people as vermin in the struggle for market share”, to “navigate without an ethical compass”. He reports on the “cultural detonation” under way on the Burrup Peninsula in western Australia, where “25,000 years’ worth of Aboriginal rock art” have been bulldozed to allow industrial development; petroglyphs turned to “construction debris”, “the flayed walls of the caves at Lascaux and Chauvet, dumped in a barrow ditch”. Lopez is happiest at high and low latitudes. The chapters on the Canadian Arctic and Antarctica are superb sustained pieces of writing set in “siren landscapes”; short books in themselves, really. The “dark threads” of both places are traced and acknowledged, but – more distant from the frontlines of atrocity – Lopez is freer to focus and to roam. He accompanies specialists – archaeologists, native hunters, polar scientists – and learns to read place as they do. Here, as in previous books, his respectful fascination for indigenous communities is apparent; especially their powers of resilience, skilful adaptation and community-based decision making under pressure. Lopez himself is also a veteran fieldworker, of course; his skills are those of attention and interpretation. In one of the few even faintly comic moments in the book, he recounts how the Inuit hunters refer to him as naajavaarsuk, the ivory gull, a species distinguished by its habit of “standing on the perimeter of the action, darting in to snatch something when there’s an opening”. One might add – though Lopez does not – that he is also an isumataq, a storyteller who “creates the atmosphere in which wisdom reveals itself”. The achievement of Lopez’s work has always been ontological before it is political; a “redreaming”, to use his verb, of the possibilities of human life. Horizon’s brilliant last chapter describes the weeks he spent searching for meteorites in the Antarctic. At 7,500ft in the Queen Maud Mountains, the flow patterns of ice have created a “concentrating mechanism” that causes meteorites fallen on to the ice cap over thousands of years to gather on a “stranding surface”. Here, “fragments from the asteroid belt, from Mars and from Earth’s moon, find their way eventually into the planet’s upper mantle”. Holding a meteorite in his palm, Lopez considers “the history of each one in the gigantic sweep of time … they suddenly seemed wilder than any form of life I’d ever known. Like the wind, they opened up the landscape.” This sense of the vibrancy of more-than-human matter shivers throughout the book; his glittering prose becomes a concentrating mechanism and stranding surface for such moments. Horizon is long, challenging and symphonic. Its patterns only disclose themselves over the course of a full, slow reading. Rhythms rise and surge across 500 pages; recursions and echoes start to weave. This is a book to which one must learn to listen. If one does, then – to borrow phrases from Lopez – “it arrives as a cantus, tying the faraway place to the thing living deep inside us”. He has given us a grave, sorrowful, beautiful book, 35 years in the writing but still speaking to the present moment: “No one can now miss the alarm in the air.” • Horizon by Barry Lopez is published The Bodley Head (£25).

"Over the past 20 years, Americans have been twice as likely to sweat through record-breaking heat rather than shiver through record-setting cold, a new Associated Press data analysis shows. The AP looked at 424 weather stations throughout the US lower 48 states that had consistent temperature records since 1920 and counted how many times daily hot temperature records were tied or broken and how many daily cold records were set. In a stable climate, the numbers should be roughly equal.  Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high temperature records than low. The AP shared the data analysis with several climate and data scientists, who all said the conclusion was correct, consistent with scientific peer-reviewed literature and showed a clear sign of human-caused climate change. They pointed out that trends over decades are more robust than over single years. The analysis stopped with data through 2018. However, the first two months of 2019 are showing twice as many cold records as hot ones. That is temporary and trends are over years and decades, not months, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate monitoring chief, Deke Arndt. “We are in a period of sustained and significant warming and over the long run will continue to explore and break the warm end of the spectrum much more than the cold end,” Arndt said. The former Weather Channel meteorologist Guy Walton, who has been studying hot and cold extreme records since 2000, said the trend is unmistakable. “You are getting more extremes,” Walton said. “Your chances for getting more dangerous extremes are going up with time.” One stark example is the southern California city of Pasadena, where 7,203 days went by between cold records being broken. On 23 February, Pasadena set a low temperature record, its first since 5 June 1999. Vermont native Paul Wennberg felt it. He moved to Pasadena in 1998 just before the dearth of cold records. “Even with the local cold we had this past month, it’s very noticeable,” said Wennberg, a California Institute of Technology atmospheric sciences professor. “It’s just been ever warmer.” In between the two cold record days, Pasadena set 145 hot records. That includes an all-time high of 113F last year. “Last year was unbelievable here,” Wennberg said. “The tops of a lot of the hedges, they essentially melted.” Scientists often talked about human-caused global warming in terms of average temperatures, but that is not what costs money or sends people to the hospital. A study this month found that in just 22 states, about 36,000 people on average go to the hospital because of excessive summertime heat. “The extremes affect our lives,” Arndt said, adding that they are expensive, with hospital stays, rising energy bills and crop losses. The AP counted daily records across 424 stations starting in 1920 and ending in 2018. The AP only considered daily not all-time high maximum temperatures and low minimum temperatures and only used stations with minimal missing data. More typical than Pasadena is Wooster, Ohio. From 1999 on, Wooster saw 106 high temperature records set or broken and 51 cold ones. In the previous eight decades, the ratio was slightly colder than one to one. In all, 87% of the weather stations had more hot records than cold since 1999. There have been 42 weather stations that have at least five hot records for every cold one since 1999, with 11 where the hot-to-cold ratio is 10-to-1 or higher, including Pasadena."

These are the results after the first month of blogging. The numbers have far surpassed my expectations.
The most activity came on April 24-27, after this climate blog was the first to report on the story we called: Russian Scientist: Expect Cooling – Pols Sitting On The Wrong Horse, hours before WUWT picked it up and linked to a botched UPI release. Ours was headlined almost 3 days at Marc Morano’s http://climatedepot.com/. In fact Climate Depot linked directly to 3 of our posts.
But I’m not doing this for the numbers. Rather, I’m focusing on finding interesting stories here in Europe that could otherwise go unreported. This is for fun and learning. Hope you keep dropping by.

"Over the past 30 years I have reported so many broken climate policy promises and quoted so much rhetoric that proved to be hollow, it is difficult to trace it back to the start. I think it’s a faded press release from 11 October, 1990 headed “government sets targets for reductions in greenhouse gases”. “The government recognises the greenhouse effect as one of the major environmental concerns facing the world,” said Ros Kelly, Bob Hawke’s environment minister. “This decision puts Australia at the forefront of international action to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases.” We knew we had to do something almost three decades ago. Children have grown to adulthood and had their own children during the time we have known, and done not very much. We were then, apparently, going to meet our target through “no regrets” actions – things that made sense for other environmental reasons as well as climate concerns. We didn’t meet it. We haven’t ever met any of a succession of greenhouse gas reduction targets by actually reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to rise, still. No regrets? At the forefront? If only. 1990 was the year the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report made clear predictions – of higher temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and impacts on agriculture. They are no longer predictions. They are our reality now. We just endured the hottest summer on record. In Port Augusta the thermometer hit 49.5 degrees. Across the country more than 200 temperature records were broken. Nine of the 10 warmest years in Australia’s records have occurred since 2005. Communities have no water. Flying foxes are dropping dead from the trees. Up to a million fish have died in the parched Murray-Darling – an ongoing environmental, social and economic catastrophe. We have been warned that without urgent action, the Darling will die. The bushfire season is starting earlier and different kinds of forests are burning, one in Tasmania stands over 1,000 years old. Flooding is more frequent and rainfall patterns are changing. Our ecosystems are being driven to collapse. For all those decades some politicians tried and failed to act, because others tried harder and succeeded in preventing it. For a brief moment we had a carbon price, and greenhouse emissions did fall, but then it was abolished, ostensibly in the name of reducing the price of groceries and services, which had never risen much in the first place, but mostly in the cynical interests of trying to win an election. There were various other attempts at credible policy over the years, from across the political spectrum, as well as some spectacularly bad ones, but in the end effective policy was mostly washed away by political timidity, outright ignorance and the well-financed lobbying efforts of mining companies determined to delay the eventual phasing-out of coal. But as the evidence of a changing climate defies denial, those who have spent careers delaying or refuting the need for action have untethered their arguments from fact. Climate policy is no longer a real “debate” about the existential threat at the heart of the issue, and competing ideas about how to address it, but rather it has become a proxy for an ongoing war of attrition, in particular between the Coalition’s moderates and conservatives, stripped of policy meaning to become a vacuous argument about being “for” or “against” fossil fuels. Those who would thwart action are also again resorting to that tired contention that would undermine any action by any nation on any global issue – we shouldn’t have to do anything because we are responsible for just a proportion of the problem, or put another way, we shouldn’t do anything because we can’t solve the problem on our own. They sow uncertainty and sometimes they descend to farce, such as citing Dorothea MacKellar’s poetic reference to “droughts and flooding rains” in refutation of scientific fact or claiming that renewable energy will “kill” night sporting fixtures. They ignore or misquote their own advice to persist with the blind belief that building new coal-fired power stations is the only way the nation can secure affordable, reliable power. They claim, for example, that the energy market operator backs investment in coal-fired power, when in fact its modelling says the opposite. And, just for the record, as Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy has pointed out, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission didn’t recommend it either. No one has, because underwriting a coal-fired power station and indemnifying it against any future climate measures makes no economic sense. But the government – including its resources minister – is persisting with its faith in new plants, even as the mining and power companies that have profited richly from coal fired power for years, and spent millions on secret public relations campaigns trying to prolong its use, are conceding the gig is up. Even more bewilderingly, it is persisting with the idea even as it seeks to build credentials with an electorate increasingly concerned about global warming, informed by what they are seeing and reading about current events, and what they are experiencing in their lives. The prime minister who once fondled a lump of coal in the parliament, is brandishing a “climate solutions package”, the contradiction most baldly evident in the fact that he is now simultaneously advocating taxpayer support for renewable projects that rely on coal-fired power stations closing, and also taxpayer support for opening new ones. We’ve seen this eleventh hour conversion before – when John Howard reluctantly said he would introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2007, faced with rising voter concern after the millennial drought. (He later admitted he did it only because of the political pressure, and never really believed in the idea.) At Guardian Australia, we think it is time, a long way past time, to take a breath and go back to the facts. We’ve tried to do this all along, of course, but at this crisis point we want to take stock of what is already happening – things we know about but need to understand better, such as the crisis in the Murray-Darling – and also consequences of climate change that are less well known or just emerging. We want to look at the latest forecasts and what they mean for our lives, our communities and our environment, and – putting the political rhetoric and posturing aside – assess the policies for emission reduction and adaptation and the broader impacts and consequences. Regret, at this point, is unavoidable: regret that Australia has been a drag on global efforts to address climate change, regret for having scrapped so long that the cost and disruption of doing what we must has risen and will be borne largely by our kids, regret for the billions of dollars wasted on half-baked policies, regret for the scandalous waste of time and effort and opportunity. But given what’s at stake, it can’t be too late to regroup, and assess the facts, to inform the most sensible path from here."
