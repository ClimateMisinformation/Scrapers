The warmists are all confused – most definitely. They want to eat their cake, and have it too. In doing so, they are really looking like real jackasses.
Today they are telling us: warm periods are unstable (and cold is stable). Yet, history shows just the opposite.
Lately we’ve been hearing lots of reports about the floods in Australia and mudslides and rains in Brazil – instability due to global warming, they’re telling us.
And last month they told us that all the cold in Europe and snow in North America were sure signs of instability in the climate system – brought on by all the man-made warming.
And be prepared for more and even worse extremes in the future as human activity pushes global temps higher, they warn. After all, warm is bad (and cold is good).
History shows that warm times are good, cold times are bad
Unfortunately for the media, yesterday Der Spiegel online reported on a new study appearing in Science, which I wrote about here. Der Spiegel writes comprehensively how the cold times in Europe lead to crop failures, starvation, disease, war and death – lots of death. At times large parts of the population were wiped out.
But as Der Spiegel writes: societies prospered during the warm times.
This is not what the warmists want you to hear. It’s the complete opposite of what they believe, or want you to believe. So this new Science report puts the warmist in a bit of a jam. After all, we’re supposed to believe that warm is bad, cold is good.
In covering the new Science report, warmist media outlets are falling all over themselves to avoid connecting the miserable times of history with the cold periods. Instead they are calling these cold times “dry times” or “periods of climate instability”.
For example Reuters, the Wapo and BBC are all reporting on this Science paper – but in unusually acrobatic ways to cover up the fact that cold is bad – and end up falling flat on their faces.

Here’s how Reuters puts it (emphasis added):
Good growth by oak and pine trees in central Europe in the past 2,500 years signalled warm and wet summers and coincided with periods of wealth among farming societies, for instance around the height of the Roman empire or in medieval times.
Periods of climate instability overlapped with political turmoil, such as during the decline of the Roman empire, and might even have made Europeans vulnerable to the Black Death or help explain migration to America during the chill 17th century.
The good times were the warm times, and here Reuters calls the bad times “periods of climate instability” and not cold periods. These  journalists are just making idiots of themselves. They know they’ve screwed up big time by hitching their wagon to the global warming hysteria. History has contradicted everything they’ve been claiming for the last 20 years.
Here’s how Stephen Stromberg of the WaPo puts it.
Writing in the journal Science, the experts claim that Rome’s Third Century Crisis — a period of political and economic unrest that inaugurated the empire’s slow decline — coincided with “distinct drying” recorded in tree rings, which may have rendered European agriculture less productive. Not just that — the appearance of the Plague in Western Europe correlates with a wet period, which may have provided conditions favorable for spreading the Plague.
Stromberg calls the cold time during the decline of the Roman empire “distinct drying”. The time of the Plague he refers to happens to be cooling time, which he dubs a “wet period” – but he just can’t bring himself to say “cold period”. In both cases sneaky little Stromberg tries to hide the fact that these nasty events events occurred in COLD TIMES.

Now here’s how the BBC put it (emphasis added):
A team of researchers based their findings on data from 9,000 wooden artifacts from the past 2,500 years. They found that periods of warm, wet summers coincided with prosperity, while political turmoil occurred during times of climate instability.
Very similar to Reuters. Here the Beeb also cannot bring itself to call the periods “cold”, and so dubs them “times of instability”. None of them mention that these changes were all natural.
Yet today, ignoring and even hiding history, they insist the opposite: claiming that warm is unstable and that cool would mean more stability.
They’ve painted themselves into a corner. Real jack-asses to say the least.

"For the first time in my life, climate breakdown is high up on the UK’s political agenda. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the Amazon fires and the hottest day on record in the UK have meant we can no longer ignore the fate of the planet we live on. But there’s another reason we’re talking about the climate crisis. For the past six months, young people like myself have taken to the streets month after month, calling for urgent climate action and demanding an internationalist Green New Deal – an immediate change to the cataclysmic system that created, enabled and perpetuates the climate crisis.  The energy we bring to the climate movement as young organisers leaves a mark on those who hear about us. The impact is clear – millions will be taking part in the global climate strike today, with the Trades Union Congress backing our call for stoppages here in the UK. But this alone is not enough. We can’t limit ourselves to one day, or even one week, of action. We need visions, plans and manifestos filled with radical policies for climate justice. So it is fitting that the climate strike will take place a day before the annual conference of a party built on the self-organisation of the working class for a free and equal socialist society. To save our dying planet from a devastating humanitarian crisis, Labour must go to war with the corporate tyranny responsible for the ecological emergency. After all, it’s not a coincidence that the climate crisis has grown at the same time as inequality balloons to grotesque levels. The fight against ecological collapse, then, is a fight for human rights, for safety and security, and for the right of every young person to a liveable future. It is a fight for socialism, against capitalist barbarism. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party recognises this. But to fulfil this vision, and to end the profit-driven system driving us over the climate cliff edge, it must commit to a radical and transformational Green New Deal, including a just transition, the creation of millions of green jobs and decarbonisation by 2030. To tackle the havoc wreaked by Conservative governments, and to establish itself as a voice for a new generation of young activists, Labour must rise to the moment, offering a new system premised on democratic ownership. In this demand, youth strikers and Labour’s grassroots have been united. More than 100 constituencies have put forward motions to party conference calling for a Green New Deal. This is the clearest signal we have seen in a major political party, and an opportunity for Labour to take the lead in preventing the worst impacts of climate breakdown. Last autumn’s IPCC report revealed the devastating impacts of global temperatures hitting above 1.5C. We only have to look at those in the global south, who have been fighting these terrifying disasters for years, to see nature’s brutal retaliation to rising temperatures. Meanwhile, studies show that our carbon budget for even these levels of global warming will be exhausted all too soon. Aiming for zero carbon by 2030 is an essential act of solidarity with the global working class, recognising the structures of imperialism and colonialism that have played a key hand in the crisis. And it’s a first step to the UK addressing its historic responsibility for much of the ecological breakdown. The economy that a Labour Green New Deal seeks to build will work as much for people at home as for those abroad (and the planet), with millions of good, green jobs; universal basic services, including free or cheap public transport to link up the whole country; a four-day working week to both reduce emissions and improve public wellbeing; and clean cities, fresh air and green spaces. Climate can’t just be on the agenda; it is the agenda. The radical programme that Labour’s Green New Deal would offer would be one of hope and genuine systemic change that prioritises justice, equality and freedom over profits for the few. Labour must seize the mantle. • Noga Levy-Rapoport is a UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver at Sweden’s sceptic The Climate Scam, Jonny Fagerström writes how pro-wind-park organisation Swedish Wind Energy is lobbying to abolish the municipal veto in order to bypass public refusal of windparks. The public, whose landscape would be ruined, should not be allowed to have a say on whether or not a wind-park is to be installed in their area, read here: Wind Power Industry Threatens Democracy
Wind-park builders and operators find it a nuisance that pesky, stubborn residents refuse to have their local landscape industrialised and property values ruined. For the wind industry, permitting is proceeding much too slowly, and populations should just accept having the windmills forced down their throats, without any further ado.
Jonny writes the threat to strip citizens of their last democratic chance to have a say on their surroundings and life in general will seriously aggravate people, and thinks that politicians simply will not take this proposed abolishment of municipal democracy seriously, but adds:
You never know.
The wind industry has deep poskets, and politicians can be bought easily enough.
In Germany, according to the online Lübecker Nachricten, Citizens near the German port city of Lübeck are protesting a proposed wind-pack on an area of 750 acres that would be home to 14 turbines, each 170 meters tall. Read and see photo here.
Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, people’s rights are also being trampled on as well (h/t IceCap):

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple a days ago I reported on how the German media has hardly been reporting on global warming. Read here.
That should be no surprise because it’s been cold in Germany over the last 3 months, and so reporting on warming planet would only draw chuckles from the public. After all, August was cool and September in Germany was a 0.9″ C colder than normal – the 26th coldest September since 1900, according to the German Weather Service. Many have been heating their homes for 2 months already.
October is looking even worse. Already we’ve had widespread light frost and many places have already gotten snow, You hear nothing about this in the German lamestream media, though. Winter is weeks early.
At the online German Auto Reporter Net, Wolfram Riedel pokes fun at the climate panic purveyors and their deafensing silence.
Silence is everywhere in the media, not a warmist is stirring. All the excitement caused by the climate madness has taken a break. And why? Because the real-life weather which we’ve been experiencing over the last several weeks simply isn’t suitable for spreading global warming panic through the population.  September and October have been colder than normal, and even the first snow has already arrived.
There were some hot days last summer, and so the climate panic purveyors had an easier time painting the devil on the wall, who happens to be surrounded in a cloud of evil CO2.
And how do the coming months look? Also very cold.
The German media reported yesterday that towns and cities are stockpiling road salt because, says the media, “meteorologists are forecasting a harsh winter”.
Last year, having relied on the “rare and exciting winters” forecasts of  made by climatologists, towns ran out of salt already in early January. This year they’re listening to real forecasters – meteorologists.

"A global campaign backed by 450 activist groups and celebrities, including actors Emma Thompson and Mark Ruffalo, is calling on the UN to endorse a global end to fracking before the industry torpedoes efforts to tackle the climate crisis. The open letter to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, includes signatures from individuals representing global environmental movements, universities and faith groups. The campaign also has backing from writer and activist Naomi Klein and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface. The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled. In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests, legal challenges and planning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was forced to stop work at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after fracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government's fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking. The open letter said fracking for fossil fuels “torpedoes our global efforts to tackle climate change and violates basic human rights”. Hydraulic fracturing is more commonly known as fracking and involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. The open letter to the UN comes seven years after the UN Environment Programme issued a global alert on fracking, which concluded it may have adverse environmental impacts even if done properly. The letter also points to the “overwhelming scientific documenting” of the fracking industry’s negative impact on the environment, public health and the climate crisis. The activist signatories include members of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Robert Howarth, a professor at Cornell University in the US and one of the letter’s signatories, said fracking for shale gas was a climate disaster because the process releases huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. He said: “Over the past decade, methane levels have been rising rapidly in the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the unprecedented global climate disruption seen in recent years.” Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and threatens to accelerate the pace of global heating. Howarth added: “Over 60% of the increased global methane emissions are from the oil and gas industry, and shale gas development in North America is responsible for one-third of the increased emissions from all sources.” Emma Thompson, who also supported the climate protests led by Extinction Rebellion in central London earlier this year, said: “Fracking is the fossil fuel world’s worst idea to date” and called it “an affront to common sense, common health and the safety of the planet”. She added: “It’s pointless, expensive, doesn’t create jobs that will serve a community, but it does pollute, damage and contribute to wrecking the climate. Its poisonous presence in our green and pleasant land is an as a whole.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch offers more interesting insights on skeptics, alarmists, the role of the media, politics, scientists etc. at his Klimazwiebel site, read here and here (in German).He answered quite a number questions as part of an “Expert Interview – Climate Change and Media”.  I picked out only some of the questions and his answers. There is quite a bit there.
Indeed Prof von Storch has plenty of criticisim for both sides (not surprisingly). In summary, Prof. von Storch advises the media, politics and scientists to stick more to their roles, and to stay away from one extreme or the other.
Q: How do you perceive public communication on anthropogenic climate change in Germany?
HvS:  The communication has improved considerably over the last year since ClimateGate, the IPCC blunders and the failure of COP-15.  The talk has become less dramatic, as well-known alarmists can longer be so sure with the attention of the public.
Q: In your view how should successful public communication of anthropogenic climate change be set-up?
HsV: Less positive is the tendency to moralise and to propagandise, like Germany should be a model for the rest of the world while countries like China and USA are to be demonized. The communication on one side should present the scientifically supported perspectives as factual supplementary conditions for decision-making, while on the other hand highlighting as political options the possibilities for making decisions by politics and society (i.e. decided by values).
Q: What has to improve with the public communication of anthropogenic climate change and what has to happen so that it gets better?
HvS: More openness to questions and skepticism; more skepticism with respect to the alarmists (i.e. the ones who have the more interesting “stories” for the media and politics); more resistance to attempts at using single events as proof that supports far-reaching statements (like on the irrelevance of the man-made greenhouse effect) on climate dynamics; caution in the argumentative use of the latest scientific findings (much in Nature and Science later turns out to be in need of revision); evaluating scientific results from the methodical points of view, and less from the point of view of political application.
Q: How do you assess the current situation in climate research?
HsV: The situation in climate research as much improved over the last year– to the extent that the discussion is more open. The influence of political circles and cartels has decreased some.

//-->




Q: What’s going well, and where are there problems?
HsV: Climate science finds itself in a post-normal phase where the mixture of politics and science is mutually beneficial to both. That doesn’t mean that the scientific process itself is damaged, but there is a need for a discussion in public on what role science should play.
Q: What must be improved and what must happen in order for things to get better?
HsV: The practice observed up to now of  “stealth advocate scientists“, i.e. of scientists who, without saying it, put their science in service of a certain political matter, needs to be stopped.
Q: What trends in the media in Germany with respect to communication on global climate change do you see?
HvS: Since about one year, the reporting has gotten more critical and open.
Q: What’s the deal with the interest of the media? Could you give us a current example?
HsV: The interest by the media was very considerable for a period of about 2 months after the events surrounding COP-15, ClimateGate and the IPCC revelations, but then faded. Alarmist reports have become somewhat less lately, also during COP-16 in Cancun. Obviously there seems to be an interest in better researched background reports.
Q: Over the last years, what impact have the increased number of skeptics had on the public communication of anthropogenic climate change?
I don’t believe the number of skeptics has gone up; more are just admitting it. I think there have always been latent reservations also among other professors from physics, geology and other areas. These reservations are now being more explicitly expressed. Many of these people are so-called “skeptics“. They are not oil-industry seduced hacks.
Q: In your opinion how does the future constellation between, climate science, climate politics and the media appear?
HsV: Hopefully in such a way that all three of these players start accepting more and more their own roles and functions, particularly I hope the media find their way back to accompanying science and politics more critically also in the climate field.

"As a report claims that airlines are struggling to control their contribution to the climate crisis, the question grows more urgent for aviation: does it have a greener future, and will a zero-emission plane ever fly? Executives hope a combination of sustainable fuels, offsetting and improving flight paths can play a part in reducing aviation’s footprint until, if ever, carbon-free flying becomes a viable technological and commercial reality. For now, the best long-term hope for the airline industry appears to be electric planes.  At Cranfield University, the laboratory for much of British aviation research, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, on Thursday urged the industry “to create an electric revolution in our skies”; for the climate and, incidentally, “to seize a share of a market that could be worth £4tn globally by 2050”. Manufacturers are pursuing electric dreams: not just companies like Boeing and Airbus, but a host of tech firms, particularly for urban air mobility – aircraft that could be clean and silent enough to make shorter air hops possible without large airports. How much that can be scaled up remains a question. For now, the development of batteries with better power-to-weight ratio means shorter trips on small planes may not be far away. At this year’s Paris air show, electric planes on display included a nine-seater plane named Alice, being developed just outside Tel Aviv by Eviation. The Israeli startup is aiming to have commercial deliveries of its plane as early as 2022. A bigger version, a partly British-built hybrid electric plane, is aiming for test flights in 2021. The e-Fan X, a collaboration between Cranfield with Airbus, Siemens and Rolls-Royce, will convert a small passenger jet to demonstrate the potential for wider commercial use. That kind of project has excited analysts: the move towards hybrid and electric engines for short-haul flights could come in the next two decades, according to an analyst report by UBS. Another zero-emission alternative could be hydrogen, the fuel behind a plane soon to be tested on flights from the Orkney islands. Trials backed by £5.3m in government funding were announced this week – underlining the potential of hydrogen for commercial aviation, according to Val Miftakhov, the founder and chief executive of ZeroAvia, which is providing the plane’s propulsion technology. He said: “Our project goal of 300 nautical miles is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies - enabling net-zero targets to be met.” The cost of producing and storing hydrogen is one major barrier. But Dr Bobby Sethi, a senior researcher at Cranfield, believes the current cost of liquid hydrogen – five to six times that of jet fuel by weight – will come down. Sethi said: “As large scale hydrogen production and liquefaction infrastructures become more established, and that of jet fuel and taxation of CO2 emissions goes up, particularly with heightened environmental awareness, we believe LH2 (liquid hydrogen) will be very competitive on cost in the medium to long term.” Manufacturers like Airbus predict new forms of plane will come – but not for 15 years. Bob Lange, a senior vice-president, says hybrid-electric propulsion could be feasible by the mid 2030s. The newest planes unveiled in recent years, such as Airbus’s A350 and Boeing’s 787, have brought a step-change in fuel efficiency, but Lange says the next major product launches will be on hold. “We need to do our research and development now for the next fuel technology.” Before those planes appear, the industry – and the planet – needs other ways to curb aviation emissions. Sustainable fuels were a major hope for aviation; and with concerns over biofuels, the focus has shifted to the potential of domestic and industrial waste. A Virgin service claiming to be the first to be partly powered by recycled waste crossed the Atlantic last October. According to its US fuel supply firm, LanzaTech, if that single flight could be scaled up – and more importantly, function with a fuel blend of 50% recycled waste rather than just 5% – it could curb greenhouse gas emissions by 65% compared with conventional jet fuel. British Airways has eyed similar technology and – after several false starts – has submitted plans to develop, with Shell, a new plant in Immingham, Humberside, which could divert half a million tonnes per year of waste – from packaging to nappies – into more sustainable jet fuel. Other measures have been stalled in planning: a single European sky and better air traffic management could cut CO2 emissions by 10%, the industry says. Airlines are meanwhile fighting to avoid more punitive taxation, with Germany poised to announce additional levies on flying. A4E, a trade body representing Lufthansa, BA and others says: “Instead of taxes, the German government should support measures such as reforming EU airspace.” But as aviation finally gets moving on emissions, the pace of change may prove too slow to avoid a clampdown."
"During the carnage of the first world war, the poet Wilfred Owen revisited the biblical story in which God tests Abraham by commanding the sacrifice of Isaac, his son. In Genesis, Abraham dutifully prepares the lad for slaughter before God relents and tells him to offer a ram instead. Owen’s bitter poem rewrites the ending:  But the old man would not so, but slew his son, And half the seed of Europe, one by one. The parable illustrates global warming just as well as war – except, with CO2 levels higher than at any other time in human history, it’s a planet rather than a continent now under the knife. That’s what makes the climate strike so fitting: an international rebellion led by the young against generations of betrayal. We know that, as far back as the late 50s, researchers for the oil industry understood the effects of carbon on the atmosphere but did nothing about it. In 1988 George HW Bush promised on the campaign trail to fight climate change. “I am an environmentalist,” he declared. “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect.” There was, of course, no White House effect. In 1997 the world’s leaders signed the Kyoto protocol, with Bill Clinton declaring “a commitment from our generation to act in the interests of future generations”. More emissions have been released since that agreement than in all of previous history. How petty, how small, how childish do those politicians with the temerity to attack Greta Thunberg look! She speaks for science, idealism and hope; they embody an ignorance or cynicism so deep as to constitute depravity. The ecological disaster that confronts us today extends way beyond climate. Some scientists speak of the “sixth extinction event” – but, as Justin McBrien argued, that phrase isn’t accurate. We might less euphemistically discuss a “first extermination event”. Nature is not dying so much as being killed, by people who know perfectly well what they’re doing. The need for protests could not be more urgent – and, at last, they’re happening. The global strike provides a perfect antidote to the despair so many of us have felt for so long. There’s a nightmarishness to the isolated experience of climate change: a sense of paralysis and horror at a world sleepwalking into disaster. By coming together on the streets, we shake that off, and we grasp something of our collective strength. In day-to-day life, there are few sections of society more powerless than schoolchildren. And yet, despite teachers and parents and politicians, they’ve spurred a movement that’s growing in almost every nation. If they can do that, what else could be possible? What might the rest of us do, if we all act together? Fairly obviously, the strike must be a beginning and not an end. This is not an issue where you can express your disapproval in a single rally and then go back to your daily life. Atmospheric physics doesn’t care if we’re tired of marching or we feel that “done our bit”. Warming won’t be stopped by symbolism or fervent hopes: we need, as, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change argues, “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. That’s no small task, especially given the vested interests in the status quo. It would be foolish not to expect difficult times ahead. In 1848 Marx described the February insurgency in France as “the beautiful revolution” – and then contrasted it with the “ugly revolution” that followed. He meant that the initial uprising (a “revolution of universal sympathy”) united everyone other than utter reactionaries. It was only later that the divergent interests among the rebels became clear. The same might be said today. Will those businesses who encouraged their workers to strike support further stoppages? What about progressive politicians – will they back ongoing actions? How can we prevent protests falling back into tokenism? What kind of alliances might take the movement forward and what kind of deals will set it back? How does civil disobedience relate to the push for a Green New Deal? All of these and other questions must be debated – and the necessary debates will be polarising, fractious and, yes, ugly. Again, though, the climate strike shows the basis for the struggle we need. All over the globe, people have rejected the sacrifice of nature on the altar of greed. That should inspire us all to redouble our efforts. We need a new movement, akin to those that shook the world in the 60s and the 70s, and we have very little time to build one.

This is no joke. Warming now leads to cooling! That’s the latest scientific news that our tax money has bought from Potsdam – from the house of Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf.This is what happens when you take activist physicists off the street, give them super-computers and a license to forecast. Here’s their press release: =========================================
Global warming could cool down temperatures in winter
11/16/2010 – The overall warming of the earth’s northern half could result in cold winters. The shrinking of sea-ice in the eastern Arctic causes some regional heating of the lower levels of air – which may lead to strong anomalies in atmospheric airstreams, triggering an overall cooling of the northern continents, a study recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research shows. “These anomalies could triple the probability of cold winter extremes in Europe and northern Asia,” says Vladimir Petoukhov, lead author of the study and climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Recent severe winters like last year’s or the one of 2005-06 do not conflict with the global warming picture, but rather supplement it.”
The researchers base their assumptions on simulations with an elaborate computer model of general circulation, ECHAM5, focusing on the Barents-Kara Sea north of Norway and Russia where a drastic reduction of ice was observed in the cold European winter of 2005-06. Those surfaces of the sea lacking the ice cover lose a lot of warmth to the normally cold and windy arctic atmosphere. What the researchers did was to feed the computer with data, gradually reducing the sea ice cover in the eastern Arctic from 100 percent to 1 percent in order to analyse the relative sensitivity of wintertime atmospheric circulation.
“Our simulations reveal a rather pronounced nonlinear response of air temperatures and winds to the changes of sea-ice cover,” Petoukhov, a physicist, says. “It ranges from warming to cooling to warming again, as sea ice decreases.” An abrupt transition between different regimes of the atmospheric circulation in the sub-polar and polar regions may be very likely. Warming of the air over the Barents-Kara Sea seems to bring cold winter winds to Europe. “This is not what one would expect,” Petoukhov says. “Whoever thinks that the shrinking of some far away sea-ice won’t bother him could be wrong. There are complex teleconnections in the climate system, and in the Barents-Kara Sea we might have discovered a powerful feedback mechanism.”
Other approaches to the issue of cold winters and global warming referring to reduced sun activity or most recently the gulf stream “tend to exaggerate the effects,” Petoukhov says. The correlation between these phenomena and cold winters is relatively weak, compared to the new findings referring to the processes in the Barents-Kara Sea. Petoukhov also points out that during the cold winter of 2005-06 with temperatures of ten degrees below the normal level in Siberia, no anomalies in the north Atlantic oscillation have been observed. These are fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure between the Icelandic low and the Azores high which are commonly associated with temperature anomalies over Europe. But temperatures in the eastern arctic were up to 14 degrees above normal level. However, distinct anomalies in the north Atlantic oscillation could interact with sea-ice decrease, the study concludes. One could amplify the other and more anomalies would be the result.
Petoukhov’s study is not about tomorrow’s weather forecast but about longtime probabilities of climate change. “I suppose nobody knows,” he says, “how harsh this year’s winter will be.”
==================================================================
It would be nice if these guys got their stories straight. First we were told for years that winters in Europe would be a thing of the past – rare and exciting. Snow in the Alps would disappear and devastate the ski industry, palm trees would grow in Scandinavia, Greenland ice would melt and on and on went the heat-stories. Now they tell us it’s going to get bitter cold.

"Google’s chief executive has revealed plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. Sundar Pichai said the clean energy deal will include 18 separate agreements to supply Google with electricity from wind and solar projects across the world. The search engine’s green energy portfolio will grow by 40%, giving the company access to an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean electricity – the equivalent capacity of a million solar rooftops, the company said. Google has become the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity by matching the huge energy demand of its global operations and data centres with the electricity generated by renewable energy projects. Google said it became the first company of its size to match 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy sources in 2017 after buying more than 7bn kilowatt-hours of electricity. It matched the feat again last year, and expects to meet the target in 2019 too. Once the most recent deals have been signed, Google’s supply agreements with renewable energy developers will total 5.5GW. Pichai said the latest package of deals will “spur the construction of more than $2bn in new energy infrastructure”, including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across three continents. “We’re not buying power from existing wind and solar farms, but instead are making long-term purchase commitments that result in the development of new projects,” he said. “Bringing incremental renewable energy to the grids where we consume energy is a critical component of pursuing 24x7 carbon-free energy for all of our operations,” Pichai added. Almost half of Google’s new renewable energy investments will be made in Europe, including projects in Finland, Sweden, Belgium and Denmark.

"From the small sun-drenched Inner Hebridean island of Iona to the packed streets of central London, parents and grandparents, children and trade unionists have stepped out of their Friday routines to tell their political leaders time is running out to tackle the climate crisis. Organisers said it was the biggest-ever environmental protest the UK had seen, with 300,000-350,000 taking part, including more than 100,000 people in London and tens of thousands more in towns and cities from Edinburgh to Bristol, Leeds to Brighton, Bedford to Cambridge. There were more than 200 demonstrations across the UK. Jake Woodier, who campaigns for the Student Climate Network, which co-organised the event, said it marked a turning point in the fight to tackle the climate crisis. “Millions of people across the globe, and hundreds of thousands across the UK, have sent a clear message about the need for urgent climate action,” he said from the protest in central London. “The people have spoken and said enough is enough ... We need an ambitious Green New Deal to tackle the climate crisis head on and deliver a world that works for everyone.” In London, young people – who have been protesting in growing numbers on Fridays this year – were joined by trade unionists, politicians, and two generations of antecedents. Mariana Clayton, 41, was with her two-year-old daughter, Albe, in Parliament Square. She said: “I am so fearful for the future. I feel totally powerless – but here, together we have a chance to get our voice heard and force action.” Emma Beresford, 14, was with her younger brother, Archie, and their mother, Anna. She said: “I went on the march for a people’s vote for Brexit but climate change is an even more urgent and pressing issue than anything else.” Jeremy Corbyn and Green MP Caroline Lucas addressed the crowd in London, with the Labour leader promising a “green industrial revolution” – a version of the Green New Deal – to tackle the climate crisis and create hundreds of thousands of well paid unionised jobs. However, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, struck a different note earlier in the day when he said the cause – which he said he supported – did not warrant missing school. That advice was ignored by hundreds of thousands of people across the UK. In Edinburgh, a huge crowd marched from the Meadows, down the Royal Mile to the Scottish parliament. They were clapped and cheered by onlookers, saluted by a bagpiper and entertained by a percussion drummer and jazz bands. Chants of “Hey hey, ho ho, climate change has got to go!” filled the streets of the Scottish capital along with tens of thousands of people, bearing banners that were both funny and dark: “33.2C in Scotland. Time to panic!”, “Sea levels are rising. So are we!”, “You’ll die of old age. I’ll die of climate change.”Ruby, 10, and Dougie, seven, have been ahead of the shift in public opinion. They were inspired by Greta Thunberg to start striking outside the Scottish parliament on a cold day in January. “There was only me and my brother there and the police. The next week there was one more, and eventually loads of people, and now there is this,” Ruby said, gesturing to the vast procession that stretched back as far as the eye could see. “I’m happy and proud.” Her younger brother said the demonstration was “absolutely amazing”. The seven-year-old was among those due to give a speech outside the Scottish legislature. His message to politicians was straightforward: “They are trying their hardest but they need to try lots harder.”In Manchester the square outside the city’s grand central library was taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and demanding change. The city’s mayor, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the protest when he gave a speech pledging that “fracking is the past, it is not the future” – but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl gave a rousing speech that took aim at politicians for their “lies”, before turning directly to Burnham. She said: “Lies, when you don’t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution-related deaths in Manchester just last year – but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats.” Elsewhere, in Birmingham demonstrators staged a die-in outside the BBC offices in the city to protest at what they said was inadequate coverage of the climate crisis. Similar actions were staged at an Oxford University open day for prospective students and by 3,000 Cambridge residents in King’s Parade in the city. One of those taking part in the Oxford protest, Ell Ludlow, said: “We are doing this because we feel like a world leading university should lead on climate. Oxford is not doing that at the moment and so we want them to act now.” In Iona, a few dozen members of the island community supported local children from the primary school in a climate strike “in the centre of the island, near the jetty”. Sarah Macdonald, an island resident and member of the Oran Creative Crafts cooperative, said: “In our small island community, we see shorelines eroding and changing; the gales that hit our exposed wee island are growing more frequent. “Most importantly, we see that the island’s children care deeply about this issue. We have to support them, speak out with them for their future. And we have to do it now.”"

A reader has pointed out that Rob Honeycutt and NoTricksZone appear to have started a trend: Climate Bets For Charity. Here at NTZ, the warmists have entered in a bet (for charity) with the coolists on whether the 2011-2020 decade will be warmer or cooler.
Climate Bet Of The Decade For Charity
Now other blogs are following. It’s the new motto now spreading in climate science:
Either put up, or shut up!”
The latest bet out there is from the outspoken Joe Romm of Climate Progress, who offers to bet Joe Bastardi on temperature and Arctic ice melt. Glad to see he wants to settle it that way, and not through a wrestling match (though the result may very well end up being the same).
Romm’s proposal is very similar to our bet here at NTZ.

In the temperature bet, Romm wants to use the 2000-2009 period instead of the 2001-2010, thus moving the high temperature year of 2010 into his column. His bet is also for charity and insists using the average of RSS and UAH – as we are doing.
But Joe Romm is adding an escape clause: If 2 Pinatubo-size volcanoes erupt, then the bet is off. Such confidence!
I haven’t checked to see what Joe Bastardi’s reaction is. I think he’ll accept both bets. Go for it Bastardi! Unfortunately it’s going to take 10 years to shut this Romm loudmouth up.
Joe Romm seems awfully cocky. I wonder if he has the guts to make a sea level bet. That’s the issue where warmist blow the most hot air, yet are most afraid of touching. What do you say Romm? 5 mm/year over the next decade? That’s way below what Gore and the PIK in Germany are forcasting.
Don’t hold your breath.
Another blog has also got into the climate betting for charity action, but on a more modest scale. Georg Hoffmann here is betting 100 € that 2011 Arctic sea ice extent will reach a record low (NSIDC). Also an attractive bet for coolists.
If all this keeps up, then it won’t be necessary to make up a global warming scare for redistributing global wealth. Looks like the betting is going to care of that itself.

"It is the final night of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu and the Fijian prime minister is explaining how to drink kava. “You clap first,” says Frank Bainimarama, as the smooth wooden bowl is passed around the circle. “Then you have to gulp in one go; then you clap again – one, two, three.” As with so many things in the region, there is a metaphor involving the sea. “Tsunami is the full bowl,” he says, explaining the different levels to which the small bowl is filled from the large tanoa, or kava bowl, in the middle of the circle. “Then full tide, low tide.” “It’s a social drink,” he says. “You can sit for hours and drink this stuff and tell stories about nothing.” Among the stories the prime minister tells over the next three hours as each person gulps down a dozen bowls of kava – about his fear of flying, his views on Trump, why he seized power in the infamous coup that saw him become Fiji’s leader – there is one theme he returns to over and over: the climate crisis. Though the Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world’s population, the climate crisis is already having a devastating impact on the region. The ocean, which has been the source of much of the region’s food and resources, is now the site of impending catastrophe. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs and warming that leads to more frequent and more severe cyclones all threaten the region. As the crisis has hit the Pacific, leaders have emerged. Despite the tiny populations of their countries, they have had an outsized influence on the global climate fight. As the world’s leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly and climate summit, we speak to three Pacific leaders who have been on the frontline of the climate crisis and are taking the fight to New York. The fight against the climate crisis has been the great second act of Frank Bainimarama’s prime ministership. After his role in the 2006 coup, which saw the Fijian commodore seize power and then refuse to call elections for eight years (Fiji has since held two, both of which Bainimarama has won), Bainimarama was ostracised by the international community. But in recent years, he has emerged as a leader in the global climate fight, becoming the president of COP23 in 2017, the UN’s leading climate change body, and the only Pacific leader to have held the title. “I and my officials come from a little tiny island and we had to go onstage and fight these big emitters,” he says. “It’s not easy to be standing up on stage telling the big emitters: ‘Come down off your high horse and do what needs to be done to fight this’.” But Bainimarama says it was important to have a Pacific leader in the role. “By then we knew what climate change was doing, especially to Pacific Island nations,” says Bainimarama. “When we took up the presidency, our fight was really the fight of the Pacific and the vulnerable islands, low-lying islands.” While Fiji, which is one of the most populous and more economically-developed countries in the Pacific, is not considered among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis – that dubious honour goes to Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands – it is still feeling the effects. “Everywhere I go in Fiji there are only two things people want, especially on the coastline. One is a seawall, the other is a hurricane shelter,” says Bainimarama. In 2016, Fiji was devastated by Cyclone Winston which killed 44 people and inflicted damage equal to one third of the country’s GDP. Under Bainimarama’s leadership, Fiji has offered refuge to the entire populations of Tuvalu and Kiribati in the event that the countries become uninhabitable due to the climate crisis. He is also willing to take the fight to much bigger powers, frequently making headlines and causing diplomatic tensions for his blunt assessments of the behaviour of wealthy countries unwilling to curb emissions (including neighbouring Australia). At this year’s climate summit and General Assembly in New York he will be demanding countries take immediate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures and calling upon developed countries to mobilise at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. “Our fight will never stop,” he says. Enele Sopoaga hails from the fourth-smallest country in the world by area and the second-smallest by population. But he wants the world to know its name and to see in its fate, the fate of the planet. Until this week, Sopoaga was prime minister of Tuvalu, which scientists predict could become uninhabitable in the next 50 to 100 years due to the climate crisis. An election in early September saw him retain his seat in parliament, but lose the leadership of the country, so he will not be attending the climate summit and UN General Assembly in New York, though he has spoken at many of them, as well as COP summits, since becoming prime minister in 2013. “As soon as I took on the leadership of my country I went to the first conference of parties in 2014 … I said, ‘Unless we save Tuvalu, we cannot save the world. Save Tuvalu to save the world’.” Sopoaga has been outspoken on behalf of his country. As the main spokesman for the Pacific Small Island Developing States at the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen he proposed amending the draft climate treaty to require countries to limit warming to 1.5C, a proposal that was rejected. At the recent Pacific Islands Forum, hosted by Tuvalu, he was one of the main leaders urging Australia to stop opening new coal mines, saying he told prime minister Scott Morrison: “You are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.” Tuvalu is home to just 11,000 people. Its total land area accounts for less than 26 sq km and according to its government, two of Tuvalu’s nine islands are on the verge of going under due to sea-rise and coastal erosion. When UN secretary general Antonio Guterres visited the country in May, he said Tuvalu was “on the extreme frontlines of the global climate emergency” and that climate change was “striking in Tuvalu is a more dramatic way than anywhere else in the world.” “We are predicted by IPCC scientists to be the first victims of submersion into the sea,” says Sopoaga. “Now, if that happens it doesn’t mean climate change is going to stop, it is going to continue ... We may be the first one, but others will follow. So my call to save Tuvalu, save the world, is not irrational, it is very pragmatic.” Sopoaga says that anyone who doubts the effects of climate change should visit Tuvalu – partly to see the impacts of the crisis on his tiny nation and partly to experience the nation’s rich culture, which would be lost if the country is lost to the waves. “Come to Tuvalu, I will show you how these islands have been badly affected and eaten by erosion, but also come so I can show you how the salinity has eaten into the freshwater table, how it has eaten into the basis of the food supply here. “You come here I’ll show you how the beautiful coral reefs … are now white-ish because they are attacked by acidification and plastic and carbon,” he says. “But the thing is, do you need to see this in order to be convinced that climate change is happening? I don’t think so.” Hilda Heine is a leader of firsts: when she was elected president in 2016 she became the first female leader of her country (she is currently the only female Pacific leader except for Jacinda Ardern in a region with the lowest rate of female political representation in the world). She is the first person in the Marshall Islands to ever get a doctorate, her country was first to submit its targets to meet the Paris agreement and it could be one of the first to see large-scale migration as a result of rising sea levels. In April, one of the local governments in Marshall Islands, purchased 283 acres of land in Hawaii as a climate change bolthole for citizens, if dire predictions for the country’s future come to pass. “I think all of us as leaders realise that we’re coming to the end of this,” she tells the Guardian. “If we don’t take action now, when are we going to take action? There is no time left for us to be indecisive … otherwise the future of our Pacific Island countries will be lost.” But Heine is not ready to accept that outcome yet. She, like many leaders of the Pacific, will be speaking at the climate summit in New York on Monday, where she will demand countries provide “commitments to enhance ambition in line with the IPCC special report on 1.5C”. “We’ve made the conscious choice to lead from the front, because otherwise, who would take the moral responsibility and the leadership on this? Even though we don’t cause this, it impacts our livelihoods more than it impacts others, so for us to just wait to take action would not make sense to our people,” she says. Heine is adamant that the most vulnerable members of society should be prominent in discussions around the climate emergency. She is the chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of around 50 countries that have contributed negligible amounts of greenhouse gases but are particularly endangered by climate change, and a key advocate for more women being brought into the climate debate. “Like any other vulnerable members of our society, [women] are more impacted by climate change,” she says. “That’s why I think it’s important for women to understand the issues and also to be brought to the table too, to help make policies that are relevant to them as a marginalised group.”"

The online Manure Manager Magazine (essential literature when debunking anthropogenic global warming science) reports here that the Pacific Legal Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas “endangerment” finding under the Clean Air Act because the agency did not submit the proposed finding to independent scrutiny by its Scientific Advisory Board.
Excerpts of the Pacific Legal Foundation release now follow:
The SAB is a panel of top scientists from universities, research institutions, and other highly regarded organizations, empowered by federal law to review any new “criteria document, standard, limitation, or regulation” that EPA proposes to issue under the Clean Air Act.

google_ad_height = 200;

At issue is the EPA’s finding, announced in December, 2009, that “greenhouse gas” emissions from automobiles pose a danger to public health and welfare.
Even though courts have held that endangerment findings are ‘regulations’ – and therefore must be reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Board – EPA dismissed PLF’s request and refused to allow review of its CO2 endangerment finding,”said Hadzi-Antich, attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation.
Hadzi-Antich adds:
The purpose of this lawsuit is to force EPA to obey the law and to ensure the integrity of the regulatory process. EPA cannot be allowed to evade the scrutiny and accountability that federal law requires.
EPA’s cavalier approach to regulation is especially outrageous when the economy is struggling and unemployment is at the highest levels in decades.
The greenhouse gas ruling could unleash a torrent of command-and-control regulations across the economy. Potentially, every activity that emits CO2 could be subject to new federal restrictions – from a steel manufacturing facility to a neighborhood pizza shop, and everything in between.
EPA cannot be allowed to impose a crippling burden on the economy by ignoring checks and balances, and shielding its regulatory process from legally required outside review.
————————————————————————————-
Expect the EPA to get lawsuits from all sides, as it should. This is an overzealous power-grab by an out-of-control regulatory agency. It’s time  to rein it in. Contact the: Pacific Legal Foundation.

My wife and I are spending a few days at the Baltic Sea near Kiel, and so blogging will be a little on the light side.
I wanted to do some deepsea fishing yesterday, but the boats didn’t go out – not enough customers. They plan to go out tomorrow. Hopefully I can land that big one. It’s a bit disappointing as I wanted to be out on the sea for days, and not just one.
I’m having some technical difficulties picking up my e-mails (some of you have sent ). My son is going to reroute them over to me and so I’ll answer them as soon as I can. Sorry for the delay.

The latest press release from the Helmholtz Institute, in Geestacht, Germany features Professor Hans von Storch and reports that he has been placed on the List Of The Top 100 Influential Germans by FOCUS magazine, who have dubbed him “The Climate Realist”.
Again, for the 2nd time this week, kudos to FOCUS.
Hans von Storch is a warmist (in name only?), and says man is having an impact on the climate. But unlike his paranoid colleagues at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research, whose neurotic science foresees only doom, gloom and catastrophe unless global society immediately suspends democracy and implements a radical and massive wealth redistribution scheme, von Storch prefers to stay within the realms of science and reason – both in practice and in function. Here’s what the Helmholtz press release says (excerpt, translated in English):
Hans von Storch, 61, The Climate Realist — apocalyptic bluster is foreign to him. Smart adaptation to change is Hans von Storch’s credo. The climate scientist from the University of Hamburg is not one of the skeptics, but is convinced like the majority of  his expert colleagues, that global warming is taking place. And because over the last years many exaggerations in climate scenarios have become known, his solid scientific argumentation is gaining more attention.”
‘Climate research is always a project involving many colleagues whose mutual findings can yield a certain amount of influence. Still, I’m pleased to be named because it demonstrates that a realistic approach with climate knowledge is gaining acceptance in the media,’ says Hans von Storch, Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht and Professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg.

The bit above about “not being one of the skeptics” is just standard CYA stuff. Who hasn’t been convinced that the earth has warmed? The question is: “Over which timescale?”
Personally, I’m been both pleased, and annoyed by von Storch. On one hand he is not an alarmist, and you can be sure he bases that on scientific data. Although I haven’t done a thorough review of his writings, he tends to produce results that fall into the sceptics column (he was one of the first to confirm McIntyre’s demolition of Mann’s hockey stick – which he called Quatsch – which means “nonsense” in English. He’s a skeptic of catastrophic scenarios – that’s pretty clear. He’s been attacked by a hot-headed Rahmstorf a number of times.
Yet, on the other hand, I find him making enough warmist comments without presenting data. It’s not for nothing he calls himself  “the honest broker” at his Klimazwiebel blog,…i.e. someone who takes a position in the middle, on the fence, and often acts to try to resolve opposing differences. One has to remember that in Germany being a skeptic is the same as committing career suicide. The only alternative is to move to the middle.
Give FOCUS credit for putting him on the list. I don’t know if any of the dark knights of climate science horrors from PIK , i.e. Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf or Edenhofer are on the list. I guess we’ll find out Monday when the new issue of FOCUS is available at news stands.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPro-Clim, a forum of the Swiss Academy of Sciences, has recently put out a news release titled: The Arguments of the Climate Skeptics. Below you’ll find the news release translated in English by yours truly. Hat tip to NoTricksZone reader John Patagon.
The Swiss Academy is apparently unswayed by the change in direction recently adopted by the Royal Society in Britain. Pro-Clim is sticking to activism and dogma, at least until further notice. Comically it claims that skepticism is scientific, but only if it does not come from climate skeptics. More on this below.
The news release that follows serves to remind warministas that the science is settled and that arguments against “climate change” are to be dismissed. So keep the faith! The release also links to a pdf file, which provides frustrated warministas with arguments they can use against skeptics in public debate. Here is the release in English:
===================================================================
The Arguments of the Climate Skeptics
Climate Press No. 29
Skepticism is the basis for scientific work, as scientific findings must be reproducible and stand up to rigorous examination. On the other hand, the skepticism coming from climate skeptics is problematic because they accept scientific proof only selectively.
The arguments from climate skeptics are numerous, but often contradictory. The facts behind climate change are challenged in more or less complex ways.  These are arguments that have been either refuted already, or simply are not scientifically plausible when examined more closely – but are always put forth anyway. In the meantime answers and detailed explanations for each point can be called up from websites at any time. A look at the collection of arguments allows them to be categorized into groups. Arguments made by climate skeptics almost always fall under one of the categories. The described categories will help you orgnanize the hundreds of arguments.
===================================================================
To me it seems strange that a scientific society would take sides instead of remaining neutral. I especially like their claim “the skepticism of climate skeptics is problematic because they accept the scientific proof only selectively“. What they are saying here is that skepticism becomes unwelcome and dismissible if it threatens their dogma.
When this belief becomes a guiding principle of a scientific society, then it has truly succeeded in reducing itself to a joke.
Sorry, but you don’t get to accept or dismiss skepticism based on whether you like it or not. If you don’t like skepticism because it’s “selective”, or “problematic”, then science is not your field.

==================================================================
On CO2, Did You Know That… ?
By Ed Caryl
Nearly all the papers on CO2 and high global warming are based on climate models, not actual data.

Did you know that there is one paper that uses satellite data to actually measure CO2’s affect on climate?
Did you know that the temperature figure for CO2 doubling (climate sensitivity) found in that paper is 0.6°C?

Dr. Roy W. Spencer and Dr. John Christy are the “fathers” of satellite based global temperature measurements. Dr. Spencer is also the author of the book, The Great Global Warming Blunder. Dr. Spencer and Dr. William D. Braswell co-authored the above paper.
First, to prepare you, some mathematics:
The formula for the amount of warming due to a doubling of CO2 is:
X = ∆T * (3.7 W/m2)/∆F
Where X is the warming in °C,
∆T is the equilibrium temperature change measured in °C,

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




∆F is the sustained forcing in W/m2, that produced that change,
The 3.7 W/m2 figure is the radiative forcing due to doubled CO2 as measured at the top of the atmosphere. This figure is from the IPCC 2001 report, and is agreed on by most researchers, including Spencer in The Great Global Warming Blunder (page 48).
Any sustained forcing of less than 3.7 W/m2 is positive feedback, resulting in an X of 1°C or more. Any sustained forcing more than that figure is negative feedback, resulting in an X of less than 1°C. If there is no feedback, positive or negative, the figure for CO2 doubling is 1°C. The IPCC figures, 1.5 to 4.5°C, assume positive feedback, mostly from water vapor.
Most of the climate sensitivity calculations use climate models, rather than real-world data. All produce climate sensitivity numbers of more than 1°C, most centered around 3°C. Roy Spencer used actual satellite temperature measurement data to find the real-world climate sensitivity. In another paper, found here, he describes evidence that the forcing is between 6 and 8 W/m2, thus climate sensitivities for CO2 doubling of from 0.46 to 0.6°C, or 0.8 to 1°F. This low number is attributed to negative feedback from clouds. This is an inconsequential amount of warming, and even that may not be reached if CO2 does not double.
This low climate sensitivity along with ocean cycles like the AMO, ENSO, and PDO may be the reason for no warming since 1998. See Bob Tisdale’s post in WUWT here for reinforcement of that idea.
Have those figures been published in a peer-reviewed journal? Yes, in the Journal of Geophysical Research. See: Spencer-Braswell-JGR-2010.pdf
Is there any independent confirmation of such low climate sensitivity? Stephen E. Schwartz (2007) (also peer reviewed in the JGR) has studied the ocean heat capacity, and has produced two significant numbers: 1) the time constant for temperature changes is 5 ± 1 year, not the much longer periods touted by others. And 2) the climate sensitivity measured this way is 1.1 ±0.5°C, very close to the no feedback case, but not excluding Spencer and Braswell’s numbers. Schwartz uses GISS temperature data, not the somewhat lower satellite data, so his climate sensitivity number may be high.
Albert Einstein:
No amount of expeimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.
Well, here are two. (Three, if you count Bob Tisdale’s post.) These are “experiments” that use actual real-world data, not models. The science is settled? You be the judge.

The news scuppers hopes for a change in fortune for the beleagured UN climate agency.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite all the media über-hype about this year’s “weather extremes”, which are normal to begin with, and the upcoming Cancun Conference, the German index of public interest on climate protection fell yet again during the 3rd quarter of 2010, from 56 to 55, according to the co2online GmbH, a program set up by the German Ministry for the Environment.
Public interest in climate protection continues to wane in Germany.
The reason for the drop was due to the lack of interest by the media in reporting on climate change. The public is bored by the topic.
The Climate Barometer is published every quarter and is based on the evaluation of 4 indicators, which are converted to form the Climate Barometer index.
Experts complained about the continued wane in public interest. Thomas Hirsch of the organisation: Bread for the World:

In the energy debate, climate protection is an issue that was very much overshadowed by the recent issue of nuclear power in Germany.

Prof Dr Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research:

Flooding in Pakistan and heatwave in Russia brought the topic in the media, but incredibly little. There is hardly any discussion on the causes of such extreme events.

I can’t help Mr Hirsch, but perhaps I can give Dr Rahmstorf, Prince of Panic, some background on extreme weather events and their causes.
Source: http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~maue/tropical/global_running_ace.jpg
Cyclones globally are near record lows and have been falling 20 years. Thus it can’t be because of global warming. So get a life Dr Rahmstorf. You’re fooling no one.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the bitter cold and snowfall forecast for the days ahead in northern and central Europe, this winter is truly shaping up to be the 3rd consecutive hard winter to batter Europe with snow and cold. This of course all flies in the face of projections made 10 years ago and even less. I thought now is a good time to bring up what the consensus and settled science told us 10 years ago.
The Independent brought us an infamous story that has become a favorite of the climate realists, click here, titled:

Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past
Britain’s winter ends tomorrow with further indications of a striking environmental change: snow is starting to disappear from our lives.
According to Dr David Viner, a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia,within a few years winter snowfall will become ‘a very rare and exciting event’.
‘Children just aren’t going to know what snow is,’ he said.”

And what gets printed by The Independent in March gets used for April Fools Day by Der Spiegel, read here, article dated 1 April 2000:

Snow never again?
Influenced by man, temperatures will continue to rise here with a certainty of 95%. In Germany the bitter cold winters belong to the past: ‘Winter with deep frosts and a lot of snow like 20 years ago will no longer occur at our latitudes”, says scientist Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg”
Damn that 5%! To be honest, it seems like Der Spiegel has April Fools climate stories every day.
Finally, WDR German public television talk show “Hart aber fair” (Hard but fair) featured the following topic on January 17, 2007, i.e. less than three years ago!

Warmer winters, broken climate – welcome to the hot future?

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to locate the video clip of that show. But it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to imagine what that discussion was like.
Today things are indeed very different. Suddenly all the talk of warm winters in central Europe has disappeared from the media radar. Instead all the talk is now about hard winters coming to Europe – due to global warming, of course.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have been told that trace gas CO2 dictates the world’s climate, overpowering the oceans and solar factors. So now we should not be surprised when someone tells us that the atmosphere dominates the behavior of the oceans, which are far more massive.
The stream of  junk environmental science doesn’t stop flowing. Again a small group is trying to convince us that the tail wags the dog. Actually in this case, the flea at the end of the tail is wagging the dog (CO2 causes climate change, which in turn causes “ocean change”).
The German warmist website klimaretter (in English that means “climate rescuer”) has become a leading provider of kook warmist stories lately. Their latest is here: Researchers Warning Of Ocean Change, which cites a report officially released today by World Ocean Review in Hamburg.
Climate change will soon profoundly influence the world oceans: This is the conclusion of “World Ocean Review”, the scientists of the Kiel Cluster of Excellence of “Ocean of the Future” in Hamburg released on Thursday.
I thought Halloween season with people running around in costumes was over. No – we are expected to accept this as fact, without skepticm or questions.
With Cancun coming up, and its failure already programmed, the 240-page report, filled with photos and charts, is the latest volume of junk science designed to spread alarm, a Hail Mary attempt to sway a public, which has long since grown deaf to the cries of climate change. Klimaretter writes:

Climate change does not only lead to rising temperatures and rising sea levels, but it also leads to increased oceanic acidification.
According to today’s online Stern magazine, in its article The world’s oceans – exploited and trashed:
‘The world’s oceans are now a high risk patient that has a chance – if given the right therapy,’ says Martin Visbeck, spokesman for the Cluster Of Excellence”
The recent report is the result of two years of work done by 40 researchers.
The Ocean Science and Research Foundation, a foundation set up by Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a fighter for ocean protection, financed the oceans’ status report. Also involved was the International Ocean Institute, which she also created.
There you have it – activist-sponsored science, which means it has nothing to do with objectivity. In the future a World Ocean Review will be released every 2 years. The latest report not only focuses on CO2-caused acidification, but on over-fishing and trash in the oceans.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember the prepsoterous Stern Report claiming warming is costing the planet dearly, and so we should avoid it?
Well, we know climate is always changing, which means only one of two things can happen – either it gets warmer, or it gets colder. We’ve been told time and again that we simply can’t tolerate any more dangerous warming. So what’s left? Cooling.
Many of us are getting a taste of it now. How do you like it?
The high costs of cooling
Airports are closed down, flights cancelled, thousands of travellers are stranded, motorways are jammed to a standstill, supply routes are blocked, railways are paralyzed, car accidents and injuries have skyrocketed, the economy has ground to a halt. Folks, this is going to cost a bundle. How much?
Dr. Karsten Brandt has roughly calculated the cost here at donnerwetter.de in his piece today titled:
Never has a winter been so expensive – 600 euros more costs per household
On average households can expect to incur €600 in extra costs compared to the average over the years. The biggest part of that will be heating and electricity costs of 300-400 euros. In addition there are other winter costs such as salt, winter damage to autos and other losses. The costs for households will reach €30 billion nationwide.
And if you include the waiting times resulting from the massive traffic jams on the motorways, that figure jumps to 80 to 100 billion euros.

This does not include the agricultural losses that are sure to be added. The construction industry is now completely idled as well. And it’s going to get worse.
The economic damage from the winter weather can only be roughly estimated. If the cold winter continues as forecast, we calculate an economic damage of about €100 billion from production shutdowns, losses with the supply chains, price increases in energy etc.
Send the bill to the Munich Re. A hundred billion euros means 2000 euros for each household in Germany. The figures are similar in Great Britain.
Government incompetence and willful neglect
Governments were woefully unprepared for this cooling, all because of close-mindedness and dogmatism.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and most politicians have been an abject failure over the last years. They stupidly based all their preparedness and winter planning for the future on the crystal balls and sorcerers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the the now disgraced Met Office in England. Policy based on fantasy. That’s gross negligence.
Also read how the biased Met Office mislead the public: gwpf.org.
Climategate did nothing to sway them to think that things might be a little amiss at theie climate research centres. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand when the scandal was uncovered. Indeed they even whitewashed away all the gross deficienies that had been exposed, and continued thinking it’s going to get warmer.  They are completely blinded by radical dogmatism, relying on incompetent scientists and tarot cards. This is horrible judgement and willful neglect on the part of Europe’s leaders.
These leaders need to make a U-Turn or resign. Leaders who cannot get past their dogmatism become menaces to the societies they’ve been entrusted to serve. They are costing us money – and lives.

"An “NHS forest” of a million trees would be planted at hospitals across the UK under a Labour government as part of the party’s plans for a green revolution. Under proposals due to be outlined at the party’s autumn conference, Labour will say it wants to plant the trees at hospitals to battle pollution and counteract the NHS’s carbon footprint.  The plan would also provide therapeutic spaces for patients and staff, which Labour believes would help recovery and promote wellbeing. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, will say the plans are part of a vision to make the NHS the greenest health service in the world, at a time when it is a significant contributor to carbon emissions in the UK. He will declare a climate emergency in the NHS and unveil new commitments to help the health service meet a net zero carbon emissions target, including the installation of 150,000 solar panels and replacing polluting ambulances with low-emission vehicles. Ashworth also wants clean air zones around NHS buildings and more energy efficient systems across the estate. “Actually, the NHS is one of the biggest polluters in the country, representing 6.3% of the carbon footprint in England. It’s more than the annual emissions from passenger aircraft departing from Heathrow. But I want to move to a net zero greenest health service in the world,” he said. “You’re not going to resolve air quality just by planting a million trees but it is an important gesture and also, particularly in mental health trusts, access to green space has a huge therapeutic value.” He will tell the party’s conference in Brighton next week: “Air pollution kills up to 40,000 people in England every year costing society more than £20bn. We have one of the highest rates of asthma deaths for young people in Europe. “As health secretary, I’ll declare a climate emergency across our NHS. It’s my commitment that a Labour government will deliver the greenest health service in the world. Our ambition is a net zero NHS.” He said hospitals would get green makeovers as ageing buildings were upgraded and repaired, prioritising solar panels and energy efficiency. “When the NHS procures it will do so ethically and sustainably. And we’ll guarantee a right to green space for patients and staff with an NHS forest planting 1 million trees across our NHS – a carbon-storing tree for every member of staff,” he will say. The policy will be unveiled as activists in Momentum, the grassroots group of Jeremy Corbyn supporters, announce plans at the party conference for Labour to adopt a Green New Deal agenda. Momentum has announced it is backing a target of zero carbon by 2030, which has been passed by about 90 constituency Labour parties and has backing from the Communication Workers Union. If passed, the target will be Labour’s most progressive green policy, with other political parties in the UK committing to net zero by 2050. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is preparing to speak at the youth climate strike in London on Friday. He is expected to thank participants for “educating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss”. “I know the situation can look bleak,” he will say. “We have a prime minister that has called global warming a ‘primitive fear without foundation’. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn’t care. “But when we see young people demanding urgent action, it’s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing – and it’s growing every day – I know we can tackle the climate emergency. “The next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick start a green industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it’s there to give life and joy to generations to come.”"

Frigid cold in the forecast for Europe
If the following chart is anywhere accurate, Europeans better get the heavy winter gear out and heat up the the Gluhwein. If this pans out, the Dutch will surely be ice skating in the canals like they used to do  in the good ol days of global cooling.


Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html
Right now snow shovels, snow tires, sleds, road salt and even hip joints are in short supply. So many accidents and slips are occurring, which is resulting in a spike in broken bones, that patients are no longer able to quickly get the replacement joints they need. The hospitals in Germany are running out.
That’s what happens when you depart from reality and start believing the fantasies of junk science. So many have been preparing for warming when in fact the opposite is happening.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember the rare and exciting snowfall projection? That’s what the leading experts using their tuned models and super-computers told us. And whenever the rest of us had the audacity to doubt these longterm forecasts, we were scolded, got one across the knuckles, and branded as deniers.
The gods are surely laughing.
Germany’s central location in Europe acts as a rough barometer for measuring general weather harshness in Europe as a whole, and so we can say that Europe in general is not getting its promised warmth. Meteorologist Karsten Brandt at Germany’s donnerwetter.de has a report out (in German) titled: Snow Without End – 2010 Is On Track To Set A Record. Here’s what Dr Brandt says:
The year 2010 is about to go down in weather history. The number of snow days is at a record level, between 70 and 110 days so far. By the end of the year Bonn for example could see 80 snow days, in Berlin it will be well over 100, and it will be between 90 and 120 snow days in other cities. As a result, it will exceed the number snow days set in the record year of 1963. In many parts of Germany, so many days of snow have not been counted in the last 100 years.
Note that snow days here means the number of days that have snow on the ground.

Gee, I wonder if the German media are all scrambling to report this? Maybe Der Spiegel will resurrect its old 1974 Ice Age piece I wrote about yesterday. This time, they could blame it on global warming. But don’t get your hopes up – the odds of the media reporting on this are, I’d say, 1 in 10,000.
200% to 300% more frost and snow days.
In addition, Dr Brandt says here that governments ought to be preparing for harder winters and not for warmth.
In the next years we will have to anticipate many more hard winters. Compared to the 1990s and 2000s, the number of frost and snow days is 200% to 300% higher. The reason for this careful estimation is the weakness of the Gulf Stream and the longer-term changeover of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation.
…the trend is definite: colder rather than warmer.”
This of course is all a very difficult act for the government to handle. The people are supposed to believe in warming, yet be asked to prepare for bitter cold and snow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m sure there were winters over the last millenium that won’t be matched, of course. No one seriously expects the Thames to freeze over, like it did during the little ice age of the 17th century. But if the computer forecasts pan out, it could very well be one of the worst winters for northwestern Europe of the millenium – maybe in that elite class of the top 50.

Say Happy New Year! (Graphic: http://www.wetter24.de/de/home/wetter/profikarten)
Sweden in Britain are already well on their way to recording a “December of the century”. Joe Bastardi, like Piers Corbyn, pretty much hit it right on the nail – almost. Joe actually forecast the cold to be more centered in southern Europe, and not Northern Europe. But he wasn’t that far off.

Outlook for January 6, 2011
How did the Met Office do with their forecast? Forget them, except for the IPCC and others who like to be fooled all the time, they’re not relevant anymore.
The harsh winter only is likely going to get worse

The above graphic shows what the temperatures are going to be like when we’re toasting in the New Year. To the left it shows temperatures 5 days later. No let up! That’s freaking cold! You can view these graphics here at: meteogroup profikarten.
(The DWD says, however, that the forecasts at the moment have a lot of uncertainty, which probably means they are not sure how the storms are going to track.)
Is Piers Corbyn expecting this to continue? For how long? I’ve been hearing until the end of March from various sources. Say it aint true!
If this stuff goes on into March, then the Thames River has a chance of freezing over. If not, then many ports waterways and canals on the mainland will still be in serious trouble.  Things can change of course. There are going to be days where things will thaw a bit, hopefully, later on. Then governments really ought to use these occasions to ensure that supplies get rammed through to the max.
And when you have cold with the pattern shown above, you tend to get lots of snow.
For years we were told that the above charts would be coloured green or even yellow. All the so-called climatologists discounted the NAO and PDO and solar cycles, etc.  They didn’t want to hear it though. They went on preparing for warmth. Now it may end up costing millions of people dearly. Warming is indeed a whole nicer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe prophets of doom and gloom insist the end is coming and that we must fight to save the planet. Join the movement for salvation.
It’s supposed to be based on science and data, yet whenever data that contradicts the end-of-world claims appear, which is often, the prophets take on an us-versus-them approach, often portraying skeptics as infidels or even criminals.
So not surprisingly to many observers, a large part of the global warming movement is seen to have long since departed from the realms of science, evolved and moved into a cult-like realm. Has climate catastrophism become a cult?
When one goes down the list of signs that identify a cult in the list below, the similarities are striking.
Definition of a cult
According to Merriam Webster’s dictionary:
1:  formal religious veneration: worship
2:  a system of religious beliefs and ritual; also: its body of adherents
3:  a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also: its body of adherents
4a: system for the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator (health cult)
5a : great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or work (as a film or book); especially : such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad b: the object of such devotion c : a usually small group of people characterized by such devotion.
How do we know if a movement is a cult?
Some cults are benign, while others are dangerous and can lead to tragedy. If many of the following apply, then it’s a sure that we are dealing with a cult-like organization (from www.apologeticsindex.org and other sources):
1. The movement is over-zealous – and regards its belief system, ideology and practices as Truth.
2. The group is elitist, claiming a superior status and purpose (e.g., to be on a mission to save humanity).
3. The group often prophesies the end of the world.
4. The group promises salvation.
5. Dissent is not tolerated and is even punished.
6. The leadership dictates how members should think, act, and feel. Leaders prescribe how they live, whether to have children, etc
7. The group instructs its members not to read information that is critical of the group.
8. The group has a confrontational “us-versus-them” mentality that leads to conflict.
9. The leaders do not view themselves as accountable to authorities, even advocating civil disobedience for the higher cause.
10. The group teaches that the ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may lead members to participate in illegal activities.
11. Mind-altering practices, such as the repeated use of propaganda and denunciation sessions are used to suppress doubts. Character assassination is a sure sign of a cult.
12. The group requires members to radically alter the personal activities they had before joining the group.
13. The group is active in bringing in new members.
14. The group is out to make money.

Dangerous cults are totalitarian and do not tolerate any criticism. Dangerous cults not only dictate what members believe, but also how members live. How often have we heard the climate catastrophism cult tell us what we should eat and drink, how to be mobile, what lights to use and how many children we should have? Cults are the antithesis of individual freedom.
Double standards
According to Apologetics Index, a destructive cult often has double standards. Members are expected to be obedient, while the cult leaders have their own special rules. A destructive cult has only two basic purposes: recruiting new members and making money. Destructive cults claim to be for the social good, but in reality the cult’s real goal is to increase prestige and often the wealth of the leader. In the Climate Catastrophism Cult, we see how leaders are getting wealthier and wealthier, while followers are asked to give up more and more.
A destructive cult claims that it is innovative, progressive and that it offers a new and better way that will cure the world’s ills. But, according to Apologetics Index, “These claims are empty and are only used to recruit members who are then surreptitiously subjected to mind control to inhibit their ability to examine the actual validity of the claims of the leader and the cult.”
Who is susceptible?
A cult needs followers. The more followers it has, the more powerful it becomes. One of the main traits that people who are susceptible to joining a cult have is a sense and desire for idealism. Those prone to joining a cult often display:
1. A desire to belong.
2. A desire for spiritual meaning.
3. The inability to say no or to express criticism.
4. Impaired capacity to question what one is told.
5. A need for quick and absolute answers.
6. Cultural disillusionment (alienation, dissatisfaction with the status quo.
7. Low self-esteem and a general lack of self-confidence.
8. to be naive.
Many followers tend to be young, disenchanted, frustrated, lonely and lacking a perspective for the future. Anyone that is going through a stressful period of transition in life is more susceptible to join a cult. It’s no wonder that older, retired people tend to be more skeptical of climate catastrophe. So, is global warming catastrophism a cult? It’s hard to find a movement that better fits the definition.

At his website here, Germany’s new climate enfant terrible posted a report titled: The Future Of Our Climate In Europe (in German) where he fires blistering criticism at regional climate forecasts made by computer-models.
Worthless models – ocean currents are 100 to 1000 times more powerful than CO2
First Brandt takes a look at CO2 versus other climate factors. Brandt says that surely CO2 will have some impact over the long-term – over centuries, but over the shorter term (100 years) and on continental scales, CO2 plays nary a role compared to other factors like ocean currents:
At the continental level, ocean currents are especially capable of completely knocking our climate out of whack. In Europe, that would be of course the Gulf Stream. This has an influence factor on our climate that is 100-1000 in comparison to the long-term CO2 impact.
So how can we trust computer climate model forecasts made for the next 100 years? Can you leave out such factors like the sun, ocean cycles and volcanoes – which are all poorly understood – and still get a useful outlook? To answer this question Brandt uses a financial analogy (which Brandt knows something about, as he runs his own private meteorological services company):
Imagine you are preparing the financial plan for your company, but you completely forget the all-important factors of taxes and mandatory expenses for employee benefits. You’re sure to go bankrupt. That’s basically the appraoch used in the climate models and their prognoses. These models exclude numerous difficult details. Still, climatologists go out and hock their climate forecast maps of central Germany and Bavaria for the year 2060.

By now, any normal reader begins to understand just how dubious and worthless such forecasts truly are. Just months ago we recall how these climate forecasters predicted warm, mild winters for Europe, along with the end of the ski industry in the Alps. Now today, having their heads pulled out of the sand by meteorologists, the same climatologists are forecasting bitter cold winters in Europe. Gone suddenly is all the dreaded warming. If this to you all sounds like a swindle, you’re not alone.
Brandt tells us more about how climatologists behave:
 Just a small change in the Gulf Stream results in Europe shivering, thus rendering obsolete all the plans made for a mild future. What’s even worse, many climate scientists know this, but still claim to make precise prognoses. The business with the future is really great, especially when the speculation involves no risk, or if others have to bear the costs of the forecasts.”

Brandt is sure that the climatologists of 2040 will need a good supply of excuses for the climatologists of today, and suggests some for the newspapers of 2040:
‘Well, that was the state of the science back then.’
or:
The models were correct, they just under-estimated this one factor.’
Brandt adds:
Perhaps you can send your suggestions for excuses to PIK in Potsdam.”
He then presents tables of the strengths of impacts of various climate drivers for Europe. We see that Europe’s climate is significantly coupled to the Gulf Stream. If the Gulf Stream were to weaken, then forget about mild winters. Winters in England could become like winters in Newfoundland. Brandt summarizes:
If you still haven’t heard from the climate debate which climate factors must be taken into account when making regional forecasts, it certainly isn’t CO2.”
Brandt does say that CO2 will have an impact over larger timescales, i.e. 1000 years.  But who knows where the climate will be in 1000 years. The earth could be back into an ice age. The earth could also be obliterated by an asteroid. You choose the scenario! Brandt writes:
Over the very short term (2-50 years) and short-term (50-100 years) climate prognoses for continents, especially Europe, depend on a number of unpredictable factors. For the next 1000 years, the Gulf Stream is the decisive factor. Even changes in air currents have similar impacts as CO2 does. Over time, the earth’s orbital parameters, random volcanic eruptions, and, in a 1000 years, again the earth’s orbit will have huge impacts. That alone is already an explosive mixture for every climate computer model, in which the most important factor is still not even accounted for: the Gulf Stream.
If that doesn’t convince you that the models and claims made by climate institutes like PIK in Potsdam are useless crap at best, then you truly belong among the fundamentalists in the AGW religion.

"Human-induced climate change is a moral wrong. It involves one group of humans harming others. People of this generation harming those in future generations. People in the developed world harming those in the developing world. Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate-driven superstorms, floods, droughts and conflicts. And there’s the greatest moral wrong of all – the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth. Yet until recently, climate change has not been argued as a moral issue. Rather, it has been presented as a technocratic problem, a cost-benefit problem, where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster. The debates have been around taxes, jobs, growth and technologies. While such debates are important – there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis – the effect has been decades of inaction, denial and delay. When something is a moral wrong, particularly a deep, systemic moral wrong, we don’t wait around debating the optimal path or policy; we stop it.  Looking back in history, the climate movement can draw inspiration from another effort to right a deep moral wrong: the slavery abolition movement. There are clearly important differences between slavery and climate change, and I’m not drawing a moral equivalence between the two; slavery was a unique moral horror and climate change is immoral in its own terrible way. But the climate community can find inspiration in the 19th-century abolitionist movement’s courageous efforts to make slavery illegal around the world. Those who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was morally righteous and powerfully clear: abolish slavery, make it illegal. It is time to do this for climate change: to make human carbon pollution illegal in every country in the world. It is time for a “carbon abolition” movement, to put an end to emissions. This is exactly what the science tells us we must do. In order to contain warming to 1.5-2C we need to bring global human carbon emissions to net-zero between 2030 and 2050. Not just reduce it. Stop it. This principle is enshrined in the Paris agreement, although few signatories have grappled with its implications. A set of firm deadlines, enshrined in international law, would force countries to immediately begin enacting the policies required to meet them, and force companies to start changing their business models. Some will protest that these laws would kill jobs and growth. But such clear deadlines would finally give businesses and investors certainty that the fossil-fuel economy is coming to an end, and catalyse a historic boom in innovation – bringing to life a new clean-energy economy. Getting every country in the world to enact carbon abolition laws seems a distant dream today. But things must have looked similarly bleak to slavery abolitionists in the early 19th century. But then, after years of campaigning and civil action, Britain made slavery illegal in 1833, France in 1848, the US in 1865, followed by numerous other countries and international bans in 1890 and 1926. What set the cascade of change going was the development of abolition as a mass social movement. History tells us that mass social movements such as women’s suffrage, civil rights and gay rights have always used moral arguments to change politics. I can think of no mass movement that was sparked by a cost-benefit analysis. The climate movement is finally finding its moral voice. The school strikes, the global climate strike, Extinction Rebellion and growing support for a Green New Deal suggest that, at last, a mass social movement is rising that could tip our politics into action. But to catch fire this campaign needs a clear, simple demand, a rallying cry that everyone can share. “Stop climate change” is too vague and abstract, while the cacophony of narrower demands – “Stop fracking”, “Build more solar”, “Eat less meat” – is too confusing. These are all crucial issues, but many people are unsure of what to make of it all. Instead, by clearly showing the immorality of carbon pollution, we can activate people’s moral emotions and then focus those emotions on a specific action: making it illegal. We have a starting point: Britain recently joined the Nordic countries, France, New Zealand, the US state of California and 19 cities around the world in adopting net-zero targets, and the EU is considering a 2050 target. The next step is to shift these soft targets into hard carbon abolition laws. The 19th-century abolitionists were brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral enslavement of fellow human beings be stopped. Today, are we brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral destruction of life on Earth be stopped? • Eric Beinhocker is professor of public policy practice at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, and executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHat-tip M White.Spaceweather.com has an excellent report today called: ALL-CLEAR IN THE STRATOSPHERE about volcanic aerosols and their impact on the earth’s climate and cooling. Turns out that they have a far greater impact than expected.
Today the earth’s stratosphere is as clean as it’s been in more than 50 years. What does that mean? It means more solar radiation can reach the earth, and is thus contributing to warming. The stratosphere is too clean – because of the lack of volcanic activity over the last 18 years. According to climate scientist Richard Keen of the University of Colorado:
Since 1996, lunar eclipses have been bright, which means the stratosphere is relatively clear of volcanic aerosols. This is the longest period with a clear stratosphere since before 1960.”
Keen examines lunar eclipses and the brightness of the umbra to assess the stratosphere. Here’s how it works:
When the stratosphere is clear, the umbra (and therefore, the eclipsed Moon) is relatively bright. On the other hand, if the atmospheric lens that illuminates the Moon becomes dirty enough, light will be blocked and the eclipse will appear dark.”
A very clean stratosphere leads to warming 
Looking at eclipses of the moon allows you to assess the cleanliness of the stratosphere, or its dirtiness, which plays a major role in global temperatures. If the stratosphere is dirty, like after a massive volcanic eruption, then sunlight gets blocked out, and cooling ensues.
But if the stratosphere is too clean, as is often the case after a long period without a major eruption, then the stratosphere becomes clear and thus more sunlight reaches the earth. This results in warming. Well, Keen says there hasn’t been a major eruption since 1992 and so the stratosphere is very clear today, the cleanest it’s been since 1960. That means more radiation – and more warming.
The comparison of images of the 1992 eclipse to 2003 shows that the stratosphere was very dirty in 1992 after the eruption of Pinatubo. In 2003 it was quite clear.

Dr Keen has an excellent presentation up: Volcanoes and Climate Change since 1980. According to the presentation, the earth has warmed about 0.25°C since 1980. The question is why? Keen suggests it’s in large part due to the lack of volcanic eruptions. To find out more, he conducted the lunar aerosol climate experiment (LUNACE).
A lunar eclipse occurs about once a year. By looking at the umbra, scientists can check volcanic impact on the stratosphere every year. Keen provides a historical background on this in Part 3, how it works (Part 4), and calculations (Part 5) in his presentation.
Interesting is that a major eruption that dirties the stratosphere has occurred about every 10 years during the 20th century. The last one was Pinatubo about 18 years ago. So we are a bit overdue now. The stratosphere is much too clean. Too much light is reaching the earth, and so it’s getting warmer.
Keen writes in his presentation:
Since 1997, when Pinatubo’s aerosol settled out, the stratosphere has been exceptionally clear.
In Part 6, Climate) Dr Keen sums it up.
Half or more of the warming since 1995 may due to the lack of large volcanic eruptions.
That’s about 0.13°C. Keen writes:
The remaining climate change is presumably caused by other forces, such as solar variability, El Nino, Atlantic AMO warming in 1995, lower Albedo and maybe even a little greenhouse gas.
So many factors out there that get ignored. Looks like it’s back to the drawing board for the climate modellers. A little advice: You’ll never get the models right unless you weight the factors correctly. Start by cutting CO2 by 90% or so. And don’t forget the clouds this time!

"The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is now at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. There is no sign of these emissions starting to fall rapidly, as is needed. The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. Greenland has lost almost 4 trillion tonnes of ice since 2002. Mountain ranges from the Himalayas to the Andes to the Alps are also losing ice rapidly as glaciers shrink. A third of the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ice is already doomed. Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai. As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. Huge cost drops have seen renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and solve difficult problems such as aviation and farming. The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream. Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating hydrogen, will also be needed. This article was amended on 20 September 2019 to correct an error in the figure given for the rate of Greenland’s ice loss. The correct amount is 4 trillion tonnes of ice lost since 2002."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel cover of August 11, 1986
The concept of “climate catastrophe” in Germany was born 25 years ago  writes German meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne here at his blogsite and, as of today, except for the media bluster, there are still no signs of it. Thüne writes:
Do you remember January 22, 1986? On this day a press conference took place in Bonn at the Hotel am Tulpenfeld. The German Physikalische Gesellschaft e. V. (German Physical Society) invited journalists and presented them with the “Warning of a Pending Climate Catastrophe”. Written on the invitation: ‘The Energy Work Group of the German Physical Society urgently warns in the accompanying document of an imminent threatening climate catastrophe’.
Later that year in August, Der Spiegel came out with its infamous Climate Catastrophe issue whose front cover showed Germany’s beloved Cologne Cathedral landmark half-submerged in sea water. The warning on the cover read: “Ozone Hole – Ice Cap Melt – Greenhouse Effect: Scientists warn of  THE CLIMATE CATASTROPHE”.
In its story Der Spiegel wrote:
A consequence of not immediately reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be sea levels rising dramatically and the Cologne Cathedral will find itself in the middle of North Sea water. The Greens reacted spontaneously and produced a paper on September 28, 1986 called:  “Overhaul of the Industrial Society“.
The sudden doomsday predictions even prompted the government in 1987 to launch the so-called Enquete Commission with the task “Precautions for Protecting the Earth’s Atmosphere.” And so the panic in Germany had begun. The following year in the United States, James Hansen gave his infamous, sweaty testimony before Congress.
Today, 25 years after Tulpenfeld, and after 15 UN climate conferences with nothing to show, the climate catastrophe still remains elusive. In fact sea level rise has decelerated over the last 5 years, and the 0.5°C is far less than what was projected 25 years ago, and is likely due to natural causes (PDO). Indeed the accumulated cyclone energy reached a record low last year.
“Utopian pipe dreams”
Dr Wolfgang Thüne
Thüne explains in depth the origins and definitions of the term “climate”, calling concepts like climate catastrophe and climate protection absurd, and reminds us that “climate” is an abstract term, whose currently accepted definition hardly goes beyond a simplistic bureaucratic meaning, and is naively defined as the average of 30 years of weather.
Thüne slams attempts to limit global temperature rise to 2°C, or to steer weather so that it complies with the specifications of a “climate” that is derived by averaging an arbitrary 30-year period of weather. He calls such efforts “utopian pipe dreams”.
In view of our paleo-climatic knowledge that there have been numerous temperature fluctuations during the earth’s history, and picking a random 30-year period as the standard for the quality of the climate is an expression of unprecedented ignorance of nature.”
Even more absurd, says Thüne, is Chancellor Angela Merkel’s concept of implementing: “global climate justice“. Thüne adds:

No matter what is tried, man will never be able to stop the always ongoing process of weather-climate change.”
and:
The German Physical Society, with its climate warning, has outed itself as an anti-scientific lobbyist for special interest groups.”
The sun, not CO2, drives the climate
Thüne clearly thinks the focus on CO2 is grossly misplaced, saying solar and orbital factors play the biggest role by far. Thüne writes (emphasis added):
Suppressing this knowledge and making threats with a climate catastrophe is unforgivable, and is to be tagged as scientifically criminal. The German Physical Society has to know that the climate that it uses as a threat and for spreading fear, does not exist. That climate is an abstract term, a feature or, as Al Gore correctly says, a phantom.
Thüne explains how many people do not even understand the solar constant, which is not constant at all. Radiation is not constant at 1368 watts/m².
In reality, because of the earth’s varying distance from the sun during its orbit, the ‘solar constant’ is between 1320 and 1416 W/m2. That means that at the start of January the earth receives 96 W/m2 more in solar radiation then it does at the beginning of July.”
Thüne reminds that the solar climate on the sun indeed impacts the climate on the earth.
It always comes down to the angle of the sun rays striking the solar energy-absorbing earth’s surface. Every physicist or natural scientist has to know that.
Unfortunately, many are paid handsomely to ignore that, and to focus on CO2.

"Friday night and the lights were indeed low. You may have been in the mood for a dance but we were in the mood for a show, as the Upside put on its gladrags and morphed into a live event, complete with panellists, a quiz and the odd joke or two. I’ll set the scene: there was the biggest TV screen in Europe (though of course, soon it will merely be the biggest TV in Britain). There were 100 in the audience, wine in the green room and expertise primed to address the theme of the night: Why the world’s not as bad as you might think.  Yomi Adegoke explained how to look on the bright side if, like her, you share the triple economic disadvantage of being a millennial, female and black. Helen Russell, who lives in one of the world’s most agreeable countries, instructed us all in how to find happiness. Alice Snedden made us all laugh. And climatologist Mark Maslin detected the green shoots of hope in the new environmental movements determined to confront the climate emergency. That was certainly the dominant theme of our journalism this week, which included: 1. A global effort by 250 news organisations, including the Guardian, to boost climate coverage. 2. A fishy alternative to plastic. 90-second read 3. A plan to bring a billion people in from the dark. Two-minute read 4. A new drive to suck back carbon and “restore” the climate: 10-year strategy 5. And of course, millions of people on the streets. 24-hour action The New York Times takes a forensic look at the mortality of children and finds that almost everywhere it is falling. Reuters meanwhile reported on a new measure in Indonesia to raise the age at which women can marry to curb child marriages. The OECD said asylum requests fell sharply in 2018 (though we’d need to find out precisely why before celebrating that as good news). The 2019 #OECD Int #Migration Outlook helps us get the facts straight. People think there are far more migrants than there really are; inflows of permanent migrants in 2017&2018 were lower than in 2016; temporary migrants increased considerably, but contributed greatly to labour And record numbers of the poorest teenagers are getting into British universities. The plumber who works free for disadvantaged people. And this gentle call in the Atlantic for a revival of the lost art of the telephone call. Danny Diskin wrote in from Brazil: I run a reforestation organisation partnering with rural schools in Brazil to build sapling nurseries, and restoring springs and river systems. Is this the kind of solutions you’d like to hear more about? Yes, definitely, Danny. Do keep us in touch with your progress. And David Dunn had a radical suggestion: When money was based with gold it was controlled in availability by how much gold was available. Today we need it based with natural resources to regain the link of worth and value which has been lost to history. Scrap all existing taxes and replace (them) with a single natural resource tax collected at source and based on the eco damage caused by their use and consumption plus UBI (universal basic income) and a wealth tax. With Team No-Side in Japan, as the rugby world cup gets underway. Also in England, with the world’s largest hokey-cokey. And finally, with this delightful slice of absurdity in which emergency services take on the “Tetris challenge” by unpacking every last bit of kit in their trucks."
"Until a few months ago I never imagined blocking a bridge and watching grandparents being carried off by police. Yet last weekend I was one of hundreds of Extinction Rebellion (XR for short) protesters who danced, sang and chanted on Princes bridge in Melbourne for several hours to draw attention to the climate crisis. The people who chose to be arrested (the police gave protesters plenty of warning and time to move on) included an assistant school principal, a clinical psychologist, a permaculturalist and a 73-year-old grandmother.  These are not the sort of activities I envisioned doing at this point in my life. In the words of that Powderfinger song, these days turned out nothing like I had planned. Then again, few people predicted the world would end up the way it has – other than climate scientists, of course, whose warnings have been ignored for decades. Just last week alone, the UN called the climate crisis the greatest threat to human rights. A former Liberal leader, John Hewson, described it as “an emergency 30 years ago”. It was revealed Australia’s top bureaucrats have been preparing for “national-scale systemic climate risks”. Meanwhile unprecedented bushfires swept across the country and New South Wales launched an emergency relocation of fish. And yet as new disasters unfold every week, our prime minister signalled that Australia will not make any new emissions reduction targets and continues to aggressively expand the fossil-fuel industry. Scott Morrison even refused to attend the UN climate action summit next week, even though he will be in America.  There are solutions to preventing the worst effects of climate change and they are so simple a child can understand them. But we need to face the fact that our compromised and cowardly political leaders are simply not listening, beholden to their mates and corporate sponsors. Given the circumstances, my wife and I decided it would not be right at this time to bring a child into this world, and we are not alone. That is a terribly sad feeling, but nothing compared to what many of our greatest minds are telling us will occur if drastic measures are not taken: food shortages and mass starvation, a climate apartheid, the displacement and deaths of hundreds of millions of people, the continued destruction of the natural world, and the potential collapse of human civilisation. When our planet is under attack, what do we do? Stand up and fight back. Some of our tools are protest and civil disobedience which can be powerful factors in building political will. History has many examples of civil disobedience leading to meaningful change, including the civil rights movement and the suffragettes. What is crazier: dancing on a bridge to build political will for urgent action on climate change, or continuing as if nothing is wrong? Going to the footy might be easier than attending a protest. But the right thing to do and the easiest thing to do are rarely the same thing. Initiatives such as reusable coffee cups and signing petitions are nowhere near enough. People who care for the future of the planet and our species need to change tack. Einstein’s definition of insanity is doing the same thing again and again and expecting a different result. Feeling anxious and distraught (again I am not alone) I attended an XR presentation earlier this year called Heading for Extinction and What to Do About It. These are popping up all over the country. As an inherently cynical person (a film critic by trade) I admit that going in a part of me longed to poke holes in it. Instead I discovered a presentation comprising exactly what our political leaders continue to ignore: evidence and science. The dramatic bits of Extinction Rebellion, such as mass arrests and road blocking, receive the lion’s share of media attention. Largely unreported is one thing that distinguishes this movement from many others: a strong regenerative culture. In short, people look out for each other. While hundreds of us held banners, waved flags and chanted at the weekend, we were given water, nuts and delicious home-baked food by a range of people regularly checking to ensure everyone was feeling OK. At the beginning and end of every XR meeting, attendees are asked to say one word to describe how they are feeling. The regenerative culture team runs initiatives to keep people happy and comforted, and a vibrant arts team creates colour and spectacle. Much of its work involves creative applications of the expired hourglass symbol, which has become the peace sign for a new generation. “With love and rage” is a common refrain. As a result of joining XR my mental health has improved. I’ve redirected my anxiety about the climate crisis into other initiatives, such as (shameless plug!) building the first national index of climate change protests. Extinction Rebellion is hugely supportive: there are people to grieve with, to laugh with, to stand together with, to demand action with. Everybody is welcome provided they adhere to a set of core principles and values and agree to these three demands. And everybody is needed. In Australia, Extinction Rebellion is building towards its “spring rebellion” which begins on 7 October and will involve rolling protests across the country. I took my conservative 74-year-old Christian mother to the XR presentation. She is attending her first protest on Friday, standing up for her grandkids at the global climate strike. She told me that if I decide to get arrested she will support my decision. Now there’s a conversation I never thought I’d have. Before the protest at the weekend, the group practised a song we performed many times throughout the day. The lyrics go like this: People gotta rise like the waterOur future’s on the lineI hear the voice of my sons and daughtersSinging climate justice now • Luke Buckmaster is film critic and writer for Guardian Australia"

"Marshwood’s oaks are shedding an unexpectedly large crop of black acorns this autumn. These are stunted stubs of nut with an eggshell sheen, barely rising in their brown cups. Long stalks show they are from pedunculate or English oaks, Quercus robur, one of the commonest native hedgerow trees. I’ve found many under one particular oak that’s about 400 years old, whose massive, twisting, almost curly, branches overspan the lane. Its lower trunk has developed a huge burl, a woody, swollen growth, caused by long-ago injuries and beetle attacks.  Producing black acorns is a sign of stress. Immature seeds die mid-growth, with the stalk, or pedicle, withering on the twig. Some have hard shells but others are soft enough to split with a thumbnail, having been invaded by insects and softened by recent downpours. Last year was a mast year when the vale’s oaks were glutted with acorns – that particular tree could have produced more than 10,000 nuts. Mast years are generally followed by meagre cropping or even barren years as trees recuperate their energy. Long-term lack of water after a mast year can be particularly difficult for oaks, which need plenty of moisture. It has been unusually dry here for 18 months – during the winter there were patches of cracked earth. That was almost unheard of in a place where the isolated residents used to be nicknamed “stick-in-the-muds” because wet, churned clay made the roads impassable for five months of the year. These dark acorns falling now are failed ones, shaken from the tree by the wind. Those that remain are fat and green with a faint bloom, plugged tight into their tea-cosy cups. They will ripen and tan in the next month or so, before bulleting the ground to be picked over by squirrels and deer. Jays will seize a good number, taking them off to bury as winter stores. Not all of these bird-planted seeds will be unearthed and eaten; some will survive and shoot, becoming saplings and one day, perhaps, mature trees."
"The Northern Territory government has set a target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in a plan that says responding to climate change is “responsible economic strategy”. The NT’s Labor government’s draft climate change response says the territory will use its natural advantage in solar resources – “now the cheapest form of new electricity generation” – to transition away from fossil fuels.  Eva Lawler, the NT climate minister, said “climate change threatens everything that makes the territory lifestyle great” and governments needed to respond. “Responding to climate change helps us protect the things we value the most — the things we can’t put a price on — and will create economic opportunities for territorians and territory businesses through the creation of new industries and local jobs,” she said. State and territory governments are increasingly moving towards ambitious climate policies in the absence of effective national policy on climate change. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is in the US this week but won’t attend the UN climate summit in New York on 23 September. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, are being deployed instead. Countries have been asked to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but Australia has so far offered no new commitments beyond its 2030 targets. This week the Australian Capital Territory government announced a far-reaching plan for the electrification of transport and homes as it moves toward a net zero emissions target by 2045. The NT’s draft plan includes an aspirational target of net zero emissions by 2050 and says a 10GW renewable energy roll-out in the NT by 2030 could create more than 8,000 jobs and bring $2bn in revenue. The plan says the territory could gain additional export revenue if the minerals sector focuses on the minerals required for production of renewable technologies. The document also says that as electric vehicles move closer to cost parity with petrol and diesel in coming years, “the average NT household could reduce vehicle running costs from $3,398 per year to $672 per year – an 80% saving”. Much of the data in the draft plan is based on a report by Beyond Zero Emissions, which said renewable energy could be put at the centre of a sustainable NT economy, creating jobs and driving new export opportunities. “The Northern Territory government has shown we can really power our economy with renewables and it’s not costly, it’s actually an opportunity,” said BZE’s chair, Eytan Lenko. This year the territory government lifted a three-year ban on fracking for onshore gas exploration in the Beetaloo basin. Climate scientists have warned opening the basin will massively drive up carbon emissions. In its draft climate response, the NT government said it will develop climate change risk response strategies for government services and assets in climate-sensitive sectors. It said it climate risk would be considered “across government decision-making”. “A climate change response is a responsible economic strategy,” the plan says. “It recognises that as Australia and the world transition to a low-carbon economy and respond to climate risk, those that don’t will be left behind.”"
"Donald Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. A senior UN official confirmed to the Guardian that the White House has booked one of the large conference rooms in the New York headquarters on Monday so that the president can address a gathering on religious freedom. The move is likely to be seen as a blatant snub to the UN climate summit, to be held in the same building on the same day. Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis. UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were “not panicked” given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly. “No one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,” the official said. It’s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his home town. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. “He’ll clog up the whole system,” said Mary Robinson, former Irish president and ex-UN high commissioner for human rights. “He won’t go to the climate summit and he wants the distraction factor, I suppose.” Even if Trump were to attend it is unlikely he would have been called to the podium to speak. Representatives from about 60 countries are expected to address the UN on Monday on the further commitments they are making to slash greenhouse gas emissions and deal with the flooding, storms and other impacts of global heating. The speakers will outline “only the best plans, only the most committed leaders will be on the stage”, according to Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN’s special envoy for the climate summit. Still, Trump’s presence in the UN building, at a time when climate protests swept around the world on Friday, will prove provocative. “Not participating and yet showing up at the building is throwing down a gauntlet,” said David Waskow, director of the International Climate Initiative at the World Resources Institute. “It’s most importantly a snub to the young people pleading for action on climate change. Donald Trump has made very clear internationally and domestically he has no interest in the science or this issue. It’s up to the rest of the world to get on with its business.” The Guardian has contacted the White House for comment."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes you have a slow day in climate news and so you have to post something trivial. This is such a post. But it’s short.Hollywood environmental campaigns always seem to involve some “star” who sings and lectures us on saving the planet. But then the star hops on a private jet and flies circles around the globe, smothering it in jet exhaust.
One recent campaign is Disney’s Friends for Change campaign in Germany, which has a promo video featuring singer Selena Gomez. I just couldn’t help but notice in the music video, Make a Wave, that Gomez and her hunk are driving to the beach in a huge gas-guzzling 4WD SUV. Why didn’t they go by foot or by bicycle? At the very least, they could have used a small hybrid car?
I often get the impression that Disney and Hollywood elitists believe CO2 is a gas that is emitted only when “other people” use energy, jets and SUVs, but not when they do.
Reading up about Selena, I see that she’s only 18 years old, and so I won’t blame her. Obviously Hollywood is just exploiting her. I really doubt she knows the first thing about climate. Poor girl is all confused.

"Laughing in the face of looming apocalypse, Friday’s climate strike brought out the best in dark Australian humour. While many signs were deadly serious, teens are nothing if not witty and they came armed with memes and pop culture references.  From classic “roses are red” poems to quips such as “I’ve seen smarter cabinets in Ikea,” the hundreds of thousands of people who turned out across the country got creative. Here are the three winners of our slogan contest #USYDSoc #GlobalClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/VEUgDuB9sr Some referenced the prime minister’s earlier criticism that students should stay in school, returning sledges in style. #ClimateStrike. Best sign so far, Domain bulging at the seams. pic.twitter.com/rS7JVOqByt Others drew on long memories to rework the “where the bloody hell are you” slogan Scott Morrison so kindly gifted the nation when he ran Tourism Australia, or noted the lack of jobs, beer and Engadine Maccas on a dead planet. #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/V1OFSCaF96 Fave sign, hands down. #GlobalClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/M42GqkZzOX But the message across it all was clear: it’s up to governments to take serious action against this threat to our survival. All the keep cups in the world won’t negate the impact of new coal mines, and pretending the climate isn’t changing won’t work either. As many a sign said: “Denial is not a policy.” Or in the words of another, picturing ScoMo holding his infamous lump of coal: “Break up with your girlfriend. I’m bored.” The Melbourne #ClimateStrike starts in Treasury Gardens soon. Fatima, 19: “Whatever we do in the next few months will decide what the future is going to look like. “We can put our all in to switch to renewables and go down a greener path, or it’s going to be bad for everyone.” pic.twitter.com/JH704W6qD4 Some @lizzo vibes at Sydney climate strike. #schoolstrike4climate #sydney #sign pic.twitter.com/iHmoEbCedp Lots of babies at this protest.

There’s nothing wrong with a friendly bet among gentlemen. I’d like to think that Rob Honeycutt and NoTricksZone had a difference of opinion, and so we decided to cordially shake hands on it like two gentlemen would. No one tried to drag the other through the mud.
But what we see at Joe Romm’s Climate Progress here is something totally different. Irked by growing public skepticism and statements made by Joe Bastardi on why he thinks the globe is starting to cool, Romm just couldn’t take it anymore. Frustrated, he lashes out.
Like a schoolyard bully who has just lost his best marbles, he calls Joe Bastardi out to the schoolyard to settle it once and for all, publicly taunting and singling out Joe Bastardi to meet him out there to duke it out in a climate bet. Romm has clearly reduced himself to a sort of schoolyard climate punk, thinking he can drag people through the mud and settle things that way. Clearly he has long exhausted his professional means. 
Romm, you blew it; you’ve shown you got no class acting like that. Twelve-year olds can act like that, but not professionals.
Maybe some other punk in your neighborhood will show up for your classless bet, but Bastardi isn’t coming for it. He’s got something maybe you had long ago – CLASS.
Joe Bastardi has left his response at his European Website here. And he’s right; this is not about meeting out in the schoolyard to settle scores. Things will be settled in time, scientifically, professionally. That’s why I tell the cock-sure warmists…be patient, things will unfold. Qué será, será.
And Bastardi asks what I think is the key question:



<!--

But what will you do if it goes down? Will you actually stop your obsession with destroying those that disagree with you and shutting down debate? Can we get your committment to that? If it goes up, I will be forced to become an advocate for your position, which if I am proven wrong, I will. I rather doubt the vast majority of people opposed to me will open their eyes even if we went into a mini ice age, as some have opined. In the end, there is the difference. I am not guided by blind faith, but faith formed from the foundation of facts on past events. If the facts prove me wrong, then I will be guided by what I know to be is right.”
The answer to the above question depends on how much class these people have. So far, it looks like they don’t have much. Joe says that if the temperature rises in the next 10 years, he’ll change his position, not because of losing, but because of what obsrvation and science say. But Bastardi accepts the challenge, like a gentleman with class would.
But at the very least, the challenge has been accepted, and you can keep your money. What you need to do is be rich enough in your heart to open your mind to other ideas, and if need be, like me, change if you are proven wrong over the coming years.
Given what I have experienced so far, it’s much easier to believe the globe will cool than people actually admit it is doing so, no matter what.”
I hope that Joe Bastardi didn’t let Romm get under his skin too much. His reply was too long, meaning he spent too much time responding to a classless person that deserves to be ignored.
Overall in this preliminary wrestling match, Bastardi just pinned his opponent in about 6 seconds flat.

Update: Romm needs to spend less time in the schoolyard, and more time in the math classroom. http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/romm-math-fail/

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the German media are now in full panic mode. They can no longer get their stories straight.Desperate to stem the flood of doubt now sweeping Germany, as the country is gripped by its harshest December in 100 years, including record snowfalls in Potsdam, the hyper-alarmist PIK and the German media are now throwing all they’ve got to explain away the embarrassing cold.
For years they preached endlessly that Germany would be experiencing balmy, southern European-type winters. Snow indeed had been relegated to the history books. The tables have since turned.
Everybody had predicted a brutal winter
Back in late summer and fall, meteorologists like Piers Corbyn, Joe Bastardi, and other German private forecasters, were all predicting cold winters ahead. Even Russian and Polish scientists had forecast the possibility of the harshest winter in a 1000 years. But the PIK and Met Office climatologists scoffed. The Met Office in England even went so far as to forecast a mild and wet winter, again.
So far, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Germany have experienced one of the worst Decembers on record, if not the worst.
PIK suddenly sees the writing on the wall
By early November even the climate scientists at the dogmatic PIK eventually recognized the writing on the wall, and so scrambled to fabricate a cartoonish “new study”, authored by PIK scientist Vladimir Petuchov, that suddenly predicted cold winters would be likely for Europe, and claimed it was consistent with global warming. Their models had just uncovered it.
The media blitz – conflicting stories
The heavy snows and extreme cold hit as expected. The public was caught off guard and demanded an explanation. And so the propaganda machinery switched into high gear. FOCUS online, two days ago on Tuesday, had the title Colder Winters Because of Global Warming. Der Spiegel and other major news outlets, along with radio and TV, all joined in spreading the PIK propaganda – all reporting this sudden new discovery by PIK.
Here Focus wrote how a PIK computer model shows how the disappearance of sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas influences the climate in northern continental regions. Less sea ice in these seas leads to release of energy into the atmosphere.
As a result, large-scale changes in air currents could occur so that polar winds make their way to Europe and North Asia, whereby the probability of cold winters triples.”
Emphasis added. They (PIK) aren’t sure amd are simply floating this out. The study’s lead author Vladimir Petuchov then adds a line, which I think will become infamous down the road:
Hard winters do not refute global warming, instead they more so confirm it.”

So, according to their latest climate models, global warming will lead to colder European winters. The probability of the such is 3 times higher. Now enters Stefan Rahmstorf.
No no…stop! Warming leads to warmer colder winters!
Meanwhile Stefan Rahmstorf is watching the back door. No matter what happens, they’ll all be able to say “We were right”. Also on Tuesday, the online Die Welt quotes Rahmstorf, also from the PIK, in an article titled: Hard Winter Not a Sign of Climate Change. (Petuchov to the contrary said that it was).
We will certainly have to anticipate milder winters rather than cold ones.”
Die Welt then adds:
PIK scientist Prof. Stephan Rahmstorf also points out that the “cold“ winters have gotten warmer.”
Stop right there. These guys can’t even get their stories straight! One PIK scientist says we’ll get warmer winters, while the other one says we’ll get colder ones. Well, which is it? Rahmstorf seems to be saying we’ll get colder winters that will be warmer. Oh, now I get it…global warming will now lead to warmer colder winters!
It was all recently discovered by their climate models
Dr. Peter Werner, also of the PIK, said on NDR Radio (also on Tuesday) that their climate models had just recently uncovered the Barents and Kara Sea phenomena, claiming it’s all consistent with man-made climate change.
Tuesday was a busy press release day for the alarmists in Potsdam. It also appears to have been a very chaotic one too.
Conclusion
So what can we conclude from all this? No matter what the climate does, they will be able to say their models predicted it. Falsification is impossible. Jared Olar of Echo-Pilot.com here says it best:
The natural sciences have terms for that kind of hypothesis. ‘Unfalsifiable’ is one of them. ‘Unscientific’ is another. An idea may be true, but if it is incapable of being ‘falsified’ or proven wrong, then whatever else that idea is, it certainly isn’t science.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHardly! Ed Caryl brings us a classic example of GISS temperature data “adjustment”.
====================================================
Urban Heat Island at Providence Rhode Island
By Ed Caryl
A recent paper by Ping Zhang and Marc Imhoff of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA materials found here), pointed out the incredible heat island around some eastern U.S. cities, including Providence, Rhode Island, and Buffalo, New York. This author decided to examine this data, and compare it to the GISSTemp data for the same location.
First, here is the image from the NASA paper, and below it, a heat map image derived from it. Note the temperature scale on the bottom of both images. The temperature scales are from 20 to 40 degrees C. Find the airport in these images.
Original NASA image
and
NASA image converted to a false-color heat map
The airport should the easy to find, it is the hottest place on the map, about 15 degrees hotter than the cool countryside at the edges of the images. This is the Warwick/Providence TF Green State Airport.
Now, where do you suppose the temperature is being measured at this airport?
As at most airports, it is in between the main runway and the taxiway in front of the terminal. Right next to that purple spot on the heat image, the hottest place on the map. After all, the pilots want to know the runway temperature when they plan their landings and takeoffs.
Look at the 2 images below from the U. S. Geological Survey, and Google respectively. The weather instruments are near the navigation beacon (the dark spot, at the arrow, near the center of the USGS photo):

What does GISSTemp say about this location? There are two records in the GISS database: a raw data file, and a corrected file that they use for further processing, such as the U.S. and the global average temperature. The default file is the uncorrected raw data. The URL looks like this:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/gistemp_station.py?id=425725070060&data_set=1&num_neighbors=1
If you change the digit after the “set=” to a 2, you get the corrected data. Both sets of data are available as text files from a link below the resulting chart. Both sets of data were downloaded and charted below, along with the mathematical difference, the “correction”.

Both sets of data show a warming trend, but the uncorrected data (Providence 1) shows much more warming than Providence 2. The difference is a stepwise correction, warming the past by as much as 1.2 degrees C.
One would think that any correction should be to cool the more recent temperatures to correct for the increasing UHI, but that isn’t what they have done. And, most of the correction was done to data before 1940. This doesn’t make sense either, as most of the infrastructure and population buildup around the airport didn’t happen until WWII and after. Also, the correction amount doesn’t approach the UHI temperature rise measured by Dr Zhang.
Will Drs Hansen and Zhang get together?
Most of the surface temperature data that goes into the averages, whether world-wide, or here in the U. S., come from airports. In the U. S., the number is 121 out of 134 stations. Each of the airports in the images in the NASA paper can be clearly seen as a hot spot. Clearly, some work needs to be done to correct the surface temperature record in light of this information.
When will GISS get around to that?

Will the new 2011-2020 decade be warmer or cooler than the last one?
That’s what we’re betting on.
The warmists are betting it’s going to be warmer. But the coolists say it will be cooler because of natural cycles, which are now beginning to have a cooling effect. Here’s why I feel us coolists are going to win:
1. CO2 is wildly exaggerated as a climate driver.
2. The PDO has entered it’s negative phase – meaning more La Ninas in the pipeline.
3. Solar activity is low.
4. The AMO is also about to head towards its negative phase.
5. We are overdue for a disruptive volcano.
6. A growing number of scientists say so.
The following is the latest list of pledges (user names and amounts in US$) in alphabetical order. Newcomers are welcome! (See below on how to bet). Amounts are in US dollars.

This bet by the way is named after the initiator: warmist Rob Honeycutt, who has pledged to match all the bets from the cool side, up to $5000.00, and is happy about the money from the losers going to charity (That’s very generous of him :)). I’ve been in e-mail contact with Rob, and he really is a good guy. He means well.
And if the cool side can get that many pledges from the coolists, then Rob will start looking for more warmists to join in to up the ante. Let’s see how high we can get this.
Payment will be made 2021, and so if you think inflation and/or lack of interest paid, etc. will erode the amount, then just add a little more to your pledge. Again, we want to keep it simple.
If you are interested in joining this bet, you can read how to:
JOIN THE CLIMATE BET FOR CHARITY 
It’s very uncomplicated. Just leave a comment making your pledge, and I’ll put your user name, e-mail address and amount on a list. That’s it! We’ll come knocking at your door in 2021 (if you lose). And hey – it’s for a good cause.
The coming decade is going to settle the science
In fact, it may take only a few years. Here’s the life-story of the AGW scare:
1980s: AGW scare was born.
1990s: AGW scare lived.
2000s: AGW scare was killed.
2010s: AGW scare will be buried.
The oceans are cooling, and cold winters are returning, which is bad news for the planet. We’d be much better off with another one or two degrees of warming. The latest tree ring study we saw in Science clearly shows that warm is better. I hope that us coolists lose this bet. But I doubt we will.

"The US is to stage its largest ever day of protest over the climate crisis, with tens of thousands of students joined by adults in abandoning schools and workplaces for a wave of strikes across the country. Climate strikes will take place in more than 1,000 locations in the US on Friday, with major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. Globally, more than 4,500 strikes are planned across 150 countries. The young strikers’ totemic figure, the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, will take part in the New York walkout and will speak to massed protesters in Manhattan. Authorities in New York have announced that its student population of 1.1 million is able to skip school to attend the strikes. In March, more than 1 million school students took part in a global climate strike but Friday’s iteration is likely to be swelled further by adults encouraged to walk out of their workplaces in support of the young protesters, who are demanding a halt to fossil fuel projects and a complete shift to renewable energy. Dozens of companies, including Patagonia, Ben and Jerry’s and the Guardian, will support striking staff, with major unions also backing the walkouts. Thousands of websites, such as Tumblr and Kickstarter, are set to “go dark” as tools are downed on Friday lunchtime. Hundreds of doctors have written medical notes to excuse students from their classes due to the threat posed by the climate crisis. “This is going to be the largest mobilization for climate action in history,” said Alexandria Villaseñor, a 14-year-old who has been protesting outside the UN headquarters over climate every Friday since December. “World leaders can either listen now or listen later, because our voice is only going to get louder as the climate crisis gets more urgent. Adults need to step up and support us. Civil disobedience breaks the system and once it’s broken it’s an amazing opportunity to make things better.” Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, an 18-year-old from San Francisco, said she will be striking because “I want children of my own and I want them to have a better life than me. I don’t want that to be taken away by climate change.” Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. “We are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,” Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style economic mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A parallel protest will take part in New York, highlighting the impact of the climate crisis on people of colour and to mark the second anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico. In Seattle, more than 1,500 Amazon employees will strike over the company’s climate policies. The strikes have been backed by several cities. “When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm,” read a joint statement by the mayors of New York, Paris and Los Angeles. “Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity, are doing just that.” The sprawling strikes represent a remarkable escalation of Thunberg’s decision last year to start skipping school on Fridays to protest against inaction by the Swedish government over the climate crisis. A global movement has since grown from the 16-year-old’s stand, and young people have expressed outrage that their generation is being left a world with increasingly punishing heatwaves, storms, flooding and societal unrest. Thunberg, who has abjured plane travel, arrived in New York on a solar-powered racing yacht last month and has since become a focal point for the climate movement, appearing on talkshows and in Congress to excoriate its members. She has also met Barack Obama, who called her “one of our planet’s greatest advocates”. Her US sojourn will culminate with the UN climate summit, to be held in New York on Monday. She will address world leaders who have assembled to help revive the flagging international effort to avoid disastrous global heating. The US and Brazil, led by nationalist leaders disdainful of climate science, have slowed momentum, with a UN report last week warning that the required ambition is lacking among most countries. “The audacity of kids simply asking leaders to lead is extraordinary. We are indebted to them,” said Rachel Kyte, special representative for the UN secretary general for sustainable energy. “They are rightly impatient. “Not every country is aligned to the need for fast action. The hope is that the US will join in at the point where public opinion is able to influence the national voice more than it does today.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe AGW religion in Germany is in deep trouble. Consensus is crumbling. the science is coming under attack.
It’s taken a awhile, but slowly and surely, Germany, once the premier power in science, is beginning to ask questions again. When lectures and seminars questioning climate science take place within academic circles and at German universities, then you know something is afoot.
Skeptic blog Readers Edition posted yesterday a clip of a seminar here by Professors Dr Klaus Landfried of Heidelberg and Dr Werner Kirstein of the Institute for Geography at the University of Leipzig before an audience at the University of Leipzig. The seminar is titled:
 “Where’s The Climate Change?”

Dr Kirstein opens the seminar and expresses his surprise that so many people are in attendance, some travelling from far away. The introductory part is then handed over to Professor Dr Klaus Landfried.
Professor Dr Landfried reminds us that a university is one of the few places in society where questions can be asked freely, where answers are searched, and then questioned again, and that without any restrictions, in an environment where debate is free.  Landfried says, “Religions have a hard time dealing with that.”

Landfried sets the tone of the seminar in no uncertain terms. This is a seminar that is absent of Rahmstorfian rules and Schellnhuber suppression.
At the 7:10 mark Dr Landfried slams any peer review process run by a good ol boys network.
In the world of science it is unavoidable, as humans are involved, that there are always attempts to portray truths as unacceptable, or to try to suppress them using methods that have nothing to do with science, and perhaps to even slander persons in an attempt shut them up. One method used here is to claim that everything that is good must go through peer review.
Dr Landfried delivers his speech forcefully, slamming peer review processes that involve a cartel of ideas, where some participants are excluded, and the others focus on concentrating their power. He reminds us that the misuse of peer review has always been a problem in science. Conflict in science is nothing new. For example, oncology has long been in bitter dispute.
At the 13-minute mark, Dr. Werner Kirstein starts his presentation. He addresses three main topics:
1. Are the IPCC model-based climate projections something to be taken seriously?
– uncertainties
– model deficiencies
– quotes Neils Bohr: “Prognoses are always problematic, especially when they look at the future.”
2. Sea level rise and glaciers
– Satellite photos show that Bangladesh is actually growing 20 sq km per year.
– Bangladesh land area is 44,000 sq km more than 10,000 years ago (4.4 sq km growth per year).
– Axel Mörner and Vincent Gray say the IPCC is corrupt.
– Rahmstorf projects 140 cm rise, Fred Singer 18 cm, the GFZ 2mm/yr, Mörner max. 20cm by 2100.
– North German coast: no detection of any acceleration in sea level rise.
– For the Pacific Micronesia, tectonics are at play.
– Islands on the Carolina Plate are sinking because the Carolina Plate is being forced down.
– Slams Rahmstorf’s and Schellnhuber’s Potsdam Institute for disinformation.
– Observations vs models, nature vs IPCC.
– Glaciers have retreated and advanced throughout time.
– In the last 10,000 years, glaciers have been smaller than they are today 2/3 of the time.
– Arctic ice is also within boundaries of natural variation.
3. The controversy and politics of climate change
Many meteorologists say about climate science: ” That’s political and has nothing to do with science.”
Dr. Kirstein: “Climate change? – That’s political and has nothing to do with normal science, it’s post-normal science.” With post-normal science, politics is at the forefront and science is just a tool to promote and drive “good” policy” by spreading fear and sticking to a dogma. In the early 1980s, “scientists” projected that all trees would die in Europe by 2005. Dr Kirstein then quotes Hans von Storch:
Climate science is not normal. It’s post-normal.
Post-normal science is always for a good cause or a political agenda. The target is to achieve de-industrialiasation – The Green Economy – The Great Transformation. The modus operandi: by spreading fear. Kirstein then quotes Maurice Strong, John Houghton, Stephen Schneider, and explains some of the recent and infamous PR scare campaigns. There’s even a Climate Change Hotel and tourism in Greenland where you can actually “see climate change taking place”.
After viewing Dr Kirstein’s presentation, it is absolutely no wonder that Hal Lewis called “climate science” the greatest fraud he’s ever seen. Dr Rahmstorf, Dr Schellnhuber, your sham is up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterComputers have been forecasting a wicked cold winter for Europe this year. Looks like it’s shaping up to be just that.
Later this week a blast of Arctic air is set to sweep across northern and central Europe, as a huge high pressure zone off in the Atlantic combined with low pressure system Gundula to east over the Baltic pump frigid air over the continent.
One meteorologist says such a weather pattern was last seen 70 years ago.
Wetter.com writes here:
Cold air will clash with moist air and, as a result, we will get more and more snow in the days ahead. But that’s not all. By and by the cold will tighten its grip, and by Friday temperatures will not get above freezing.
That is still not the end of it. This weekend temperatures nationwide [Germany] will be between 5 below and 13°C below at night. But hang on tight. Next week will be even colder – especially at night, where for example, the temperature in the Black Forest will drop to 26°C below!
And if that is not enough, then drive out to the Swiss mountains. 38°C below is the forecast during the night from Sunday to Monday!

German tabloid Bild newspaper reports here, quoting meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net:
The weekend will be bitter cold. Daytime highs will climb to only -8°C to -2°C . Nighttime temperatures will drop to -10°C. But in areas with clear skies and snow cover, especially in the central mountain regions, temperatures of -25°C will be reached.
Jung says such a weather pattern can stay around a long time before it goes away. He tells Bild newspaper:
When cold polar air is really there, than it’ll stick around for awhile. At the moment weather models show no end in sight for the coming cold wave. Quite to the contrary, the first weekend of December is going to be even colder, and there’s the threat of heavy snowfalls.
We’ll be getting temperatures like we would only expect in the dead of winter. A similar weather pattern led to the extreme winter in 1939/1940.”
And it’s still autumn officially!
Strange how the leaders of the world’s most climate-activist countries will be discussing ways to prevent warming in balmy Cancun Mexico just when their respective countries will be struggling in bitter cold. The Gods have a sense of humour.

"It’s possible that the implications of Justin Trudeau’s blackface episode (I can’t recall how often I blacked up, says Trudeau, 20 September) will be taken as simply personally unfortunate, the result of “a bit of fun” and careless playacting coming back to hurt his political prospects. It should make us ask serious questions. What kind of world is it where a white person getting made up to look like a black person can cause such trouble? Two recent Guardian articles pointing to our continuing refusal to talk about race, by Mithu Sanyal (Whisper it, but it’s finally OK to talk about race in Germany, Journal, 18 September) and Alex Clark (‘What we can learn is, be aware of the beginnings. Be aware of racism, be aware of nationalism’, Review, 14 September), are good places to start looking for answers.  The blackface issue is so powerful because it reveals white people’s almost total failure to appreciate the ongoing violence of racism and how this is fixed on the skin, making it the most basic index of racial identity. A white person “blacking up” cannot help but tease out all the most injurious features of race while allowing them to play in the inversion of its hierarchies and the fictions of its construction. Many people believe race does not exist and that, like the makeup, it can be wiped away. This is only possible if it’s not your skin that is in the game, a point powerfully made by the black American comic and civil rights activist Dick Gregory, to white audiences in 1962: “Wouldn’t it be a helluva joke if all this was really burnt cork and you people were being tolerant for nuthin?”Rod EarleShalford, Surrey • It should not surprise us that such revelations about Justin Trudeau appear right before a tight election. Trudeau has been fighting to maintain a federal carbon tax; powerful international oil interests would prefer that Canadians elect Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who voted against the Paris agreement, is a fierce opponent of the carbon tax and has promised to stop Trudeau’s “war on cars”. May I remind you that the world is burning. Please highlight our climate crisis and threats to the health of our Earth rather than gossip which is clearly politically motivated.Dr Pamela Jane SmithCambridge • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"I was born into a world in which my future and my past are uncertain. Born into a world where my inheritance is slipping into the sea. Born into a world where my people are going extinct. I am 20, and I am suing the executive branch of the federal government for causing the climate crisis. I am one of the 21 youth plaintiffs in the Juliana v United States climate lawsuit taking action against our government for denying us our constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. I am also a first-generation Garifuna-American. My people are an Afro-indigenous community originally from the island of St Vincent in the Caribbean. In the 18th and 19th centuries, we were pushed from our homeland on St Vincent by British colonial power, settling on the eastern coast of Central America in Honduras and Belize. Despite overwhelming adversity, we organized our community and emancipated ourselves to protect our future as a people. However, the struggle continues for me and my people. As sea levels rise and the coral reefs upon which we depend disappear, the Garifuna’s future is uncertain. Again, we are being pushed from the lands upon which we settled. The land that my family has inhabited for generations, the land that I am supposed to inherit, will be underwater in a few decades unless the federal government stops actively promoting fossil fuels as our primary energy source. Until the unprecedented Superstorm Sandy, my mom hadn’t had to prepare for a natural disaster since she left Honduras. She raised me in White Plains, New York, a place that for her, promised safety and relief from disasters like Sandy. During the hurricane, I spent days hunkered down in her bedroom without power as the storm raged around us. I was a terrified middle-schooler waiting for one of the many trees surrounding my house to come crashing down on us, just like I’d seen happen on the TV. The anxiety from that event and its immediate aftermath seven years ago is still with me. This anxiety is increased by the knowledge that the identities that I inhabit: first-generation, trans, indigenous, Latinx, black, youth; all make me uniquely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. That is why I have dedicated the past four years of my life to holding the federal government accountable for the harm it has caused and continues to cause me, by knowingly perpetuating the climate crisis. Like the youth in other famous civil rights lawsuits, such as Brown v Board of Education, we are demanding that the government address the injustices its policies have wrought to ours and future generations. In our lawsuit, we are not asking for money, but instead, seek a government-prepared climate recovery plan sufficient to protect our constitutional rights and ensure a climate system capable of sustaining human life. Like the Garifuna have done for centuries, we are fighting for justice, and for our survival. People of color, indigenous communities, low-income communities and young people face a significantly higher risk of experiencing the impacts of climate change I first learned of the institutional racism and injustice underlying our political system during the height of Black Lives Matter (BLM), a movement that brought increased attention to the police murder of unarmed black people across the country. Coming just a few years after Superstorm Sandy, a disaster that disproportionately impacted people of color in my community, it wasn’t hard to draw the connection between the systemic injustice highlighted in BLM and the climate crisis. Just as police, our supposed protectors, perpetuate violence on black bodies because of the color of their skin, our federal government is perpetrating violence on these same bodies through its policies that create and maintain our nation’s fossil fuel-based energy system and cause catastrophic climate change. As I dug deeper into this issue, I found that climate change has long been impacting marginalized demographics around the country and the world. People of color, indigenous communities, low-income communities and young people face a significantly higher risk of experiencing the impacts of climate change than the general populace and young people from marginalized demographics are especially vulnerable. One thing that is clear to me now is that the climate crisis is a social justice issue – and is having a profound impact on my life and my identity. What’s worse is that the executive branch of the United States government – a government, that, in theory, was created to protect us – has known that burning fossil fuels will cause climate chaos for more than 50 years. Instead of working to curb emissions, it has colluded with corporate interests – actively enshrining the fossil fuel energy system into our nation’s policies. Because of the actions taken by the United States government and the fossil fuel industry, my generation has never known a world free from the impacts of climate change. We must find new ways to fight by listening to the stories of our ancestors There is a lesson to be learned from my ancestors. No matter the adversity that we face, we must organize our communities against the systemic injustices driving climate change, or disappear altogether. We must find new ways to fight by listening to the stories of our ancestors. By looking back at the story of my people, of people all over this planet, tribes and communities who knew they had to do anything in their power to avoid losing everything. This decade is our last chance to stop the destruction of our people and our planet. This is our time to hold our government accountable for the actions it has taken, and continues to take, to perpetuate the climate crisis and to stand in solidarity with communities around the country and the world in our fight for a just future. This is why I will join millions in the street on 20 September for the Global Climate Strike. We have no choice but to act when the alternative is to sit and watch our world burn. We have no choice but to act when the alternative is extinction. Vic Barrett is a plaintiff with Juliana v United States"
"A hoax photo that claims to show rubbish left behind by Australian climate strike protesters is circulating on Facebook, despite being revealed as fake months ago. Though it lacks any verification, and was debunked in April, the image and false caption have been shared 19,000 times in 12 hours, and thousands of times from copycats. On Friday, an estimated 300,000 Australians, and millions of people around the world, took part in protests against inaction on the climate emergency. Hours later, an Australian pro-coal page reposted the photo, which originated in April. It was captioned: “Look at the mess today’s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park.” However, the photo is not from a climate strike, not from Friday and was not taken in Australia. It is from a marijuana-based festival called 420 held in London in April 2019. In Sydney, there was no climate strike held in Hyde Park on Friday. Nor was there in London, where the event was held outside the Houses of Parliament. Viral misinformation doing rounds. This pic is from an event in Hyde Park, London in April unrelated to climate protests. https://t.co/Ro1fcFLcyS pic.twitter.com/G5aaKLiDzd London’s Royal Parks authority had already addressed the hoax back in April. There's a lot of incorrect information doing the Twitter rounds this morning. This photo is the result of an unofficial event in Hyde Park on Saturday, not the #ExtinctionRebellion protestors in Marble Arch.It costs us millions to clear #litter every year. Please take it home. pic.twitter.com/F1JtAqmnVO According to the fact-checking site Snopes, the London marijuana event was held next to an Extinction Rebellion protest. The photo does show London’s Hyde Park but the rubbish was created by the 420 attendees, not climate protesters. According to organisers, Extinction Rebellion protesters helped clean up the mess made at the 420 event. Snopes says the confusion began due to ambiguous wording from a Facebook page THTC (The Hemp Trading Company) that was trying to shame 420 attendees to clean up. “This is #HydePark after #420,” it said. “Ashamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn’t be bothered to clean up after yourselves…#cannabiscommunity you can do better – you need to do better. After the misinformation began to spread, the THTC page clarified later, posting: “IMPORTANT EDIT: a lot of people are misreading this post. This was the aftermath of Hyde Park 420 – and was *cleaned up* by Extinction Rebellion crew.” This is from a totally separate event that took place in Hyde park. #ExtinctionRebellion activists went to help tidy up anyway because it grossed us out as much as it does you. In the UK on Friday, more than 300,000 people attended more than 200 events, making it the biggest environmental protest the UK had seen. An estimated 300,000 people also turned out in Australia, with at least 100,000 in Melbourne and 80,000 in The Domain in Sydney – not Hyde Park."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a clip I missed -broadcast late last year by German ARD television in a news show called Report MÜNCHEN (Report Munich). H/T to Rudolf Kipp, who commented at another blog. See video in German:
Report München on biofuels
It’s yet another glittering jewel of an example of the destruction wreaked by the AGW cult movement. It’s scorched earth policy to save the planet. Meanwhile cult leaders are profiting as the world gets burned. The clip description:
Indonesia: Instead of rainforests, more and more palm oil plantations. Palm oil for our kitchens, cosmetics and biofuels. Report MÜNCHEN shows the latest pictures from Borneo and the ecological catastrophe taking place there. A devastating climate result is the bottom line. Yet parts of the EU-Commission obviously wants to cover this up.”
Biofuel deforestation produces 20% of CO2 emissions
It’s the destruction of the rainforest in the name of climate protection. Clearing the land to make way for palm oil plantations. Prof. Jürgen Schmid of the Fraunhofer IWES Institute:
“We have recommended the German government to completely stop its support of bio-fuels.
The ARD calls the clearing of forests in Asia:
An ecological catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions.”
Unfortunately, huge areas of jungle have already been completely cleared so that palm trees can produce a relatively minuscule amount of biofuel to burn in Europe. Burning the biofuels will reduce CO2 emissions a tiny bit. But this is all offset, and then far far exceeded, by the CO2 that is released from the large-scale deforestation. Prof. Florian Siegert, University of Munich:
It is estmiated that the deforestation causes 20% of the total CO2 emissions on the planet.”
Producing 20% of the CO2 emissions to save a few tenths. A proud result of the destructive AGW cult movement. What do the EU leaders have to say? They are covering this up. Report Munich received classified documents showing that EU bureacrats suppressed this information and kept it out of the public’s view. In an e-mail:

Hypothetical values from an indirect land use change should be removed from the texts.”
Sustainability swindle
EU guidelines do state that primary forests may not be cleared to make biodiesel starting in 2012. But Report Munich calls this labelling fraud. Deforestation of primary forests is not restricted when it comes to clearing primary forests for palm oil for the food industry, and as a result, only a shift on paper takes place. That means rainforests may be cleared away also in the future for palm oil for food. On the old plantations, palm oil for biofuels will move in. Now you see it, now you don’t.
That’s how EU bureaucrats are saving the planet from the climate catastrophe. ARD TV calls it “greenwashing”. Prof. Jürgen Schmid calls it:
Sustainability Swindle”
The Fraunhofer Institute presented their urgent warnings to the EU. But the devastating results were simply deleted in reports – whitewashed. The final report on biofuels was only 10 pages long, and there was no mention of the rainforest devastation caused by the EU’s biofuel policy. Infuriated by the EU, the Fraunhofer Institute added their disclaimer to the report:
The final presentation of the results do not reflect the views of the Fraunhofer ISI.”
When confronted by journalists, EU leaders were quick to duck the brutal reality and busied themselves giving sustainability awards to corporations like Mercedes Benz for building bio-fuel cars. Meanwhile, the German government is even now ignoring the recommendations of its own scientific advisory board, and intends to go ahead in boosting the use of biofuels by the year 2050.
Says Prof Jürgen Schmid:
The German government’s target is to boost bio fuels share as a fuel to 90%. That is madness.”
But destructive cults are mad. And that’s the way the green movement is going ahead. That’s how to save the planet: Just burn it!
The video report was produced by Thomas Kiessling, Mike Lingenfelser (29 Nov 2010).

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s an example of what dissenting opinions have to face here in what was once called the land of poets and thinkers. (In climate science Germany is more the land of dogmatists and intolerants, unfortunately. But as I’ve said, that’s slowly changing).
Yesterday I posted a piece “Climate Science” Now Questioned At German Universities about Professor Dr Werner Kirstein of the University of Leipzig and a seminar he held last June called “Where Is The Climate Change?”
Taking apart “climate science” is not a real achievement in itself. The science has been crumbling rapidly for quite some time now. Dr Kirstein’s real achievement in this story is, however, daring to speak up against the climate science religion. To do so in Germany, one has to expect multiple character assassination attempts. Georg Hoffmann attempts just that, ridiculing not only Dr Kirstein, but the University of Leipzig as well.
Kirstein’s seminar at the University of Leipzig did indeed upset the climate clergy, not surprisingly, and so they have sent out an underling, Georg Hoffmann, to attack, ridicule and attempt to slap down Kirstein and the University of Leipzig, and it should all serve as a reminder to anyone else who might dare to speak up. Hoffmann wrote his hit piece yesterday at his blog site. The title in English:
Climate Hack Of September 2010 – Professor Kirstein And the University of Leipzig.
The highly acclaimed Climate Hack Of The Month Award for September 2010 goes to Professor Kirstein and his employer, the University of Leipzig. The claim made by Kirstein that “Greenland was mostly ice-free during the Middle Ages” belongs to the Top Ten of probably the most senseless statements ever made on the subject of climate change. Congratulations from the jury.

Here we have a person childishly ridiculing a distinguished professor and an entire university. Seldom do we witness such hubris in Europe, except of course in “climate science”. This is precisely what “climate science” dissenters have to deal with regulary. And such attacks are generously funded by European governments.
I watched the entire Kirstein presentation, and everyone knows what he meant with Greenland. Hoffmann is simply hiding behind his computer in Paris, or wherever, and attacking from the safety of his hinterhalt, like a true coward. He nitpicks and takes things out of context. Of course he cherry-picks his data at every opportunity, and applies post-normal science throughout.
Yet, we all know that if called out to debate face to face in public, people like Hoffmann are the last to show up. Open debate for post-normal scientists is foreign, and it has proven to be nothing but disastrous in the past.
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9082151
Before the debate
GW is a crisis:   Yes 57%  No 29%
After the debate
GW is a crisis:   Yes 42%  No 44%
Those were results at a time when belief in the climate religion was at its zenith. Today doubt is much higher. So expect more cheap shots to come out from the hinterhalts.

"Hundreds of thousands of Australians took to the streets on Friday as they called for greater action on the climate emergency in more than 100 cities and towns across the country. Organisers of the school strike for climate claimed about 300,000 people attended dozens of rallies, including an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne and 80,000 in Sydney. The unprecedented climate crisis protests were likely the largest public demonstrations in Australia since the marches against the Iraq War in 2003.  “I fight for climate justice because everyone deserves a safe future,” 17-year-old student Niamh told a crowd that spilled out of a Melbourne park and into the city streets. “The government is not supporting it yet, but together we will change that.” Sparked by the first climate striking student, Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, the protests have grown into a global movement. In Australia, they have garnered support from the wider environmental movement, but also from other non-profits and charities, unions and some businesses. Friday’s crowds doubled the size of the student strikes in March, organisers said. Protesters ranging in age from toddlers to the elderly chanted slogans such as “we are not drowning, we are fighting,” and held up signs and placards. Many were personally critical of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who is currently in the US to visit Donald Trump. Morrison drew criticism this week after confirming he would not attend the United Nations Emergency Climate Summit in New York. In Sydney and Melbourne, there were long lines to enter the rallies, which brought parts of both cities to a halt. Throngs of students, families, mums with strollers, officer workers and unionists filled Sydney’s Domain to hear from protest organisers, Indigenous students, Pasifika activists, and union leaders. Pacific climate warriors: “I have a right to set foot on my islands... to see its beauty and everything it has to give. My generation and generations to come have a right to stand on the same soil our ancestors did.”#ClimateStrike #sydney pic.twitter.com/b6asT8WDL1 Moemoana, 18, had come from Wollongong to the protest, and her homeland is Samoa. “I’ve come to fight for the Pacific,” she told Guardian Australia in the crowd. “Seas are rising and it’s affecting Pacific Islands, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, it’s a real threat and Australia needs to know that Pasifika are neighbours and Australia really needs to help out.” Marlie Thomas, a Kamilaroi high school student from Gunnedah, said she was attending the rally on the authority of her elders, not the department of education. “I’ve had to help collect bottled water for our family in Walgett,” she said, about the western NSW town which has run out of water after rivers dried up. Oscar interviews Zac who is losing his voice after leading the crowds in chants at the Brisbane #ClimateStrike. “It’s so great, chanting with all the other people for what we think is right”. pic.twitter.com/79pa58MUPH About 35,000 people attended a protest in Brisbane. Across Queensland, climate strikes had a very direct local message to match the ambitious global demands of protesters: a stop to the Adani Carmichael coalmine and action to save the Great Barrier Reef. Large crowds turned up in places torn between coal basins and the Queensland coast in places like Mackay and Townsville, which have mineworkers’ jobs and a tourist industry at stake. “We strike because our future is in their hands,” said Brisbane year 12 student Morgan. “Our very existence sits precariously on the shoulders of politicians who care more about whether almond milk can be called milk than they do about climate change.” Esther Plummer (13 years old) interviews fellow climate strikerJasper (15 years old) about why he is attending the #ClimateStrike in Byron Bay. pic.twitter.com/YTrFpOJrC3 In Melbourne, where the protests coincided with the last day of the school term, the rally packed out Treasury Gardens and spilled onto Spring Street, where the state’s parliament sits. “I feel like there isn’t going to be very much of a future, or if there is, it will be very short unless we do something,” said Michaela Pam, 15, who took the day off school to attend. But the Coburg High School student told Guardian Australia of the large crowds: “It makes me feel really happy. You get a little bit of hope.” Some Coburg High students. The school said they could come if their parents let them. #climatestrike pic.twitter.com/uHmoydLa0z Melbourne school strikers #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/wtLI8WcoCV Melbourne organisers Niamh and Freya, 16, told the crowd the protesters did not blame those who worked in the fossil fuel industry for the climate crisis. “We understand the role fossil fuels have played in putting food on the table for families,” said Freya. “It’s vital we all work together, not against one another. It’s not about jobs versus the environment.” Large numbers also gathered in Australia’s other major cities. Organisers estimated about 15,000 attended a strike in the capital, Canberra, while there were about 10,000 people at rallies in both Perth and Adelaide. Organisers in Tasmania said 22,000 people attended an event in Hobart. Bob Brown, a former leader of the Greens and a giant of the environmental movement, said the crowds were larger than those during protests against the Franklin Dam in the 1980s. Students and protesters also gathered in smaller centres, from the beaches of Byron Bay on Australia’s east coast to the outback towns of Alice Springs and Katherine. In the Queensland town of Chinchilla, a lone striker, Ariel Ehlers, 12, staged her own strike. Organisations striking included 33 Australian unions, 2,500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, Domain and Intrepid, and faith institutions including the Anglican Church and Uniting Church, organisers said. Universities said they would not penalise students who missed classes to attend, while the Uniting Church synod for NSW and the ACT also allowed their students to strike. Catholic and Anglican church-run schools as well as NSW public schools said students should remain in class. The acting prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the rallies should have been held on a weekend so they didn’t disrupt businesses, schools and universities."

This from Reuters: Exclusive: Sierra Club sues over California solar plant. Hat tip: DirkH.
These guys don’t even know what they want. They’re against everything – and now even the things they once said would save the planet – like windmills, solar panels and crops for bio-diesel.
The report starts as follows (emphasis added):
A leading environmental advocacy group is suing the state of California’s Energy Commission over its approval of a giant solar plant, underscoring the growing challenge to the nation’s renewable-energy goals from within the environmental community.”
I suspect it’s because they have come to learn that these things are in reality ugly, dangerous, inefficient, expensive, and will end up doing real damage to wildlife, environment and landscape.
Now all we have to do is to get them to realize that CO2 is nowhere near as bad as they think, and that it actually makes the planet greener. That’ll take probably another 10 years to do, or a full-blown ice age.
Not only environmentalists are protesting the construction of solar plants, but regular folks and landowners have already had real success. Reuters:
In December, the Quechan Indian tribe won an injunction blocking construction of the Imperial Valley solar project, under development near California’s border with Mexico by NTR’s Tessera Solar.
The Calico plant was also under development by Tessera until the company sold the plant last month to K Road Sun, a subsidiary of New York investment firm K Road Power. Tessera has been struggling to find funding for its plants, which cost about $2 billion.
With the huge areas of land needed and overall opposition, it’s getting more and more difficult to find investors. These projects are turning into hot potatoes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAntarctic sea ice simply refuses to melt, and stubbornly remains at a very high level. In fact in 2010 it reached its second highest level ever since satellite measurement began over 30 years ago. Normally Antarctic sea ice peaks at about 18.3 million sq km around September 20.
But this year, Antarctic sea ice reached that value already on about August 9 or so – over 5 weeks early! I’m using the graphic below to draw up these statements.
Stubborn Antarctic sea ice refuses to melt. 
In 2010 Antarctic sea ice remained at or above the normal high peak (18.3 million sq km) for well over 2 months, from early August until late October. That’s quite awhile for the ice to hang around. I bet lots of penguins are happy about this.
Granted I haven’t gone back and taken a look at the stats over the years, but I doubt you’ll find very many years where this has happened. So you just have to laugh when physicists impostoring as climate scientists tell you the Antarctic is in trouble. 
Fact is, it’s the climate scientist impostors who are in trouble, as we expose day by day. Don’t be surprised if soon another model or paper comes out claiming global warming is causing more ice! Read here. Call it desperate pre-emptive damage control on their part.
Global sea ice
Overall global sea ice was steady until about 2004, then declined for a few short years. Since 2007 it has been trending upwards. We’re at where we were about 20 years ago.
Total global sea ice is trending a recovery. 
Many are now predicting a recovering Arctic over the next couple of years, like Joe Bastardi. With no further ice melt, the peculiar absence of tropical storms, and bitter winters returning, it all means alarmists will have to be content with the meager pickings of isolated heat waves, floods or droughts.

The usual German media outlets today feature the usual scientists who are out in force spreading the dreck science that global warming is leading to more weather extremes, and La Ninas.
These “scientists” are from the usual source: the alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).  Amazingly, one of these scientists even claims that the current La Nina is warm, and caused by global warming. 
The interviews come on the heels of Der Spiegel’s report late last week on a paper appearing in Science that shows just the opposite has been true in history: Warming leads to milder climates, which lead to human prosperity.
German Stern magazine did an interview with PIK scientist Anders Levermann, who is a lead author on the IPCC 5th Assessment Report on the subject of sea level.  Here’s his comment on the media-ballyhooed weather extremes we’ve been hearing about:
Certain is: In a rapidly warming world, we will experience more frequent stronger extreme weather events like flooding, droughts and high winds.”
Everything is caused by global warming – even the “record snowfalls in Germany”. Other than sci-fi reports from reinsurer Munich Re, I have yet to see one scientific report that links these weather events to global warming. In fact Accumulated Cyclone Energy last year reached a record low.
On the Australian floods, Levermann attributes them to warm waters around Australia, in combination with the current La Nina, which he says:
Together with the La Niña climate phenomena, which provides a warming of natural origin, the warmer water temperatures lead to the worst rainfalls in a 100 years. The higher ocean temperatures in turn are very likely a consequence of global warming.”
[Update: To be fair, Levermann here most likely meant: The higher ocean temperatures near Australia (and not the Pacific in general) in turn are very likely a consequence of global warming. I guess he wants to say the La Nina pushed the warm water to Australia, and this water is warmer than usual because of warming. The statement he makes above  is very misleading, to say the least].
On weather extremes in Germany this winter, Levermann serves up this observation (fantasy):

In any case one has to say that the snowfall of last winter was unusual. Also this winter was a record winter when compared with the past 100 years. Such 100-year records are tumbling one after the other, and it’s going to happen even more often in the future.”
Rahmstorf says there’s a connection (but he doesn’t see it yet)
The online Handlesblatt also features an interview with PIK Prince of Panic Stefan Rahmstorf about the same weather extremes. The Handelsblatt asks Rahmstorf if it is connected to global warming:
The planet is getting hotter and wetter. 2010, together with 2005, was the warmest year since measurements began, and it was also the one with the most precipitation. Also the increase in devastating floods can be explained by global warming says Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).”
Stefan Rahmstorf (Photo: PIK)
Everything today can be attributed to global warming. The theory is unfalsifiable. If it happens, it’s because of global warming. Anf if it doesn’t happen (droughts), that too is because of global warming.
The Handelsblatt then asks Rahmstorf if the floods in Australia and Brazil are not the results of the La Nina? Here’s Rahmstorf’s reply:
Of course these events are, in the forefront, traced back to La Niña. But the change between El Niño and La Niña is a cyclic phenomena occurring every three to seven years. But that does not explain why this year records which have stood for 100 years  have been broken. There are experts who believe that the fluctuations between El Niño and La Niña are more severe. Right now we are having an Extreme-La-Niña. In 1998 we had the most extreme El Niño.”
His colleague Levermann suggests it’s because of global warming. Note that Rahmstorf cites some experts who say so. But what does Rahmstorf himself believe? Handelsblatt:
 But I do believe that it’s still too early to robustly show there is indeed a change.”
This has been typical of Rahmstorf and PIK lately, having it both ways. Notice how he starts by claiming that the extremes are due to global warming, and that the ENSOs are getting more extreme too. But then he says he can’t robustly show a connection between global warming and ENSO extremes. It’s there, it just can’t be shown.
Just another day at the PIK. Doing all it can to link everything to global warming.

It’s the latest for teaching German kids the end of the world is coming, unless…!

It’s the year 2500 and what’s left of mankind is on the verge of absolute extinction. Climate change has taken its toll. The planet in no longer hospitable. The few people left live in caves and tunnels. What’s left of the protective ozone layer is about to get wiped out by a solar storm.
It’s the climate meltdown, and we’re right in the middle of it!
Their time is running out, as shown at the 0:54 mark, where a sort of Mann’s hockey stick is used to illustrate this. Something has to be done!
So a group of courageous heroes find a rickety time machine and decide to risk it all to try and go back in time in an attempt to avert the man-made climate catastrophe. Only hero Fay makes it through the time machine and lands in the year 2050.

There she tries to convince the people of what they are doing to the planet – but damn those sceptics and deniers.
San Francisco under water? Tornadoes in Europe?
Finally, Fay end up meeting cranky climate scientist Bent Svensson and begs him to continue his research on his clean fuel, which he has abandoned because his wife died. Can Fay convince Dr Svensson and save the planet?
Now only you can rescue the planet!
This computer game is sure to provide kids with hours of entertainment and education on living responsibly.
Actually, I’m a bit surprised that the end of the world has once again been pushed back 490 years. Al Gore said it would come in 10 years and Prince Charles said 2 years. Now it keeps getting postponed and we have to wait half a millenium.
If Fay had been clever she would have gone back to at least  2000 and disposed of the “deniers” and the HadCrut hacker (if only we knew who he or she was). 2050 seems awfully late. I’d would interpret that as having at least 40 more years to think about the problem. What’s the rush?
Two thumbs down.

"Jainey Bavishi is all business as she takes off from Battery Park to walk the perimeter of lower Manhattan. It’s a muggy afternoon, a breeze barely lifting off of the New York Harbor, after days of heavy rain. She maneuvers throngs of tourists, construction workers and suits streaming out of office towers for lunch as she walks north from the waterfront park toward the Brooklyn Bridge. In a skirt suit and flats, Bavishi fits in among lower Manhattan’s workday hustle. But there’s no one else with a job like hers: director of the New York City’s mayor’s office of resiliency. She is the woman tasked with protecting all 580 miles of New York City shoreline from more frequent and extreme storms and expected sea rise due to the climate crisis. “We have got a chance to really reimagine the waterfront,” she says, heading underneath FDR Drive past interim flood barriers erected by the city following Hurricane Sandy. There’s an air of promise and forward-thinking in her stride. “I think that’s really exciting,” she exhales. This walk with Bavishi is, in fact, an exercise in imagining: in March, the mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced an ambitious $10bn proposal to extend Manhattan’s southern coastline into the East River as far as 500ft. Bavishi’s walk from Battery Park almost to the Brooklyn Bridge is the roughly one-mile span proposed for expansion. It includes the financial district, sparkling residential towers and the luxury mixed-use community Battery Park City, where a one-bedroom condo is about $1m. Twelve miles north, in Hunts Point in the South Bronx, the waterfront outlines a much different scene. A stench rises from the sidewalks in the summer heat, open garages reveal heaps of auto body parts and cyclists swerve between box trucks that dominate the streets. About 13,000 people live in ageing apartment buildings at the center of this peninsula, lined on either site by heavily industrialized waterfront. Hunts Point residents and activists fought for years to increase access to the waterfront as well as address longstanding environmental issues. More recently they have engaged with the mayor’s office of resiliency, formed in 2014 to oversee New York City’s $20bn portfolio of programs to make the city more resilient to the climate crisis. In Hunts Point, residents reimagined a waterfront that addressed longstanding environmental injustices and poverty that persists in the area. The Hunts Point community spent five years developing a  plan for protective waterfront infrastructure doubling as public green space, a “Levee Lab” to study resiliency efforts and create local jobs, and a tri-generation plant creating low-carbon cooling and a micro-grid to supply backup power in emergencies. But around the same time de Blasio introduced his $10bn proposal, the office of resiliency decided it would not fund that plan, due to high cost and because Hunts Points residents do not live in the floodplain. That decision hit this community hard, one of several in New York City finding it can’t face a future of climate change without quality of life issues being addressed first. In preparing for its future, the city would have to confront injustices of its past, and some environmental activists fear the city is not up to the task. The mayor’s office of resiliency set a goal for holistic resiliency planning across the five boroughs, but there’s a lingering question: how does the city enforce waterfront protection for all, when some of it is home to billions of dollars of real estate, infrastructure and investment, and elsewhere it has been neglected for decades? As the climate crisis promises to lay bare the stark disparities of New York City, the answer has never been more pressing. ••• For the past five years, the environmental activist Angela Tovar has posted flyers, maps, renderings, artwork and a rally poster that reads “Pollution Isn’t the Solution” all over the South Bronx Community Resiliency Agenda Lab at the cavernous Hunts Point community hub called the Point. As director of community development at the lab, Tovar is constantly hustling about, running late today because a discussion about the Point’s community-led resiliency plan with the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ran long. “Our work on climate justice started a long time ago,” she says. “And it came from an understanding that there are a high volume of toxic substances in this area, which is also vulnerable to storm surge.” Tovar points to a large map with about 20 red dots marking the peninsula’s waterfront – they represent businesses with high volumes of toxic substances. She identifies the residential blocks between the waterfront as an “environmental justice community where about half the community lives below the poverty line, and there are really serious public health issues we know will be compounded by climate change.” Tovar then points to a chunk of the peninsula, the entire north-eastern half, occupied by the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, which spans 60 acres and supplies food to the entire north-eastern corridor. “Not only are we talking about a potential threat of storm surge hitting an environmental justice community, and hitting businesses with toxic chemicals, we are talking about how that would impact the food distribution center,” she says. Hurricane Sandy prompted the office of resiliency to focus its attention on protecting the food distribution center. Meanwhile, community organizers like Tovar had already been advocating for the city to also take stock of the poverty, isolation and longstanding environmental injustices across the peninsula. The office of resiliency ultimately decided to focus on strengthening buildings inside the food distribution center instead of moving ahead on a comprehensive waterfront resiliency plan. (Bavishi says the decision was made because the Hunts Point’s residential community is not located in the floodplain.) Her voice strains and head shakes recalling how that news came around the same time de Blasio announced his $10bn investment in building new land in lower Manhattan. “It felt like a tremendous slap in the face, to be honest,” she says. Tovar acknowledges that the $10bn is far from secured, but points out the South Bronx lacks even a promise of funding. “All we’re saying is make that same commitment to the most vulnerable communities in New York City,” she says. “Get up on stage, make that commitment and say: ‘Low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately burdened by climate change.’” Local activists have moved ahead on smaller projects with more modest amounts of city funding, such as launching a community wifi network resistant to power and internet outages. The Point also runs the Be a Buddy program, which is building a network of local volunteers who learn how to provide resources, aid and immediate support during climate emergencies like heatwaves or storms. “We just have to continue to move on our own,” Tovar says, with a hint of defeat in her voice. ••• In another borough on another waterfront, another underserved community has come up with their own program to train residents to help one another. It’s called Local Leaders and is a 10-week emergency preparedness training run by the not-for-profit Red Hook Initiative (RHI) out of a converted warehouse a few blocks from the Gowanus Expressway, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Unlike the South Bronx, Hurricane Sandy devastated Red Hook, transforming RHI into de facto recovery headquarters. The thousands of residents seeking help were primarily public housing residents – this neighborhood has the second highest concentration in the city. Red Hook embodies perhaps the greatest challenge facing New York as it braces for the climate crisis: nearly one-fifth of all housing units within New York’s floodplain are public housing, and the city’s public housing agency struggles to provide even basic services to residents. Tevina Willis moved into the sprawling public housing complex about a decade ago. During Sandy, she and her neighbors ran up and down stairs, hauling water and spreading information about available resources. She was one of the first graduates of Local Leaders after RHI initiated it in 2013 to empower residents with emergency preparedness tactics such as CPR and conflict resolution; now she facilitates incoming groups. “Local Leaders further connected me to my neighbors,” Willis says, “And it took off from there.” During an August block party hosted by RHI, a conversation with Willis about resiliency kept returning to housing. “Our electricity constantly goes out, every other day there’s an electrical fire in someone’s apartment,” she details over pop and rap music blasting from the DJ booth. “A lot of our tenants experience gas outages.” She points to a resident who recently went without gas for six months. Willis is helping spearhead the next phase for trained Local Leaders: “a social justice and community organizing campaign to fight for policy change” with a focus on improving public housing. “We need resiliency inside our apartments,” she says. On a quieter day, RHI’s chief strategy officer, Javier Lopez, spoke about the larger resiliency vision for the neighborhood. While the city has installed some interim flood protections since Sandy, a larger plan to install floodwalls, raise streets and improve drainage to protect housing has yet to be implemented. Like Willis, Lopez struggles to reconcile the planning process with glaring needs of public housing residents. “It’s hard to project the future when the present hasn’t been addressed,” he says. He spoke of a divide between low-income, marginalized residents and the scientific, architectural and urban planning community advancing resiliency plans. “Sometimes we walk into these meetings and the architects and scientists are coming in at a 10, and we’re at a two,” he says. “No one from the resiliency world has had the awareness to take into account that neighborhoods have faced structural racism and various forms of disinvestment,” he continues. “There are voices missing, there are areas of concern, there hasn’t been a restoration of what was lost since Sandy.” ••• Along our lower Manhattan walk, and again in a quick telephone conversation, I ask Bavishi how she weighs the needs of different waterfront communities in resiliency planning. “An incredible amount of community engagement,” she says. “Our goal is to be thoughtful and inclusive, recognizing there is no silver bullet and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We have to work with communities to figure out the right solutions for particular neighborhoods.” She points to an inter-agency plan developed in Edgemere, in Rockaway, Queens. Edgemere has been called one of the most neglected neighborhoods in New York City and is particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because it’s sandwiched between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. During Sandy, flooding from both waterfronts – one lined with a defunct landfill, the other a city-owned wasteland – debilitated the neighborhood. “We were able to engage communities in thinking holistically about what would make their neighborhood more resilient,” Bavishi says. The resulting plan includes buying hurricane-destroyed houses to turn into parks, transit upgrades, raising homes and the shoreline, building a new mixed-use complex and improving the public housing lining the bay. Sonia Moise watched the calm waters of the bay meet the fierce waves of the ocean from her bedroom window in Edgemere the night of Sandy. The promise of Edgemere as a more resilient neighborhood is overshadowed by her seven-year struggle to recover from that day. “There’s no amount of people who complain like we do about [recovery] work not being done the right way,” she says. “I honestly believe we were treated the absolute worst because of location.” Outside of her three-story home hoisted atop a slab of concrete, she mentioned how long it took to grow backyard grass because the property was built atop rocks and sand. This spring she wrapped a stormproofing renovation, funded by her savings as well as the city’s post-Sandy rebuilding program, Build it Back. But the saga isn’t over: she recently hired a lawyer to dispute the quality of work from Build it Back, which she feels will not sufficiently protect her from the next storm. “We need to feel we’re safe,” she says of her community’s lingering trauma recovering from Sandy. But there’s a larger threat beyond the next storm: Edgemere will be one of the first New York neighborhoods made uninhabitable by the climate crisis. There’s already a division emerging on Moise’s block: homes with raised elevation – like her own – and those still at ground level. “The people who haven’t raised their houses know they won’t be able to stay,” she says. The city offered to buy Moise’s property following Sandy, but she declined. “I don’t trust the city, that they’d give the money you want for your house,” she says. Would she consider selling if she knew she would get a fair payment? “Probably not,” she says, considering the grievances built up during the recovery process. “I have a disdain for the city.” So Moise will stay, as her neighborhood is both transformed by the climate crisis and the city’s efforts to protect it. On the cusp of such transformation, there’s a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere walking the streets – even a level of disbelief that Edgemere does, in fact, belong to the same city as lower Manhattan. ••• When de Blasio announced his ambitious proposal to expand lower Manhattan, he listed the reasons it was worth saving: home to a half-million jobs, 90,000 residents, the nexus of nearly all the city’s subway lines. He left out that the city and private sector have heavily invested in this neighborhood since the early 1700s, when it emerged as a financial hub, as other waterfronts became places to house poor New Yorkers, often alongside toxic industrial sites. Bavishi’s goal to holistically address it all is daunting, if not impossible. Funding sources to implement many of the city’s resiliency plans – including lower Manhattan’s – are uncertain. Implementation in neighborhoods such as Red Hook has taken longer than residents expected. Crucial city agencies such as the New York City housing authority, which oversees public housing along the floodplain, lack its own vision and funding for resiliency. And, as Tovar mentioned in the resiliency lab, De Blasio still has yet to get on a stage and acknowledge low-income communities are disproportionately burdened by the climate crisis. Bavishi ultimately acknowledges the office of resiliency does not have the capability to address all the longstanding concerns of marginalized communities. “There’s an urgency to climate challenges we’re facing and we want to take that seriously,” she tells me over the phone. “We also want to make sure we’re not raising expectations for other solutions that are out of sync with the resources we have.” So New York is left to see how its most vulnerable residents will survive as the city’s shorelines are transformed – when the ambitious resiliency plans fall through, when stormproofing can’t address day-to-day needs like safer housing. “Having an exciting, bold vision is not enough,” Tovar says of the Hunts Point resiliency plan, though she could be talking about the rest of the city. “I hope the city comes back to the table to think big and do something unprecedented, because we’re New York City. But how do we encourage them to do that?” • This article was updated on 21 September 2019 to clarify that on the Red Hook resiliency plan, while an early plan under a different mayor never panned out, the city says their newest plan is on time."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m a little overdue with the climate bet (FOR CHARITY) update. But here it is.
This bet is also known as the Honeycutt Climate Bet for Charity, named after Rob Honeycutt who first proposed this bet. You can find the background info here.
The cool side takes an early lead!
Will the new 2011-2020 decade be warmer or cooler than the last one? The first month, January – 2011,  came in well below the 2001-2010 average. Call it a 3-pointer for the coolists – a message to the warmists! We’ve taken the early lead. And looking at the La Nina that’s taken hold, that early lead will certainly grow. Is it going to be a blowout?
It’s a long ballgame though – 119 more months! Here are the bets so far (I hope I haven’t left anyone off the list. If so, let me know and I’ll repost the table).
The cool side bets so far:

Also add reader Mathhu ($100) to the above list. New total $5550.
And the warm side bets:

The warmists, though small in number, are indeed a generous bunch.
So far we (both sides) have pledged over $19,000.00. So no matter who wins, some good will come out of this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany's version of Stephen Schneider (Wikipedia)
I think some people are not aware of, or seriously underestimate, Germany’s contribution to this global warmist movement. It really isn’t scientific at all. It’s purely political. Science (junk science) is just one of the engines they use to propel it.
A reader brought my attention to an interview with Hartmut Grassl at the leftwing newspaper TAZ in Berlin. Grassl is one of the grand-daddies of the German global warming movement.
He was the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI), a member of the Enquête Commission, a main Kyoto Protocal player, director of climate research programs at the World Meteorological Organization, board member of the über-alarmist Munich Re re-insurer and also the Academy of Sciences in Hamburg. He’s kind of like the German version of Stephen Schneider.
Here’s how this seemingly distinguished individual views the growing scepticism (answers from the TAZ interview paraphrased).
On handling sceptics (paraphrased):
Have they ever published anything? In 99% of the cases, that’s already the end of the debate – their literature has nothing to do with science.
What motivates the sceptics (paraphrased)? 
Some get money from oil companies. Others are just people who are against everything. I used to try to convince them with scientific arguments, but it was hopeless. When I get e-mails from them they are highly aggressive and filled with exclamation points and sentences in block letters.
On Climategate (paraphrased)
They were released just before Copenhagen. They always get real loud before major conferences. In the USA the sceptics have been traditionally strong; a lot of money flows in part from the oil industry.
On storms and exaggerations (recall he is a board member at Munich Re!):

One also has to say that people who exaggerate climate change are not helpful. Some environmental organisations even claim that climate change leads to more storms.”
Are there any credible sceptics? (paraphrased)
Yes, but very few. Richard Lindzen from MIT in Boston for example: He doesn’t dispute CO2’s greenhouse gas, but doubts the feedback effects. The climate models have probably gotten better as a result of his critique. But, the debate over his objections is pretty much over.
On Henrik Svensmark
Also Svensmark has been refuted a number of times. But scientists are often unable to let go of worn out theories, especially their own.”
What about the geologists?
Of course there have been temperature rises of 4 to 5 °C over periods of 10,000 years. But today we are talking about a warming of  2 to 3°C within 100 years!
There you have it. Sounds like our reader Dana doesn’t he? I mean that in a friendly way. I really like his answer about Svensmark. It’s kind of like the black pot insisting the white porcelain vase is black.
And shall we add a few more exclamation marks to the last statement and put it in block letters as well? Which 100 years is he talking about anyway? The computer model-fantasy century?
Just for the record, so far in this observed century the temperature has risen 0°C. plus or minus a few hundredths.
Source: http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/rebuking-bs-with-more-bs/
Expected climate warming: +1.5 to +5.5°C.
This century’s trend so far:  – 0.2°C.
I think I’m going to post “This Century’s Trend So Far” every month.
But in the future I will not cheat. and use instead UAH and RSS, which below shows a slight warming of about 0.6°C per century, well below the IPCC scenarios.
So far this century, the temperature is showing a slight increase.

"Mark Butler wants to make one thing clear: the shadow minister for climate change and energy is not for turning. It wasn’t a mistake to pursue an ambitious climate policy in the 2019 election and “we are not going to change our position to get to a level of profound irresponsibility [on policy], like the government”, he tells Guardian Australia’s politics podcast. “Our position on climate is unshakeable.”  This declaration might seem hard to square with Butler’s swingeing self-assessment of just over a week ago. The shadow minister, a leftwing powerbroker and close ally of Anthony Albanese, used a speech at a book launch in Canberra to send a message to colleagues that there can be no sugarcoating Labor’s election loss, and all policies, including the ones for which he had direct portfolio responsibility, needed to be subjected to a “ruthless and unsparing” review. Butler says that ruthless and unsparing inquisition is already in train, with campaign reviewers Jay Weatherill (a long-time friend and factional ally) and Craig Emerson considering the impact of various policies on the May result, including his in climate and energy. But he insists the scope of the official reflection is policy detail, not core principle. “Our principles on climate change are utterly clear and unshakeable.” He’s not yet sure which specific election commitments survive the cull, and which don’t, but Labor, he says, will implement the Paris agreement, look for policies that will keep warming below 2C, move to net zero emissions by 2050 and set medium-term emissions reduction targets “that are consistent with these principles and guided by the best available scientific and economic advice”. As well as looking at how to recalibrate the policy offering within those fixed parameters, Butler says Labor is also looking at its messaging. He says Labor has not been clear enough in the past that the transition in coal communities that will happen as a result of decarbonisation is more a function of decisions being made by trading partners in Australia’s major export markets than of domestic climate regulation. He says it is hard to separate out what is happening globally from what is happening locally and communicate that comprehensively when Labor is being wedged on both the right and the left, but he says “that is the challenge, to try and make those things a little clearer”. Butler says working on the interface between Labor’s climate policies and the viability of coal communities in regional Queensland and the Hunter Valley is “something we are going to have to work hard on dealing with over the next couple of years”. “Decisions taken by our trading partners have a very real impact on regional communities … I understand why people feel so passionately about this, and want to have some agency in it, but it is our responsibility as politicians to speak truth. What happens to mines, whether they can wash their face, is not going to be determined at all by what happens in [Canberra] – it’s a direct function of the export market.” He says while Labor understands the backlash in coal communities that has prompted fellow frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon, who represents an electorate in the Hunter, to speak out more assertively and positively about coal – he argues there is no substantial internal dissent about climate ambition. He says the new Labor MPs who have entered parliament post-election have made it clear they believe climate action is a core part of the social democratic project in 2019. But he says the political environment, for Labor, remains fraught. The Greens, with crossbench backing, are proposing to bring forward a parliamentary motion declaring a climate emergency. Butler says it is abundantly clear there is a climate emergency. “I’ve said so in the parliament on a number of occasions.” But he says there is also zero prospect of that motion getting up in the current parliament, and he’s “not sure it is realistic to have a debate”. He says some in the Coalition are also emboldened by the May victory, and as a consequence of the voter affirmation, there will be a centre of gravity in the centre right that wants to keep weaponising climate change as an issue. Butler says the past decade in Australian politics has demonstrated there is a “business model” in division, and Labor has washed up consistently since the Rudd period on the wrong side of bursts hyper-partisanship on the left and the right. While he has concern about some in the government digging in and declaring climate change “always has to be weaponised” – he also thinks it is possible Scott Morrison will shift on climate during the coming term, particularly if the Australian community remains vocal on the issue, and business also continues to demand policy certainty to allow it to deal with carbon risk. He says for people who want practical climate action, as opposed to rhetoric, bipartisanship remains “the holy grail”. Butler says Morrison is not Malcolm Turnbull on climate, and not Tony Abbott, but somewhere in the middle. He suspects the prime minister has no “deep beliefs” on the issue, but that could enable him to pivot to a more plausible policy position in the event he makes a judgment that climate change is harming the electoral prospects of the Coalition. Perhaps Morrison, he says, can take “some baby steps to break down the culture war”. He says while there is a significant risk climate change will become even more polarised in Australia as citizens become more frustrated and angry with the lack of policy action, and elements of the Coalition seek to weaponise the issue against progressive parties in contests in the coal basins – community organisation and action is very important over the coming parliamentary term. “It is really valuable to have the community put pressure on this building,” he says. Butler says all the survey evidence he has seen indicates Australian voters are alarmed by the lack of policy action on climate change, and the issue rates second behind concerns about cost of living pressure. He says he is “utterly convinced” that public opinion in favour of action is “broad, deep and growing”. Politicians, he says, need to be particularly aware that young people are hugely motivated on climate change. Butler has teenaged children and meets regularly with young activists. “I can see it in their eyes,” he says. “They think our generation is from a different planet.” He says there is a risk of climate change widening the generation gap, which is more substantial now, he thinks, than at any time since the 1960s, “and we know what happened out of that” – good things, he says, “but a lot of turmoil”. He says the challenge of the term will be to try and keep moving forward and to build a constituency for change. “We can’t continue in the next decade to have the wars we’ve had in the last decade. The last decade was supposed to be the critical decade. I don’t know what beyond critical is. “If we get to 2030 with the level of inertia we’ve had over the last decade, then we have profoundly let down our children and grandchildren”."

"There is a celebrated line in Jared Diamond’s Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive, his bestselling study of ecocide and sudden social implosion. Referring to the “self-inflicted environmental damage” on Easter Island by deforestation, Diamond asked: “What did the Easter islander who cut down the last palm tree say while he was doing it?” While there has been much academic controversy about the accuracy of his shorthand for what happened on Easter Island, what remains, however, is a powerful and affecting metaphor, one ever more resonant in the midst of the escalating global climate emergency. The question “What on earth are we thinking?” is, today, no longer an experiment in supposition. We can see the shape of the calamity and measure our responses and the hypocrisies and contradictions inherent in them. Confronted by a climate emergency on a vast scale, and with the widespread failure of our political leaders, we continue to behave as if someone else – anyone else – will solve the problem, rather than tackling it ourselves. So we worry. And we continue to consume. And sometimes we consume as a way of escaping the worry of consuming – even as we struggle to step back and see the wider, and blindingly obvious, picture. It is a cycle that has placed a well-founded sense of anxiety about humankind’s future, perhaps not experienced so viscerally since the depths of the cold war and the fear of nuclear annihilation, against a profound sense of powerlessness. Solutions can seem beyond our reach as individuals and, if solvable at all, are in the hands of governments. There are, then, deep and pressing reasons to be desperately worried. But there are also reasons for optimism. Alongside a wider democratic crisis, last week’s climate strike – and the wider Extinction Rebellion represented by figures such as the teenage climate campaigner Greta Thunberg – exists as a potent reminder that activism is not simply about lobbying the seats of power but about our power. As individuals, we can shape the culture, societies and politics we live in and drive them towards better results. In the heat of political debate, we forget sometimes the importance of individual acts While it is easy to be cynical about the impact of protest in an age of populism, where politicians seem determined to find ways to become ever less accountable, the global reach and scale of last week’s strike suggest a shifting of public opinion. Where once events such as Climate Camp could attract a few thousands, mainly committed activists, the climate strike has attracted vast numbers across the world, many of them protesting for the first time. If we need leaders such as Thunberg, it is as a reminder of the importance not only of organised action but of what we can and should do for ourselves. It is a philosophy that was best summed up by the US philosopher and educator John Dewey in The Ethics of Democracy. Dewey rejected the idea that democracy should be confined to narrow ideas of government, political institutions and electoral mandates. Rather, he argued, it should be seen as a way of life, recognising that it is individuals and their intrinsic interactions with society that make majorities for change. A lesson that has sometimes been obscured is that we know who Thunberg is because of decisions that she made as an individual, as a person who refused to be intimidated by the scale of the problem and chose to organise for change. Some reject the notion that individual action – recycling or changing how much meat we eat or how we travel – is a sufficient response to the sheer scale of the problem confronting the planet. But this misses a key point about how we live our lives. In the heat of political debate, we forget sometimes the importance of individual acts. What we put in our breakfast bowl, small issue as it is, became – for me at least – something that made me think about the sustainability and provenance of what I ate when a friend pointed out that huge amounts of water are used to produce my once favourite almond milk.  Our individual moral choices – as consumers (and indeed how and whether to consume), how we vote, and what initiatives we support or we reject – might seem insignificant. But it is those small changes that can transform societies. Indeed, profound social change has often come incrementally. Consider the abolition of slavery, the movements for universal adult suffrage, trade union and gay rights. For the majority of us, the most powerful statement we can make beyond voting and occasional protest is in choosing how we live our lives in a consumer society and how we communicate those choices as part of the widening debate. While it is easy for figures such as Donald Trump to mock the demand for the phasing out of plastic straws or the need for low-energy lightbulbs, the reality is that he is pushing against a wider and far more sophisticated appreciation of environmental impact. What’s more, an increasing number of large corporations have internalised their vulnerability to changing patterns, making consumers more powerful than many suppose. A case in point is the major car manufacturers that have moved into electric vehicle production not because they feel it is the right thing to do but because they sense it is what customers will want in the future, because it is increasingly what future legislation will dictate and because they believe they will make money out of it. There are two crucial lessons from last week’s climate strikes. The first is that we need to overcome our own sense of paralysis in the face of an epochal moment of anxiety. The second is that we are more powerful than we think. And perhaps – just perhaps – the accumulation of small acts can lead to immeasurably larger outcomes. What is certain is that without asking what we are doing and acting on it, like the Easter islander with the axe in Diamond’s metaphorical question, we have absolutely everything to lose. • Peter Beaumont is a senior reporter on the Guardian’s Global Development desk"

"An artificial dune of nearly 2m cubic metres of sand has been created on the Norfolk coast in an innovative approach to slowing coastal erosion. In the £20m sandscaping scheme, enough sand to fill one and a half Wembley stadiums has been dredged from existing North Sea seabed extraction sites off Great Yarmouth and ferried to the rapidly eroding coastline beside the large gas terminal at Bacton. Nearly four miles (6km) of coastline has been replenished with new sand, deposited up to seven metres deep in places in an irregular form so the wind can create dunes to buffer the soft sandy cliffs. Although the sand is expected to erode and move with storms and currents, the project’s engineers say it will buy 15 to 20 more years for a coastline where seaside communities are predicted to have to move inland later this century because of rising seas caused by the climate crisis. Villages to the south of Bacton have blamed increased erosion on the concrete sea defences around the gas terminal. These have prevented the natural movement of sediment from sandy cliffs drifting southwards to replenish neighbouring beaches. The new mobile defences are calculated to work with the longshore drift which will carry the sand southwards where it will protect other coastal villages that are increasingly vulnerable to the climate crisis. It is the first scheme of its kind outside the Netherlands where the Zandmotor project used 10 times as much sand to protect a half-mile stretch of coastline in south Holland. The Dutch engineering company that designed the project has identified up to 20 coastal locations where sandscaping could be used, including Lincolnshire and the shingle coast at Aldeburgh in Suffolk. The company is currently discussing with Cornwall county council a potential sandscaping solution in Penzance where coastal erosion threatens the railway line. Jaap Flikweert, the coastal management adviser for Royal HaskoningDHV, said the Norfolk project was “a little nephew of Zandmotor”. “It’s less radical and it looks like a big, slightly more curvy beach nourishment scheme … it sticks out less from the shoreline but this is the best concept for the clients,” he said. Local people at Walcott in Norfolk – where the 2013 storms wrecked homes – welcomed the scheme but pointed to the loss of 1 metre of sand from the lower part of the beach since it was placed there in August. “A lot of it seems to have disappeared already,” said Ken Crowe. “I hope it does what it set out to do. Time will tell.” “People say the beach used to be like this 60 years ago,” said Cathy Kerby. “It’s improved the beach for everyone … we trust the experts know what they are doing and it will work.” According to Flikweert, some sand will be moved by the tides and currents and will disappear on to offshore sand banks in the winter but is expected to return in the summer. “That’s the dynamic of the beach. Of course it looks worrying, especially for local people, but that’s how it works.” The Zandmotor scheme in south Holland has surpassed initial expectations. The natural sea defence was expected to last for 20 years but a recent analysis suggested it could last twice as long. The Bacton project caused controversy in the spring when netting placed on the cliffs prevented returning sand martins from nesting in their regular holes. However, according to Natural England which monitored the sand martins, the birds dug new nest holes nearby and enjoyed a successful nesting season with as many birds as before. The new sand is also expected to provide habitat for shore-nesting birds such as ringed plover. Two-thirds of the £20m British scheme has been funded by the owners of Bacton gas terminal – including Shell – with £5m from the Environment Agency and additional funding from councils. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “The climate crisis requires innovation and collaboration between countries, organisations, sectors and communities. The Bacton to Walcott scheme is a model for other climate resilience projects, protecting key national infrastructure while also delivering added coastal protection to the local villages.” The Bacton gas terminal brings ashore 20% of the UK’s gas needs and is designated critical national infrastructure. When the terminal was built in the 1960s it was 100 metres from the sea but this had dwindled to 20 metres before the 2013 storms. After these storms, in places the sea was just 10 metres from the terminal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn my last post, I wrote about some German politicians who have woken up to the fact that energy saving lights are highly toxic, and dangerous to use in households.They now want to have them banned, and bring back the old incandescent bulb Edison brought us 130 years ago. I also posted a link to a shocking German documentary that exposes the reckless recycling of the mercury-laden bulbs.
Parts 2 and 3 of the documentary show the horrific handling of the used ESLs, which I describe here in English.
Part 1/3: The North Sea island of Nordeney changes over to energy saving lights in a project with Philips
The 2009 report on NDR German television investigated the energy saving lamps (ESL) in detail and found it is probably far worse for the environment than any one could have imagined. In Part 1, the North Sea island of Nordeney wants to eliminate all incandescent light bulbs, and thus become a model for the world. So Norderney teams up with ESL manufacturer Philips to replace all normal lights with ESLs.
Citizens expressed their concerns about the toxic mercury in the lamps. But the Philips spokespersons downplay the risk and tell lies about the risk. The TV documentary asks the question: “Are ESLs really that good for the environment?” The answer to this question becomes shocking when all factors are examined.

Part 2: The ESLs are transported and reloaded over hundreds of kilometers, leaving a trail of toxic mercury and broken lamps behind. 
As Part 2 shows, many of the residents of Nordeney are worried about the toxic mercury, and want to know how the ESLs are to be safely transported off the island once used. Is it possible to put them in containers without breaking and releasing mercury? In a town meeting with citizens, a Philips sales manager simply answers that it is not the responsibility of the manufacturer, but rather that of the recycling companies. Here the Philips spokesmen underplays the hazards of their ESL’s.
The citizens want to know if recycling companies properly handle the ESLs? To answer the question, the NDR reporter follows the entire recycling route of the ESL. What he finds is horrific.
Taking the old lamps back to the shop
Part 2 of the documentary shows that shops gladly take back the ESLs once used, and carefully collect them for recycling. When you buy a new lamp, then just bring back the old one. The shops collect the old ESLs and a disposal company later picks them up and takes them to a disposal centre. But as you will see, the route to recycling is one that is riddled with released mercury and broken lamps. Work conditions for workers are horrendous.
Toxic work conditions
Used ESLs first are first collected at the Müllumschlagstation (Waste Gathering Station) on Norderney. As the NDR reporter shows, the Müllumschlaganlage Norderney is poorly equipped to handle the old ESLs. The company doesn’t have the proper containers for storing and transporting them. As a result many of the ESLs break and release their toxic mercury into the environment. Here a worker handling the broken ESLs is asked if he was afraid of the mercury. He replied,
“No, we wear gloves – and we have been immunised.”
Immunized against mercury? The disposal company spokeswoman then explains that the correct containers for holding the old ESLs are actually wire mesh boxes, but they don’t have any in Norderney, and then adds that ESL breakage is rare anyway and so it isn’t a real problem. But as the reporter shows, there are broken ESLs everywhere.
Once the lamps are sorted, trucks pick them up and transport them off from the island. Where do they go next?
Unloading and reloading – broken lamps everywhere
The reporter follows the truck on its trip from Norderney to the MKW disposal centre on the German mainland located in Grossefehn, just east of Emden. But here the facility is also not a recycling centre. It is just another logistics collection centre where the “improper” containers are unloaded and the lamps reloaded again (more lamps break). No recycling is done here. Here, the broken ESLs are sorted out by workers who only wear gloves and no masks. One worker is picking broken pieces and putting them in a paper box and brings them to a container – an open wire mesh container. When a wire mesh container is full, it is picked up by a truck and the journey continues.
More unloading and reloading – more broken lamps

//-->




From Grossefehn the truck transports the ESLs to a 3rd location where there are many more wire mesh containers filled with old broken ESLs exposed to the air. At this third location, ESLs are also only collected, and not recycled, and then sent to yet a 4th location. But where? The reporter then follows the ESLs, now held in the “correct” wire mesh containers, all the way to Bad Oeynhausen, several hundred km away. But at this location, the reporter is not allowed to film.
The reporter does, however, find out that the next location for the old lamps is the DELA recycling company near the city of Essen. By now the old lamps have travelled more than 600 kilometres since leaving Norderney. Many do not even survive the trip. And the energy the lights had saved by consuming less electricity is certainly used up by the long and complicated logistics chain.
At DELA, the manager spoke openly about the recycling process, proud to be a part of protecting the environment. On the subject of breaking ESLs, he assured that it happened very rarely. Says manager DELA Ralf Kölzer:
Broken glass is immediately sorted out and there is practically no breakage in the wire mesh containers. The amount of breakage is negligible.”
But the reporter then shows a truck being unloaded. As the truck is opened, many small shards of mercury contaminated glass fall to the ground. No problem though. Two workers simply sweep up the broken contaminated glass and throw it away.

Part 3: Horrific work conditions at the recycling plant
Finally at DELA, the 5th location, recycling begins – first the ESLs are unloaded from the mesh containers and thrown into a crusher by hand. The workers here are not even wearing any type of masks. “No problem”, says manager Kölzer, “The mercury vapours are simply removed by the overhead vacuum hood”. The crushed material is then separated according to size and type. The crushed and sorted material is then packed into so called Big Bags (you can see a cloud of dust blowing out from the bag when a worker moves it).
Recycling the ESLs consume lots of energy
The ESLs from Norderney are also crushed in Bad Oeynhausen and then delivered to DELA in big bags. There the crushed material is separated and goes through a complex process that requires a lot of energy. How much energy? No one can answer that question. EU bureaucrats say that the energy savings are worth it, even with the mercury problem. Environmental groups like Greenpeace are also active supporters of the ESLs. But Greenpeace in Hamburg refused an interview with NDR.
I also tried to get a comment from Greenpeace, but got nothing.
Nowhere is it possible to find a complete life cycle study on CO2 and energy that compares ESLs and standard lights. More important, what about the mercury in the environment? What about the health of the workers?

The NDR reporter also researched to see if the ESL lights really do last longer than the normal lights and use less energy. The results show that they do not.

"Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist, has tapped into a global passion for change from the outdated, exploitative system to a holistic and responsible one (Thunberg tells US Congress: ‘I want you to take real action on climate’, 19 September). The industrial paradigm separates materials from their histories. Forests may have been torn down, lakes polluted, people and animals displaced, but the consumer doesn’t know this. Society has taught us that it is essential to have the latest product and not to question where it came from or who was hurt in the process. The need for change has to be now.  Sometimes it is hard to know what to do. People have been led by consumerism for so long that it is difficult to see that there is another way, but there are many practical things we can do, such as: don’t fly unless absolutely necessary; eat less meat and dairy; plant a tree; create a garden with shrubs and flowers that will attract wildlife; line-dry clothes; unplug electronic devices; turn lights off when not needed; drive less; grow your own vegetables or eat local produce; don’t buy fast fashion; ask where products have come from.  Some of these will inevitably lead to a change in lifestyle, but if we do nothing our precious planet is at risk. We need to care for this planet like it is our own skin. It is time to look upwards into the sky and realise that there is nowhere else for us to go and to value this beautiful place we call home.Diana SandersLlanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy • On 20 September, many people will strike to raise awareness of the climate crisis and encourage governments to take action to tackle it. While this is a worthwhile endeavour, there’s no need to wait for a special date to commit to saving the planet. If you truly want to combat climate change, you can start today by removing meat, eggs and dairy from your shopping list. Each year, humans kill 60 billion land animals for food – that’s almost 7 million every hour. All these animals produce massive amounts of waste, which releases powerful greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. Animal agriculture is the single largest source of both methane and nitrous oxide, greenhouse gases that are, respectively, 25 and 300 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. A person who follows a vegan lifestyle produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide than a meat-eater and uses 1/11th of the oil, 1/13th of the water, and 1/18th of the land. That’s why the United Nations has stated that a global shift towards a vegan diet is essential to combat the worst effects of climate change, and research from the University of Oxford has found that going vegan is “the single biggest way” to reduce our environmental impact. So by all means take part in the strike for the climate – but remember that change starts on your plate and choose planet- and animal-friendly vegan meals.Sascha CamilliPeta Foundation • We cannot forget the rural poor in Africa as we tackle the climate crisis. Your recent article covering the Bloem report (Fighting climate crisis by avoiding meat ignores poor countries’ needs – report, 17 September) has confirmed what we have known for a long time: we need country- and community-specific solutions to address global nutrition and the climate crisis. Meeting sustainable diets in rural Africa remains a challenge. With livestock traditionally playing a significant part, the crucial question is of how animals are managed going forwards. In holistic, integrated farm systems, livestock can play a part in sequestering carbon, as well as ensuring that children grow up free from the lifelong effects of stunting due to malnutrition. With this in mind, the addition of livestock to small-holder farms in rural Africa cannot be tossed aside; it is still the sustainable solution they so desperately need. A dairy cow can, for example, regenerate tired soil through manure, and provide essential nutrition from milk. Without access to processed protein alternatives like tofu, eggs and milk are the most effective way for rural African communities to prevent stunting in children. The difference between the industrial-scale cattle ranching that is destroying the Amazon and sustainable family farmers in Africa really cannot be stressed enough.Richie AlfordDirector of research and impact at the charity Send a Cow • There are many of us who would agree with George Monbiot’s heartfelt plea to prevent wealth due to its irrevocable destruction of the planet (For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth, 19 September). It seems screamingly obvious to me too. But how do we bring about the change required to achieve this. No wealthy person is going to voluntarily give up reaping the rewards of wealth earned by their hard work. Their wealth is stashed away in financial havens all round the world. Have we got to recognise that the capitalist system is flawed? As a child playing Monopoly, it was clear that once the expensive properties had been acquired by one player the game was over. In real life the same rule applies: only other rich people can play a rich person’s game. So, George, let us hear your suggestions of how we can stop people getting rich; how the capitalist system can be revised to share wealth more equally? How can we change the human mindset? The human race is very competitive and individualistic. That is why we are still here today. But if we do not find a way, I believe we could destroy ourselves and the planet. I see it as evolution turned on its head. We have to go in reverse. Angela FinchSydenham, London • The effects of the climate emergency are blindingly obvious. All around us, we can see the damage in gardens, allotments, parks and farms in south-east and eastern areas of England. Due to the record high temperatures and very low rainfall, many trees are in danger, vegetables and shrubs are collapsing or failing to flourish, and grass is turning brown. And the air quality is even worse than usual in many areas as a result, with consequent risks to health. But you would be hard put to gather any of this from watching or listening to weather bulletins on mainstream TV and radio. Over and over again, weather presenters cheerfully welcome the high temperatures and dryness with barely a mention of the damage being caused. Any chance of rain is usually described as a risk, rather than something desperately needed. How do weather presenters think that plants, trees and wildlife grow and flourish? It is especially worrying that the effects of the climate emergency are being normalised on mainstream TV and radio. The BBC and other broadcasters need to step up to the plate and properly inform and educate people about the effects of the climate emergency on our weather. Programmes about extreme weather or climate change don’t redress the balance when everyday weather bulletins normalise what is happening and ignore the extremely serious effects.Linda LennardSt Albans, Hertfordshire • Bill McKibben is so right (If the world ran on sun, it wouldn’t fight over oil, 18 September). A few years ago I wrote to the then Tory energy secretary suggesting that every new-build house be fitted with solar panels. The reply I received was that the cost to housebuyers would be excessive in an already inflated housing market. Yet an extra £7,000 on the mortgage for a £400,000 house is peanuts and would soon be recouped by energy cost savings. It would revitalise the solar industry, guarantee work in that sector for evermore, and help save our planet. Everyone I share this idea with supports it as being sensible and an easy part solution to the oncoming climate crisis – particularly if we continue to get such global warming and sunshine as we have seen these last couple of years. I cannot for the life of me think what objections governments can have to this in this day and age. I wish someone in authority would tell me.Rob Parrish,Starcross, Devon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Geological events often take their time, where a few millimeters per year is fast. But in this case, Mother Nature appears to have hit the super fast-forward button, demonstrating her awesome power.

Volcano Erta Ale (above) in northeastern Ethiopia has begun to gurgle and widespread seismic activity threatens to redefine the map (see below) of the African east near the Red Sea – and to do so very quickly. Der Spiegel (in English) reports on dramatic geological events now unfolding.
The area between the dotted lines could be submerged. (Photo source: Wikipedia.
Der Spiegel headlines and writes:

Violent Seismic Activity Tearing Africa in Two
Researchers say that lava in the region is consistent with magma normally seen on the sea floor — and that water will ultimately cover the desert.
The earth is in upheaval in northeastern Africa, and the region is changing quickly. The desert floor is quaking and splitting open, volcanoes are boiling over, and seawaters are encroaching upon the land. Africa, researchers are certain, is splitting apart at a rate rarely seen in geology.”

For now, the only thing holding back the Red Sea water from the Danakil Depression (see following graphic) are hills, and they appear to be sinking quickly, writes Der Spiegel.
Afar Drape. The Danakil Depression is located in the upper center. Graphic source: Wikipedia). 
And now that the Erta Ale volcano nearby is erupting – something no one anticipated, it could disrupt that last barrier that keeps the Red Sea at bay. Der Spiegel:
The magma coming out of Erta Ale has the same chemical composition as the kind that emerges from deep-sea volcanoes. The entire region increasingly resembles an ocean floor — one without water.”
Magma typically seen under the Red Sea is flowing underneath the continent, and eventually something has to give. Fissures are appearing at many locations in the region. According to geologist Tim Wright, fellow at the University of Leeds’ School of Earth and Environment:
The hills could sink in a matter of days”
Tectonic activity has increased recently not only in that African region, but has also spread into Saudi Arabia. De Spiegel quotes Oxford University’s David Ferguson on his predictions for volcanic eruptions and earthquakes in the region over the next decade, saying they will…:
  …become of increasingly large magnitude.”

"Millions of people demonstrated across the world yesterday demanding urgent action to tackle global heating, as they united across timezones and cultures to take part in the biggest climate protest in history. In an explosion of the youth movement started by the Swedish school striker Greta Thunberg just over 12 months ago, people protested from the Pacific islands, through Australia, across-south east Asia and Africa into Europe and onwards to the Americas. For the first time since the school strikes for climate began last year, young people called on adults to join them – and they were heard. Trade unions representing hundreds of millions of people around the world mobilised in support, employees left their workplaces, doctors and nurses marched and workers at firms like Amazon, Google and Facebook walked out to join the climate strikes. In the estimated 185 countries where demonstrations took place, the protests often had their individual targets; from rising sea levels in the Solomon Islands, toxic waste in South Africa, to air pollution and plastic waste in India and coal expansion in Australia. But the overall message was unified – a powerful demand for an urgent step-change in action to cut emissions and stabilise the climate. The demonstrations took place on the eve of a UN climate summit, called by the secretary general, António Guterres, to inject urgency into government action to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement. Carbon emissions climbed to a record high last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that there is little more than a decade left to act to slash emissions and stabilise the climate. Donald Trump will be at the UN headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead, in what will be seen by many as a snub. On Friday, the voices of key political leaders were noticeable by their absence. Instead it was a day for people to set forth their demands, ranging from a ban on new mining in countries like South Africa and Australia, to a “green new deal” in the UK and US to better air quality and more trees in countries like India. “We are out here to reclaim our right to live, our right to breathe and our right to exist, which is all being denied to us by an inefficient policy system that gives more deference to industrial and financial objectives rather than environmental standards,” said Aman Sharma, a young protester in Delhi. The action began in the Pacific Islands, where citizens have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea took part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events and discussions. Students held placards in Kiribati and chanted: “We are not sinking, we are fighting.” The demonstrations spread across Australia – the world’s biggest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas – where more than 300,000 people took to the streets in 100 rallies, prompting a tweet from Thunberg – awake in New York – that the “huge crowd” would set the standard. Incredible pictures as Australia’s gathering for the #climatestrike This is the huge crowd building up in Sydney. Australia is setting the standard! Its bedtime in New York...so please share as many pictures as you can as the strikes move across Asia to Europe and Africa! pic.twitter.com/7eAPUQPq5C The Australian finance minister, Mathias Cormann, had said on Thursday that students should stay in class rather than go on strike. In a retort, Danielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student said: “World leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work. I’d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.” In Tokyo, hundreds of students and environmental activists marched through the business and shopping district of Shibuya, chanting “Climate Justice!” while holding hand-painted placards made of cardboard with messages such as “Go Green,” ‘‘Save the Earth,” and “the Earth is on fire.” Smaller rallies were held in more than a dozen cities around Japan, including Kyoto. No protests were authorised in China, the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another. “Chinese youth have their own methods,” she said. “We also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.” There was action, however, in Taiwan, where dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks. In Thailand, hundreds of young people demonstrated outside the environment ministry in Bangkok and dropped to the ground feigning death. “We are the future and we deserve better,” said 12-year-old Ralyn ‘Lilly’ Satidtanasarn – who has been dubbed “Thailand’s Greta” for her campaign against plastic bag use in a country where each person uses 3,000 throwaway bags a year. In India’s capital Delhi, where the suffocating air pollution was the target of the demonstration, Rishika Singh, 18, said: “It’s the poorest who suffer the most. The rich are better off – they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort.” An armoured personnel carrier was deployed in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to protect about 100 young people as they marched, led by a group of young women carrying a banner emblazoned with “Fridays for Future”. Fardeen Barakzai, one of the organisers and head of the local climate activist group, Oxygen, said: ”We want to do our part. We as the youth of our country know the problem of climate change.” In Kenya’s capital Nairobi some young protesters wore hats and outfits made from plastic bottles to highlight the dangers of plastic waste, a major threat to people living in the developing world. Strikes took place in several Nigerian cities, including Lagos, which is often beset by formidable quantities of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU.  “Leaders should listen to what the climate scientists are saying. No leader should forfeit the future of younger generation,” said Oladosu Adenike, an activist in the Fridays4Future campaign in Nigeria. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. “We don’t really have a way out of this,” said Natalie Kapsosideris, 16. “The future looks really dismal at this point. There’s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us … and it’s all because they want to make money.” Demonstrations took place in most European countries, with huge crowds in Warsaw, Poland and more than 1.4 million people taking action across Germany. In Berlin, demonstrators blocked roads and protested outside the German chancellery. In response, Angela Merkel announced a €50bn package of new measures to curb carbon emissions and review progress towards reaching its climate goals by 2030. Merkel said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Thunberg’s motto “unite behind the science”. “The chances are very good, they have grown, that we will reach our climate goals this time,” Merkel said. “If we should realise we’re not on track, then we will correct this.” In Brussels one rather poetic placard read: “Respect existence or Expect resistance!” Thousands took to the streets in Dublin. Luke Corkery, a university student, said in a tweet: “Blown away … This is a movement led by young people across the globe. We’re not just looking for an excuse for a day off school or college; we’re standing up for the future of our planet.” The global protest culminated in New York which was anticipating one of the largest climate strikes. Education chiefs in the city gave every one of the 1.1 million children in its schools permission to attend the climate strike and hear Thunberg speak at a rally at the United Nations headquarters. “Greta! Greta! Greta!” the crowd chanted as she took to the stage. The 16-year-old directed her speech to the students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. “We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,” she said. “Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?” She sparked laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and “tell us they really, really admire what we do” yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. “We demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?” It was estimated that more than 250,000 people turned out for the protests in New York, with thousands more demonstrating in Boston, Miami and San Francisco. In Mexico City, protesters chanted “Se ve, se siente, la tierra está caliente” – “You see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.” In Brazil, where recent fires in the Amazon have drawn attention to the climate emergency, students attended protests in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and the capital Brasília. • This article was amended on 23 September 2019.

Share this...FacebookTwitterExtremist climatologists, with their wild global warming related doomsday predictions made earlier, are beginning to look more and more silly with every passing winter.
Remember when the once reputable CRU claimed that wintertime snow would be rare and exciting? Well, since that assertion was made, snows have been coming already at mid-autumn more frequently it seems, and winters have been increasingly harsher.
In fact Britain’s The Weather Outlook warned the UK is now being gripped by a bitter series of winters comparable with the harsh 1939-42 winters. Read more below.
Fall officially started only 3 weeks ago, and the official start of winter is still more than 9 weeks away. Yet, you wouldn’t know it looking at the latest weather forecasts throughout Europe which are calling for bitter cold and snow.
Germany’s online, English-written The Local reports snow forecast for the central and south Germany’s hilly regions for late this week:
On Thursday afternoon cloud cover will roll in, bringing rain to the north and the east – and possible snow in higher altitudes by Friday. Low-lying mountains in the Harz region, as well as the Fichtelgebirge in Bavaria and Saxony’s Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, are all likely to see snow fly…
Great Britain’s online Telegraph reports today that snow is also in the forecast. We’re not talking about snowfall at the summits of tall mountains here, but down in the low hills. The Telegraph writes:
Winter will come early to Britain next week as snow is forecast for the north while the south will shiver in frosty sub-zero nights.
and:
Forecasters Positive Weather Solutions have already predicted a ‘white-out’ winter almost as harsh as last winter – with widespread snow, temperatures down to -4F (-20C) and transport chaos.

The Weather Outlook, which has an accurate seasonal forecasting record, warned the UK is now being gripped by a bitter series of winters comparable with the harsh 1939-42 winters which made conditions so horrendous during the Second World War.
This all flies in the face of the alarmist global warming forecasts made earlier. In 2008 the UK Telegraph reported that heat waves would become more common and kill more people.
…Britain was warned that climate change could lead to thousands of deaths during heatwaves and outbreaks of malaria.
A report said there was a “high risk” of a dangerously hot summer within five years that could kill 6,000 people. But these would be more than offset by milder winters leading to fewer deaths from the cold, currently 20,000 a year.
Germany’s Die Welt wrote just a few days ago that spring could start arriving already in late January in Germany by 2030, read here!
 
I’ll spare readers all the other loads of nonsense other major papers have written.
Perhaps journalists and AGW-believing climatologists will wake up some day and realise that climate is heavily driven by ocean cycles. For the first time in a long time, the PDO and the AMO are both entering in lockstep the cold phases of their respective 30-year and 60-year cycles. A low activity solar cycle on top of that could act to make it a triple whammy.
A number of scientists, yet a minority, have been warning of this leading to decades of harsh winters for some time now. But as science goes, the outsiders are usually right, and the “consensus” is often wrong. Indeed, science is about obliterating consensus.
And what does this coming winter look like for Europe and the world?
Winter and spring forecast 2010/11
Note the cold Arctic forecast for 2011. Might want to hold off planting them tulips early next spring – at least until after late January.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowly, but surely, more and more people in Germany are speaking up against the hoax that is man-made global warming. Websites and blogs are sprouting and scepticism is spreading. The old, established narrative is now being seriously challenged.
The latest example is a piece written by Ronald Gläser in the online news and commentary magazine called eigentümlich frei:
Brutal Media Campaign Against Climate ‘Deniers’
For starters, Gläser calls the 10:10 no pressure film “only the latest high point in the ongoing campaign against climate sceptics”.
In the run-up to the climate conference in Cancun, which starts on November 30, the propaganda machinery of the academic-media complex will get even shriller.
Gläser then cites the slanderish Der Spiegel piece called Science As The Enemy which suggests only a handful of US scientists are sowing doubt on the AGW theory, and that “97% of all climatologists support the theory”. Gläser equates this Der Spiegel claim to communist East German propoganda.
This is a percentage that not by coincidence reminds of the old Communist East German election results.

The Der Spiegel hit-piece was designed to intimidate other scientists into silence. Gläser writes;
This is Mao’s favorite principle: Educate hundreds by punishing one.
Gläser then provides the background on the resignation of University of California Santa Barbara professor Hal Lewis from the American Physical Society (APS), after having been a member for 67 years. Gläser summarises:
With his open letter he has shown again, for the zillionth time, what’s behind the so-called consensus on the topic of global warming: nothing!
