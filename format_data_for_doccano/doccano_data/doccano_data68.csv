By Dr. Dietrich E. Koelle
[Translated, edited by P Gosselin]
Announcements that the Arctic sea ice would soon disappear have been among the most favorite of claims made by publicity-seeking climatologists and leading American politicians. According to the following, there isn’t supposed to be any Arctic sea ice left today:
10 Failed Forecasts
(1) M. Murphy, New Scientist, 1960: “The Arctic ocean will be ice free the entire year before the end of the 20th century” (i.e. by the year 2000),
(2) “Arctic specialist Bernt Balchen 1972: “The warming trend can produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000.”
(3) Jay Zwally (NASA) said in December 2007 : “The Arctic Ocean could almost be ice-free in the summer of 2012” (National Geographic)
(4) Louis Fortier (Arctic Net, Canada) 2007: “The Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2010 or 2015”.
(5) David Barber (Univ. of Manitoba), 2008: “The North Pole could be ice-free this summer for the first time”: June 2008 (2) (3)
(6) Prof. W. Maslowski (US Naval Postgraduate School), 2008: “In summer 2013 we will have an ice-free Arctic”.
(7) Mark Serreze, NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Colorado, USA) in 2008: “The Arctic could be ice-free in 2012”.
(8) Al Gore, former US Vice President at the Copenhagen climate conference 2009: “Arctic will be ice-free in five years” = 2014.
(9) US-Senator John Kerry 2009: “The Arctic will be ice-free in 2013”.
(10) Prof. P. Wadhams (Cambridge University), 2007: said in 2007 that the Arctic ice was in a “death spiral”, and in 2011: “the ice could be completely gone in four years”, i.e. 2015.
So what happened?
The Arcic ice has not disappeared, rather after shrinking from 1980 to 2012 it has risen over the past years (Figure 1). 2015 saw a Northwest Passage that was no longer possible to cross – too much ice.

While we shouldn’t be surprised that politicians like Al Gore or John Kerry would say such things and latch on to claims about the end of the Arctic, it is completely baffling that experts such as Mark Serreze (NSIDC) or Prof. P. Wadhams would reach such estimations.
What do all these false forecasts have in common?
They fully ignore statements that point out polar ice mass and extent are cyclical in nature. This means that it is not possible to simply extrapolate outwards from a short-term trend. There are foremost phases of expansion and retreat. The main causes for this are temperature fluctuations and changes in oceanic and atmospheric currents. Only one thing is certain: The supposedly responsible-for-everything CO2 rise here plays no role.  The proof is delivered by the development of Antarctic sea ice, which, at the same atmospheric CO2 level as at the North Pole, has risen steadily over the past 35 years and reached a record in 2014 (Figure 2). Strangely this rarely gets brought up by the media. It just doesn’t fit with the hysteria template.
Fundamentally many conventional climate scientists have a problem with natural climate factors and climate cycles. For them climate first began in 1880 along with the systematic measurement of temperature. Before that there is only proxy data, which however are imprecise and thus are best ignored. That’s why there’s a widespread lack of understanding when it comes to the natural climate factors that were at play long before man appeared on the planet.

Figure 3 below shows the global temperature from 1860 to 2000, along with the Arctic temperature. Clear to see is the 60-year cycle temperature fluctuation between 0.2 and 1.2°C. Russian Autor Frolov shows in Figure 4 a similar trend for the Barents Sea (70-90° N) and extrapolated accordingly for the coming 50 years. Here a temperature drop of about 1.5°C is expected. Also in a new GEOMAR-paper from 2014 that factors in the NAO impact reaches the result that the North Atlantic region is going to cool.

Figure 4: Temperature and projection at the Barents Sea 1900-2060 (Frolov, 2014)
Clearly there is absolutely no indication anywhere that points to the Arctic sea ice disappearing. American climate researcher David Dilley, who worked 20 years at the NOAA, even said that according to his analyses, cooling will continue over the next 120 years (4). This can be expected due to the anticipated temperature decline associated with the natural 230 year climate cycle that reached its peak in 2005. This trend is shown also in Figure 4 with the reduced maximum in 2060 compared to 2000.
To the contrary, scientists at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, are anticipating a long-term-reduction in sea ice cover at the North Pole area in the summer time over the coming decades (5). Ms. C. Habermalz, AWI, believes (8) the Arctic will be ice-free by 2040-2050.
No matter, there is no need to fret over the poor polar bears having their icebergs melt away, which a number of wildlife protection organizations have announced in attempts to get people to donate. Polar bears have already survived a number of warm periods – the most recent being the Holocene Maximum 7000 years ago when global temperature was some 1.5°C higher. Sea ice at the North Pole, David Dilley says, was only half as much back then (see ref. (6)).

"Berkeley this week became the first city in the United States to ban natural, fossil gas hook-ups in new buildings. The landmark ordinance was passed into law on Tuesday, after being approved unanimously by the city council the previous week amid resounding public support.  Although Berkeley may be pushing the vanguard, the city is hardly alone. Governments across the US and Europe are looking at strategies to phase out gas. In California alone, dozens of cities and counties are considering eliminating fossil fuel hook-ups to power stoves and heat homes in new buildings, while California state agencies pencil out new rules and regulations that would slash emissions. Natural gas, it seems, has become the new climate crisis frontline. Berkeley’s ordinance, which goes into effect on 1 January, will ban gas hook-ups in new multi-family construction, with some allowances for first-floor retail and certain types of large structures. The reasons behind the decision are multifold. Energy use in buildings accounts for about 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in California. If the state is to meet its goal of 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045, the gas will have to go. For decades, gas was considered among the preferred energy sources for buildings and embraced as a bridge from dirtier fossil fuels to a green energy future. “There’s been a lingering perception that burning gas was cleaner than electricity, which might have been true 20 years ago when electricity came from burning coal,” said Pierre Delforge, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council . “When we look at electrification policies, we need to think about what the grid will look like in 10 or 20 years, not what it looked like yesterday.” A state energy commission report released in early 2019 concluded that building electrification was “a key strategy” for reducing the state’s climate impacts, one that “offers the most promising path to achieving [greenhouse gas] reduction targets in the least costly manner”. Roughly 3% of all natural gas extracted by industry is leaked into the atmosphere, where methane is a far more potent, if shorter lived, greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Berkeley was also motivated to reduce health and safety risks endemic to gas appliances, which release significant emissions and pollutants indoors. And then there’s the matter of running large amounts of flammable fuel around a state known for large earthquakes. A Pacific Gas and Electric pipeline explosion in 2010 turned a Northern California neighborhood into a smoking crater. “We really believe we have the underpinnings of good legislation with economic, health and safety and climate impacts,” said the Berkeley councilmember Kate Harrison. “We can do this and we’ll end up a lot healthier and cleaner for it.” Further decarbonizing the grid and electrifying buildings will be key to helping California meet its ambitious climate goals. In 2018, the state passed a law requiring it to derive 100% of its power from zero-carbon energy sources by 2045, and to pursue a “bold path” to get there. Cities’ individual choices will be crucial in reaching that target. Energy is regulated at the state level, but municipalities control much of their own building codes. “Climate-minded cities are all pulling their hair out, like, we have a climate emergency, and the national government doesn’t care. But this issue is squarely in their wheelhouse – they’ve just got to think about it in new and creative ways,” said Bruce Nilles, managing director of the Rocky Mountain Institute. “We’re dealing with an existential crisis. We’ve got to dust off all the different ways that different actors can do good, progressive, climate-minded things.” More than 50 cities and counties in California are now considering similar policies to Berkeley’s, either banning or limiting gas and incentivizing full electrification in new buildings. Panama Bartholomy, director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition, points to this summer as a transformative one: in order to have new ordinances in place by 1 January, municipalities will have until September to pass electrification measures. “Not all 50 are going to make it. I’m thinking a couple dozen make it,” he said. Even a fully electrified California will still burn some gas, some of it to power that electric grid. Los Angeles, for example, plans to phase out some gas infrastructure, but is also investing in a new gas-fired power plant, in service of fully phasing out coal. There are also still hurdles in the developer community. When Dan Kalb, a city council member in Oakland, tried to convince a developer to build a new housing development to be fully electric, he said, they were unwilling, claiming that new apartments without gas wouldn’t command the same high market rate as units that were oven-ready. And new construction accounts for just roughly 1% of buildings in California. In order to fully phase out gas, reach climate emissions goals, reduce indoor pollution, address safety hazards, and reach zero-carbon energy by 2045, state and local governments will have to create an incentivized, affordable pathway away from the pipelines, and toward induction stoves and heat pumps. Bartholomy’s coalition is working with manufacturers to prepare them for all that new electric appliance demand. “We’ve got about 10 years to really transform this market and make the clean version the more attractive version,” said Bartholomy. If more cities can pull off what Berkeley did, they could not just clean up California, but also create a model for local and state governments across the US, as coal is phased out and the electric grid becomes cleaner. “There are gas utilities all over the industry, all over the country that are terrified that this fight is going to come to them,” said David Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute. “There are rumblings in Oregon and Washington. The fight’s in California right now but it’s coming everywhere.” For utilities that sell both gas and electricity, a gas phase-out presents a tremendous market shift, but not necessarily an existential one – they’ll stay in business, their customer bases intact. But for utilities that sell and service only natural, fossil gas, the prospect of Berkeley leading California toward an electric green future is horrifying. “If you’re a gas-only utility, then building electrification is a death sentence for you. In that sense they’re almost akin to the coal mining industry,” said Pomerantz. SoCalGas, for example, serves nearly 22 million customers, or about half the state. A subsidiary of Sempra Energy, the utility arguably has the most to lose from electrification. “The Southern California Gas Company is just not coming to the table on this,” said Bartholomy. “They aren’t providing any vision to meet our climate targets.” SoCalGas did not respond to a request for comment. Gas companies won’t be the only ones left bearing the cost of old energy infrastructure. Ratepayers have in turn invested in the current pipelines, which will become stranded assets if everything electrifies. “If you’re going to have entire communities apart from the gas system under the name of decarbonization, who is left holding the bag of the things that are already in the ground?” said Michael Colvin, director of California Energy for the Environmental Defense Fund. Of all the challenges facing full electrification, the affordability component is among the trickiest. A report released in June cautioned that as more people leave the gas grid, the same fixed infrastructure costs will be spread across a smaller number of customers, raising prices for everyone left. “We don’t want to have low-income communities the only ones left paying for the natural gas – these are already folks who pay a disproportionate amount of their income for energy and we don’t want to make it worse,” said Bartholomy. But we’ve invested a lot in that gas infrastructure, and it still has to be paid for somehow, by someone. “It was put in place assuming we would be using gas infrastructure for so many years,” said Ranjit Deshmukh, environmental studies professor at UC Santa Barbara. “Are we as a society and a consumer base obligated to pay for that even if we’re not using it in the future?” If the public doesn’t pay for those pipelines, Colvin warns, it may be even more difficult to get the investment necessary to carry California into full electrification. “Who on earth is going to invest in us if we don’t honor our past commitments?” The earlier California begins fully decarbonizing the state’s energy, the more time there may be to plan for what will be a painful, if necessary, phase-out. If the state is to go zero-carbon by 2045, new gas-powered appliances would need to be removed from the market by around 2030. “We have a 10-year window to figure out a lot of these conversations. That sounds like a long time, but it’s not,” said Colvin. “There’s pipes in the ground that have been around since the 30s.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I’m meandering off into the field of nutrition, as readers here know I do this sometimes – if I feel it’s very important.
Recently at Twitter I began following Tim Noakes, a specialist in nutrition. Tim recently posted a link to a video by Dr. Sarah Hallberg, who runs a clinic for treating obesity and diabetes in Indiana. If you have 20 minutes time, do take it to watch the video. It may add years to your life (and save our bank accounts).

Some time ago I became convinced that obesity, heart disease and nutrition-related diabetes were in fact all designed to profit what to me is increasingly looking like a very deceptive and evil group of industries. It wasn’t intended at first, but then a number of parties discovered how they could rig it to their benefit, and the rest morphed into the monster it has become today.
At least two generations of the human species have had the wool pulled over their eyes with the high-carb diet, junk-science-based nonsense. Just the most basic statistics tell the whole story:
* 50% of US adults (120 million) are either diabetic or pre-diabetic.
* Each patient pays thousands annually for diabetes medicine.
* Diabetes industry alone rakes in $250 billion every year.
Let’s recall that the high-carb diet, just like global science, was once backed up by a overwhelming “consensus of leading experts”. Today hundreds of millions of people are now paying a painful price. Hallberg says:
There’s a lot of money to be made keeping you sick.”
If I were Dr. Hallberg, I’d be watching my back very closely. There are a lot of powerful forces out there who don’t want her message to get out.

The HadCRUT global temperature dataset that the IPCC references contains instrumental records that date back to the year 1850. Precise CO2 data (measured in tenths of parts per million)  from thousands of years ago can be found in Antarctic ice cores, with direct measurements (Mauna Loa) available since the 1950s.   In comparing the two records, it can be concluded that during the last 165 years, rapidly increasing CO2 concentrations only correlate with rapidly increasing global temperatures for one 25-year period (1977-2001).   Put another way, for 85% of the last 165 years there has been little to no correlation between CO2 concentration changes and temperature changes.
Maximum CO2 warming occurs within 10 years after emission
Before illustrating the lack of trend correlation between CO2 and temperature during the last 165 years, it needs to be pointed out that scientists have determined that on average it takes about 10 years for the maximum warming effect from CO2 emission to be realized. In other words, CO2 emissions from the 1950s predominantly had the most pronounced effect on temperature trends by the 1960s.  It could also be said that we are now experiencing the height of the warming effects of the CO2 emissions from the early 2000s.  The timing of the CO2-to-temperature effect was determined by Ricke and Caldeira (2014) in their Environmental Research Letters paper entitled “Maximum warming occurs about one decade after a carbon dioxide emission”.
Ricke and Caldeira, 2014:
It is known that carbon dioxide emissions cause the Earth to warm, but no previous study has focused on examining how long it takes to reach maximum warming following a particular CO2 emission. Using conjoined results of carbon-cycle and physical-climate model intercomparison projects, we find the median time between an emission and maximum warming is 10.1 years.
Selecting decadal-sale warming and cooling phases
Having established that correlational fluctuations between CO2 concentrations and global temperature should be detectable on a decadal scale (presuming that Ricke and Caldeira [2014] are correct), the CO2 and temperature record for the last 165 years can be considered — rooted in the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) assumption that temperature fluctuations should occur in direct response to CO2 concentration changes.
The IPCC routinely selects starting and ending points from the instrumental record to establish warming and cooling phases in their trend analysis. For example, the years 1998-2012 from IPCC AR5 (2013)  are selectively used to analyze the recent “hiatus” in global warming, and the years 1910 to 1940 are selected in AR4 (2007) to denote the early 20th century warming (ETCW).  In that same vein, the decadal-scale periods selectively considered for this analysis are:

1850 – 1910
1910 – 1940
1940 – 1977
1977 – 2001
2001 – 2014

1. 1850 – 1910: -0.1°C Cooling with +15 ppm CO2
According to NASA*, between 1850 and 1910, CO2 concentrations rose from 285 ppm to 300 ppm. During this same 60-year period, global temperatures cooled by almost -0.1°C despite the +15 ppm increase in CO2 concentration.  The temperature trends are illustrated below with woodfortrees interactive graphs.

2. 1910 – 1940: +0.45°C Warming with +11 ppm CO2
Between 1910 and 1940, CO2 concentrations rose from 300 ppm to 311 ppm, or by +11 ppm. Interestingly, anthropogenic CO2 emissions did not rise, but remained flat at 1 gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year during this period.  Even so, in the 30 years between 1910 and 1940, global temperatures warmed by +0.45°C, or +0.15°C per decade.

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/plot/1910/to:1940/trend
3. 1940 – 1977: -0.1°C Cooling with +23 ppm CO2

Between 1940 and 1977, CO2 concentrations rose from 311 ppm to 334 ppm, or +23 ppm. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions dramatically rose from about 1 GtC per year in 1940 to about 5 GtC per year by the mid-1970s.  During these 35+ years of rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, global temperatures nonetheless cooled by almost -0.1°C.

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
4. 1977 – 2001: +0.35°C Warming with +37 ppm CO2
The first and only period in the last 165 years that there was actually a correlation between rapidly rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions and rapidly rising temperature was between the years 1977 and 2001. CO2 concentrations rose from 334 ppm to 371 ppm, or +37 ppm during this period.  Temperatures rose by +0.35°C, or +0.15°C per decade  —  a similar warming rate when compared to the 1910 to 1940 trend.

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/plot/trend
5. 2001 – 2014: -0.04°C Cooling with +27 ppm CO2
Finally, between 2001 and 2014, CO2 concentrations rose from 371 ppm to 398 ppm, or by +27 ppm. During this same period,  temperatures remained flat or even slightly cooled by a few hundredths of a degree, which meant that a substantial portion of the latest IPCC report (AR5, 2013) necessarily was devoted to explaining why the 21st century global warming “hiatus” had occurred.
Several dozen scientific papers were also published during this period, each attempting to explain why CO2 could be rapidly rising while temperatures were not.  This “pause” inconvenience was eliminated in 2015 with the onset of the 2015-’16 Super El Niño that rapidly drove up sea surface temperatures, as well as via the nearly immediate  acceptance of the controversial Thomas Karl (et al., 2015**) “pause-busting” paper which selected the year 1998 as a starting point and adjusted past warming down and more recent warming up (so as to allow temperature trends to correspond better with climate models).  With the onset of the La Niña recovery trend commencing in April/May 2016, temperatures are likely to continue to decline from the 2015-’16 El Niño peak in the near future despite the rapidly rising CO2 concentrations (which have now eclipsed 400 ppm); this may further extend the 21st century pause in global warming that began in the early 2000s.

Chart: www.woodfortrees.org/plot/trend.
Summarizing Question 
Many Holocene temperature reconstructions show significant fluctuation in temperatures during the last 2,000 years (i.e., a Roman Warm Period, a Dark Ages cool period, a Medieval Warm Period, and a Little Ice Age cool period). However, CO2 concentrations remained stable at about 270 to 275 ppm throughout each warming and cooling epoch.  For example, during the roughly 600 years between the as-warm or warmer-than-now Medieval Warm Period and the beginning of the 20th century (the 1300 to 1900 A.D. Little Ice Age), temperatures plummeted to the coldest centennial-scale phase of the last 10,000 years.  Yet CO2 concentrations not only did not decline along with the temperatures, they rose slightly during this period.  This record necessarily extends the lack of correlation between CO2 and temperature changes well beyond the last 165 years.
The summarizing question, then, is this:
If CO2 is a primary determinant of temperature (as the AGW theory proposes), and if the warming effects of CO2 emission reach their maximum impact within about a decade, why is the correlation between decadal-scale CO2 trends and decadal-scale temperature trends weak to non-existent for most (~85%) of the last 165 years, as well as completely non-existent for nearly all of the last 2,000 years?

"Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have recorded their highest ever temperatures as the second extreme heatwave in as many months to be linked by scientists to the climate emergency grips the continent. The Dutch meteorological service, KNMI, said the temperature reached 39.2C (102.5F) at the Gilze-Rijen airbase near Breda on Wednesday afternoon, exceeding the previous high of 38.6C set in August 1944. In Belgium, the temperature in Kleine-Brogel hit 38.9C on Wednesday afternoon, fractionally higher than the previous record of 38.8C set in June 1947, and then subsequently rose to 39.9C. Forecasters said temperatures could climb further on Thursday. Germany’s national weather service, DWD, said it believed a new all-time national high of 40.5C – 0.2C higher than the record – had been set in the town of Geilenkirchen near the Dutch and Belgian borders, but had still to confirm it. “The most extreme heat will build from central and northern France into Belgium, the Netherlands and far western Germany into Thursday,” said Eric Leister of the forecasting group AccuWeather. After several cities in France broke previous temperature records on Tuesday, including Bordeaux, which hit 41.2C, the national weather service, Météo France, said Paris was likely to beat its all-time high of 40.4C, set in July 1947, with 42C on Thursday. City records in Amsterdam and Brussels are also expected to fall. Cities are particularly vulnerable in heatwaves because of a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, in which concrete buildings and asphalt roads absorb heat during the day and emit it again at night, preventing the city from cooling. The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. Temperature records for this time of year have already been broken across much of Europe. The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C. The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. It is not possible to pin the heatwave definitively on climate change because weather varies naturally. Moreover, the effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloud across northern Europe is likely to become more common as the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position. However, this year’s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding. The body’s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies and older people are less well able to regulate their temperature and should stay in well-ventilated conditions. In the 2003 European heatwave there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night. There is also an impact on farmers. While warmth at the right time is crucial for crop growth, excessively high temperatures can inhibit that growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care. Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C in the southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux. Clare Nullis, a World Meteorological Organization spokeswoman, said the heatwaves bore the “hallmark of climate change”. The extreme events were “becoming more frequent, they’re starting earlier, and they’re becoming more intense”, she said. “It’s not a problem that’s going to go away.” The 26-28 June heatwave in France was 4C hotter than a June heatwave would have been in 1900, according to World Weather Attribution, a new international programme helping the scientific community to analyse the possible influence of climate breakdown on extreme weather events. A study published earlier this year by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich said the summer heatwave across northern Europe last year would have been “statistically impossible” without climate change driven by human activity. KNMI has issued a code orange extreme temperature warning for all of the Netherlands except the offshore Wadden Islands and implemented its “national heat emergency” plan, while Belgium has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire country on a code red warning. Spain has also declared a red alert in the Zaragoza region, where the worst wildfires in 20 years took place last month. The EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service warned of an extreme danger of further forest fires in France and Spain on Thursday, with a high or very high threat level in Belgium, Germany, Italy and Portugal. Twenty French départements were also placed on red alert. Agnès Buzyn, the health minister, said: “Nobody is immune in the face of such extreme temperatures. There are risks even if you are not particularly vulnerable.”  Britain’s Met Office issued similar advice and said the UK all-time high of 38.5C, recorded in Faversham, Kent, in August 2003, could be exceeded on Thursday. Local authorities in France have placed restrictions on water usage in 73 of the country’s 96 départements following dramatic falls in ground and river water levels. “It’s tricky but under control, but we need to be very vigilant,” said the junior environment minister, Emmanuelle Wargon. The French energy company EDF said it was shutting down two reactors at its Golfech nuclear power plant in the southern Tarn-et-Garonne region in order to limit the heating of water used to keep the reactors cool. Scientists have said such heatwaves are closely linked to the climate emergency and will be many times more likely over the coming decades. Last month, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said Europe’s five hottest summers since 1500 had all occurred in the 21st century – in 2002, 2003, 2010, 2016 and 2018. Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, the institute said, adding that this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”. • This article was amended on 25 July 2019 to add a temperature announced after publication. The Belgian weather service initially announced that Kleine-Brogel had hit 38.9C, but the temperature later rose to 39.9C."

Leipzig meteorologist studies effects of climate change on worldwide precipitation

Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air. Does this mean that climate warming leads to more precipitation on average than it did a few decades ago? Dr. Marc Salzmann of the Institute for Meteorology at the University of Leipzig looked at this question. In a study he found that climate change so far has not had an impact on the average global precipitation amount. This could change by the end of this century. The meteorologist published his findings in “Science Advances”.
“The Arctic is melting, temperature and sea level are rising, and every year a new record is reached with CO2 in the atmosphere. Only the global average amount of precipitation has not changed measurably,” says Salzmann. Indeed precipitation has increased in some regions of the earth, but at the same time it has decreased in others. It is also known that as a consequence of climate change, there are heavy rainfalls more often. “With the worldwide average precipitation, however, neither computer models nor observations show significant changes,” he explains.
This is due to tiny particles called aerosols that float in the air and are created, for example, by sulfur dioxide. They have a cooling effect on the climate. But according to Salzmann, they do not suffice to offset the global temperature warming that is caused by greenhouse gases. Yet the affect of aerosols on precipitation has still been strong enough to offset the affect by greenhouse gases on the global average precipitation.
“My study shows that the global precipitation amount on average falls an estimated 3 to 4% per degree Celsius of cooling by aerosols, while the already known value for greenhouse gases is only 1.5 to 2% precipitation increase per degree of warming,” says the meteorologist. These different “hydrological sensitivities” is the reason why we can be thankful that the average precipitation amount has changed very little worldwide even though the global mean temperature has risen.
However for the future – already at the end of this century – Salzmann expects a significant increase in global precipitation amount. Because greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for a long time, the concentration rises even if emissions remain steady. Aerosol particles on the other hand get washed away by rain rather quickly.
Original in “Science Advances”: “Global warming without global mean precipitation increase?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Joe Bastardi at Twitter posted a chart from Scripps Oceanography Institute, which does put out some excellent work despite a fair amount climate science activism from a few of its scientists.
According to the Weatherbell meteorologist, Scripps has forecast a La Niña under -2.0 over five consecutive month, as the following chart shows:

While it’s still questionable that the La Niña will arrive already this summer, there is rapidly diminishing doubt that it will be hitting the globe hard by wintertime. Joe adds:
The implication of the SCRIPPS forecast with the ONI is it would more than counter the recent strong el nino, over a multi year period”
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology writes here (April 26, 2016):
Eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures have cooled significantly in the past fortnight, and are now approaching neutral levels. As temperatures under the surface are below average, more surface water cooling is expected. However the atmosphere is only slowly responding to these changes, and hence the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and cloudiness near the Date Line continue to fluctuate around El Niño thresholds.
Six of eight international climate models suggest the tropical Pacific Ocean will return to neutral levels within the next month. By September, seven of eight models suggest La Niña thresholds are likely. However, individual model outlooks show a large spread between neutral and La Niña scenarios.”

The following chart from Wikipedia gives an overview of all La Niña events occurring since 1900.

Source: Wikipedia here.
Note how in the above figure a lack of La Niña events persisted from 1976 to 1998, a time that saw the globe warm some 0.6°C. Since 1998 the frequency of La Niña events has increased with global temperatures remaining flat. Back in the early to mid 1970s, a time of frequent La Niña events, much of the media warned of a coming little ice age. For example in 1974 German Spiegel news magazine warned that the chances of warming were less than 1 in 10,000! A number of scientists sounded the ice age alarms, blaming it in part on sinful human activity.
By 1986, with La Niña events having been absent close to 10 years, Spiegel flipped and began its spectacular warnings of global warming, showing a semi-submerged Cologne Cathedral on the cover of a 1986 magazine. by 1988, James Hansen was before Congress prophesizing the end of the world.
Significant midterm climate cooling in the pipeline?
The oncoming La Niña in combination with weakened solar activity and a flip towards the cool phase by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may soon be all working in tandem to set up months of global cooling ahead, which means a likely resumption in the overall global warming pause over the latter part of the current decade.
Global temperature over the years ahead will hinge in part on how frequently La Niña events occur.

"A declaration by the head of BHP that tackling the climate crisis will require “the biggest global mobilisation since World War II” has prompted claims the world’s biggest miner is more serious about the problem than the Australian parliament. But shareholder advocates warned BHP’s pledge to do more on climate change, including setting targets for its customers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and linking executive pay to pollution reduction, should be viewed sceptically while it remained a member of groups that lobbied against significant action.  Speaking in London, the BHP chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, said global heating was “indisputable” and called for drastic action, including but not limited to carbon pricing. He said the company would spend US$400m to develop technologies to cut emissions from its own operations and from the companies that buy its iron ore, coal, gas and other resources. The “scope 3” emissions released by BHP’s customers are nearly 40 times greater than what it emits itself. Mackenzie indicated the company would not cut its emissions immediately, instead promising to limit its 2022 pollution at 2017 levels, but the company has a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. He said the company would strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021. The announcement comes as BHP and other resources companies face increased pressure from shareholders to show they are acting in the face of what scientists say is a climate emergency. Market sources said the move was also consistent with the company planning a long-term move away from thermal coal, which is burned in power plants and is worth far less than the coking coal used to make steel. Dan Gocher, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the commitment was a landmark shift for corporate Australia. But he said the company also needed to address the pro-coal advocacy of groups, including the Minerals Council of Australia and the Business Council of Australia, of which it was a leading member. “This is the biggest local block on Australia having ambitious climate and energy policies,” he said. “While it continues to fund these organisations we have a problem.” Gocher said while BHP’s comments sent a powerful signal, its 2022 target was not ambitious when held up next to the Paris agreement goal of limiting heating to less than 2C and its financial commitment was tiny given the size of the company. He said the company had made climate commitments before that delivered little and most of the detail was still to come. Mackenzie said BHP would set a “medium-term, science-based” target next year for the decarbonisation of its operations. “BHP plays this game better than anyone,” Gocher said. “The announcement is great, but we will judge what they are actually doing when we see it.” The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), which represents funds that manage more than $2.2tn in retirement savings, welcomed BHP’s announcement but said companies needed to provide more information about their climate risk. “ACSI encourages companies to take the lead in transitioning to a low carbon economy by setting forward looking targets,” the chief executive, Louise Davidson, said. Davidson said links between executive pay and “non-financial measures” such as climate risk needed to be based on objective targets and genuinely put remuneration at risk. “For companies that are exposed to the financial risks of climate change, it makes sense for remuneration to include links to climate risk management performance,” she said. Emma Herd, chief of Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said BHP’s scope 3 emissions pledge was a significant shift. It follows liquefied natural gas producers arguing they deserve credit for lowering global emissions where their gas displaces coal, a case that has won vocal support from the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor. Herd said BHP’s statement was an important admission that companies could not claim credit for cutting their customers’ emissions if they did not also take responsibility for where they contribute to them. “This actually acknowledges that if you accept the opportunity side you also have to accept the risk side,” she said. She said Mackenzie’s speech showed what qualified as good corporate behaviour was changing. “The bar continues to move. What was considered leadership in 2018 is not what is considered leadership in 2019. The momentum is all going one way.” Taylor said MacKenzie had correctly pointed out that a transition to a lower carbon world should look to avoid major increases in the price and unreliability of energy and materials. “The government is taking a sensible and balanced approach to reduce global emissions and meet our international obligations,” he said. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said Mackenzie’s speech demonstrated the seriousness with which the corporate sector, investors and regulators were taking climate change was growing, while Australia’s emissions continued to rise under Morrison government policies. “The gap between the approach of the corporate sector and the Australian government keeps growing as the urgency of real climate action becomes more apparent,” he said. Adam Bandt, climate spokesman for the Greens, said it was remarkable that the head of BHP was using similar language as school students striking for action on the climate crisis. He contrasted it with that heard in the Australian parliament. “I never thought I’d say the words that Liberal and Labor should take a leaf out of BHP’s book, but it sounds like BHP recognises the climate emergency as a clear and present danger, unlike the old parties,” he said."
"Bowing to the interests of a few deep-pocketed utilities, Ohio has enacted a controversial new law, dubbed HB 6, subsidizing dirty, decades-old coal plants and gutting the state’s clean energy programs. I have spent the past five years researching states’ efforts to roll back clean energy laws. This Ohio bill – which Governor Mike DeWine signed the day it was passed – is the worst yet.  The legislation reflects an unfortunate national pattern: electric utilities pushing to delay climate action, bolstered by a president similarly interested in dragging our country’s feet. For years, FirstEnergy and AEP have been trying to dismantle Ohio’s clean energy policies and bail out their dirty coal plants. Since President Trump took office, these companies have found a receptive audience. FirstEnergy’s CEO has met with Trump personally. Last year, the company asked his administration to invoke emergency powers to save its struggling coal and nuclear plants. Just a few months ago, an Ohio Republican operative who has a major role in Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign called several House Republicans who were on the fence to persuade them to vote for HB 6. These companies have spent several million dollars on deceptive advertising, lobbying and campaign contributions to help elect politicians sympathetic to their cause. In return, these politicians have proven dutiful beneficiaries, working diligently to secure almost a billion dollars of ratepayer subsidies for FirstEnergy and AEP. As lobbying goes, not a bad return on investment. This isn’t just happening in Ohio. Utilities across the country are pushing to delay climate action and stall the growth of renewables, which are already a cheaper source of electricity than continuing to operate three-quarters of US coal plants. Last week in Florida, the CEO of an electric utility called for large charges on customer bills in order to make solar customers “go away”. The Sunshine State gets a measly 3% of its electricity from renewables. Yet Florida utilities still fight customers trying to install solar. In Louisiana, the utility Entergy actually paid actors to show up at a New Orleans city council meeting to secure approval for a new natural gas plant. And in Arizona, the state’s largest electric utility – Arizona Public Service – has poured more than $50m into elections, including for its own regulator, often lying about its involvement. Once its favored politicians took office, the utility succeeded in rolling back solar policies. These same electric utilities have funded climate denial for decades. Now they’ve moved on to delay: more than half the country’s highest-emitting utilities are slow-walking their own plans to decarbonize over the next decade. Some major utilities have zero plan to reduce carbon emissions. When a private electric utility chooses to spend its guaranteed profits on denial or delay, the public cannot choose to stop buying its power. There is no exit from a monopoly. In the Ohio case, these utilities started their attacks on renewables in 2011. By 2014, the state had frozen its clean energy targets and made it nearly impossible to build wind energy. This latest change will erode what little policy is left. The law will eliminate clean energy targets and gut an energy efficiency program that has saved the state $5bn – instead cementing Ohio’s position at the bottom of national clean energy rankings. With only 2.5% of its electricity from renewable energy sources last year, the state is in 49th place. In a truly Orwellian doublespeak, Ohio’s latest policy is called the Clean Air Program. The lawmakers don’t even have the guts to call the law what it is – a coal plant subsidy – and instead refer to these dirty sources as “legacy assets”. Some advocates have focused on the parts of the bill that would subsidize nuclear, and the legislation’s small offerings for solar – both carbon-free sources of power. Yet the bill provides almost twice as much funding for coal as clean energy. This is all occurring as Ohio bakes in another heatwave. As farmers throughout the state struggle to plant crops under record rainfall and flooding. As poor communities surrounding these coal plants continue to breathe toxic air. The climate crisis is on Ohio’s doorstep. Yet the corporations running these ancient coal plants want to keep them operating until 2040, when they will be 85 years old. These plants are long past retirement age. The next time you feel that you are to blame for climate change – because you forgot to hit the light switch, or you took that flight to see your ailing mother – remember the Ohio electric utilities and their coal subsidies. Remember the politicians who gave them this billion-dollar bailout after receiving personal favors, like a flight to Trump’s inauguration on a corporate jet. And know that one day after signing this bill, Ohio Governor DeWine attended a Trump fundraiser hosted by coal baron Bob Murray. Fighting the climate crisis is not about purifying yourself. It’s about dismantling corporate power. Electric utilities are a great place to start.

"Most Britons believe climate change is more important in the long term than Brexit and say it should be a top priority for Boris Johnson’s government, according to an opinion poll. Women and young people are more likely to say that action over climate change is a more pressing priority than issues around Brexit.  The ComRes survey, commissioned by Christian Aid, found that 71% of the UK public agreed that climate change would be more important than the country’s departure from the EU in the long term. Six out of 10 adults said the government was not doing enough to prioritise the climate crisis. Two-thirds of those surveyed agreed that Johnson should put the issue at the top of his agenda. In his inaugural speech as prime minister outside No 10 on Wednesday, Johnson mentioned the environment briefly. He said Britain was “leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation”. Laura Taylor, director of advocacy for Christian Aid, said: “As Prime Minister Boris Johnson gets his feet under the table at No 10, there are a large number of urgent priorities. However, it’s clear that beyond the present political turmoil, UK adults know there is a bigger crisis, which is potentially catastrophic for the whole of humanity – particularly some of the world’s poorest people, who are more vulnerable to the effects of this climate emergency.” She said she hoped Johnson would “hear the challenge from the majority of the UK public to do more to tackle this climate emergency”. The extreme heat in the UK this week demonstrated the urgency of action. “Extreme weather patterns … are even more exacerbated in other parts of the world, where droughts, floods and storms are wreaking havoc, costing lives and seeing millions of pounds of damage each year.” The poll also showed that church-going Christians were more likely than the general public to say the climate emergency should be a top priority of the government, at 77% compared with 66%. Taylor said: “It has been heartening to see church denominations and Christian groups in recent months declare a climate emergency.” • This article was amended on 5 August 2019. An earlier version said the Christian Aid poll asked what issue should be “the top priority” for the new prime minister, rather than “a top priority”. This has been corrected. The headline was also amended to clarify that respondents believed that the climate emergency was more important in the long-term than Brexit."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I posted on how weather models have been forecasting a bitter cold mid March for much of Europe.
This has now been confirmed by Joe Bastardi at his latest Saturday Summary here beginning at about 3 minutes into the report.
Not only does the GFS show bitter cold for mid March taking hold across Europe but so does the European model. Joe states at 3:22:
Europe has been very cold the past several days and will continue to be cold. It’ll warm up and then turn very very cold there again.”
Powerful La Niña in the pipeline
But what was more interesting in yesterday’s Saturday Summary was the Scripps forecast for the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which currently projects a La Niña with a value of -2.64 to be reached by the end of the year, see 18:00 mark.

By December/January 2016/17, a powerful La Niña is forecast to disrupt global weather, usher a major cooling. Source: WeatherBell Saturday Summary
A value of -2.64 is pretty intense. Though Joe does not think the La Niña will get that extreme when all is said and done, it’s clear that a significant event is very likely looming. Joe says Scripps is forecasting a stronger La Niña then what the El Niño was.
I wonder if we are going to be hearing about that from the alarmist side.
The veteran Weatherbell Analytics meteorologist points out that over the past decade the global equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature has been on the cool side more often – a fact that bodes ill for those with bets placed on continued alarming global warming. Expect more data fudging alterations ahead.
Add to this intense La Niña the cooling North Atlantic and solar activity that is tapering off, and all the ingredients are there for inconvenient cooling over the next years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce again it’s time to look at how the Solar Impulse 2 project is coming along.
Readers will recall that the Solar Impulse 2 plane was designed by a team of Europeans with the aim of making the first solar-powered “solo flight” around the world and thus show the world the endless possibilities of solar power. Unfortunately the only thing that has been “endless” is the trip itself (and the costs)!
Grounded in Hawaii
Recall that the Solar Impulse 2 plane began its journey from Abu Dhabi way back on March 9 (this year). Then some 200 days later it got stuck in Hawaii and hasn’t gone anywhere ever since due to massive technical problems, also read here and here.
So far instead of bringing attention to the technology’s potential, the project has only managed to show the glaring limitations of solar power technology. Earlier I noted that the plane needs the dimensions of a jumbo jet – just to carry the payload of a car.
Bailout
The Solar Impulse 2 has run into another huge problem, it is reported: money. But that problem has been resolved, at least for now, reports the Canadian CBC. It writes that the project has “raised the $27 million ($20 million US) it needs to finish the trip, co-founder and pilot Andre Borschberg said on Monday.”
Money maelstrom project: $170 million
Moreover the CBC reports on the project’s total budget since it began in 2004: “…some $227 million ($170 million US)”. 
My God. Imagine all the other real and pressing problems that could have been alleviated with that kind of money. This is just irresponsible and the project’ backers need to be told that: chemical maker Solvay, Swiss lift maker Schindler, power grid maker ABB and Swatch’s Omega brand, to name a few. It is arguably a sin to burn away that kind of money on what is clearly a debacle while hundreds of refugees are drowning in the Mediterranean. It’s frustrating to see such misplaced priorities and funds.

It is a fact that the Solar Impulse 2 has been a greenhouse gas nightmare involving the burning of tens of thousands of liters of fossil fuels because an entire support crew has had to fly along in a fossil fuel powered jet.
One year late!
The CBC writes that the plane is planned to fly on to Phoenix, New York, Morocco before finally coming full circle back to Abu Dhabi. The team “hopes” to start again in April, 2016, when “there’s enough sun” to recharge batteries.
At this rate, they could walk around the world almost just as fast.
Route unknown – depends on the weather!
Yet, they don’t even know where they will be flying next, and that it all depends on the weather. This is how wild the project has been. The CNC writes:
Vancouver, as well as San Francisco, Los Angeles or Phoenix are all candidates, Borschberg said. They also reckon on a U.S. Midwest pit-stop followed by New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport, before crossing to either Europe or North Africa and, finally, Abu Dhabi. He hopes a year’s delay will not undermine the message he aims to spread at the Paris climate talks.”
CBC writes that Borschberg is hoping that someday this type of travel be implemented “on a large scale“.
Boy, wouldn’t that be progress. Fly from Tokyo to L.A. – in just 6 months (if you’re lucky)!

"It was the hottest day of the hottest month on record – at least until this sweltering summer. I remember it well, because on 19 July 2006, my family and I moved from London to Somerset to begin our new life here. The month began with what the cynics call “a typical English summer: two fine days followed by a thunderstorm”, and hailstorms across a swathe of the country, from Cornwall to Cumbria. By mid-month the rain had mostly gone, and on clear nights, parts of England experienced ground frost – as far south as the notoriously cold spot of Shawbury in Shropshire.  But the day we drove down the A303 to the West Country produced what was then a UK temperature record for July, the hottest since records began in 1914, when the mercury rose to 36.5C (almost 98F) at the Royal Horticultural Society garden in Wisley, Surrey. A few days later, central London was also suffering from the heatwave, with temperatures peaking at 34C. In the rest of July there were scattered thunderstorms, the inevitable result of the heat. Many places experienced their warmest ever July, with above average sunshine and below average rainfall. My abiding memory is of spraying my children with water from the garden hose to keep them cool."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIncreasingly alarmist climate scientists, media members and politicians are openly challenging democracy, saying the people-represented system needs to be done away if there is to be any hope of averting major climate damage.
Nico Stehr at the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here describes the growing dissatisfaction not only among the Tea Party or the UKIP, but also among climate scientists and others. He writes:
Among climate scientists, climate policy-makers and the media one detects a growing impatience with the virtues of democracy when it comes to the robust findings on global warming.”
Stehr, who believes the planet is indeed headed for a climate catastrophe, writes that the lack of political action on the climate issues is increasingly being blamed on the ineffectiveness of democracy. For a growing number in the media, politics and science, democracies are no longer able to meet the climate challenges the world allegedly faces.
These democracy-hostile critics warn that should we continue on as usual, we will quickly run into a catastrophe that will even “put the survival of man at risk“. The underlying message is that democracy needs to be suspended if we are to save ourselves.
Stehr cites David Shearman and Joseph Wayne Smith in their book “The Climate Change Challenge and the Failure of Democracy“. Who write:
We need an authoritarian form of government that can implement the consensus of the science on greenhouse gas emissions.”

“Enemies of freedom”
Other names Stehr cites are James Hansen and Hans-Joachin Schellnhuber, But Stehr is wary of the approach and cites philosopher Friedrich Hayek who warned of the danger of becoming intoxicated by the belief that knowledge can allow the control of human activity, a trap academics often fall into. Hayek was not surprised that: “People who become intoxicated by the progress of knowledge, often become the enemies of freedom.”
For Stehr, it is no surprise today that in Paris “doubts over the functionality of democracy …are going hand-in-hand with the further escalation of apocalyptic consequences of climate change for humans.” Stehr finds it ironic that it has come down to:
Democracy can be rescued only by getting rid of democracy.”
Steyr writes that one major problem that the critics of democracy have is their deficit in understanding the role of science in society.
Under the climate catastrophe scenarios and solutions put out by alarmist climate scientists, there is no alternative to an authoritarian approach. If a slow moving democracy gets replaced by an authoritarian regime capable of implementing the “needed” measures, then naturally course will find itself under an autocracy. And should democracy indeed take the actions necessary to curb the alleged problem, then here too it will find itself under an autocracy. Ultimately the choice is between a consensual autocracy or a non consensual one. With alarmist climate science view, submission is the only option.
More democracy, not less, is the solution
Stehr ends of his commentary by stating he believes the solution is not to restrict democracy, but rather to expand it and “the global opportunity to have an impact, and to extend and multiply knowledge from individuals, groups and movements that deal with environmental problems.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNoTricksZone reader Indomitable Snowman, a scientist who wishes to remain anonymous, has submitted an analysis of June temperature in Germany measured by the DWD German Weather Service.
==========================================
German June Temperature Data – Statistical Analysis
By: The Indomitable Snowman
Recently, Pierre posted an article that included temperature data for the month of June in Germany. By inspection the sequential plot of the data appeared to show no long-term trend of any sort. However, more insight can be gained via quantitative statistical analysis.
Statistical Results
Using the tabulated data (graciously provided by Josef Kowatsch) for the sequential years 1930 – 2015 (86 data points in total), it is readily found that the mean value of the data set is 15.7, while the standard deviation is 1.20.
Trend Chart
Using the data points and the above information, it is a simple task to construct a “trend chart” – in which the data points are plotted, but with the inclusion of horizontal lines for the mean value, +/- one standard deviation, and +/- three standard deviations:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The trend chart clearly shows that the “system” is statistically well-behaved, with the points clustering close to the +/- one-standard-deviation band – indicating that there is no secular change in the underlying system over the time span, and that the variability about the mean can be solely attributed to statistical fluctuations. (It is also a well-known problem that when such a stable system is sequentially sampled, apparent-but-phantom “trends” will seem to appear; these can be seen in the plot, but they are not meaningful – they are artifacts of the sequential sampling.)
Histogram
The proper way to group the data in such a system is grouping by standard deviations – something that is best-presented in a simple histogram:

The center bar is the number of occurrences within one standard deviation of the mean, while the other bars (moving outward) show the number of occurrences from one to two standard deviations (plus and minus), etc. Even though the number of data points is relatively small for the emergence of complete statistical behavior (i.e., the system is undersampled), a Gaussian profile (expected of a system that has a stable mean and statistical fluctuations about that mean) is clearly discernable.
Further, simple Gaussian statistics would predict the following number of occurrences for a Gaussian system with 86 data points – 54 within one standard deviation of the mean, 30 between one and two standard deviations, and 2 beyond two standard deviations. The actual numbers from the data are 55, 28, and 3 – remarkably close to the simple Gaussian expectations, even though the system has been undersampled.
Conclusion
Statistical analysis of the data indicates that the system in question has been stable over the entirety of the sampling period (1930 – 2015) and is not changing. In particular, the system, even though undersampled, produces results that are in almost exact agreement with expected results for a system that is stable around a central mean – with the variability between individual samples being entirely attributable to simple statistical variability.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a video posted at Youtube showing how a wind turbine caught fire and self-destructed in a spectacular fashion. Certainly nothing you’d want to be close to as debris is seen flying over a large area.
Hat-tip Gerti at FB.

What’s interesting is that in the background we see there is also a second turbine on fire. The other turbines in the park are not even operating, even that the wind is blowing, which tells you just how useless these things are in helping developing countries get electrified and modern.
Most likely this was some feel-good project financed or even funded by the UN, World Bank or some renewable energy development and technology transfer fund of some type. This is what we get for the money.
One can only speculate on the root cause of the problem. In many third world or emerging countries, however, maintenance standards are often inadequate, and so such systems break down far more prematurely, thus making them even bigger money losers.

"For a week this September, dozens of news organizations in the US and around the world will join forces to devote their front pages and air time to a critical but under-covered story: the global climate emergency. This unique media collaboration, timed to coincide with landmark UN Climate Action Summit in New York, is the first initiative of Covering Climate Now, a project co-founded by The Nation and the Columbia Journalism Review, in partnership with The Guardian, which aims to kickstart a conversation among journalists about how news outlets can improve their coverage of the climate crisis.  The project, which is still welcoming additional media partners, includes more than 250 newsrooms, representing every corner of the media landscape, all of whom have pledged to dedicate resources to climate coverage for the week starting 16 September and leading up to the UN Summit on 23 September. The partners include major TV networks (CBS News) , digital players (HuffPost, Vox, the Intercept, Slate), local newspapers (the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Minneapolis Star Tribune),  public radio programs (Marketplace, The World) and many others. Covering Climate Now launched in May at an event at Columbia Journalism School with dozens of newsroom leaders, including the legendary TV journalist Bill Moyers, who delivered the keynote. At the time, the co-founders of Covering Climate Now, Mark Hertsgaard of the Nation and Kyle Pope, editor-in-chief of Columbia Journalism Review, wrote an impassioned oped calling for change in how the media covers the climate crisis. “At a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster, climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media,” Hertsgaard and Pope wrote. “Especially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time.” Partners in the September week of coverage will make their own editorial decisions about what stories to feature. All that’s required is for each outlet to make a good faith effort to increase the amount and the visibility of its climate coverage – to make it clear to their audiences that climate change is not just one more story but the overriding story of our time. The point is to give the climate story the attention and prominence that scientists have long said it demands so that the public and policymakers can make wise choices.

Of course it wouldn’t be long before his flock lost their faith and disappeared.

Recently released MRC report concludes that celebrities who preach green lifestyles live lavish, energy-intensive lives. Photo: MRC.
A similar situation is playing out today when it comes to “climate protection” preaching celebrities and prominent personalities as they demand people scale back their lifestyles and accept Spartan living. All the while these same celebrities enjoy rich and lavish lifestyles in huge mansions, private jets and yachts.
The MRC.org here has released a 28-page report on environmental hypocrites who don’t follow what they preach. At the top of the list we find Leonardo DiCaprio, James Cameron and Al Gore – all of whom boast a net worth of well over a 100 million and frequently use private jets to travel all over the world.
The report features 12 celebrities, and it states there are many more and that they are in good company.

Moreover a  2014 study by the British government found that people who claim to worry about climate change use more electricity than those who do not. Wouldn’t you think that after preaching energy savings for over 25 years, these people would by no be among the most energy frugal by now? They aren’t. The MRC adds:
At the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the speakers alone (not the attendees or notable guests for the summit) traveled a grand total of 1,036,537 miles from locations as distant as China, India and Peru. That’s enough miles to circle the equator 41.6 times. […]
Hollywood has many more climate change alarmist hypocrites who weren’t included in this report. Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, commuted more than 300 miles to work by jet, multiple times a week. Paul McCartney once had his Lexus hybrid car flown from Japan to the UK, which The Huffington Post admitted caused its ‘transport footprint’ to be “over 100 times greater than it should have been.” Not only did Live Earth Concert star Madonna fly all over the world to promote her career, The Daily Mail (UK) reported that she owned “a collection of fuel-guzzling cars, including a Mercedes Maybach, two Range Rovers, Audi A8s and a Mini Cooper S.
Trudie Styler, the wife of Sting, even admitted in 2008 that the couple were climate change hypocrites. According to The Daily Mail (UK), ‘[e]nvironmental experts labelled Sting’s band, The Police, the dirtiest in the world because of the amount of pollution created during last year’s reunion tour of the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, the UK, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, China and Japan.’
The media’s, and particularly the broadcast networks’, lack of coverage of this hypocrisy is inexcusable. The Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics states that journalists need to ‘Provide context. Take special care not to misrepresent or oversimplify in promoting, previewing or summarizing a story.’ Yet, in covering for these celebrities, the media broke this rule in order to promote a liberal, climate change alarmist agenda.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientific Consensus: “Efforts to curtail world temps will almost surely fail”
By Kenneth Richard
Already this year there are 6 peer-reviewed papers examining efforts to curtail CO2 emissions through the use renewable energies. They all conclude that the effort won’t be successful. Given the trillions already committed and at risk of being totally wasted, one has to seriously question the wisdom of the effort.
In fact, some think the renewable energy effort could make things even worse.
What follows are 6 scientific publications from this year alone that tell us the climate protection efforts are not working.
1. Jones and Warner, 2016
“Here we quantify the changes in the global energy mix necessary to address population and climate change under two energy-use scenarios, finding that renewable energy production (9% in 2014) must comprise 87–94% of global energy consumption by 2100. Our study suggests >50% renewable energy needs to occur by 2028 in a <2 °C warming scenario”
Press release here.
“Efforts to curtail world temps will almost surely fail”
The Texas A&M researchers modelled the projected growth in global population and per capita energy consumption, as well as the size of known reserves of oil, coal and natural gas, and greenhouse gas emissions to determine just how difficult it will be to achieve the less-than-2 degree Celsius warming goal.  “It would require rates of change in our energy infrastructure and energy mix that have never happened in world history and that are extremely unlikely to be achieved,” explains Jones.   “Just considering wind power, we found that it would take an annual installation of 485,000 5-megawatt wind turbines by 2028. The equivalent of about 13,000 were installed in 2015. That’s a 37-fold increase in the annual installation rate in only 13 years to achieve just the wind power goal,” adds Jones.  Similar expansion rates are needed for other renewable energy sources.  “To even come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, 50 percent of our energy will need to come from renewable sources by 2028, and today it is only 9 percent, including hydropower. For a world that wants to fight climate change, the numbers just don’t add up to do it.”

2. Lomborg, 2016
“All climate policies by the US, China, the EU and the rest of the world, implemented from the early 2000s to 2030 and sustained through the century will likely reduce global temperature rise about 0.17°C in 2100. These impact estimates are robust to different calibrations of climate sensitivity, carbon cycling and different climate scenarios. Current climate policy promises will do little to stabilize the climate and their impact will be undetectable for many decades.”

3. Moriarty and Honnery, 2016
Highlights: “We argue it is unlikely that RE [renewable energy] can meet existing global energy use.
Fossil fuels face resource depletion, supply security, and climate change problems; renewable energy (RE) may offer the best prospects for their long-term replacement. However, RE sources differ in many important ways from fossil fuels, particularly in that they are energy flows rather than stocks. The most important RE sources, wind and solar energy, are also intermittent, necessitating major energy storage as these sources increase their share of total energy supply. We show that estimates for the technical potential of RE vary by two orders of magnitude, and argue that values at the lower end of the range must be seriously considered, both because their energy return on energy invested falls, and environmental costs rise, with cumulative output. Finally, most future RE output will be electric, necessitating radical reconfiguration of existing grids to function with intermittent RE.”

4. Ferroni and Hopkirk, 2016  
Abstract: “Many people believe renewable energy sources to be capable of substituting fossil or nuclear energy. However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of moderate insolation is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI EXT). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.”
Conclusion: “[A]n electrical supply system based on today’s PV technologies cannot be termed an energy source, but rather a non-sustainable energy sink. … [I]t has become clear that photovoltaic energy at least will not help in any way to replace the fossil fuel.”

5. Bannaga, 2016
“It is evident that UN efforts to combat climate change are not effective because past experience shows that CO2 generation cuts weren’t near enough. The recent Paris Agreement may restore a faith in UN process if implemented but doesn’t reduce temperatures as needed unless all drivers of climate variability are considered, particularly the abortive role of developing cities. The UN Programme appears to be focusing on attaining urban resilience rather than targeting grassroots causes. Urbane-bias global policies drive the rural population to leave their land and flood cities while over-usage of natural resources by the rich is left unchecked.”

6. Kelly, 2016
“The growth of the ecological footprint of a human population about to increase from 7B now to 9B in 2050 raises serious concerns about how to live both more efficiently and with less permanent impacts on the finite world. One present focus is the future of our climate, where the level of concern has prompted actions across the world in mitigation of the emissions of CO2. An examination of successful and failed introductions of technology over the last 200 years generates several lessons that should be kept in mind as we proceed to 80% decarbonize the world economy by 2050. I will argue that all the actions taken together until now to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide will not achieve a serious reduction, and in some cases, they will actually make matters worse. In practice, the scaleand the different specific engineering challenges of the decarbonization project are without precedent in human history. This means that any new technology introductions need to be able to meet the huge implied capabilities. An altogether more sophisticated public debate is urgently needed on appropriate actions that (i) considers the full range of threats to humanity, and (ii) weighs more carefully both the upsides and downsides of taking any action, and of not taking that action.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterMartin Greive and Daniel Wetzel at Germany’s center-right national daily Die Welt have a commentary on renewable energy, telling readers that it will hit the poor in Germany the hardest.
They write that the Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) will result in 540 euros in extra costs for each German household in 2016.
And things are going to get much worse, they warn, adding:
Economic experts believe that extra costs will be 100 billion euros over the next ten years.”
The figures were calculated by the Cologne-based Institute of German Economy (IW Cologne). The costs stem from the 6.35 cents/kwhr feed-in surcharge consumers are forced to pay for green energy, power grid costs, and other charges. Greive and Wetzel also write that the long technical delays dogging North Sea wind parks is causing additional costs for consumers to the tune of 17 euros.

The flagship daily quotes IW Cologne energy expert Esther Chrischilles, who points out that the costs are especially hitting the poor:
Most of the costs a politically dubious with respect to wealth redistribution.”
The Die Welt journalists write that in total the added costs will amount to 100 billion euros for companies and private households over the next ten years, according to Eric Schweitzer, President of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry DIHK).
Michael Fuchs of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU) party says, “I ask myself how consumers are supposed to handle this.”
German Vice Chancellor and Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel is coming under increasing fire for failing to get the electricity costs under control and failing to reform Germany’s crushing EEG feed-in act.

"As viral stunts go, getting the weather onside for your collaboration with the world’s most famous environmental activist is quite the coup. But, unlike newsagents hawking two-for-one lollies and tabloid front pages extolling fun in the sun, the 1975 and Greta Thunberg aren’t pretending there’s any silver lining to this heatwave.  “Unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance,” says Thunberg on the track (confusingly, also called The 1975), a rallying cry for action on the climate crisis.  Over on Twitter, the band’s frontman, Matt Healy, has pointed out that “Steves” and “Marys” identifying themselves as “Brexiteers” have been united in their dismissal of the track. The BBC has helpfully stated that the band will more than likely take international flights to complete their upcoming tour dates, “despite air travel being a significant contributor to climate change”. (Manager Jamie Oborne told the Guardian that they couldn’t fix touring overnight, but that it was no reason not to act.) Sure, an ambient, spoken-word song is probably not going to do much about the “overall failures of our current systems” that Thunberg speaks of. But what it does is to intelligently weaponise the “current systems” within which the 1975 exist. They may not be the world’s most commercially successful band, but – with their stylish aesthetic, unfiltered intimacy with fans and success with a post-genre mix of everything from soft rock to emo – they are one of the most mimicked, and so Thunberg’s message could spread far beyond their network. Spotify’s recommendation algorithms work by assigning thousands of intricate data points to every song, then using that data to link a track you already like, to another one you haven’t heard but would probably like as well. So, it’s easily a short leap from, say, shameless 1975 imitators Catfish and the Bottlemen to the extremely 1975-aping tracks on the new Kaiser Chiefs album to the actual band’s five-minute speech about the imperative to act on the climate emergency. Songs can’t change the world, but they can change minds. Teaming up with Thunberg is also a canny subversion of the music industry’s obsession with “features”, where artists combine star power to sweep up maximum streams and radio playlisting (especially in the US, where radio tends to be segregated by genre). See: the latest albums by Ed Sheeran, Mark Ronson and DJ Khaled, and the charts, where such tracks make up half of the current UK Top 40. The 1975 have never done a feature before, and have criticised it as a shameless grab for chart positions. That they made an exception to centre Thunberg’s vital message shows them using their platform to amplify women’s voices (something they did earlier this year when Healy read, well, something I wrote about misogyny in music at the Brits) instead of coining it in themselves. They are not just ceding the floor: the band and Thunberg’s proceeds from the track are going to Extinction Rebellion. Track features are always timely, and often fleeting things, striking while a trend or artist is hot. And Thunberg is nothing if not the voice of our time. But her track with the 1975 will ultimately open their forthcoming album, Notes on a Conditional Form – an album that, going by their last few, may end up being considered one of the defining records of the 21st century, outlasting this moment. In years to come, their collaboration may stand as a bellwether: will our offspring’s offspring be dumpster diving for old vinyl with which to construct shelter from the sun, or will they live in a world where they can listen back to it and feel relieved that we made it after all?"

By Kenneth Richard
According to a just-published (2016)  Nature scientific paper, large portions of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) are significantly melting from below due to massive geothermal heat flux forcing. A natural explanation for ice sheet loss is not consistent with the paradigm that says the melting of the GIS is largely due to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Brand new paper at Nature:
Melting at the base of the Greenland ice sheet explained by Iceland hotspot history
Ice-penetrating radar and ice core drilling have shown that large parts of the north-central Greenland ice sheet are melting from below. It has been argued that basal ice melt is due to the anomalously high geothermal flux that has also influenced the development of the longest ice stream in Greenland. Here we estimate the geothermal flux beneath the Greenland ice sheet and identify a 1,200-km-long and 400-km-wide geothermal anomaly beneath the thick ice cover. We suggest that this anomaly explains the observed melting of the ice sheet’s base, which drives the vigorous subglacial hydrology and controls the position of the head of the enigmatic 750-km-long northeastern Greenland ice stream. Our combined analysis of independent seismic, gravity and tectonic data, implies that the geothermal anomaly, which crosses Greenland from west to east, was formed by Greenland’s passage over the Iceland mantle plume between roughly 80 and 35 million years ago. We conclude that the complexity of the present-day subglacial hydrology and dynamic features of the north-central Greenland ice sheet originated in tectonic events that pre-date the onset of glaciation in Greenland by many tens of millions of years.”
Below are four older scientific papers also indicating that the source of the rapid melt water production in northern and central Greenland is significantly related to high geothermal heat origins:

1. High Geothermal Heat Flow, Basal Melt, and the Origin of Rapid Ice Flow in Central Greenland
Age-depth relations from internal layering reveal a large region of rapid basal melting in Greenland. Melt is localized at the onset of rapid ice flow in the large ice stream that drains north off the summit dome and other areas in the northeast quadrant of the ice sheet. Locally, high melt rates indicate geothermal fluxes 15 to 30 times continental background. The southern limit of melt coincides with magnetic anomalies and topography that suggest a volcanic origin.”
2. Subglacial topography and geothermal heat flux: Potential interactions with drainage of the Greenland ice sheet
Introduction: [T]here is a growing body of evidence suggesting more extensive basal melting in the central region of northern Greenland.  Fahnestock et al. [2001a] determined age-depth relationships and basal melt rate from ice-penetrating radar in northern Greenland and detected high basal melt, in places up to 0.2 m/yr, under the onset region of the Northeast Ice Stream and its southern tributaries. This basal melt requires a geothermal heat flux much greater than the estimated continental background of 57 mW/m2  [Sclater et al., 1980],and Fahnestock et al., [2001a]  speculate that the inferred large heat flow may be of volcanic origin. Similarly, at the base of the NGRIP deep ice core, drilled on the ice divide 170 km northwest of the onset region of the Northeast Ice Stream, the observed basal temperature is at the pressure-melting point [Anderson et al., 2004; Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003]. The basal melt rate at NGRIP reaches 7.5 mm ice per year, and the modeled geothermal heat flux is between 90 and 160 mW/m2 along the flow line originating 50 km upstream of the drill site [Dahl-Jensen et al., 2003].  Again, the origin of the large geothermal heat flux remains unidentified. Ice-penetrating radar profiles show bright bed reflections in many locations in northern Greenland, indicating the presence of lubricating meltwater at the glacier base.”
3. Estimating the basal melt rate at NorthGRIP using a Monte Carlo technique
From radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys and ice core data it can be seen that the ice sheet is melting at the base in a large area in Northern Greenland. The RES images reveal internal layers in the ice. The layers are former deposition surfaces and are thus isochrones. Undulations of the isochrones in regions where the base is smooth suggest that the basal melt rate changes over short distances. This indicates that the geothermal heat flux is very high and has large spatial variability in Northern Greenland.… Combining the estimated basal melt rates with the observed borehole temperatures allows us to convert the basal melt rates to geothermal heat flow values. From the two-dimensional model we find the basal melt rate and geothermal heat flux at NorthGRIP to be 6.1 mm a−1 and 129 mW m−2, respectively.”
4. Basal melt at NorthGRIP modeled from borehole, ice-core and radio-echo sounder observations
From temperature measurements down through the 3001 m deep borehole at the North Greenland Icecore Project (NorthGRIP) drill site, it is now clear that the ice at the base, 3080 m below the surface, is at the pressure-melting point. This is supported by the measurements on the ice core where the annual-layer thicknesses show there is bottom melting at the site and upstream from the borehole. … The results show the geothermal heat flow varies from 50 to 200 mW m-2 along the 100 km section of the modeled flowline. The melt rate at the NorthGRIP site is 0.75 cm a-1, but the deep ice in the NorthGRIP core originated 50 km upstream and has experienced melt rates as high as 1.1 cm a-1.”

"Plant enough trees and you’ll be able to take the oomph out of damaging storms. That’s the message that is coming out of a study published in Environmental Research Letters, which suggests that major reforestation across Europe has the potential to reduce the number of extra-tropical cyclones by as much as 80%. Scientists from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used a climate model to compare the number and intensity of cyclones under two scenarios: Europe devoid of trees and Europe covered in trees. Forests make the land bumpier (than a field of wheat say) and the results suggest that this extra friction helps to slow cyclones down. The results show that a tree-covered Europe would have around 10% fewer cyclones on western European coasts, rising to 80% fewer cyclones in eastern Europe. That’s because most cyclones approach from the west, meaning those that reach eastern Europe have to bounce over more trees.  One downside to fewer storms could be a reduction in rainfall, but it’s likely that increased evapotranspiration from extra trees would help to make up the shortfall. Other things, like wind turbines or skyscrapers, could also increase surface roughness and slow cyclones down, but they’d likely reduce rainfall too."
"Protesters from the climate crisis group Extinction Rebellion have brought disruption to Capitol Hill in Washington, superglueing themselves to doorways to block politicians and staff. Just after 6pm, six activists stood in doorways to a tunnel connecting the Cannon office building to the US Capitol in an attempt to prevent members of Congress attending an evening vote.  A total of 17 activists were arrested and charged with crowding and obstructing, according to US Capitol police. Several were also charged with defacing public property. Demonstrators said their goal was to force a House and Senate concurrent resolution on the climate emergency – currently on hold – to receive immediate attention. In three pairs, they used Gorilla Glue to stick their hands to the doors and each other. They were draped in yellow and red tape that said “Caution” and wore yellow hazard signs that said “Declare climate emergency” or “Closed. We’re sorry. Due to the climate emergency Congress is shut down until sufficient action is taken to address the crisis.” A few members of Congress arrived and, finding their route blocked, were forced to turn around. But other people, including fellow activists, gathered under the Cannon building rotunda to watch. The demonstrators shouted, “Climate emergency now!”, “We’re out of time!” and “This is not a drill!” Among the protesters, her right hand glued to an open glass door, was Sara Soko, 22, from Washington, who said she was prepared to get arrested if necessary. “I’m doing this today because the Congress is dragging their feet on declaring a climate emergency, and it’s supposed to be like a speedy transition, and that’s what the resolution says. So we’re here to try and make this more urgent.” Politicians had failed, Soko added. “They have not done anything,” she said. “And this resolution is asking the simplest thing: it’s just to recognise the science and to declare it an emergency and that we need to do something. And they can’t even do that.” After a few minutes, US Capitol police arrived at the scene, pushing under one of the protester’s arms. He loudly exclaimed: “Ow!” The police then ordered spectators back about 10ft and formed a line of five officers. One protester exclaimed: “DC was under water last week. DC was on fire this weekend. We can’t live much longer like this.” Another said: “I know you’re listening, officers, I know you have children. Do you want them to live in a world that’s burning? … I’ve always wanted to have children. Three weeks ago I broke down in my car because I realised I can’t bring a child into this world.” Then a chant began: “What do we want? Climate emergency. When do we want it? Now.” Another loud chant followed: “Climate extinction rebellion.” After a brief pause, a young man who was looking on began singing We Shall Not Be Moved and others joined in. Finally, about half an hour after the protest began, police ordered the impromptu gathering, including reporters, to move back and out of sight of the doorway protesters. A simultaneous protest took place in the Rayburn building, again to deny access to the US Capitol. Kaela Bamberger, a spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which has staged attention-grabbing events in the US and abroad, said a total of 16 activists had risked arrest with the intention of disrupting “business as usual”. She added: “We believe the issue is so urgent it should be treated as a top priority. Petitioning and lobbying have been shown to be ineffective in the past, so we are taking extreme action to reflect the extreme nature of the crisis. The climate emergency should be treated with the gravity it deserves.“The legislative process has failed on the issue. We’re using nonviolent civil disobedience to combat complacency in Congress.” Extinction Rebellion Washington DC published photos and videos of the intervention on its Twitter account. One tweet said: “We are superglued to the tunnels under the Capitol because what other choice do we have when our politicians choose money over life? We are risking our freedom and safety to demand a climate emergency declaration.” Outside the Longworth building at 8.15pm, at least 10 of the protesters, under arrest and wearing plastic cuffs, were calmly loaded into two police vans while their possessions were held in transparent plastic bags as supporters watched. Some described how they had unstuck their hands from the doors in what was a slow and painful process. “I was worried about losing skin but that didn’t happen,” one said. The organisation Movement for a People’s Party, which is separate from Extinction Rebellion but was involved in the demonstration, issued a press release stating that its national director, Nick Brana, had been arrested during protests at three underground tunnel entrances leading to the Capitol. “It is not known what charges have been leveled or when Brana and the others will be released,” it added."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe July 24, 2016 print edition of national flagship daily Die Welt wrote a feature story on how German citizens are becoming fed up with the widespread crony capitalism of the wind energy business and are thus now mobilizing a fierce rebellion. The German daily writes of health issues for people living in their vicinity.
The article starts by featuring technology fan Volker Tschischke, who was once an ardent proponent of renewable energy – until wind turbines were built close to his residence and encircled his home village of Etteln. Now he leads a citizens initiative against the construction of wind parkc. The turbines “have driven him to resistance“, Die Welt writes.
Local politicians are no longer serving the interests of the local people, but rather “are rolling out the red carpet for wind power companies” and appear to be “no longer listening to the people and about the concerns of their everyday lives,” the national German daily writes.
A “destructive force”
Die Welt describes an Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) that is “dividing the people“, where those who live in big cities and thus not effected by the blight are open to wind parks, while those living in the countryside are fed up and fiercely resisting them. Die Welt reports that people across rural Germany “no longer view the Energiewende as a necessary national project, but as a destructive force.”
Now, ever so gradually, it even appears that Berlin is getting the message as leading parties see their poll numbers dropping. Die Welt writes that Berlin is now throttling the expansion of wind parks and working to “deescalate the conflict“.
“Ruined and destroyed for generations”
As an example of blight and destruction, Die Welt cites the area surrounding the central city of Paderborn, quoting a local resident who is thinking about packing up and leaving: “Here the living area is being ruined and destroyed for generations.”
Even though Berlin is scrambling to put the brakes on the uncontrolled spread of wind turbine littering across the rural landscape, local residents often remain powerless against the mighty wind industrialists and projects that have already been proposed. And even when local political leaders side up with their residents against the parks, Die Welt describes a David versus Goliath fight:
On one side there’s the mayor of the town and some of his staff, and on the other side there are corporation-like companies that hire staffs of lawyers.”

In such cases the big wind companies have an easy time pile-driving their projects through, Die Welt writes.
Opponents resort to sabotage
Also wind park developers often promise towns and villages cash-flow from wind projects, But as Die Welt reports, most never end up seeing any money. “The promise of business tax revenue is a ‘large fairy tale’.”
Die Welt also adds that wind park opponents are often labeled “grumblers“, “troublemakers” or “Energiewende blockers who use ludicrous ways to try to stop the success of the Energiewende.”
The conflict has even escalated to the point where opponents have even sabotaged a wind measurement instrument used to check the feasibility of a possible future project. Farmers are even blocking deforestation equipment with their tractors, Die Welt reports.
Lawless, Wild West conditions
In other locations it seems that wind energy development resembles the Wild West where there is a complete lack of law and order. Town have corrupted the planning, permitting and building process. Die Welt writes sometimes sleazy towns act as planner, permitting authority, builder and operator all in one. Nothing stands in the way. There are no checks and balances. Only a few profiteers. The German daily writes:
The county of Aurich is a stakeholder in wind park projects. For the investor that is totally practical. He is thus practically the funder, impact study conductor and project approver all in one.”
Whether its solar power or wind energy, there’s a common thread: A very select few are profiting hugely while the rest of society are left to clean up a huge industrial, financial and environmental mess.

"Just after 6am, Victor Funez fills a three-gallon plastic pitcher with water from a tap in the cemetery, balances it on his head and trudges home, where his wife waits to soak maize kernels so she can make tortillas for breakfast. Funez, 38, stops briefly to help his daughter with some homework before heading back to the cemetery with the pink urn. This load fills large plastic milk and juice bottles used for drinking throughout the day. The tap is the family’s only source of water, so Funez makes the journey along the dusty dirt road 15 to 20 times each day. “My husband’s job is to fetch the water so I can do the housework. It’s like this every day, all day,” said Bianca Lopez, 46. “We can live without electricity – we have candles and lamps – but water, that’s essential.” La Estación is a makeshift community of 59 households along disused railway tracks that cut across Nejapa – a semi-urban municipality on the northern outskirts of El Salvador’s capital. This tiny Central American state is one of the most murderous in the world, plagued by warring gang factions and security forces who shoot to kill. Relentless bloodshed and chronic unemployment have driven wave after wave of migration as Salvadorans seek a better life. But in recent years, widespread water shortages are increasingly helping fuel unrest and forced displacement. “Marginalized communities struggle day to day to get access to enough water. It’s not a question that this could one day cause social conflict – it already is … the whole country is close to crisis,” said Silvia de Larios, the former director of ecosystems and wildlife at the ministry of environment and natural resources (known by its Spanish acronym, Marn). El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Central America. It also has the region’s lowest water reserves, which are depleting fast thanks to the climate crisis, pollution and unchecked commercial exploitation. According to one study, El Salvador will run out of water within 80 years unless radical action is taken to improve the way the country manages its dwindling water supplies. As in just about every aspect of life in El Salvador, the water problem is only exacerbated by corporate interests, corruption and the country’s vicious street gangs. Local women have long used the banks of the San Antonio River as an open-air laundry. But the laundry spot lies within Barrio 18 territory, whereas La Estación is controlled by the rival MS-13 gang – and crossing gang boundaries can get you killed. Nejapa has one of the highest murder rates in the country, with 71 homicides per 100,000 habitants in 2018, according to research by Elizabeth G Kennedy, a migration and violence scholar. López’s only income comes from washing her neighbour’s clothes, but she endures the hardship of the tap and pitchers rather than crossing the frontline. “It would be much easier at the river, but it’s not worth my life.” For some, there’s no choice but to take the risk. At 10.30am, Elena Fuente, 46 and daughter-in-law Jocelyn Álvarez, 23, rush towards a waiting rickshaw with plastic bowls jam-packed with freshly washed clothes balanced on their heads. Álvarez loses her balance and falls, scraping her knees badly. She’s new to the river laundry, as their MS-13-controlled neighbourhood previously had running water every night, but there’s been not a drop for the past 22 days, and no one knows why. “We risk the gangs because we’ve no other choice – we’d run out of clean clothes,” said Fuente. None of the women would dream of bringing a man to the spot, she added. “That would cause a problem.” Years of drought has prompted water rationing in urban and rural areas across the country. Yet much is wasted: most rainwater is lost due to widespread deforestation and eroded river basins; once in the system, 48% of water is lost through leaks. Sources are already running dry: the Nejapa aquifer provides 40% of the water used by the overcrowded capital, but the water level has shrunk by 20% in the past five years alone. Meanwhile, a lush forest, known as the lungs of Nejapa, is being chopped down to make way for gated housing developments with private underground wells. Nejapa’s biggest industrial water guzzlers and alleged polluters – the local Coca-Cola bottling company and sugar cane plantations – have been unaffected by rationing. In the fields behind the Coca-Cola factory, murky, foul-smelling water can be seen pumping into a stream. AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer which controls the bottling company, did not respond to specific questions about the pollution, but said it was committed to sustainability and conservation. At least 90% of El Salvador’s surface water is contaminated by untreated sewage, agricultural and industrial waste, according to studies by Marn. “There are no clear rules, no sanctions, no monitoring, and big business uses these legal vacuums to exploit water as a product for profit. It’s the poorest who suffer most,” said De Larios. The suffering is stark in nearby Joya Galana, a campesino canton of 53 families with a bird’s-eye view – and smell – of the country’s biggest open rubbish dump, which has polluted every river and underground water source for several miles. Joya’s water supply is piped in from another community, but was recently cut off for three months after thousands of dollars were stolen from a maintenance fund and a waterhole fund dried up. The supply is back for now, but the situation is precarious. “Today we have water, tomorrow who knows?” said Sonia Guardado, 40, who, like many others, is considering leaving the country. “Our water supply isn’t secure. We need solution, or else we’ll have to leave.” Amid the escalating water crisis, a network of grassroots groups, environmentalists and the Catholic church convinced lawmakers to make history in 2017 by banning metal mining – a major cause of pollution. But politicians have so far refused to create an independent regulatory system, which campaigners argue would put human consumption and sustainability above corporate interests. Andres McKinley, a water and mining scholar from the Central American University (UCA), said: “This is a huge political issue; we must change who controls water. That’s the war we’re in.” La Estación was built on disused state land in 2015 by families unable to afford anything else. Four years later, it’s still battling for running water, a sewage system and land titles (the community is technically illegal). It’s a constant grind to get water – and to get rid of it – and both challenges fuel health problems and tensions between neighbours. At 2pm, thunder rolls and rain crashes down on the metal sheet roofs. Some neighbours rush outside to uncover tall barrels to collect the precious drops, but the rain also floods shallow ditches along the unpaved roads. As the storm subsides, clouds of mosquitoes appear above the dirty puddles. Last year, health inspectors blamed the community’s contraband water supplies and makeshift drainage system for a spike in mosquito-borne dengue and chikungunya. Neighbours in adjacent communities with running water stopped selling it to La Estación under threat of fines; others put up barbed wire fences to stop them laying hoses. So the inhabitants of La Estación have had to be creative. Health and water officials clock off at 4pm. At about 4.01, Esmeralda Cerritos, 29 , a local union activist, unspools a long hose and attaches it to a tap in a the house of a neighbour who charges her $2 a month. She dangles the other end of the hose into the pila, a deep trough next to the cement sink in the yard, and gathers dozens of containers and bottles, each specifically identified in the precise lexicon of water storage: balde, pinchanga, barril, tambor, cántaro, juacal, pinchel and  garrofón.  It takes three hours to fill the receptacles, which will last the family three or four days. “We’ve been trying to get running water for four years, but there’s always another hurdle,” she said. A community meeting is held to discuss the latest challenge: the health ministry will only authorize running water for households with septic toilets, which cost about $500. This either means the poorest neighbours will be left without water, or the entire community will be forced to wait another a year until a sewage plant is built. The community votes to wait, in order to avoid further divisions: in 2015, a mayoral candidate promised people running water in exchange for $250 and their votes. Fifteen households agreed: they have water (though no legal permits), and they refuse to share with neighbours. Cerritos spoke out against the deal, but received death threats. With gang members on either side of the division, Cerritos backed off. “The cycle of violence begins when the state abandons communities by not providing fundamental human rights like water, education, health and jobs – which end up being the fertile ground in which gangs and violence grows,” said Jeanne Rikkers, a violence prevention expert with the NGO Cristosal. “But the fix is only ever about the violence, never the root causes. As water become increasingly critical, gangs will likely become involved in community conflicts as the state is absent.”"
"About 200 reindeer have been found dead from starvation in the Arctic archipelago Svalbard, an unusually high number, the Norwegian Polar Institute has said, pointing the finger at climate crisis. During an annual census of the wild reindeer population on the group of islands about 1,200km (746 miles) from the north pole, three researchers from the institute identified the carcasses of about 200 deer believed to have starved to death last winter.  Ashild Onvik Pedersen, the head of the census, said the high degree of mortality was a consequence of climate crisis, which according to climate scientists, is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as the rest of the world. “Climate change is making it rain much more. The rain falls on the snow and forms a layer of ice on the tundra, making grazing conditions very poor for animals,” she said. In winter, Svalbard reindeer find vegetation in the snow using their hooves, but alternating freezing and thawing periods can create layers of impenetrable ice, depriving the reindeers of nourishment. According to Onvik Pedersen, a comparable death toll has been recorded only once before – after the winter of 2007-2008 – since monitoring of the reindeer population started 40 years ago. The increased mortality is also due in part to a significant increase in the number of reindeer in the Norwegian archipelago. That is partly thanks to climate crisis and the warmer summers, meaning more individuals compete in the same grazing areas. Since the 1980s, the number of reindeer has doubled in Svalbard, and now stands at about 22,000, according to the Norwegian Polar Institute."

"Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has surged above three football fields a minute, according to the latest government data, pushing the world’s biggest rainforest closer to a tipping point beyond which it cannot recover. The sharp rise – following year-on-year increases in May and June – confirms fears that president Jair Bolsonaro has given a green light to illegal land invasion, logging and burning. Clearance so far in July has hit 1,345 sq km, a third higher than the previous monthly record under the current monitoring system by the Deter B satellite system, which started in 2015. With five days remaining, this is on course to be the first month for several years in which Brazil loses an area of forest bigger than Greater London. The steady erosion of tree cover weakens the role of the rainforest in stabilising the global climate. Scientists warn that the forest is in growing danger of degrading into a savannah, after which its capacity to absorb carbon will be severely diminished, with consequences for the rest of the planet. “It’s very important to keep repeating these concerns. There are a number of tipping points which are not far away,” said Philip Fearnside, a professor at Brazil’s National Institute of Amazonian Research. “We can’t see exactly where they are, but we know they are very close. It means we have to do things right away. Unfortunately that is not what is happening. There are people denying we even have a problem.” It may also complicate ratification of Brazil’s biggest ever trade deal with the European Union if EU legislators decide the South American nation is not keeping its side of the bargain, which includes a commitment to slow deforestation in line with the Paris climate agreement. The official numbers from the National Institute for Space Research are a growing embarrassment to Bolsonaro, who has tried to fob them off as lies and criticised the head of the institute. Earlier this week, the president insisted the numbers should be screened by the ministry of science and technology and shown to him before being made public so that he did not get “caught with his pants down”. This has raised fears that the data could be vetted in future rather than automatically updated online each day as is currently the case. In his first seven months in power, Bolsonaro, who was elected with strong support from agribusiness and mining interests, has moved rapidly to erode government agencies responsible for forest protection. He has weakened the environment agency and effectively put it under the supervision of the agricultural ministry, which is headed by the leader of the farming lobby. His foreign minister has dismissed climate science as part of a global Marxist plot. The president and other ministers have criticised the forest monitoring agency, Ibama, for imposing fines on illegal land grabbers and loggers. The government has also moved to weaken protections for nature reserves, indigenous territories and zones of sustainable production by forest peoples and invited businesspeople to register land counter-claims within those areas. This has emboldened those who want to invade the forest, clear it and claim it for commercial purposes, mostly in the speculative expectation it will rise in value, but also partly for cattle pastures, soya fields and mines. Earlier this month, it was reported that thousands of gold miners illegally invaded Yanomami indigenous territory near the border with Venezuela. Elsewhere, illegal loggers have mounted at least two attacks in response to Ibama enforcement operations, according to the Folha newspaper. On 4 July, they reportedly burned an Ibama truck in Espigão d’Oeste, Rondônia state and last week they were said to have burned bridges in Placas, Pará state. Rather than defend his officials, the environment minister Ricardo Salles appeared to side with the loggers when he gave a speech to a group of them in Rondônia soon afterwards, in which he reportedly told them: “The timber industry deserves to be respected … What happens today in Brazil, unfortunately, is the result of years and years and years of a public policy of producing laws, rules, regulations that are not always related to the real world. What we are doing now is precisely bringing the legal part of the real world that happens in every country from north to south.” During a recent G20 meeting, Bolsonaro told the German chancellor Angela Merkel that she had no right to criticise because Brazil’s conservation record was superior to that of Europe’s. This is a dubious claim, according to Climate Observatory, which cites World Bank data that shows Germany has given protected status to a bigger share of its land than Brazil. Brazil is also going backwards fast. After an 80% reduction in the rate of deforestation between 2006 and 2012, successive governments have relaxed protections. Clearance has been creeping up. Last year, deforestation rose 13% to the highest level in a decade. This year is on course to be far worse and the trend is back towards the dark days of the early 2000s. “Unfortunately, it is absurd, but it should not catch anyone by surprise. President Jair Bolsonaro and minister Ricardo Salles are dismantling our socio-environmental policies,” said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, an NGO formed by a coalition of environmental groups. He said Salles had eradicated the department responsible for policies to combat deforestation, that no leaders have been appointed in eight of the nine Ibama regional offices, and that operations to combat environmental crimes declined 70% between January and April 2019 compared with the same period last year. The Deter satellite data is considered preliminary, but it is usually a guide to the longer-term trends. More detailed annual figures are usually released towards the end of the year, after the National Institute for Space Research has calculated data from the more powerful Prodes satellite system. Trees are considered essential to climate stability. Earlier this month, a study indicated that planting a trillion trees could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities. But scientists say maintaining existing forests, particularly in the tropics, is far more important."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the Institute of German Business (IW) the cost of Germany’s once highly touted “Energiewende” (transition to green energy) will soar to a whopping €31 billion ($35 billion) in 2016 alone, thus further burdening the already ailing German consumer.
Hat-tip: Gerti.

That’s a huge sum of money for the country of 80 million citizens. So, for all that money, are they now getting more beautiful weather and great results cutting back “climate-harmful” CO2 emissions? You’d certainly hope so. Sadly, the answer is s big fat “NEIN”.
Nothing in return for the money
In fact Germany’s CO2 emissions have not dropped at all over the past 7 years, and even went up a percentage point last year. Moreover, weather conditions continue today as they always have: typically rainy, cool, gray, windy and raw. For the roughly €1200 or so per year the average household has to fork out each year, it all sounds like an awfully raw deal (unless you happen to be one of the lucky few making money hand over fist in the scam). And that €1200 figure is only going to go up rapidly in the years ahead.
The www.finanznachrichten.de writes that the 2016 figure is about 3 billion (11%) more than a year earlier (2015). That’s unsustainable burden growth.

“Grid stabilization” adding to the costs
One reason for the ever increasing costs, the site writes, is the “costs for power grid stabilization“. As more highly fluctuating, weather-dependent power comes online, the costlier the grid stabilization measures become. What was once a highly stable energy supply system requiring intervention only a dozen times per year, now requires tens of thousands of interventions by the grid operators each year.
Often times wind and solar parks are forced to be taken offline to prevent the grid from getting toasted by power surges from wind gusts and sun bursts. In such cases, the wind and sun park operators are paid whether they produce or not. Last year consumers were saddled with over half a billion euros from such “unproduced energy” costs. The Energiewende is morphing into a central planning folly of the scale matched only by the Venezuelan Chavez communists.
30% higher electric bills by 2030
Another reason cited for the exploding costs is the continued new installation of wind and sun energy generation systems. Thus it is little wonder that that leading German politicians, such as Michael Fuchs, are getting antsy and calling a stop of the construction of new wind parks for which there are no power transmission lines. If this is not done, Fuchs says, German households face 30% higher electric bills already by 2020.
Just a matter of time before the fuses start blowing.

"Thriving doesn’t quite cover it. New data released quietly late last week underscores the staggering pace of growth of renewable energy across Australia. Nearly 3.5 gigawatts of large-scale clean energy projects were built in 2018. In capacity terms, this is more than twice the scale of Hazelwood, the giant Victorian brown coal plant that shut abruptly a couple of years ago, and it more than tripled the previous record for renewable energy installed in one year, set in 2017.  In generation terms, the amount of clean electricity being sent into Australian homes and businesses is expected to increase 36% this year, and should grow another 25% next year. The Clean Energy Regulator, which released the report, says this makes Australia the global leader in per capita renewable energy deployment. In an outcome considered near impossible four years ago, the country already has enough projects committed to meet the national 2020 renewable energy target, roughly equivalent to about 23% of electricity required. The regulator says Australia will go close to generating a level of clean power next year that the parliament legislated to avoid in 2015, after the Abbott government considered trying to abolish the 2020 target altogether before settling on reducing it by about a fifth. With the target surpassed and the incentives associated with it no longer available for new developments, analysts say large clean energy plants are being built based more on commercial factors. While state targets are playing a role, notably in Victoria, the dramatic fall in the cost of clean energy has driven businesses to sign direct contracts with new renewable energy suppliers to avoid high market prices, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, says the pace of growth is equivalent to the electricity boom of the 1950s, when new coal and hydro plants transformed the electricity system. In a new report for the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, he says the most populous state, NSW, doubled the power it received from large-scale wind and solar plants in just 14 months. “There are just heaps of projects in the pipeline,” Saddler says. “NSW has lagged behind South Australia and Victoria for windfarms in particular, and Queensland has been even worse, but that has changed.” He says the new renewable projects in NSW should comfortably fill the gap that will arise when the Liddell coal-fired plant shuts in 2022, a planned event deemed so potentially disastrous a year ago that the Coalition under Malcolm Turnbull attempted to put pressure on the plant’s owner, AGL, into reversing its decision. The surge in clean generation is creating conditions that would have been unimaginable not so long ago. For a brief period last weekend, so much energy was being captured from the wind and sun, and demand for electricity use dropped so low, that the spot price for wholesale electricity simultaneously fell to $0 in each of the five eastern states connected through the national grid. At that moment, 44% of the electricity being used across the market was from a renewable source, compared with 26% across the week. In terms of power bills, the zero price was mostly inconsequential. It was brief – most electricity is sold at long-term contract prices and the wholesale cost is only a fraction of what people are ultimately charged. But Tristan Edis, a director and analyst with consultants Green Energy Markets, says it was a significant moment for what it points to. “I was surprised it happened, but what it tells us is it could soon end up happening on days when demand is not low,” he says. “We are adding so much solar on top of existing solar at the moment. It is making a real difference in the middle of the day.” The transformation under way is posing serious questions for regulators and generating companies. Coal-fired power plants, which still provide more than 60% of grid electricity, have traditionally been considered inflexible and capable of operating around the clock. Some black coal plants in NSW are being turned off during periods when it is not profitable to run them. Others are coming under increasing pressure as the amount of renewable generation increases. While the government now requires electricity generators to give three years’ notice before they shut a power plant down – an attempt to avoid a repeat of the abrupt closure of Hazelwood – analysts believe it is highly likely some will stop operating sooner than currently planned. A big question for the clean energy industry is: can the pace of investment last? As Guardian Australia reported last year, conventional wisdom has been that clean energy investment and the pace of change in the system would fall off once the renewable energy target stopped driving new projects unless there was a new national policy to replace it. The federal government has no plans to introduce one, beyond a shortlist of projects it is considering underwriting but is yet to develop. State targets have generally been considered not enough to fill the void. That remains the most popular view. The Clean Energy Regulator says investment after 2020 remains uncertain. But the Australian Electricity Market Operator last year found that even a business-as-usual path, including Victoria’s target of 50% renewables, was likely to lead to about 46% clean energy by 2030. Analyses had found that Australia could and would need to do more to play its part in achieving the Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Edis points out that some of the clean energy investment decisions now coming through were made when wholesale prices were high. As more generation comes on, supply outstrips demand and prices fall, there is less incentive to build unless a government policy requires it. “To be honest, I expected the investment would have slowed a fair bit earlier,” Edis says. “My feeling is it should drop away over the next six months or so. Investors will then be looking for the next coal plant to cark it.” Saddler is less certain. He sees roadblocks to further investment, including the challenge of connecting clean energy plants on greenfield sites to the grid and the need to “firm” variable renewable generation with increased between-state transmission cables and energy storage. But he says analysts and bureaucrats increasingly think some spending may continue in a way that was not expected a year ago. “It’s really just the commonwealth that’s a brake on things,” he says. “The question now is: how significant a brake are they?”"

==================================
The online SVZ here reported yesterday on a wind-turbine construction accident occurring in Southern Germany. Workers of the Hamburg-based Nordex company were operating a large hoisting crane by remote control as it lifted the 60-tonne wind turbine rotor assembly for mounting onto the 200-meter tall tower. At 60 meters height the entire assembly came crashing down onto the earth below.
See photo here.
According to an eyewitness, a gust of wind may have caused the rotor to strike the tower before falling. The SVZ reports that the impact likely caused irreparable damage to the structure’s foundation, and so the entire turbine unit will have to be rebuilt complete from scratch. Damage is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of euros. No one was injured.
The accident is now under investigation and a construction strop has been ordered until the cause of the accident is determined. The SVZ writes that the estimated cost of a new wind turbine is near 5 million euros.

"Germany’s Green party has proposed stay-at-home working to help the nation cope with record temperatures. Just as other Europeans have found themselves struggling to deal with unprecedented heat levels, Germans have also been trying to find ways to cool off. “Heat-free home office days” are the latest suggestion.  With experts warning that temperatures closer to 50C will soon become the norm – instead of the lower 40s as they were this week – the opposition Greens say the government needs a heat action plan enabling employees to stay at home. The party is calling for Hitzefrei or “heat-free” leave for workers and children. In a statement, the party, which is enjoying about 22.5% support in the polls, said: “We need to be prepared for the fact that these heatwaves are only going to continue, what with the ongoing climate crisis.” Anton Hofreiter, the head of the Greens parliamentary group, and Bettina Hoffmann, the party’s environmental expert, have drawn up the proposals as part of their heat action plan, calling for “home office” for all employees except those who for operational reasons have to go to work. The proposal came as forest fires raged around the town of Jüterborg in the state of Brandenburg, with 50 to 100 hectares alight. Firefighters could do little more than to look on due to the large number of munitions buried underground at the former GDR military training grounds with the danger of detonations making the burning forests too dangerous to enter. Even as temperatures lowered on Friday across western Europe in the wake of record highs in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Paris, the continent continued to feel the effects of the heatwave. In France, hundreds of hectares of fields caught fire in Oise, the nation’s second largest grain-producing region, resulting in farmers being ordered to stop harvesting. At least one farmer was killed when his harvester became engulfed in flames, local media reported. Belgium also suffered its first death as a direct result of the heatwave when the body of a 66-year-old woman was found near her caravan close to the beach. Harvesting is in full swing in France, the European Union’s largest grain producer and exporter, where searing temperatures this week broke records in many parts of the country as well . It was the first time the authorities have ordered a halt to the harvest in Oise, FNSEA, France’s largest farm union, said. The German Greens argue that those who work outdoors on construction sites or on farms are among millions who face a “health hazard” from the heat. Elsewhere, in residencies for the sick or elderly, “cool rooms” should be set up, the party said. It is also calling for the introduction of more green spaces, with “trees, parks, green open spaces and paths” providing “large cooling air-conditioning systems” for towns and cities.  France is seen as an example to follow, with its government working on the implementation of a similar multi-faceted heat action plan. Hoffmann said not only was employees’ health under threat but their concentration levels also suffered. “Because heat reduces performance and concentration ability, it’s also in the interests of our economy to protect people from the heat”. According to one medical expert, for every 10-degree increase in summer heat, productivity sinks by 30%. But employment representatives say the majority of German employees were needed in the workplaceand other measures had to be taken instead. Wolfgang Steiger of the ruling CDU’s economics council, called the Greens’ proposals unrealistic. “Work that needs to be done needs to be done, otherwise our economy cannot function,” he said. On Thursday, the highest temperature ever recorded was in Lingen in north-west Germany, where it reached 42.6C. Daniela Jacob of the Hamburg-based Climate Service Center Germany, is among a growing number of experts to argue that temperatures in the 40s will become a new norm and will creep closer to 50Cs over the next three decades. “If one believes in the regional climate models … we could be seeing temperatures of up to 44, 45 or 46C.” "

To answer that, lately I’ve been telling them to just look right at home in Germany. When elected officials don’t take the public seriously, then political heads roll. Welcome to democracy.
Last Sunday the German state of Hesse, home of financial center Frankfurt, held municipal elections. The results were (for some) eye-popping. Like in America, mainstream politicians are taking massive blows.
Not only are people fed up with the arrogance of the political mainstream in USA, but so it is in Germany as well.
Over the past weeks and months there’s been a lot of grumbling among the German public amid accusations the mainstream parties have stopped taking their worries and concerns seriously. The biggest issue of concern, among many, is the mass immigration of Muslims into Europe and the continent’s security.
Voters in the state of Hesse have made their voices heard
Angela Merkel’s CDU party took a major blow in a number of cities in Hesse. The anti-immigrant, rightwing AfD party won 13.2 percent of votes in Hesse on Sunday, making them the third largest party behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who won 28.2 percent and 28.0% respectively. The German Green party lost almost one third of their voters.

Over the years Angela Merkel has shifted the party to the center, making it almost indistinguishable from its traditional rival center-left SPD socialist party on a number issues. This naturally left the right political spectrum wide open for the taking. Today mainstream Germans politicians are aghast that the AfD has rushed in to fill the massive political void. Last Sunday’s election showed this in the clearest terms.
German mainstream parties in collapse
And things are only getting even worse for the mainstream parties. Today Germany’s once traditional CDU and SPD parties find themselves in full blown collapse.
This coming Sunday the rich southern state of Baden Württemberg will be holding state elections, and both mainstream parties are expected to see astonishing losses. Merkel’s CDU is forecast to pick up only a miserable 28.5% of the vote, a whopping 10.5% less than 5 years ago. The socialist SPD party faces total ruin, projected to pick up only 12.5% of the vote, which is 10.6% less then the already miserable 23.1% they got in 2011. The hard right AfD on the other hand, is expected to haul in 12.5%.
German Minister scolds the public
Many leaders of the old mainstream parties are now lashing out at the latest results of democracy, some even taking it upon themselves to scold the citizens. An angry Sigmar Gabriel of the SPD party said Monday, for example, “There is, damn it, a responsibility by the citizens for this democracy.” In other words, Gabriel’s view of democracy is one that does not offer any options. Vote for what we say, or shut the hell up.
Mr. Gabriel is the German Minister who recently warned that Americans should not be voting for Donald Trump!
Is it any wonder these old crusty politicians are losing relevance faster than immigrants are coming in? It’s not the citizens who need to take their responsibilities seriously – rather it’s the political leaders themselves.

Already at the end of May 2015 and at the end of March 2016 only a little solar activity was observed. Low solar activity leads to a global and regional cooling. That was known already in the 18th century, as some people got rich in the wheat business.
The current solar cycle (SC) 24 is the weakest in over 100 years.
And since using the new counting method July 1, 2015 (sunspot relative number) SC 24 may be the weakest in almost 200 years: Solar activity since 1700 – meteo.plus:
The following diagram shows the relative numbers for the time period 1820 until the present (source: SIDC), which are calculated using the sunspot numbers. The light green color depicts the daily value. The dark color shows the monthly and yearly average. For the long-term trend, a red line with the 5.5-year (i.e. half a cycle) average has been added, as well as a blue line showing the 30-year average.

Solar cycle 24 has been weak in comparison to the cycles of the past 200 years. The highest daily value so far for the current cycle has been only 135 sunspots. No cycle has been this weak since SC 7 (starting in the year 1823). The monthly average values are currently very low. Source: Solar Activity since 1700 – meteo.plus.
Notice:
On July 1, 2015, the relative numbers were replaced by a homogenized version. The new relative numbers are now immediately available. Comparison between the old and the new version shows the differences. More info at SIDC/SILSO.”
The mean international sunspot relative number (SN Ri) of the last 13 years starting in June 2003 up through May 2016 is SN 39 – considerably below the critical value of SN 50. http://sidc.oma.be/silso/datafiles.
This may have implications as some experts believe the threshold is met for cooling. The Berliner Wetterkarte here writes:
Mean sunspot numbers for each cycle of more than (approx.) 50 over a longer time period are associated with above-normal temperatures. If the mean sunspot number for each cycle is below 50, then below normal temperatures result, i.e. a cold period!…”
The time lag for a weak sun’s impact on climate, depending on the thermal inertia of the oceans – and depending on the study – is between 8 and 20 years: Time lag earth’s climate vs. sun = 14 + – 6 years.

From June 1997 to January 2016 global temperatures made a pause. Using the unfalsified satellite temperatures from RSS:

“Figure 1. The least-squares linear-regression trend on the RSS satellite monthly global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset shows no global warming for 18 years 8 months since May 1997, though one-third of all anthropogenic forcings have occurred during the period of the Pause.“ Source: The Pause hangs on by its fingernails
The powerful El Niño event of late 2015 has temporarily ended the warming pause:

RSS lower troposphere temperature data since 1978 shows statistically insignificant temperature rise since 1998. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/trend
Using UAH satellite data, since March the temperature has been falling as the warming effects of the recent El Niño fade:

Source: UAH Global Temperature Update for May, 2016: +0.55 deg. C
NCEP data also show that cooling continues in June 2016, as the following chart depicts:

Source: weatherbell.com/temperature.php
Since the El Niño has faded, the oncoming projected cooling La Niña is expected to arrive over the coming months: El Niño is dead, La Niña lives! – ENSO update May 2016.
Thus it may be only a question of months before the global warming pause resumes and the Earth cools with the weak sun.
Moreover the Svensmark Mechanism between weak solar activity and thus stronger cosmic rays can result in up to 100 times more powerful cloud formation in the troposphere. This has recently been confirmed by the research results at CERN.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. med Johannes Mayer made a presentation on the serious hazards of infrasound (1 – 20 Hz) from wind turbines saying: “It is unbelievable the flood of international scientific publications that has appeared over the last one and half years.”

In the presentation Mayer cites “120 scientific papers” confirming the hazardous impacts of infrasound on human health.
Bogus claims infrasound is safe
Mayer blasts the lobby-backed claims (based on measurements taken by unsuitable instruments) that infrasound generated by wind turbines is harmless to humans and wildlife and presents a number of studies showing how the very opposite is true.
At 7:35 Mayer tells the audience that 5 years ago he also used to believe that infrasound was not a real factor for anyone a kilometer or further away from the source. But after having researched the new literature on the topic he concluded that infrasound is a serious factor on the health of humans even at far greater distances.
At the 8:20 mark Mayer explains how infrasound acts on the human inner ear and interacts with the brain, and the serious effects it can have on the human organs, citing a study from medical journal Lancet. “It’s confirmed by numerous scientific papers,” Mayer tells the audience. At 9:15 Mayer presents:
The short term effects on infrasound
– pressure in the ears
– anxiety feelings
– dizziness
– exhaustion
– tiredness in the morning
– respiration disturbance
Also experiments have been done on animals, and results show profound impacts on their physiology and health, ranging from changes in hormone levels and immunological parameters to damage to lung tissue, Mayer shows. At 10:08 he presents:
The long term impacts of infrasound
– chronic respiratory disorders
– chronic stress and sleep disorders from higher stress hormone levels
– emotional disorder, depression, burnout
– high blood pressure, heart disease

And the symptoms of infrasound illness:
– depression
– irritability
– tension
– headache
– mental and physical exhaustion
– concentration and sleep disorders
– noise sensitization
All of this is caused the constant low pressure waves acting on the inner ear and fooling the body into thinking it is in motion when in fact it is not. Infrasound interferes with the body’s natural biorhythms. Mayer concludes this results in infrasound from wind turbines being “a problem to be taken very seriously”.
Especially dangerous for pregnant women
At the 15:50 mark Mayer reminds the audience that even European officials issued directives regulating infrasound and pregnant women, writing that “they should not perform activities that could generate strong low frequency vibrations because they could increase the risk of a miscarriage or premature birth.”
Mayer emphasizes that the effects of infrasound are not something imagined in people’s heads, but are in fact very real. It is even diagnosed as an illness by doctors.
“Turbines should not even be in sight”
Mayer blasts wind-turbine German government agencies for their refusal to acknowledge the very real health facts and for blindly following everything the wind lobby tells them. He cites medical expert Dr. Reinhard Bartsch of the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena (20:35):
From today’s level of knowledge wind turbines should be placed only far away from residential areas, and better: they should not even be in sight.”
At the 21-minute mark Mayer presents major publications on infrasound. Studies by Thorne and Salt show that up to 40% of people are sensitive to infrasound and that the health of these people who live near wind parks is “considerably and seriously affected (injured) by this noise“.
Finally, a Canadian review of 62 scientific publications appearing in the Canadian Journal of Rural Medicine concluded that industrial wind turbines have “negative health impacts” on people who live in their vicinity.
Mayer praises regulations on distances from homes in Canada and New Zealand, which restrict the construction of wind turbines to 4 and 3 km away respectively.

Schneefan at German climate science site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de writes here that the NOAA’s ENSO model CFSv2 saw considerable deficiency with its recent forecasting, which not long ago foresaw ongoing global warming El Niño conditions for 2016.
What follows is the BOM Climate Model Summary from 16 March 2016 with the NOAA/CFSv2 prognosis:


The mean is depicted by the lowest bar. In mid March many ENSO models were already predicting La Niña conditions by August 2016. The NOAA/CFSv2 is a clear outlier. Source: www.bom.gov.au/climatePacific-Ocean
The NOAA/CFSv2 modelers have in the meantime admitted to a cold bias in their programming, foremost at the equatorial in the Atlantic, which led to a false computation of the equatorial Pacific (ENSO) computation, as Dr. Roy Spencer of the UAH reported: Impact of CFSv2 Model Fix on 2016 La Nina Forecast.

The false, overly warm NOAA result is shown in the “Before fix” image below (left). The corrected version is depicted by the “After fix” image (right). Note the huge difference we see in the equatorial Pacific region. The chart below shows the anomaly from the mean:


Screenshot: The charts by Dr. Ryan Maue show the projected SSTA by the NOAA/CFSv2 for September 2016 generated on 29 March 2016 before the error was corrected (left) and after the correction (right). Suddenly a La Niña appears in the forecast. Source: Impact of CFSv2 Model Fix on 2016 La Nina Forecast. 
The Australian BOM Weather Services consequently removed the “warm” NOAA/CFSv2-ENSO forecast from its “ClimateModelSummary” (see chart above) and thus the mean forecast of the remaining ENSO models for August 2016 stands at -0.7°K, thus putting it clearly in La Niña territory:
BOM Climate Model Summary 29 March 2016 – without NOAA/CFSv2 forecast:

The mean of all models (bottom bar) – without the NOAA/CFSv2. The forecast is  -0.7 °K deviation in August 2016.  Source: www.bom.gov.au/climate/Pacific-Ocean.
The current CFSv2-ENSO prognosis is now approaching the mean of the other ENSO model forecasts (blue lines). Some models are showing very powerful La Niña conditions close to -3° K hitting later this year. Only the old, too-warm calculations (shown by the bold black dashed line) is falsely in the positive range:

The plot above shows the partially corrected ENSO forecast of 1 April 2016 for the SSTA in the ENSO 3.4 area for the coming months. The current (corrected cold) forecasts (blue lines) are, for some, showing La Niña values of -0.5°K and colder already arriving in June. In autumn 2016 many models are forecasting -2.0°K and colder! Preliminary indications are showing a powerfully cold La Niña is in the pipeline. Every new ENSO forecast is becoming suspenseful. Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov.html.
Schneefan writes that the global satellite data for the lower troposphere (TLT) from UAH are as expected headed down wards after having reached its peak of 0.83°K in February (March: 0.73°K), see: UAH V6 Global Temperature Update for March, 2016: +0.73 deg. C.
The GFS forecast for April 2016 also sees a considerable drop with the global 2m temperatures:

The above plot shows the measured and calculated anomalies from the global mean temperature using the usual modern WMO 1981-2010 climate mean. The computed trend for early April (black line) is steeply downward, even though it is computed using the NASA/GISS “adjusted” (falsified) factor. Source: www.karstenhaustein.com.php.
Schneefan comments that the current unusual weak solar activity and the currently oncoming cold ENSO development will make it clear that the recent claims of a warming planet were more hype than anything else, and that the real trend is cooling over the coming years.
It’s still early to be predicting a La Niña of -3.0°K. Expect that figure to be corrected upwards. One thing is clear: La Niña arriving this fall is becoming an almost sure bet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA press release by Germany’s Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reports how offshore North and Baltic Sea wind turbines need to be in operation for 25 years before they become profitable, but that they are prone to shortened lifespans due to rust from the harsh sea environment.
As a result the wind turbine installations need extra and very costly maintenance to ensure that they survive long enough. It’s turning out to be an insurmountable challenge.
Maintenance to turbines cannot be done at a dry dock, rather, because they are permanently fixed out to sea, repair work and maintenance have to be done offshore in raw and windy conditions. Not only is this expensive, but it also puts the lives and limbs of repair personnel at risk.
This is the reason engineers and researchers are trying to find ways to better protect offshore wind power systems from the brutal elements. Protection of vulnerable metal surfaces is planned to be achieved by developing and applying new surface films, but this is still very much in development.
100 times the cost of a new turbine
The figure that is especially astonishing about offshore wind power turbines is that the “maintenance and repair costs of offshore wind turbines over the years add up to be a hundred times the cost of the new turbine itself,” says Peter Plagemann of the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology and Applied Material Science (IFAM) in Bremen.
Plagemann adds (my emphasis):
While a metal coating during the construction of a turbine on land can cost up to 20 to 30 euros per square meter, it can be several thousand euros for offshore turbines.”
This is yet just another huge and costly technical obstacle faced by offshore windparks. It’s going to be an expensive mess come clean-up time.

"Environmental protesters blocked the path of Boris Johnson’s car on Wednesday as he made his way to Buckingham Palace to officially become Britain’s new prime minister. The protesters said they were aiming to highlight the need to tackle the climate emergency. The Greenpeace activists joined hands across the Mall as Johnson was making his way to meet the Queen. The protest, in which the activists had planned to hand a letter to Johnson that detailed how to end the climate crisis, was quickly broken up by police. The former Green party leader Natalie Bennett said on Twitter that the event was “a reminder for Boris Johnson, in case the air-conditioning was making him forget”. She added that the climate emergency “should be at the top of his in-tray”. The protest came just before the Queen asked Johnson to form a government, after Theresa May’s resignation as prime minister and his victory in the Conservative leadership contest on Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered in Russell Square in London to protest against Johnson’s ascension and the government. The demo, dubbed “fck govt fck boris” after a lyric from Stormzy’s Vossi Bop and billed as a street festival, featured a bus with the words emblazoned on it as a nod to Johnson’s “£350m for the NHS” promise on the side of the Vote Leave campaign bus. The Labour leftwing grassroots movement Momentum, the Women’s Strike Assembly and Guardian columnist Owen Jones were among the event’s organisers. After a DJ set and performances from musicians, the demonstrators began marching through central London towards Trafalgar Square. Later, a group of protesters, more than 10,000 according to organisers’ estimates, marched south to the gates of Downing Street, many of them chanting: “Boris Johnson, fuck off back to Eton.” A very profane protest against Boris Johnson pic.twitter.com/LfqIajFUkZ Downing Street was put into lockdown as the gates were blockaded by about 100 officers and a dozen riot vans, and no one was allowed in and out of that entrance. Meanwhile, the anti-Johnson campaigners set off purple and pink flares as they danced to booming music. Just before 8pm, MP Grant Shapps turned up at the Downing Street gates, where he was promptly turned away by an armed officer on duty. On the other side of the gates, and away from the demonstration, a string of tight-lipped Tory MPs made their way out of No 10 as further appointments were announced. They each walked straight from No 10 to a private exit which took them towards the Foreign Office buildings or a back exit. Shapps eventually used a different route to No 10, where he learned that he had been made transport secretary. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, earlier gave a speech in Russell Square in which he described Johnson as a “racist” and “a liar”. He also warned onlookers not to “fall for his buffoonery”. Lois Ward-Marvin, 23, a tattoo artist, was among the demonstrators. She said: “I don’t want Boris Johnson to be prime minister – the people that did vote for him were all white men. He’s racist, sexist, homophobic, and I don’t think he really wants to bring change for good.” However, Ward-Marvin added that she did not know who in politics would be a better fit for the post. “I’m Jewish, so the antisemitism row has pushed me away from Labour,” she said. Also in the crowd was lecturer Kevin Logan, 54. He said he was protesting against Johnson’s “incompetence”. He added: “He’s going to be awful and I’m really scared of what’s going to happen with Brexit with him in power.” Speaking close to Downing Street, Jay Crosbie said he was at the protest because he believed Johnson’s time in government would be “detrimental” to the country. “I’m here as a queer person – we know we’re the people he doesn’t care about,” he said. Instead of a banner, Crosbie carried a rainbow fan with the words “bum boys” written between the folds as a nod to an infamous comment by Johnson. Crosbie was not only worried that things such as the controversial Gender Recognition Act “won’t be on the table” under Johnson’s premiership, but also that he would not be able to resolve the current Brexit chaos. “The enormity of this just seems lost on Boris Johnson – it’s like a pantomime, like Punch and Judy,” he added.  Despite the anger at the new prime minister, the demonstration appeared overall to be peaceful and there were no arrests. A second protest is planned for 20 September. Earlier in the day, campaigners from People’s Vote UK held banners outside Parliament Square and Buckingham Palace to urge the government to give the public a vote on the final Brexit deal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service here has published the result of March 2016 weather in Germany – having crunched the data from some 2000 stations scattered across the country.
Although DWD insists March was “mild”, a closer look at the data reveals that it was in fact 0.3°C cooler than the 1981-2010 mean.
How did the DWD conclude that the month was warm? It used the mean of the obsolete 1961 – 1990 period, a time when the globe was gripped in a cool spell and the media was warning of “global cooling”. Compared to that period, March 2016 in Germany was 0.5°C warmer. Why the DWD still uses the 1961 – 1990 reference period while the rest of the world (e.g. NOAA, WMO, etc.) uses the 1981 – 2010 period remains a mystery.
Perhaps it has a little to do with activist science. Schneefan at wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de called the DWD press release an April Fool’s trick, writing:
By using the old climate mean, a warming gets faked – as we see once again in March 2016 in Germany – a realistic look compared to the mean of the last three decades […]  shows that the trend has even switched to some cooling, …”

Indeed on April 1st Central Germany even woke up to a real weather April Fools trick – a blanket of snow on the ground: “Central Germany gets April Fooled with heavy snowfall“.
A plot of March temperatures over the past 30 years shows that 2016 was in fact among the colder ones and that the country has not seen any March warming over the past 30 years.

Source: DWD
Interestingly, the chart above shows that 8 years saw March outside of the shaded normal range: 4 were too warm and 4 were too cold. Clearly the cold ones were more extreme than the warm ones. Where’s the warming?
Finally, don’t be surprised if the March 2016 figure gets revised downward in a few weeks time. Over the past months the DWD has developed a habit of putting out “warmed” press releases on preliminary monthly results, only to quietly revise them downwards later on.

"Australian insurance giant Suncorp will no longer invest in, finance or insure new thermal coal mines and power plants, and will not underwrite any existing thermal coal projects after 2025. This is the latest in a series of pledges by banks and financial services companies that they will not support projects that mine or burn coal used for electricity generation, in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  Activists said Suncorp’s announcement meant there were now no Australian insurers willing to underwrite new thermal coal developments. Suncorp, which owns insurance brands AAMI and GIO, made headlines in February when it announced its half-year profit had slumped 45%, mainly because of extreme weather events in Sydney and Queensland. Its then chief executive, Michael Cameron, called on the government to make it compulsory for Australian businesses to adopt climate change action plans to prepare for natural disasters. In a statement on Friday, the $17bn company said climate change posed a financial and strategic risk but was also an opportunity. It said it had applied a shadow carbon price, assuming greenhouse gas emissions have a cost, to its investment decisions since 2017 and had recently expanded that across all its operations. “The practical outcome of this is that we have materially reduced our investment in fossil fuels, including thermal coal,” an official said. “We will seek to increase exposure to businesses that have a positive environmental impact, including renewable energy generation and technology.” Suncorp’s competitor QBE said in March it would no longer insure new thermal coal projects and would stop underwriting existing operations from 2030. Market Forces, an activist group affiliated with Friends of the Earth, lodged a shareholder resolution this week asking Suncorp to set targets for phasing out all fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. Campaigner Pablo Brait said the company’s announcement was significant. “Any company wanting to run a coal-burning power station past 2030 will now be unable to get an Australian insurer to back it. [Energy companies] AGL and Origin might want to take note,” he said. Brait called on Suncorp to go further. “Without action on oil and gas there is a risk that Suncorp ends up trading one massive climate risk for another over time,” he said. Suncorp said in February its experience with extreme events had prompted it to increase its annual allowance for natural hazards by $100m and to buy another $200m of reinsurance cover. Market Forces said claims to Suncorp for flood, fire and cyclone damage had been $1.7bn more than the group had budgeted for over the past decade."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe website of the German Employers Association (DAV) has posted a comprehensive interview by Holger Douglas with physicist and climate scientist Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, concerning the role of CO2 on the world’s climate.
Photo: Professor Horst-Joachim Lüdecke

Lüdecke, who has authored numerous climate science publications in climate science journals, is sure that the role of CO2 on climate is grossly overstated and riddled with alarmist hype.
Polar bear population “growing”
On polar bears, Lüdecke says there is “no trace” of the animal disappearing due to climate change and that the polar bear population has in fact been climbing. Moreover, the polar bear has been around for “hundreds of thousands of years“.
Climate sensitivity much weaker than assumed
On the subject of the greenhouse effect and radiation outwards into space, Lüdecke reminds that the climate system involves countless, poorly understood complexities, such as cloud cover and water vapor. In the interview he tells:
Water vapor is a very powerful greenhouse gas, and acts to enhance the warming effect. We call this feedback, as the warming is magnified more by it then it is alone by the radiation effect. But the other assumption claims: The opposite is correct! More water vapor in the air leads to more clouds that cool.”
On which effect is true, Lüdecke tells the DAV:
The theory of a feedback is not confirmed by measurements. According to the theory, the altitudes over the tropics at about 5 to 7 kilometers are supposed to be showing a clearly measurable heating zone that is referred to as the ‘Hot Spot’. No one has found it. Everything points to the pure radiation effect being weaker and not enhanced.”
No human fingerprint
The retired, independent physicist then tells the DAV that “man’s influence on the climate still cannot be filtered from the climate noise even today” and that today’s climate and weather changes are no different than what was observed hundreds of years ago, citing the IPCC itself:
There is not a single bit of scientific justification to claim: Here we are seeing unusual climate developments that can be only attributed to humans.”
Lüdecke suspects that the cyclic nature of climate natural climate change is caused mainly by the sun’s activity, naming the De Vries/Suess 200-year cycle and the 1500-year Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle as examples.

He also confirms the recent “18-20 year” global warming pause and reminds us that in geological terms, the Earth today in fact finds itself in a ice age period, which is typically defined as one that sees the poles frozen over – as is the case today.
On proxies the retired climate scientist says that care has to be exercised in interpreting the data they yield. The DAQV asks whether there is a relationship between temperature and CO2 concentration. Lüdecke replies:
No, there’s nothing to see there.”
CO2 concentration in fact historically low
Lüdecke also points out that today’s atmospheric CO2 levels are in fact close to historical lows, and that elevated concentration bring a number of advantages to the ecosystems, foremost a greener planet with better plant growth.
Also, man’s CO2 emissions pale against those from the oceans and natural environment.
Ocean acidification “an alarmist myth”
On whether the threat of ocean acidification exists, Lüdecke dumps cold water on that claim:
No, ocean acidification is another myth of the alarmists. Every chemists you talk to on ocean acidification being a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 will roll his eyes. […]
Also the supposed sensitivity of corals to CO2 in sea water is an alarmist myth.”
“Dangerous, undemocratic ideology”
At the very end of the interview, Lüdecke comments on climate protection as a movement:
Here I allow myself to state very clearly: Climate protection has nothing to do with protecting nature. Climate protection is a dangerous, undemocratic ideology.”
In the next post, we will look at what Prof. Lüdecke says in the rest of the interview concerning climate models and the energy trend in Europe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTV station WPTZ here reports that developers planned to build seven 500-foot-tall wind turbines near the town of Swanton, Vermont, near Lake Champlain. However the industrial colossuses are no longer welcome in a state that proudly views itself as green.
Hat-tip: Indomitable Snowman, Ph.D
Vermonters are finding out quickly that wind parks are massively industrial, not environmentally friendly, pose a serious threat to human health and birdlife, and that they are eyesores that ruin the state’s idyllic landscape. Wind parks installed in Lowell and Sheffield have clearly demonstrated that such projects are in fact far more environmental vandalism than they are “protection”.
The latest proposed Swanton wind park went up for a straight up or down vote among the local residents. The Result? “Residents voted 744-142 to support legislation giving towns the ability to oppose future projects.” That’s 83% to just 17%!
Residents be damned
So is this going to impress state officials, led by Governor Peter Shumlin? WPTZ reports:
State officials warned that the results of the two proposals are not binding. […] Townspeople currently don’t have a say in area wind development. […] Even with voting results, the state can still move forward with the development plan.”
In other words: Votes (democracy) are apparently no longer binding in Governor Peter Shumlin’s the kingdom of Vermont. Has he lost it?
Moreover, developers cried that the wording made it difficult to get a fair vote because it focused on the negatives of wind energy and not the positives. However many residents argue that there aren’t really any positive points and that the “clean energy” claim is only a feel-good argument. Wind energy is unpredictable, wildly fluctuating, severely stresses the power grid, and it is NOT cheap.

One resident in Vermont informed me by e-mail that the vote will not impress the state and that it will take a voters-be damned-view and simply steamroll the project through.
Irasburg residents reject wind park 274 – 9!
Meanwhile the VermontWatchdog here reports that the residents of Irasburg, located in rural, scenic northern Vermont, just stone throw away from the now infamous Lowell windpark, also recently voted on a proposed wind park, rejecting it by a vote of 274 to 9 (97% to 3%)! That vote result was so lopsided that the 9 votes probably came exclusively from the landowner and a few of his buddies.
The VermontWatchdog called the result “a stinging rebuke“.
The spirit of Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys is alive again in Vermont it seems. Vermonters must keep up the fight. The VermontWatchdog quotes citizen Paul Drayman:
There are big companies that are right now buying up some very large plots of land, and they’re targeting areas like this. … If we do not stop this, in 20 years you will not recognize this area. It will look very different.”
The “ruralness” that characterizes Vermont will be lost at least for a generation.
Here in Germany we have seen huge debacles in the country’s mad rush to wind energy. Any Vermont resident is welcome to contact me for more information on the failed German model. You can start by looking at all the posts I’ve written under Alternative Energy at the side bar.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest hardcopy issue of flagship news magazine Der Spiegel reports how Germany’s green energy revolution has bitterly divided the country’s environmental movement.
Enoch zu Guttenberg, one of Germany’s most prolific environmentalists has become an outspoken critic of wind energy in Germany, and believes children in the future will be able to see Germany’s idyllic landscape only in paintings as developers clear hill-top forests to make way for skyscraper-size industrial wind turbines.
Guttenberg, a symphony conductor, told Spiegel the movement against wind turbines has exploded over the past months and years and that his speeches against wind turbines are attracting ever larger crowds: “When I started 60 or 70 would come, now there are more than 1000.”
Moreover Guttenberg talks of “hundreds of local citizens’ initiatives” that are now mobilizing against wind projects. Spiegel writes of a whole “new quality” of resistance that governments now need to confront as many traditional environmentalists now rail against what they view as a “corruption of green party members, environmental groups, local politicians and city councils“.
So divided the environmentalists have become that Germany’s powerful BUND (Friends of the Erath Germany) launched a slander lawsuit against Guttenberg after he accused the organization of having “merged” with the Wind Lobby. BUND later dropped the suit. Since then Guttenberg has compared the BUND directors to Judas and accused them of having sold out the environmental philosophy for a “dish of lentil”. Leading environmental activists today are now saying: “The color of sleaze is no longer black, rather it is green.”
The environmental movement has become so disunified, Spiegel writes, that once diehard nuclear energy opponents have now switched to protesting wind turbines, as many planning boards ignore concerns of the citizens and attempt to steamroll projects through against the public will.
Often the projects are politically explosive, involving a good old boys network. A typical pattern, Spiegel writes:

Town mayor, local pols, city directors, who at the same time happen to be the managing directors of wind parks and who profit from them. A dubious mesh of community and electricity interests.”
This is how it works at many communities, Spiegel describes. Often the nearby residents and citizens pay heftily through lost property values, health issues from infrasound, and high electricity prices. Invariably only very few benefit at all.
Planners often shoot back and claim nothing is illegal about the business deals. But the public is not having it. Spiegel adds:
Indeed in the meantime resistance is growing. ‘The mood has flipped because people are noticing that it is all about business,’ says anti-wind activist [Manfred] Knake”
At the end of the article Guttenberg, Spiegel writes, calls it the “capitialistic injustice of the Energiewende“.
The money of the little guy, who has to pay billions for renewables,  is diverted into the pockets of some large property owners.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterBook review: “The Fable of a Stable Climate”
By Dr. Hans Labohm
(Edited/condensed by P. Gosselin)
Gerrit van der Lingen has recently published a fascinating book, “The Fable of a Stable Climate, the writings and debates of a climate realist”.
Most of the public information about the climate comes from scientists who studied the weather and weather processes and who consider temperature data of 150 years already a long period. For geologist and paleoclimatologist van der Lingen this is only a heartbeat in the geological history, which forms the only correct context for judging the present climate developments.
Ideology vs pure science
While studying climate change in the past van der Lingen realised that the present belief in man-made catastrophic global warming caused by CO2 emissions is not supported by the science and that it seems the debate is one between ideology and pure science.
The first chapter of his book an overview giving a clear overview of the climate debate, with all its high and low points. It draws attention to important participants, protagonists as well as antagonists. What really surprises Gerrit van der Lingen is how it is possible that intelligent people have been taken in by the AGW hypothesis and seem to have lost all sense of reality as a consequence.
British science delegation misbehaviour
One salient detail in the book pertains to the Russian position in relation to the Kyoto Protocol. The Russians had a few questions on which they never received an answer. In 2004, they decided to organise a climate conference in Moscow, independently of the UN IPCC climate panel, and with the co-operation of a number of climate sceptics. At the end of this conference, Andrei Illarionov, then economic advisor of president Putin, presented his impressions.
Yuri Antonovich and I have mentioned the fact that this is the first seminar of its kind that we have managed to arrange and it was accidental. Over almost a year we have repeatedly asked our foreign partners who advocate the Kyoto Protocol and who insist that Russia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and we have invited them to meet and discuss these issues, present arguments and counter-arguments and discuss them jointly. But we have not received any reply for a year. These people persistently refused to take part in any discussion.
Nine months ago, at an international climate change conference in Moscow, ten questions concerning the essence of the Kyoto Protocol and its underlying theory were submitted to the IPCC. We were told that the reply would be given within several days. Nine months have passed since then but there has been no reply, even though we have repeated our inquiries on these and the growing number of other related questions.
Instead of getting replies to our questions, we kept on hearing that replies did not matter. What was important is that whether or not Russia trusts Britain, the European Union and the countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and that have been exerting unprecedented pressure on Russia to ratify it. This is why it was so important for us to arrange a real meeting and a real discussion of real problems with the participation of foreign scientists who have different views in order not to stew in one’s own juice, as Yuri Antonovich put it, but to hear the arguments not only of our Russian scientists but also the arguments and counter-arguments from scientists in other countries.
We did get such an opportunity and over the past two days we heard more than 20 reports, we held detailed discussions, and now we can say that a considerable number of the questions we formulated and raised have been somewhat clarified, just as some other questions have.”
Andrei Allarionov continued describing in detail the misbehaviour of the British delegation under the leadership of Sir David King, then the most important advisor of the British government, who did his utmost to sabotage the meeting, among others by requiring that climate sceptics not be allowed to present their presentations, and by stalking out of the meeting.

Ideology, not science
Illarionov compared the AGW with an ideology:
The next point brings us directly to the Kyoto Protocol, or more specifically, to the ideological and philosophical basis on which it is built. That ideological base can be juxtaposed and compared … with man-hating totalitarian ideology with which we had the bad fortune to deal during the 20th century, such as National Socialism, Marxism, Eugenics, Lysenkoism and so on. All methods of distorting information existing in the world have been committed to prove the alleged validity of these theories. Misinformation, falsification, fabrication, mythology, propaganda. Because what is offered cannot be qualified in any other way than myth, nonsense and absurdity.”
The Moscow climate conference leaves no doubt that the Russian Academy of Sciences cannot be considered as supporters of the AGW dogma – a thesis that is part of the standard repertoire of the disinformation by climate alarmists.
“Rubbish in – gospel out”
The book also looks at all important themes of the climate debate are discussed in short, clear analyses, and all allegations of the climate alarmists are tested against measurements and observations, and are refuted. In the end all warming hysteria is not based on science, but only on non-validated computer models. As is often said: Rubbish in – gospel out.
At the end of the book, Gerrit van der Lingen sighs:
When future historians will be studying the present global mass hysteria about alleged catastrophic man-made global warming (MMGW), they will most likely shake their heads in total disbelief. They may well compare it with other such historic irrational hysterias, like the tulipomania in Holland in the 17th century. […]
The belief that human emissions of carbon dioxide cause, or will cause catastrophic global warming is a […] totalitarian belief. It does not allow ‘critical discussion’. Those scientists who try are vilified. Over the years I collected the following abuses: ‘climate change deniers’, ‘cashamplified flat-earth pseudo scientists’, ‘the carbon cartel’, ‘villains’, ‘cranks’, ‘refuseniks lobby’, ‘polluters’, ‘a powerful and devious enemy’, ‘profligates’. The list is endless. […]
By saying that the science of climate change is ‘settled’ and not open to further discussion, clearly shows that the belief in man-made global warming is not based on proper science, but is a neo-Marxist, intolerant ideology. It is anti-science, anti-capitalist, anti-democracy, anti-growth, anti-humanity, anti-progress.”
All in all, “The Fable of a Stable Climate” shows a wide and solid knowledge of the subject. Moreover Gerrit van der Lingen has the talent to very clearly explain the complicated problems, which make his writings very accessible for a broad public. In other words: his book reads like a riveting novel.
The book has 418 pages and many illustrations and graphs, as well as extensive reference lists, and is available in both paperback and Kindle, can be ordered at www.book2look.com.

"The scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming is likely to have passed 99%, according to the lead author of the most authoritative study on the subject, and could rise further after separate research that clears up some of the remaining doubts. Three studies published in Nature and Nature Geoscience use extensive historical data to show there has never been a period in the last 2,000 years when temperature changes have been as fast and extensive as in recent decades.  It had previously been thought that similarly dramatic peaks and troughs might have occurred in the past, including in periods dubbed the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Climate Anomaly. But the three studies use reconstructions based on 700 proxy records of temperature change, such as trees, ice and sediment, from all continents that indicate none of these shifts took place in more than half the globe at any one time. The Little Ice Age, for example, reached its extreme point in the 15th century in the Pacific Ocean, the 17th century in Europe and the 19th century elsewhere, says one of the studies. This localisation is markedly different from the trend since the late 20th century when records are being broken year after year over almost the entire globe, including this summer’s European heatwave. Major temperature shifts in the distant past are also likely to have been primarily caused by volcanic eruptions, according to another of the studies, which helps to explain the strong global fluctuations in the first half of the 18th century as the world started to move from a volcanically cooled era to a climate warmed by human emissions. This has become particularly pronounced since the late 20th century, when temperature rises over two decades or longer have been the most rapid in the past two millennia, notes the third. The authors say this highlights how unusual warming has become in recent years as a result of industrial emissions. “There is no doubt left – as has been shown extensively in many other studies addressing many different aspects of the climate system using different methods and data sets,” said Stefan Brönnimann, from the University of Bern and the Pages 2K consortium of climate scientists. Commenting on the study, other scientists said it was an important breakthrough in the “fingerprinting” task of proving how human responsibility has changed the climate in ways not seen in the past. “This paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle. This paper shows the truly stark difference between regional and localised changes in climate of the past and the truly global effect of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions,” said Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London. Previous studies have shown near unanimity among climate scientists that human factors – car exhausts, factory chimneys, forest clearance and other sources of greenhouse gases – are responsible for the exceptional level of global warming. A 2013 study in Environmental Research Letters found 97% of climate scientists agreed with this link in 12,000 academic papers that contained the words “global warming” or “global climate change” from 1991 to 2011. Last week, that paper hit 1m downloads, making it the most accessed paper ever among the 80+ journals published by the Institute of Physics, according to the authors. The pushback has been political rather than scientific. In the US, the rightwing thinktank the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is reportedly putting pressure on Nasa to remove a reference to the 97% study from its webpage. The CEI has received event funding from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and Charles Koch Institute, which have much to lose from a transition to a low-carbon economy. But among academics who study the climate, the convergence of opinion is probably strengthening, according to John Cook, the lead author of the original consensus paper and a follow-up study on the “consensus about consensus” that looked at a range of similar estimates by other academics. He said that at the end of his 20-year study period there was more agreement than at the beginning: “There was 99% scientific consensus in 2011 that humans are causing global warming.” With ever stronger research since then and increasing heatwaves and extreme weather, Cook believes this is likely to have risen further and is now working on an update. “As expertise in climate science increases, so too does agreement with human-caused global warming,” Cook wrote on the Skeptical Science blog. “The good news is public understanding of the scientific consensus is increasing. The bad news is there is still a lot of work to do yet as climate deniers continue to persistently attack the scientific consensus.” • This article was amended on 26 July 2019. An earlier version abbreviated the name of the Competitive Enterprise Institute as CPI, rather than CEI."
"As Europe suffers another summer of record-breaking heatwaves, it is worth reflecting on the group perhaps least happy to benefit from the soaring temperatures – Green parties across the continent, which are, however, in a better electoral position than ever. In May’s European parliament elections, the Greens won 22 more seats and 4.4% more of the vote than in 2014. Domestically, the German Greens participate in a majority of state governments and top national polling; the president of Austria is a Green-Independent and Greens have secured record vote shares in recent elections in Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands. They are also poised to pick up votes in forthcoming Swiss and Austrian elections. Although setbacks in Denmark and Sweden highlight the importance of national context, Greens have been gaining footholds outside their historical strongholds and are surging in polls in Ireland and the UK. The most obvious explanation is found in shifting attitudes to the environment and the climate crisis. Although Europeans lost some belief in the threat during the 2000s, by 2016 large majorities across the continent agreed that global heating was happening, that it was at least partially caused by humans and that its impact would be negative. It is this “salience” that activates emotions and changes voting behaviour. In 2016, only 6% of EU citizens listed the environment as one of the two most important issues affecting their country. Just two years later, this figure had risen to 14% and is still climbing. In the latest Eurobarometer – a survey which monitors public opinion in every member state – 22% of Germans, 41% of Dutch and 39% of Swedes ranked “the environment, climate and energy” as one of their country’s top two most important issues. By contrast, southern and eastern Europeans remain fairly uninterested – just 1% of Greeks picked the issue in 2018, the same as in 2005. The UK ranks somewhere in the middle, at 11%, though this summer has seen a sharp increase. Why is the salience of the environment soaring? Historically, some academics have played down the effects of “real-world” events or citizens’ abilities to deduce which issues matter, instead emphasising strategic manipulation of the agenda by the media and politicians. While these certainly count, the salience of the environment, like that of most other issues, ultimately does reflect real events. Evidence of soaring temperatures is becoming the lived reality of citizens, making scientific findings on the resultant collapse of ecosystems increasingly difficult to ignore. However, there is more to the current Green success than greater environmental concern. The geographical disparities can still be partially explained by the long-term emergence of “post-material values” in affluent western European societies in the 1970s. These saw individuals move beyond materialist, redistributive concerns to quality-of-life matters, including care for the environment. Moreover, the breakdown of postwar western European party systems and the accompanying decline in class voting mean that we are increasingly inclined to vote according to psychological predispositions and less because of social group. Without these social anchors in place, mainstream parties have become more vulnerable to “anti-incumbency” voting and single-issue voting, primarily to new parties. Centre-right parties have had to deal with challenger, anti-immigration parties, while the centre-left has suffered at the hands of, first, anti-austerity parties and, increasingly, environmentalist parties. Although vote switching and electoral volatility have increased in Europe in recent decades, this is almost entirely within ideological blocs. Voters with broadly leftwing or rightwing predispositions now have multiple choices – with similar ideologies but differing priorities – at the ballot box. All of these challenger parties, including the Greens, have displayed a remarkably more professional appearance to voters, mirrored by far more effective internal machinery, all of which has been aided by the arrival of the internet and social media. It is no coincidence that the Green party of England and Wales (GPEW) could maintain its membership and a role in the party system after its 2015 “green surge” receded, whereas it quickly faded into irrelevance after its far larger 1989 European election vote share. The case of the GPEW also highlights both how Green parties can take on different shapes according to national contexts, but also how long-term trends tend to see international party families converge ideologically in certain political conditions. Before 2016, the GPEW was a leftwing, anti-austerity protest party whose surge in many ways foreshadowed the rise of the old left of Jeremy Corbyn. But events since then have shaped it into a far more “European”, post-material Green party, swapping the previous flagship of anti-austerity for environmentalism and pro-Europeanism. This mirrors the previous convergence of far-right parties around their single policy flagship of opposition to immigration during the so-called refugee crisis, cleverly playing down any previous extremism or social authoritarianism. What does all of this mean for parliamentary politics? In particular, how should the major losers of the Greens’ ascent – social democrats – respond? Leftwing parties have been tempted to focus on regaining an often sentimentalised vision of the “white working class”, almost always on the issue of immigration. This is a mistake. Across western Europe, most far-right, working-class voters were usually previously centre-right voters and their conservative value orientations mean their chance of voting for the centre-left are tiny. Centre-left parties should focus on those who share their broad values, whether in terms of environmental quality, material opportunities or rights and freedoms. In the 1990s, social democrats were able to achieve electoral success after adopting the Greens’ environmental message en bloc, essentially halting the progress of Greens for two decades. Today, the demand for greater environmental action goes far beyond what centre-left parties are offering.  If western European social democratic parties want to regain offices of state, I’d suggest they offer ambitious proposals on the environment. • James Dennison works at the European University Institute and is the author of The Greens in British Politics: Protest, Anti-Austerity and the Divided Left"
"If there is a glimmer of light amid the darkness of recent reports from the Brazilian Amazon, where deforestation is accelerating along with threats to the indigenous people who live there, it could lie in the growing power of climate diplomacy, combined with increased understanding of the crucial role played by trees in our planet’s climate system. The deal agreed a month ago between the EU and the Mercosur bloc of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay (Venezuela is suspended) enhances European leverage with its South American trading partners. Already, the prize of access to EU markets is credited with having convinced Brazil not to follow Donald Trump’s lead by withdrawing from the Paris climate deal. Now the EU must strengthen its environmental commitments, as a letter from 600 scientists demanded before the deal was agreed. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, made no secret of his plans to promote development, and drew powerful support from Brazil’s agribusiness and mining interests before last year’s election. He scorns conservation and indigenous rights, claiming recently that his foreign opponents want Amazon tribes to live “like cavemen”. Satellite data shows the message is getting through, with clearances up sharply and this month set to be the first in five years in which Brazil has lost an area of forest bigger than Greater London. Illegal gold mining too is spreading. Last week one of the leaders of the Waiãpi people, Emyra Waiãpi, was found stabbed to death on a remote reserve in the state of Amapá, after armed men raided his village.  The situation is of critical importance, and all the more disturbing given recent climate projections. Protecting the world’s largest tropical rainforest, thought to contain 30% of all species, has rightly been an important focus for Brazilian and global environmental policies for two decades. But less than a year after Mr Bolsonaro’s election, the national environment agency appears significantly weakened, with enforcement actions during the first half of 2019 down 20% on the same period in 2018. Prosecutors and activists have been intimidated, while public opinion is mostly engaged elsewhere (for example, on pension reforms). Mr Bolsonaro’s pitch to domestic and foreign audiences is the same: the Brazilian Amazon is none of anyone’s business but Brazil’s. With this in mind, the forest’s international defenders must tread carefully. Denunciations of the new government’s pro-business policies in the name of biodiversity could prove counterproductive. Instead, environmentalists, including Green politicians, should work through European political institutions, in the knowledge that the EU is the second-biggest market for Brazilian exports. Firm pressure must be brought to bear in the form of strong environmental regulations, and a refusal to compromise on transparency. Beef or soya farmed on illegally cleared land must not be imported to Europe. At the same time, Brazilian civil society organisations need support to challenge and resist illegal incursions, and to champion their country’s existing commitments – including to reforestation of cleared areas. Climate education must be promoted globally, so that people can better understand what is going on (the murder of a journalist linked to rainforest exploitation is already the subject of a drama on Brazilian TV). Forest clearances may produce short-term gains, but in the longer term they can only bring disaster. Brazil is in a strong position, at the next round of UN climate talks (moved to Chile after Mr Bolsonaro withdrew an offer to host), to demand increased international aid for the vast Amazon region. If we claim this tropical wilderness as a green lung for the world, we cannot expect Brazil to conserve it alone."

It is widely assumed that sea levels have been rising in recent decades largely in response to anthropogenic global warming. However, due to the inherently large contribution of natural oscillatory influences on sea level fluctuations, this assumption lacks substantiation. Instead, natural factors or internal variability override the detection of an anthropogenic signal and may instead largely explain the patterns in sea level rise in large regions of the global oceans.
Scientists who have recently attempted to detect an anthropogenic signal in regional sea level rise trends have had to admit that there is “no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming,” or that the “sea level rise pattern does not correspond to externally forced anthropogenic sea level signal,” and that sea level “trends are still within the range of long-term internal decadal variability.”
Below are highlighted summaries from 4 peer-reviewed scientific papers published within the last few months.
1. Hansen et al., 2016
For the convenience of the readers, our basic results are shown in Figure 1. We identified five individual oscillations (upper panel), including a sea-level amplitude of 70 mm (top–bottom [t-b]) of the 18.6-year oscillation caused by the lunar nodal oscillation (LNO) … Together with a general sea-level rise of 1.18 mm/y, the sum of these five sea-level oscillations constitutes a reconstructed or theoretical sea-level curve of the eastern North Sea to the central Baltic Sea (Figure 1, lower panel), which correlates very well with the observed sea-level changes of the 160-year period (1849–2009), from which 26 long tide gauge time series are available from the eastern North Sea to the central Baltic Sea.  Such identification of oscillators and general trends over 160 years would be of great importance for distinguishing long-term, natural developments from possible, more recent anthropogenic sea-level changes. However, we found that a possible candidate for such anthropogenic development, i.e. the large sea-level rise after 1970, is completely contained by the found small residuals, long-term oscillators, and general trend. Thus, we found that there is (yet) no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming in the world’s best recorded region.
2. Palanisamy, 2016
Building up on the relationship between thermocline and sea level in the tropical region, we show that most of the observed sea level spatial trend pattern in the tropical Pacific can be explained by the wind driven vertical thermocline movement. By performing detection and attribution study on sea level spatial trend patterns in the tropical Pacific and attempting to eliminate signal corresponding to the main internal climate mode, we further show that the remaining residual sea level trend pattern does not correspond to externally forced anthropogenic sea level signal. In addition, we also suggest that satellite altimetry measurement may not still be accurate enough to detect the anthropogenic signal in the 20-year tropical Pacific sea level trends.
3. Hadi Bordbar et al., 2016
The tropical Pacific has featured some remarkable trends during the recent decades such as an unprecedented strengthening of the Trade Winds, a strong cooling of sea surface temperatures (SST) in the eastern and central part, thereby slowing global warming and strengthening the zonal SST gradient, and highly asymmetric sea level trends with an accelerated rise relative to the global average in the western and a drop in the eastern part. These trends have been linked to an anomalously strong Pacific Walker Circulation, the major zonal atmospheric overturning cell in the tropical Pacific sector, but the origin of the strengthening is controversial. Here we address the question as to whether the recent decadal trends in the tropical Pacific atmosphere-ocean system are within the range of internal variability, as simulated in long unforced integrations of global climate models. We show that the recent trends are still within the range of long-term internal decadal variability. 
4. Dangendorf et al., 2016
The observed 20th century sea level rise represents one of the major consequences of anthropogenic climate change. However, superimposed on any anthropogenic trend there are also considerable decadal to centennial signals linked to intrinsic natural variability in the climate system. … Gravitational effects and ocean dynamics further lead to regionally varying imprints of low frequency variability. In the Arctic, for instance, the causal uncertainties are even up to 8 times larger than previously thought. This result is consistent with recent findings that beside the anthropogenic signature, a non-negligible fraction of the observed 20th century sea level rise still represents a response to pre-industrial natural climate variations such as the Little Ice Age.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning recently sent a letter to daily Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten (PNN), which earlier had reported on dramatic “ice loss” in Antarctica and resulting dangerous sea level rise – the typical bogus climate alarm story we’ve become accustomed to hearing from the Truth Media.
Sadly, the PNN presented only the doom and gloom perspective of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), and so Lüning sent a letter to set the record straight. In his letter he presented by 5 very recent papers that “clearly contradict such a dramatic ice melting at the South Pole.”
In the first paper Lüning cites, NASA states that ice mass gains at Antarctica were greater than the losses.
The second paper states that scientists concluded that sea level rise from the modeled melting of Antarctic ice sheets over the next 200 years will in fact be slower than expected. Yes, the models were over the top again.
The third paper Lüning presents shows that melting of the “West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be slowed by two big factors that are largely overlooked in current computer models“. Yes, more model flaws.
The fourth paper, appearing in the American Geophysical Union, states that “annual snow accumulation on West Antarctica’s coastal ice sheet increased dramatically during the 20th century“.
And the fifth paper examined here writes that the Antarctic ice sheet has stayed frozen over the past 14 millions years, thus suggesting that “the surrounding region, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, or EAIS, has likewise remained intact“, thus lending “new support for the idea that the EAIS did not experience significant melting even during the Pliocene, a period from 3 to 5 million years ago, when carbon dioxide concentrations rivaled what they are today“.
Lüning writes to the PNN that he is getting the impression that “foremost dramatizing climate studies are finding their way” to their newspaper and that he would be happy if they visited his Die kalte Sonne site.

"The blistering heat that last week brought travel chaos and record temperatures to Britain reveal the nation’s vulnerability to changes in weather patterns in regions far from our shores. That was a key message outlined by climate experts after the nation recorded its hottest ever July – thanks to the arrival of heated air carried on atmospheric currents from Africa to the British Isles. “Although the average rise of global temperature is around 1.0C compared with pre-industrial times, we mustn’t forget the rise isn’t even across the globe, as some regions have warmed more than others,” said Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office. “Temperatures in parts of North Africa, for example, have risen by around 2.0C. This can have a marked effect on UK weather, because the weather patterns, like the one we have seen last week, can bring a stronger signal of climate change with it too, boosting temperatures. The UK receives influences from other neighbouring regions, and as many of these are warming at a faster rate than the UK our climate can receive a greater boost from climate change.” Temperatures passed 25C for three days last week, which means that the hot spell could officially be classified as a heatwave. Fears that rail lines would buckle in the heat led to severe speed restrictions being imposed on many lines, bringing disruption that is still affecting some services. At the same time the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany all experienced record high temperatures last week. In Paris temperatures soared to 42.6C on Thursday, surpassing the city’s previous highest by more than 2C. However, it is still unclear if the UK also experienced its hottest-ever day on Thursday. Provisional figures released by the Met Office on Friday indicated that a peak of 38.7C had been experienced at Cambridge University Botanic Gardens. Britain’s previous high was 38.5C, reached in 2003 in Faversham. The Met Office has refused to confirm the new record UK temperature until it has double-checked its instruments there. This will be done this week, said a spokesman. Most experts expect the reading will stand as a new record, however. “The fact that Thursday’s maximum temperature in Cambridge was the highest ever seen in Britain is an indication of just how dangerous to people these heatwaves can be,” added Professor Hannah Cloke, of Reading University. “At such high temperatures, every extra degree is potentially the difference between life and death to vulnerable people. Last week’s conditions were described as “weather on steroids” by Dr Karsten Haustein, of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. “The UK could have reached 40C last week, but cloud cover during the afternoon prevented it. What this short but intense episode has shown is that the potential for 40C is there. “While we don’t know when it will happen for the first time, it is very probable that it is eventually going to happen if climate change continues unabated.” This point was backed by meteorologist Professor Andrew Charlton-Perez, at Reading University. “There are a huge range of physical processes which contributed to the temperature extremes we saw last week. These include both the large-scale weather patterns that brought the warm air mass over the UK and Europe, but also the smaller-scale, local transfers of energy which can be affected by the presence of clouds and the structure of the layer of air nearest to the Earth’s surface.”"

By Kenneth Richard
It is apparently regarded as “consensus” science that more than half of the climate changes occurring since the mid-20th century have been caused by humans.  For example, the IPCC’s “consensus” statement from 2013 reads like this:
It is extremely likely more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.
The “extremely likely” designation for this position seems to suggest there is little to no disagreement with this statement in the scientific community, or at least this is what we are apparently supposed to believe.
Only a relatively minor and inconsequential role
Interestingly, since January 2014, the last 2 and half years, 770 peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published in scholarly journals that call into question just how settled the “consensus” science is that says anthropogenic or CO2 forcing dominates weather and climate changes, or that non-anthropogenic factors play only a relatively minor and inconsequential role.
Instead of supporting the “consensus” science, these 770 papers support the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties apparent in climate modeling and the predictions of future climate catastrophes. Furthermore, these scientific papers strongly suggest that natural factors (the Sun, multi-decadal ocean oscillations [AMO/PDO, ENSO], cloud and aerosol albedo variations, etc.) have both in the past and present exerted a significant influence on weather and climate, which means an anthropogenic signal may be much more difficult to detect or distinguish as an “extremely likely” cause relative to natural variation.  Papers questioning the “common-knowledge” viewpoints on ocean acidification, glacier melt and advance, sea level rise, extreme weather events, past climate forcing mechanisms, the “danger” of high CO2 concentrations, etc., have also been included in this volume of 770 papers.
In 2014, there were almost 250 papers that may support a skeptical-of-the-consensus position. see here.

Now updated for the first 6 months of 2016, a review of the literature has already uncovered a list of 240 papers published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals that support a skeptical-of-the-consensus position, see here.
This 2016 list includes 43 papers supporting a Sun-Climate link, which can be added to the 188 papers linking the Sun to climate changes published in 2014 (93 papers) and 2015 (95 papers).
Voluminous evidence
This voluminous evidence of a strong non-anthropogenic influence on climate would seem to undermine the IPCC’s contention that the “consensus” position (e.g., climate change is mostly caused by humans) has been wholly accepted in the scientific community.
Would it be too much to ask for the IPCC to consider this scientific evidence when issuing their next report?

We routinely read about “highest ever” Arctic ice sheet and sea ice melt rates in the Arctic. And about rapid, “faster-than-expected” melting of ice shelves in West Antarctica.  And then, of course, we’re told that sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate — a catastrophically accelerating rate — due to the amplified warming at the poles, or “polar amplification”.
The predominant cause of these alarming climate changes is almost invariably attributed to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, of course. These headlines are now commonplace, designed to grab our attention and stir us to action.  But does the scientific evidence confirm that the polar climate is predominantly determined by the rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions?
A warming and cooling Arctic
As documented in the below Climate4you graph (HadCRUT4), the Arctic climate has followed a roughly 60-year oscillation in the last century. Arctic (70-90 N) temperatures warmed during the 1920s to 1940s, cooled during the 1950s to1990s, and then returned to a warming trend from the mid-1990s onward.

Source: Climate4You 
Back in the early 1990s, the failure of the Arctic region to warm during the previous ~40 years (1950-1990) despite the concomitant increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions was puzzling to scientists publishing in the journal Nature (Kahl et al., 1993: “Absence of evidence for greenhouse warming over the Arctic Ocean in the past 40 years“), leading them to question whether the models for the CO2 greenhouse warming hypothesis  could adequately explain climate fluctuations for the polar regions.
Below are some excerpts from the Kahl et al. (1993) paper.
In particular, we do not observe the large surface warming trends predicted by models; indeed, we detect significant surface cooling trends over the western Arctic Ocean during winter and autumn. This discrepancy suggests that present climate models do not adequately incorporate the physical processes that affect the polar regions.
Conclusion Kahl et al., 1993:
The lack of widespread significant warming trends leads us to conclude that there is no strong evidence to support model simulations of greenhouse warming over the Arctic Ocean for the period 1950-1990.  Our results, combined with the inconsistent performance of model simulations of Arctic climate indicate a need to understand better the physical processes that affect polar regions, especially atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions, ocean heat transfer and cloud radiative effects“
A cooling Antarctica, Southern Ocean since 1979
In contrast to the recent Arctic warming trend, there has been a lack of atmospheric warming in and around Antarctica since the late 1970s according to both the UAH and RSS datasets (as shown in the two graphs below). Scientists have documented a net growth in Antarctic sea ice in the last few decades, and, according to Fan et al. (2014), the Southern Ocean has also cooled since 1979, consistent with the increase in sea ice.  These results are, of course, not consistent with modeled projections.
Key points from the Fan et al. (2014) paper entitled “Recent Antarctic sea ice trends in the context of Southern Ocean surface climate variations since 1950“:
[A]ll of these studies reported a close relationship between [sea ice extent] and sea surface temperature (SST) whereby sea ice gain is associated with lower SSTs and vice versa. … Cooling is evident over most of the Southern Ocean in all seasons and the annual mean, with magnitudes approximately 0.2–0.4°C per decade or 0.7–1.3°C over the 33 year period [1979-2011].”
Also RSS and UAH show Antarctic cooling since 1979:

The unsettled science of polar amplification and CO2 forcing
As the warming in the Arctic has resumed (after decades of cooling), scientists no longer seem to be questioning the theoretical models projecting a polar-amplified warming due to increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Instead, it is presumed to be “settled science” that the dominant cause of the Arctic warming trend since the mid-1990s has been anthropogenic  CO2 emissions.
But is the science of polar amplification due to a rise in atmospheric CO2 really settled? A paper published recently  (2015) by Dr. Schmithüsen (Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany) and colleagues may seriously undermine this conceptualization. The scientists analyze observational measurements (using the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer) of global-scale CO2 radiative forcing and find the greenhouse warming effect for CO2 is “weak” (Greenland) to non-existent (Antarctica) at polar locations, and that the CO2 greenhouse warming effect is instead strongest in the equatorial regions.   Not only is the polar amplification paradigm  rendered questionable by these observed results,  but Schmithüsen et al. (2015) have found that, for central Antarctica, increasing CO2 actually leads to a “negative greenhouse effect”, or a net cooling.
Below are highlighted excerpts from the Schmithüsen et al. (2015) paper entitled “How increasing CO2 leads to an increased negative greenhouse effect in Antarctica“.
For this region [central Antarctica], the emission to space is higher than the surface emission; and the greenhouse effect of CO2 is around zero or even negative, which has not been discussed so far. We investigated this in detail and show that for central Antarctica an increase in CO2 concentration leads to an increased long-wave energy loss to space, which cools the Earth-atmosphere system.”
And:
For most of the Antarctic Plateau, GHE-TES [greenhouse effect as measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer] is close to zero or even slightly negative; i.e., the presence of CO2 increases radiative cooling. Over Greenland, the greenhouse effect of CO2 is also comparatively weak but invariably positive. An evaluation of monthly averages of GHE-TES shows that the increased cooling due to CO2 of Antarctica is strongest during austral spring and autumn. … Central Antarctica is the only place on the planet where increased CO2 concentrations lead to an increased LW energy loss to space [cooling]. In the Northern Hemisphere the lowest, but invariably positive, [CO2] forcing values are seen over Greenland and Eastern Siberia.”
An excellent visual representation of the “weak” radiative forcing effect attributed to CO2 for the polar regions is found in Figure 4 (below) from the paper. Notice that, according to Tropospheric Emission Sperctrometer measurements, the radiative forcing values are in the range of only about -1 to +5 W/m2 for the polar ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland), whereas radiative forcing values average roughly 20 W/m2 for the rest of the globe, with up to 35 W/m2 for the equatorial regions.

Cloud radiative forcing more than CO2 radiative forcing
To put this relatively “weak” -1 to +5 W/m2 CO2 greenhouse forcing for the polar regions into perspective, consider that the radiative forcing (greenhouse warming effect) for clouds has been found  to be several times  greater (~30 W/m2) over the Greenland ice sheet than for CO2 forcing (~5 W/m2).   In fact, scientists (Tricht et al., 2016) have determined that cloud forcing warmed the Greenland climate by 1.2°C from 2007 to 2010, which is enough heat energy to melt 90 Gigatonnes (Gt) of ice.
Here’s an excerpt from the Tricht et al. (2016) paper “Clouds enhance Greenland ice sheet meltwater runoff“:
Clouds are known to play a pivotal role in regulating the local SEB [Surface Energy Balance], with competing warming and cooling effects on the surface. […] The satellite-based cloud observations allow to estimate the cloud impact on the SEB [Surface Energy Balance].  … The annual mean CRE [Cloud Radiative Effect] of 29.5 (±5.2) W m 2 provides enough energy to melt 90 Gt of ice in the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] ablation area during July and August. … The snow model simulations, which capture the evolution of the GrIS SMB [Surface Mass Balance] from 2007 to 2010, indicate that clouds warm the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] surface by 1.2° (±0.1) C on average over the entire period [2007-2010]. … These results further indicate that not only liquid-bearing clouds but also clouds composed exclusively of ice significantly increase radiative fluxes into the surface and decrease GrIS SMB [Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Mass Balance]”
Not only for Greenland, but on a global scale, cloud radiative forcing has also long been observed to be far more climatically influential than CO2 forcing. For example, in the Ramanathan et al. (1989) paper entitled “Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment” — which has been cited over 1300 times in the peer-reviewed literature — it was determined that the greenhouse effect of CO2 may need to be increased by a factor of 100 to approach the greenhouse effect of clouds. What follows is an excerpt:
Water vapour and cloud are the dominant regulators of the radiative heating of the planet. ..The greenhouse effect of clouds may be larger than that resulting from a hundredfold increase in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. … The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling.”
Summary
The implications of these measurements showing relatively minimal CO2 greenhouse forcing at the poles are enormous. Succinctly, the alarmist insistence of a significant anthropogenic influence on polar ice sheet melting and the consequent impact on sea level rise become highly dubious if observational evidence reveals that the CO2 greenhouse effect is only very modest  (-1 to +5 W/m2) for the polar regions.  For if the Arctic warming trend and sea ice decline that resumed in the 1990s cannot be significantly attributed to increases in atmospheric CO2, this severely undercuts the heart of alarming claims about humans catastrophically altering the polar — and global — climate.
The sensational headlines about melting polar ice and rapidly accelerating sea level rise would be reported with much less exhortative zeal if there wasn’t also a co-existing paradigm that says anthropogenic CO2 emissions are what drive these alleged climate changes. So when science doesn’t corroborate what the alarming headlines say about a significant anthropogenic or CO2 influence on the polar climate, ice melt, or sea level rise, that science is usually glossed over…or dismissed.  After all, the science is supposed to be settled. Right?

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessional engineer Bernd Töpperwien made a presentation (in German) on infrasound and its impacts on human health, specifically addressing the impacts of a wind park proposed to be built in the region he resides.

Though low-frequency infrasound (<20 Hz) is not audible to the human ear, the pressure variations are felt by the inner ear, which plays a major role when it comes to our sense of balance, perception, and orientation.
In his presentation Töpperwien says he used to be a proponent of wind energy. But after having researched the phenomenon of infrasound, he has changed his mind. One problem is that it is very difficult to dampen infrasound and that it travels great distances. A typical infrasound wave from a wind turbine can be measured up to 25 kilometers away he says. They travel great distances.
Moreover, air inversions can even reflect infrasound, and hence act to amplify the waves. Infrasound can also be transmitted to homes via the ground.
The changing pressures ´that infrasound causes in the inner ear lead to the person to believe he is in motion when he actually is not. This can cause the person to experience motion sickness symptoms. Other people may experience feelings of panic or feel discomfort in their organs.

Negative health impacts already confirmed
Other problems persons exposed to infrasound may experience include, insomnia, headaches, depression, high blood pressure, dizziness, tinnitus or even heart problems. All these ailments have been confirmed by a number of German government institutes. The German Army and the Robert Koch Institute have confirmed that persons exposed to infrasound over extended time periods can suffer damage to health, Töpperwien tells the audience.
What does Töpperwien say about wind turbines near homes?
I wouldn’t like to have any such turbine anywhere within 5 kilometers from where I live. I would like to stay healthy.”
What is the result? Increasingly German citizens are mounting ferocious resistance to wind turbines. Today there are hundreds of opposition groups.

"How many wedge-tailed eagles is a black-throated finch worth? No doubt there’s an economist out there willing to have a crack at answering that question, but the right of Australian politics seem to have already figured it out without so much as community survey: eagles are important and finches are not. Australian conservatives mock the idea that the government would block Adani from building a new coalmine on top of the endangered black-throated finch’s nesting grounds, yet it’s the same commentators and parliamentarians who are terribly excited about blocking a proposal to build a windfarm on Tasmania’s Robbins Island. The fact that Bob Brown is worried about both eagles and finches has created even more excitement.  So worried about the eagles is the former Greens leader that he has spoken out against the construction of what would be the southern hemisphere’s largest windfarm. An act so exciting that the Australian newspaper has now devoted three front-page stories to examining the issue. It’s not clear why some species of bird are so important to conservatives and others are inconsequential. The fact that an environmentalist might ever oppose a windfarm is one of the most exciting things to happen to the rightwing commentariat since Yassmin Abdel-Magied used her freedom of speech to defy political correctness and criticise Anzac Day. On 8 July, Brown wrote an opinion piece for the Hobart Mercury outlining concerns about the construction of 270-metre-high wind turbines in the flightpath of endangered migratory birds including the swift parrot, and near the nesting sites of endangered species including the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. He also flagged the environmental consequences of clearing a path for transmission lines through the Tarkine forest. Barely a week later the Australian ran a story about Brown’s opinion piece under the headline: “Crusader Brown turns against wind farm”. For decades, conservative strategists have painted those who take the science of climate change seriously as “zealots”. Having written Brown off as a zealot, of course the Australian would expect that if he supports investment in renewable energy in general, he should always support every proposal. But does anyone believe that Brown – or anyone else serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions – thinks there is nowhere in our natural or built environment unsuitable for the installation of renewable energy? Put simply, those who want to take no steps to reduce emissions are determined to suggest that those who want to take some steps must want to take every step imaginable. I’m not making this up – rightwing commentators often suggest that environmentalists want everyone to “live in caves” or “the dark ages”. Like most people, those who take climate science seriously take other issues seriously as well – including local environmental effects, economic effects and the distributional consequences of policies to reduce emissions. But the confused attacks on Brown haven’t just come from the right and they haven’t just focused on the importance, or lack of importance, of protecting birds. Some have criticised him for mentioning that the project would be foreign-owned (xenophobia), for caring only about Tasmania (nimbyism) and for speaking out about a topic that was bound to fire up the right (the naivety!). It is amazing how many people one short opinion piece can excite. Pointing out that the proposed windfarm would be foreign-owned isn’t xenophobic – it’s a key part of any democratic or planning discussion about who bears the costs and who receives the benefits. I’ve sat in court and argued on the side of small communities who say that foreign-owned coalmines should be opposed on the basis that their town will incur most of the costs of noise and dust pollution, while most of the benefits will accrue to people who live thousands of kilometres away. No one has, yet, called me xenophobic. As for criticising a former senator for Tasmania for speaking out on behalf of Tasmania, I’ll let others puzzle over that one. But let’s get back to the strategy of attacking Brown. The idea is to present Australians with a false choice between doing nothing to tackle climate change or doing “everything”. The right are betting that such a choice is so difficult that many people will turn away from trying. At the same time, it distracts from the simpler question of whether the Australian government is doing enough to tackle climate change. Democracy requires sensible debate to make sensible decisions. That’s why conservatives work so hard to link issues such as same-sex marriage to bestiality, and supporting renewable energy with the end of modern civilisation. But just because it’s juvenile doesn’t mean it won’t work. There are better and worse places to build coalmines, wind turbines, high-rise buildings and nuclear waste dumps. Australians not only have the right, but should be encouraged, to participate in such debates. But in Australia, if you want to talk about better regulation of the building industry you support “the nanny state”. If you want to talk about the high-quality public health systems in the Nordic countries, you want to “weigh down the economy with the burden of tax”. And now it seems, if you have dedicated your life to the environment but think there are dumb places to build a windfarm, you are a hypocrite who wants to cause climate change. Sigh. But, exhausting or not, democracy needs debate. While arguing with conservative commentators often feels like arguing with a drunk relative at Christmas, the alternative of being silenced is worse. There will always be local concerns associated with the construction of new freeways, new coalmines, new high-rise towers and yes, new wind and solar farms. Democracy doesn’t promise us that everyone will always be happy but it should promise us that everyone has a voice in the decisions that affect them. It’s not Bob Brown and the other environmentalists concerned about the Robbins Island windfarm who are being hypocrites – it’s those on the right who have ignored community and environmental concerns for decades when freeways and high-rise housing were killing the birds and pissing off the locals, and who are now feigning concern about those very same issues. • Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute. He was a strategy advisor to Bob Brown when he was a senator. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Spiegel here writes that India has no plans of cooperating when it comes to CO2 reductions: “In India economic development comes before climate protection. The country is massively embarking on coal-fired power.”
Coal before climate
The German weekly writes that the country has 360 million people suffering under grinding poverty and 400 million people living in homes that are not even connected to the power grid. With such pressing problems it is no surprise that climate change does not have top priority for Prime Minister Modi.
That’s bad news for the proponents of massive global CO2 cuts and (expensive) green energies. Spiegel maintains that India will play a decisive role on whether or not climate protection targets get met. Currently the country is seeing rapid economic growth and its emissions of CO2 are accelerating like never before. Coal burning is set to double by 2019, Spiegel writes. CO2 emissions are projected to almost triple by 2030. That’s huge for a country with well over a billion people.
India rejects requests to cut back
The flagship German weekly also adds that India is not about to accept any requests from prosperous industrial countries that it scale back its coal-burning, especially in view that per capita CO2 emission is India is a mere fraction of developed western countries (see Spiegel’s first chart) and that is the western countries who have burned coal for 150 years and are responsible for alleged climate problems.

Spiegel writes:
India accuses the industrial countries of hypocrisy when it comes the environmental protection – a sentiment that many other developing countries have expressed.”
Industrial countries must pony up 155 billion a year!
Modi’s government is not going to accept any deal unless the industrial countries pony up big time, Spiegel describes. New Dehli estimates that just reducing the intensity of Indian CO2 emissions will cost 155 billion euros – per year! A number that Spiegel says is somewhat overblown and for the purpose of negotiation.
Expect industrial countries in Europe and North America to commit to substantial cuts, but developing countries to get a free pass. Globally CO2 cutbacks remain a distant fantasy and will continue their growth unhindered.

"Britain could bake under record-breaking heat as temperatures could potentially climb to 39C on Thursday. The scorching conditions may spark thunderstorms, which could trigger travel delays, flash flooding, and power cuts.  The dangers of cooling off in lakes, rivers and the sea were highlighted by emergency services after the bodies of three people were pulled from the water on Wednesday after they reportedly got into difficulty swimming. A yellow weather warning is in force for most of England, except the south-west, and parts of Scotland from 3pm on Thursday until 4am on Friday. According to the Met Office, there is a 60% chance the temperature could rise above the current all-time UK temperature record of 38.5C on Thursday. “It will get into the 30s across the country and reach the mid-30s in the south-east,” Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said. “If it is to get to 39C, it will happen somewhere between London and Cambridge. “Temperatures locally could also break July or all-time records.” Lightning storms have already caused fires and rail disruption this week during the heatwave. Network Rail warned that speed restrictions might be introduced in areas where tracks were at risk of buckling. Extreme weather action teams (Ewats) had been activated to keep passengers safe and trains running, it said. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, advised passengers in London and the south-east to consider changing their travel plans on Thursday. London North Eastern Railway (LNER), which runs inter-city services on the East coast mainline, is advising customers against travelling on Thursday. It said some services were likely to be cancelled or delayed as speed restrictions would be imposed between Peterborough and London King’s Cross. The Met Office has warned that heatwaves are on the increase as a result of climate change. The scorching temperatures gripping the UK and much of Europe come against a backdrop of global warming of 1C since the industrial revolution driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Both Belgium and the Netherlands broke their all-time maximum temperature records on Wednesday, reaching 39.9C and 39.1C respectively, the Met Office said. Higher temperatures are making extreme hot spells more likely and more intense, experts warn."
"Greta Thunberg has made her musical debut on a single by the 1975. On a track called The 1975, a version of which traditionally opens each of the British band’s albums, the 16-year-old environmental activist restates her position on the need to act on the climate emergency. Thunberg said: “I’m grateful to get the opportunity to get my message out to a broad new audience in a new way. I think it’s great that the 1975 is so strongly engaged in the climate crisis. We quickly need to get people in all branches of society to get involved. And this collaboration I think is something new.”  Over the 1975’s minimal orchestral backing, Thunberg says: “We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed. But homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around.” She continues: “We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.” Thunberg concludes: “So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel.” Read the full text of her speech below. The proceeds from the track will go to Extinction Rebellion at Thunberg’s request. The environmental group released a statement welcoming the collaboration: “Music has the power to break through barriers, and right now we really need to break through some barriers if we are to face this emergency.” Thunberg is the first outside party to feature on a recording by the band. The track was recorded in Stockholm in late June and is the first song to be released from the 1975’s forthcoming album, Notes on a Conditional Form. The band manager and founder of the label Dirty Hit, Jamie Oborne, said the group and the label were making efforts to minimise their environmental impact. Dirty Hit’s office has phased out all single-use plastic, will no longer produce plastic products including CD jewel cases and is working to minimise the impact of vinyl production. “Rather than ignoring that it’s a pollutant, we’re minimising it by only doing lightweight vinyl from now on,” Oborne said. “That isn’t very trendy, but one heavyweight LP is the equivalent of making two or three [standard thickness LPs].” Dirty Hit’s CDs and vinyl are contained in paper packaging and not wrapped in non-degradable shrink wrap. Oborne said they had sourced a biodegradable shrink wrap which they would integrate fully once their production plants had full access to it. The 1975’s next merchandise line will also be environmentally friendly, repurposing unsold merchandise into new garments. Oborne dismissed peers’ suggestions that the organisation could be labelled hypocritical for taking a stance on the climate crisis before becoming 100% carbon efficient. “That’s why we’re in this situation where everyone’s standing around and it takes a child to point out that we can make these changes,” he said, referring to Thunberg. “We’re not going to have touring worked out in six weeks because everything’s working against you, but we are going to have it sorted out in a period of time, and 50% is better than nothing. If everyone pushes responsibility onto other people because they can’t completely solve [the issue], we’re already fucked.” The track release follows Thunberg’s address to French politicians on 23 July, in which she urged them to “unite behind the science” of climate change. After rightwing legislators said they would not attend her appearance at the National Assembly, she said youth climate activists have become “the bad guys” for stating “uncomfortable things”. “Just for quoting or acting on these numbers, these scientific facts, we receive unimaginable amounts of hate and threats,” she said. “We are being mocked and lied about by members of parliament and journalists.” On 20 September, Thunberg and other young environmental activists will lead a climate strike around the world. The 1975’s new album is the second in their Music for Cars series, which began in November 2018 with A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. The group will headline this year’s Reading and Leeds festivals in August. The full text of Thunberg’s speech. We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis. And we need to call it what it is. An emergency. We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control and that we don’t have all the solutions yet. Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things. We admit that we are losing this battle. We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed. But homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance. We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases. And either we do that, or we don’t. You say that nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don’t. Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Now we all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change. But you cannot have one without the other. If you look through history, all the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level. People like you and me. So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible. To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible. Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground. So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules. Because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change. And it has to start today. So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week the media, led by the Washington Post, screamed and hollered the North Pole was in meltdown as temperatures there rose some “5 degrees above normal”. In Europe some media outlets did not even bother converting the 50° Fahrenheit figure to (the less impressive sounding) 32°C.
It is true that the temperature right at the North Pole was “estimated” by “weather forecast models” to have supposedly reached the melting point – for a period of a few hours. But what the news media neglected to tell readers is that the North Pole region itself is actually a vast area – and one that is extremely poorly measured – as even the Washington Post admits. The Arctic region as a whole in fact did not warm up anywhere near 32°K (50°F) last week.
Only a fraction of the Arctic saw a large warm spike
The reality is that weather charts showed only a minority fraction of the Arctic saw temperatures near the melting point, while the vast remainder remained stuck at its usual 25 – 40°C below zero range.
According to the Danish Meteorological Institute here, which has been systematically tracking Arctic temperatures north of 80° latitude since 1958, here’s what the 2015 “North Pole meltdown” really looked like (far right) once the whole Arctic region got factored in:

Chart: DMI.
The above DMI figure shows that the temperature in the Arctic above 80°N was estimated to have risen only some 13°K during the event, and not 30°K as the WAPO tried having its readers think. Note how also in early March 2015 the Arctic saw a similar rise.
Just a few hours after the local region near the North Pole saw a burst of warm southern air, almost immediately temperatures there dropped back to -30°C.

Has a 13°K spike happened before?
Is a 13°K temperature spike in the high Arctic something weird and totally unusual that we need to worry about? Going back and looking at the DMI charts over the past 58 years, we find that such temperature spikes in the Arctic for the period early November to late March are nothing new.
For example a look at the year 1959, the chart below shows that a similar temperature spike occurred not just once, but twice! (marked yellow).

Chart: DMI.
And examining all the years since 1958 we see that a temperature spike of some 12°K or more in a matter of a few days (during the November to March deep winter period) occurred more than 70 times! And over 100 times for spikes of 10°K and more. 
Clearly we see fluctuations of 10°K (i.e. similar to what just happened) in a matter of days are actually the norm for the North Pole region.
Also taking a look at the wild fluctuations seen in 1964, 1984, or 1990 – back when CO2 was at levels near or below the “safe” 350 ppm – we see they were far more extreme.
What does this tell us about the reporting by the Washington Post, and all the other media outlets who allowed themselves to be duped and irresponsibly played along? It shows that many mainstream journalists are agenda-driven, not interested in digging, and that their sole aim in reporting climate science is to fabricate junk-science-based scare stories that have no journalistic merit.
They’ve degraded themselves to acting as the mouthpieces for a dishonest agenda.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back I posted before-and-after photos of how wind parks are destroying Germany’s natural landscape.
Those photos have now been put into a video. Send the link to political leaders or communities who may be contemplating wind parks in their areas.

Is this really what you want to see every time you look out the window? How does destroying nature save it?
Meanwhile in Germany the “nature-saving” wind parks have done nothing to curb CO2. Last year Germany’s CO2 emissions rose.

Yes, you read that right. There has been NO warming in 85 years.
There are many surface land stations with records going back more than 100 years. Some records exist back to 1880 and earlier. GISS cuts the records off at 1880. There are many gaps in these records before 1930, and all the 20th Century warming occurred before then.
How do I know this? I scanned the GISTemp web site for locations with long records, that were as continuous as possible, with a variety of satellite brightness indexes. Because the U. S. Weather Bureau was especially diligent in setting up measurement stations, 60% in this study are U. S. Over the rest of the world it was very difficult to find stations with both long, continuous records, and a zero satellite brightness index. I stopped searching after finding a total of 50 stations.
The satellite brightness index is used by GISS as a proxy for population and thus a proxy for urban warming. It is then used to calculate the amount of “homogenization” to apply to cities and towns. Locations with a brightness index (BI) of 10 or less is considered “rural” and no homogenization correction is applied to those with zero brightness. However, Time of Observation (TOBs) and move corrections are still applied to these stations. GISTemp has downloadable temperature data for: Unadjusted temperature, Adjusted temperature (TOBs and move adjustments), Adjusted and Cleaned data (Cleaning removes data considered unreliable in some way) and Homogenized data. For the 50 stations, Unadjusted, Adjusted and Cleaned, and Homogenized monthly data were downloaded. Of these, 20 stations are considered rural, with a BI of 10 or less. 15 are towns with BI between 11 and 32, and another 15 are cities with a brightness index of more than 32. I attempted to select pairs or triplets of locations that had a large city with close by rural stations. This was easy in the U. S., with the high density of stations, but more difficult in the rest of the world where stations might be separated by hundreds of kilometers.
For all the 150 resulting temperature records, the linear trends for each from 1930 to the present was calculated using Excel. This gives the annual trend numbers in degrees C. Here are summaries of that data presented as bar charts for each group of locations, rural, medium sized towns, and large cities; the bars are for summer and winter data. Summer is June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere, and December, January, and February in the southern. Winter is the reverse of that.

Figure 1 is the rural data. Unadjusted data indicates summer cooling at these stations since 1930. Even the adjusted and homogenized data indicate less than 0.125°C summer warming in 85 years. This is statistically NO warming in the summer. Winter warming is about 1° over 85 years. This may all be due to increasing population and home heating around these stations.

Figure 2 is for towns with BI from 11 to 32. For example, towns like North Platte, Nebraska, Godthaab-Nuuk, Greenland, and Bismarck, North Dakota. The Unadjusted summer trend is almost zero, with the adjusted and homogenized summer trends less than 0.4°/85 years. The winter trends are much higher at 1.36° in 85 years. All of the summer trend increase is due to adjustments; as is nearly half the winter increase.

Figure 3 shows the big cities, like Tokyo and New York. It is expected that these locations would have high urban heat island affecting temperatures in summer and winter. Again, adjustments have increased both summer and winter temperature trends, though not as dramatically as for the smaller towns. Homogenization is supposed to correct for this, but has failed to do so for summer trends, and has only made the winter trend slightly less than the rural winter.
This has led to the strange result that medium size towns are supposedly warming faster than large cities by almost 50%.
All of the trend increase in the last 85 years is due to mankind’s desire to keep warm in winter. This inside warmth leaks out into the surrounding environment and is measured by the local weather stations. This, combined with tinkering with the data, has produced all the warming in the last 85 years. There is clearly no warming, and perhaps some modest cooling, in the summer, and all the winter warming is due to direct heating by mankind keeping warm. Shorter term trends, like the 70’s cooling, are due to natural cycles. There is no “hockey-stick”! No “Solution” is necessary.
Here is the list of the stations used. There are nine stations with negative annual temperature trends. They are highlighted in blue. Three of those are large cities. Five more have trends between zero and 0.0025°C/year. Most of those are rural.

There is more analysis to be done on this data for future articles.

====================================
The oceans (SST) have cooled surprisingly over January to February 2016.
While during other El Niño events like in 2015/16 led to a time-delayed warming of the Earth’s atmosphere – as was the case this year, the global oceans have decoupled themselves from this time-delayed warming and are showing a surprising significant cooling from January to February 2016 when compared to the powerful 1997/98 El Nino event:

The plot from BOB TISDALE shows the course of the SSTA during the powerful 1997/98 El Niño and from 2015/16. The monthly mean SSTA from multiple data suppliers show a surprising drop in global SST in February 2016. Source: Global Sea Surface Temperature Responses to the 1997/98 and 2015/16 El Niño Events.
The North Pacific, which since 2014 had been parked off the west coast and known as the warm BLOB, saw the greatest share of the global sea surface cooling. By December 2015 it practically disappeared:

Global temperatures fell in March 2016
In March 2016 the global temperatures have shown a clear retreat after their three to four-month highpoint February 2016 – time delayed after the El Niño peak at the end of October/start of November 2015. This has also been the case in the tropics as well:

The plot shows the measured/calculated temperature deviation global (black curve) and in the tropics (red curve). After a peak in February 2016, global temperatures have fallen sharply as of 28 March 2016. Source: weatherbell.com/temperature.php. 
Therefore it is fully possible that the global temperatures have already begun to gradually ease back from the previous month’s record high in February 2016, although this was not expected to happen until April: Record warmth in the troposphere in February 2016 – Tropical sea surface starts to cool off.
“…With increasing cooling of the tropical sea surface, this means also a gradual cooling of global temperatures will set in by April 2016, which I described here:  ENSO update February 2016: El Niño leaving– La Niña arriving…”
Also see the unfalsified facts n: “Global Warming” Reality Check February 2016: The global warming ”pause” since 1997 continues– RSS 0.94.”
The water masses of the equatorial Pacific over the past months have released a considerable amount of energy into the atmosphere. From the end of October 2015 until the end of March 2016, the upper 300 meters have cooled strongly: by 2.6°K.

The plot above shows the course of the temperature anomalies down to 300 meters at the equatorial Pacific. The powerful positive deviations (orange) of the Downwelling-Phase reached their peak at 2.1°K deviation at the end of October/early November 2015 and have fallen 2.6°K to -0.5° K (blue): El Niño leaves– La Niña arrives! Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/enso.shtml
We will have to wait and see to find out whether the global temperature anomalies will go negative already by the end of 2016, similar to what happened with the El Niño event 1997/98 – though the negative global temperature anomaly did not arrive until March 1999 – which we saw in the UAH satellite data: http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data.txt.

"At sunrise, the misty fields around the village of Guior are already dotted with men, women and children sowing maize after an overnight rainstorm. After several years of drought, the downpour brought some hope of relief to the subsistence farmers in this part of eastern Guatemala. But as Esteban Gutiérrez, 30, takes a break from his work, he explains why he is still willing to incur crippling debts – and risk his life – to migrate to the United States. “My children have gone to bed hungry for the past three years. Our crops failed and the coffee farms have cut wages to $4 a day,” he says, playing nervously with the white maize kernels in a plastic trough strapped to his waist. “We hope the harvest will be good, but until then we have only one quintal [46kg] of maize left – which is barely enough for a month. I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more.” Central America remains one of the world’s most dangerous regions outside a warzone, where a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption has forced millions to flee their homes and head north in search of security. But amid a deepening global climate crisis, drought, famine and the battle for dwindling natural resources are increasingly being recognized as major factors in the exodus. Camotán is a collection of rural communities in the eastern department of Chiquimula, which lies in the rain shadow of the imposing Sierra de las Minas. It forms part of Central America’s dry corridor: a belt stretching south through Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, that receives little rain and is particularly susceptible to droughts and extreme weather. In theory, the rainy season here should last from late April to October, with a drier period in July and August known as the canícula – a regional peculiarity that requires two short harvests. But the past decade has seen frequent, intense droughts and late rains due to unusually hot and dry canículas and prolonged years of El Niño – the warm phase of a complex weather cycle caused by increased Pacific surface temperatures. “Over the past six years, the lack of rainfall has been our biggest problem, causing crops to fail and widespread famine,” said the climate scientist Edwin Castellanos, the dean of the research institute at Guatemala’s Universidad del Valle. The current run of hot, dry years follows a decade or so of unusually prolonged rains and flooding due to the other phase of the cycle known as La Niña, caused by colder Pacific waters. “Normal, predictable weather years are getting rarer,” added Castellanos. On the ground, the impact has been devastating. In 2018, drought-related crop failures directly affected one in 10 Guatemalans, and caused extreme food shortages for almost 840,000 people, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). As a result, entire families have been migrating in record numbers: since October 2018, more than 167,000 Guatemalans travelling in family groups have been apprehended at the US border, compared with 23,000 in 2016. Those who remain, often depend on money sent home by emigres, especially in rural areas, which received more than half the $9.2bn of remittances sent to Guatemala in 2018. Despite the rainshowers in Camotán, el niño is back and the outlook for 2019 is grim: about 2 million people in the dry corridor will need urgent food aid, according Ricardo Rapallo, the head of food security at the FAO. “Without doubt climate and environmental changes impact food security. For those who depend on agriculture the situation is very precarious, they are very vulnerable,” said Rapallo. Local political factors are also important. Water shortages and poverty are causally linked to the country’s skewed land distribution: roughly 2% of the population control 70% of all productive farmland. In Chiquimula, 71% of people live in poverty, and 40% in extreme poverty. Forests mitigate climate change, but Guatemala has lost half its woodlands in the past 40 years – and deforestation rates are rising, in turn causing floods, landslides and erosion of farmland. In the peasant farming communities around Camotán, water storage is scarce, and the Maya Ch’orti’ people who live here mostly rely on rainfall to irrigate their crops. Most houses have no toilets, and low water reserves mean most families drink and cook with contaminated stream water. “We waste and contaminate most of our water through mismanagement. We’re not prepared for climate changes,” said the climate scientist Castellanos. The region’s main cash crop is coffee, and for decades, many campesinos relied on seasonal work at commercial plantations to supplement their subsistence lifestyle. But a global price crash and the deadly rust fungus known locally as la rolla – which thrives in hot and humid conditions exacerbated by the climate crisis – have wiped out about 80% of the region’s coffee in the past five years. This has led to less work, lower pay and more hunger. Gutiérrez lives in a half-finished palm-roofed adobe house with his wife Miriam Ávalos, 22, and their five children aged between seven months and nine years. All of the children are small for their age. For breakfast, they have half a corn tortilla each. At school, they sometimes receive noodles and a high-calorie supplement drink, courtesy of a government programme. Dinner is another tortilla or two with salt or herbs – but no beans as the drought destroyed last year’s entire crop. The family’s chickens died a few months back from a mystery illness, so there are no eggs, and meat and dairy are unaffordable. The adults eat once or twice a day. Guatemala has the sixth-highest malnutrition rate in the world with at least 47% of children suffering chronic malnourishment. Malnutrition rates are even higher among the country’s 24 indigenous communities, rising to over 60% in Camotán. Since 2016, at least 800 children under the age of five in Camotán and the neighbouring municipality Jocotán have been diagnosed with acute malnourishment, according to health centre officials. (Underreporting means the real number is likely to be significantly higher.) “The government strategy [to tackle malnutrition] has good elements, but in practice it has been limited to putting out fires, dealing with emergencies, not tackling structural problems or corruption in public administration,” said Paola Cano, a nutritionist and public policy analyst. “Without international aid, even more people would be dying.” Ávalos was 13 when she had her first child. She weighs 90lb and is breastfeeding her seven-month old daughter who weighs just nine pounds. The two-year-old girl weighs 18lbs; her cheeks and stomach are distended, and her hair is falling out – classic symptoms of acute malnutrition. The five-year-old girl is just recovering from sudden weight loss. Sometimes they wake up at night, crying from hunger. “We’re desperate,” said Ávalos, who looks and sounds exhausted. “There’s no money and no food.” Ávalos’s niece died in 2016 at the age of three months. Her mother was unable to produce enough breast milk, and the family couldn’t afford formula. “This isn’t poverty – or even extreme poverty: this is a famine, and people are dying,” said Rodimiro Lantán from Comundich, a grassroots Ch’orti’ organisation helping communities reforest ancestral lands in an effort to prevent forced migration. Families face an impossible choice: stay and risk starvation, or gamble everything on the perilous migrant trail. “They risk their lives if they stay – and if they go,” said Lantán. One local who took that chance was Juan de Léon Gutiérrez, a 16-year old boy from a nearby village. In April, he died at a Texas children’s hospital just days after he was taken into US immigration custody – one of at least eight Guatemalan children to have died shortly after crossing the US border since May 2018. Juan de Léon was not related to Esteban, but such deaths are deeply felt in these rural communities where would be migrants are well aware of the dangers they will face. Esteban is in tears as he leaves the family home to meet a local people smuggler, or coyote, who may be able to guide him north. He has no savings, but, his godfather has offered the coyote the title to 3.5 acres of land as a guarantee. If Esteban makes it to the US, he’ll pay the $5,000 fee; if he doesn’t, the coyote will keep the land. “Banks don’t help people like us,” he says, through tears. He has been told that families have a better chance at the border, so he is considering taking his scrawny nine-year-old son, Wilson, with him. He knows that taking a chronically malnourished child on a 2,000-mile journey will be tough – but he cannot afford to wait: the food is running out. In these parts, the period between harvests, June to August, has always been hard. But the current crisis is different, said Gutiérrez’s mother Isigra Martínez, 58, as she heated leftover tortillas for lunch. “We grew up hungry, but the past four years have been very hard,” she said. “I don’t want my son to go to America, and it will be terribly hard on Wilson.” “I’ve heard people have died on the journey. But maybe there’s no other way.”"
"On Friday afternoon, two members of Extinction Rebellion, Tamsin Omond and Sara Arnold, spoke at Port Eliot festival in Cornwall to Emily Sheffield, a former deputy editor of Vogue, about the role of the fashion industry in the climate emergency. Addressing an orangery packed with people who looked as if they knew their way round a vintage boutique, Arnold talked of the need for a “complete cultural change around clothes”.  She also listed a number of facts to convince even the most diehard fashion fan that change is necessary: the industry is set to grow by 63% by 2030; 100bn items are produced each year, “far more than we need”; fashion is a contributor to about 10% of carbon emissions; it is one of the biggest polluters, responsible for the release of a huge amount of microfibres and plastics into the ocean. Extinction Rebellion, she said, is promoting a fashion boycott, urging people not to buy any new clothes for a year. “We must curb our consumption very, very rapidly … We already produce enough clothes. We can swap clothes between one another, we can customise clothes, we can upcycle them.” The talk took place as part of the festival’s Fashion foundation, where events are taking place all weekend, including from the likes of designer Alice Temperley, and Turner-prize winning artist Jeremy Deller, as well as workshops in brooch-making and “energetic drawing”. Speaking after the event, Arnold explained more about the boycott’s aims, saying it does not need to mean going without. Indeed, she loves clothes. She trained in fashion design at Central Saint Martins in London and dreamed of being the next Alexander McQueen; she is wearing what Sheffield described as a “frow-ready” outfit – 50s glasses, her mum’s old dress and red lipstick. It comes down to “challenging your relationship with clothes”, she says. Arnold points out that even with secondhand clothes there are problems, such as whether they are being shipped from afar. “With everything you do, you need to ask questions and challenge … The best thing we can do is swap things with the people that are close to us.” Sheffield broadened the discussion by asking environmental questions of the audience, including: “How many single-use outfits will the British purchase this summer?” and “How many of those are for festivals?” The answers are 50m and 7.4m respectively. She followed by asking people to raise a hand if they bought a new outfit for the festival. Predictably, no one put their hand up. There was scope for taking heart, though, given the fact that doubling the useful life of clothing from one to two years reduces emissions by 24%. Extinction Rebellion is planning disruptions for London fashion week in September. It used direct action last time, blocking roads across the city to hinder those trying to travel from one show to another. For the next instalment, it is planning a funeral for fashion week, because, according to Arnold, “that should be where it stops for ever … During this absolute emergency, celebrating new fashion, which is essentially what fashion week is doing, is not relevant.” Arnold looked to the example of fashion during the second world war, when, she says, it was frowned upon to wear ostentatious dress. “Yet we are in an existential crisis and fashion weeks are going on as usual,” she said. For Arnold, it is not business as usual. She was working for a luxury brand when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report saying there were 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. The sense of emergency took hold and she “walked out of the job leaving a resignation letter that said ‘we have 10 years left to fight for the planet so, goodbye’”. Omond agrees that the conversations the industry has need “to be about how we are dealing with the climate emergency and nothing else. That is the state of the emergency we’re in. We need to focus on how we can transition, not in 10 or 20 years, but today or tomorrow. Into a future where we are regenerating the earth rather than ransacking it.” They looked to the example of the recently cancelled Stockholm fashion week, pledging instead to become a platform that helps the industry be more sustainable. The next London fashion week, she says, “should be a declaration of emergency, not a celebration”. It should “be the death of fashion”, after which there will be rebirth. Omond spoke more broadly about the Extinction Rebellion movement, about its origins and how its rapid growth and success was rooted in the research of two academics, Roger Hallam and Dr Gail Bradbrook, into non-violent civil disobedience. As the black civil rights and Indian independence movements were the defining issues of their era, so climate change, she said, is the defining issue of ours. “What we see is that climate change is not a once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-a-generation or once-in-a-century issue. It is a once-in-a-species moment. It will be our defining moment.” • This article was amended on 29 July. It is Stockholm fashion week that has been cancelled, not Copenhagen."
"Australia has a responsibility to protect the Pacific region from the impacts of climate change, PNG’s newly appointed prime minister has said. James Marape told the Guardian Australia had “a moral responsibility … to the upkeep of the planet”, particularly given the extreme effect it was having on smaller Pacific nations. “I don’t intend to speak from Canberra’s perspective, they have their own policy mindset, but as human beings I know they will respond to the moral obligation that is prevalent amidst us, that we are environmentally sensitive to the needs of others.” He said the voices of smaller island nations must be listened to. “As big countries in the Pacific – Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand – we have a sense of responsibility to the smaller island countries, because displacement of these smaller communities will first and foremost be our neighbourhood responsibility,” Marape said. In a wide-ranging interview, Marape outlined a vision for his country, to leave behind a history of wasted opportunities and squandered resources, and move towards a healthy and educated nation free of violence. In May, after Scott Morrison led the Coalition to an election victory , Pacific leaders urged him to do more on climate change, saying Australia was “lagging behind”. Marape, who is completing his first official visit to Australia this week, said he would “not be silenced” on environmental responsibility. “We can have our resources but we must have it in an environmentally-friendly manner, so that we leave planet earth to the next generation not in the form we’ve inherited but a better form. He said he believed Australia, New Zealand, and PNG should lead the Pacific as a “bloc” of nations reconstructing their economies to handle resource productions in a more environmentally and socially sensitive way. On Thursday Marape warned foreign companies already in PNG that he intended to crack down on regulatory compliance, and also shake up revenue processing to ensure PNG drew at least 50% in taxes and royalties. He also wanted to see a shift towards an agricultural exports economy, as a “food bowl for Asia” rather than the current dependence on mining. “For the amount of wealth the lord has blessed us with ... the actual translation of this resource into improving peoples life hasn’t happened well in 44 years,” he told Guardian Australia. “I don’t blame the past they lived at the time. They wrote the history, I’m going to write the future for our country.” He said if his government didn’t get the balance right, future generations would blame them. His comments followed an ambitious declaration on Thursday that the impoverished nation would be free of its dependence on Australian aid – more than half a billion dollars a year – within the decade. He told Guardian Australia a prosperous PNG was a “win-win” for Australia. “If we are independent economically, if we are solid and sustaining our own life, your taxes don’t need to come to us,” he said. “We’ll keep the borders up north safe, we’ll have a better, friendly region up there, so the entire region is safe. If we disintegrate up there it affects Australia too.” Marape won the leadership in May after several months of political chaos which ousted his predecessor, Peter O’Neill. O’Neill’s legacy includes numerous crises and controversies, including allegations of corruption and mishandled public policies. In recent years a growing health crisis has been exacerbated by corruption scandals, medication shortages, mishandled medication contracts, and outbreaks of polio and drug-resistant TB. Marape pledged investigations into corruption around the medication supply, and announcements by September of new health interventions. He said he and Morrison had negotiated Australia’s assistance in improving health care. PNG also continues to have some of the world’s worst rates of family and sexual violence, and last week 18 people were massacred in the highlands village of Karida. The murders of mainly women and children were an escalation of worsening tribal violence which shocked the country. Marape denied there was a cultural tolerance of violence in PNG, warningperpetrators they would face prosecution, and said revenge attacks and traditional systems of compensation as a response to violence had to end. “I’ve made it absolutely clear on every occasion I’m asked this question, that whether it’s domestic violence or violence generally in society, culture and custom will not be a place to hide,” he said. PNG police have historically been underresourced, with investigative officers and specialised family violence units effectively grounded because they can’t pay for petrol to attend a crime. Marape said his government would target “hot spots” around the country to improve police resources where they are needed most."
"Since Monday, Britain has felt like a sun-bloated packet of supermarket pasta salad: sweating and smelly, abandoned at the bottom of a dog-waste bin, by turns greasy, hot, unpleasant, swollen and revolting. I have seen topless men resting beaded armpits on bus poles, teenagers dipping their feet in bright-green canals that are so choked with weed they seem hardly wet, parks turned to hay, parents wiping screaming and heat-exhausted children with flannels outside long queues for swimming pools, and car parks littered with ice-cube bags and fizzy drink cans. I have smelled other people’s arse cracks and seen carrier bags of used cat litter create a fiesta of bluebottles around our communal bins. I have left imprints on other people’s furniture. In the words of my mother – who lived through the 1976 heatwave with my newborn sister – “It’s pretty hard to deny climate change in this.” But, my friends, if this week has taught us anything at all – other than that strange, slippery, silvery feel of under-breast condensation – it is that Britain is not ready to live at 38C; we are ill-prepared for our changing climate.  According to a new piece of modelling by the global ecology research centre Crowther Labs, by 2050 London will have the climate of Barcelona. Sure, allow people to burn fossil fuels, farm intensively, drive and fly unnecessarily and waste natural resources like water and gas at the rate we are now and we’ll eventually have the climate of Barcelona. But we’ll have it with the culture of an NCP car park: crowded, threatening, poorly designed and smelling in every corner of someone else’s piss. When temperatures spike at 30C for a few surprising days a year, the UK could feel like a giant summer party. Benches are dragged on to pavements turned moist by recently melted chewing gum; children play out into the golden glow of late evening, hitting balls against garage doors and screaming through the spray of a hose; you’d go to a beer garden on the way home and drink something ludicrous because it was cold and you smelled of suntan lotion and felt you were on holiday; you might text someone you shouldn’t; you might soak your bed sheets as a result. But this week, as our children’s bedrooms still thrum away at 34C by midnight and our mosquito bites turn ankles into hot, stiff tree trunks of infection, people were not smiling. Tragedies occurred as people flocked to unsound bits of dockland, river and coast, desperate to find relief from the screaming sun above us. Parents, employees and trains simply dragged to a halt, like carthorses through liquid concrete. Emotions frayed, gardens withered, pets gently desiccated and children were sprinted from tree to tree by anxious parents trying to find entertainment in the shade for eight hours at a time. Suddenly, selling off all those shady public parks, local swimming pools, cool and quiet libraries, pieces of riverbank and tree-lined playgrounds didn’t seem like such a clever way for councils to claw back some money after years of vicious government cuts. Yesterday, during the hottest July day of my entire British life, I walked past a group of men in long-sleeved, full-length, high-vis worksuits, laying tarmac in the middle of a road junction. Machines pounded, the bitumen steamed, the sun raged down on their sweat-streaked faces. Each one looked, in his own way, like he was about to die. Rushing home, I half-filled my 20-month-old’s baby bath with cold water (to be later poured over our plants), in the middle of our front room, unable to go outside and unwilling to burn more precious resources and thereby increase the climate problem by buying a fan or – ye gads – an air conditioner. I thought of all those people in flats, like mine, with windows designed to open the width of a dildo. I thought of the nappies bulging in ripe bin bags like slow-roast casseroles. I thought of the cars occupied by single drivers, chugging poisonous blue fumes over fields and rivers because profit-crazed, micro-managing, outmoded bosses refused their request to work from home. I thought of all the ice-creams turning soft in corner shops. I have walked down enough fart-warm high streets, watched enough music festival fights and spent enough time on glaze-baked buses to know that Britain isn’t ready for 40C summers. Not in our homes, not in our workplaces, not even in our bodies. You may want to deny the climate emergency, you may want to hang on to the luxury and irresponsibility that denial allows. But my friends, you cannot deny the smell of a twice-cancelled commuter train service, with a blocked and swinging toilet, creeping past a fly-tipped ditch as a sweaty businessperson pulls a tuna mayonnaise sandwich from their heat-soft leather bag. This is the future that climate denial is heading us for. And I, for one, am not cool with that. • Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Joe Bastardi also weighs in on March forecast weather here.
Schneefan at the German skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here looks at March weather this year in Europe. Although Europeans have seen a warm winter, the meteorological spring has started out on the bitter cold side and forecasts are showing it could get much worse.

In Central Europe (Germany) snow has been falling down to the flatlands and the cold is expected to stick around – and possibly intensify.
Schneefan writes a massive snowstorm has brought the heaviest snowfall in March in 50 years to the Russian capital city of Moscow, paralyzing the city. The reason was storm low “Zissie”, which also brought the southern and eastern parts of Germany heavy snowfalls.
As of March 4, 2016, a large area of snowfall covered the western part of Germany, bringing snow to the lowlands and traffic disruptions at the higher elevations:

March cold forecast to continue, possibly intensify
Schneefan, who seems to have a very good meteorological background, writes that the March 3 forecast wintry weather will continue because of a polar vortex cold trough extending foremost over Central Europe and an accompanying powerful blocking Atlantic high.

Today the newest model forecast has been crunched out and it shows a cold trough extending well into Central and Eastern Europe even after mid March – thanks to a blocking high over Scandinavia and a low centered over western Russia:

That’s all it takes. Europeans will recall that the opposite pattern dominated late last year, giving Europe one of the mildest November-December periods on record.
It’s the patterns, stupid! It has nothing to do with global warming. Like local temperature is dominated by atmospheric patterns, global temperature is dominated by the oceanic patterns. It’s warm now globally because of an El Nino.
What follows is the GFS temperature forecast chart for 14 days out, March 19:

Note that the GFS model forecasts nighttime temperatures to fall to as low as a staggering -29°C for March 19!
Of course forecasts this far out are fraught with much very real uncertainty, and so it is very likely that such cold readings will not be reached. Revisions come daily.

What follows are the forecast noontime temperatures for March 19, where we see widespread freezing:

Schneefan summarizes by stating that there is even the possibility that the second half of March winding up colder than the first half.
Weather forecasts are indeed fickle, and so only time will tell if it really will get cold. Often times patterns flip unexpectedly and bring the opposite. Let’s hope it does. As mild as this winter has been, most agree that it has been long enough already. An icy March would be brutal and tough to take.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome 15 years ago we were told that snow and ice in the wintertime would be things of the past.
Then Europe and North America experienced a series of harsh winters and climate scientists, turning on a dime, suddenly declared them the result of global warming.
Now that claim too is turning out to be a farce as well.
=====================================
Flopped hypothesis: Cold winters not the consequence of shrinking Arctic sea ice
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning und Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Do you recall how the experts wanted to tell us that cold winters were linked to global warming? For example Spiegel Online wrote on 27 October 2014:
Weather bridge: Ice melt in the Arctic cooling winters in Europe
Climate scientists have discovered a meteorological remote link: When the sea ice melts in the Arctic, atmospheric currents get shifted – winters in Europe and Asia get cooler.
According to a study, ice melt over the past decades has led to especially harsh winters in Europe and Asia. Observations show that the cold winters could be linked with the retreat in Arctic sea ice, which has been happening over the past decades. Scientists led by Masato Mori of the Japanense University of Tokyo have discovered that the retreat of sea ice in the Arctic Barents-Kara Sea favor atmospheric currents that lend to cold in Europe and Asia. These atmospheric patterns that are called ‘blocking situations’ that serve to convey cold air to Europe and Asia and cause harsh winters there, reported the scientists in the journal “Nature Geoscience”.

A regrettable scientific knee-jerk reaction – as it would be exposed just half a year and half later.
A team of scientists of the University of Colorado Boulder and the NOAA led by Lantao Sun examined the mechanism more closely on 25 May 2016 in a new study in the Geophysical Research Letters. They were unable to confirm the relationship between sea ice melt and cold continental winters. The cold winters were neither explainable by the shrinking Arctic sea ice, nor by anthropogenic factors, the scientists found. A pronounced and underestimated natural climate variability is much more at play here.
The abstract for this important paper follows:
What caused the recent “Warm Arctic, Cold Continents” trend pattern in winter temperatures?
The emergence of rapid Arctic warming in recent decades has coincided with unusually cold winters over Northern Hemisphere continents. It has been speculated that this “Warm Arctic, Cold Continents” trend pattern is due to sea ice loss. Here we use multiple models to examine whether such a pattern is indeed forced by sea ice loss specifically and by anthropogenic forcing in general. While we show much of Arctic amplification in surface warming to result from sea ice loss, we find that neither sea ice loss nor anthropogenic forcing overall yield trends toward colder continental temperatures. An alternate explanation of the cooling is that it represents a strong articulation of internal atmospheric variability, evidence for which is derived from model data, and physical considerations. Sea ice loss impact on weather variability over the high-latitude continents is found, however, to be characterized by reduced daily temperature variability and fewer cold extremes.
This is a nice example of how we should not immediately believe everything our experts say and why critique and skepticism are completely justified.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal sea ice stable for 38 years
By Kenneth Richard
Everyone knows that climate change is normal occurs naturally, at times rapidly, and that there is really nothing we can do about it. Amazingly, with some climate aspects, there has not been any change in about 40 years.
According to NSIDC sea ice trend data, from 1979 to 2006, the sea ice losses for the Arctic (purple trend line in graph below) were effectively counterbalanced by the sea ice gains in the Antarctic (green trend line), producing a conspicuously flat trend line in global sea ice.

Global sea ice has remained unchanged over the past 38 years, as measured by satellite. Source: woodfortrees.com here.

From 2006 to 2016, global sea ice trends have also been remarkably stable despite a massive increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions during this period. In fact, the sea ice gains in Antarctica have perhaps modestly superseded the losses in the Arctic, resulting in a very slight increasing overall trend in global-scale sea ice during the last 10 years:

Overall trend surprisingly shows slight increase. Source. woodfortrees.com here.
In 1979, global atmospheric CO2 was measured at 337 ppm. In 2016, global atmospheric CO2 has exceeded 400 ppm.
For both hemispheres combined, then, the addition of about 65 ppm of atmospheric CO2 concentration since 1979 has apparently had no overall effect on global-scale sea ice trends.

"The majority of YouTube videos about the climate crisis oppose the scientific consensus and “hijack” technical terms to make them appear credible, a new study has found. Researchers have warned that users searching the video site to learn about climate science may be exposed to content that goes against mainstream scientific belief. Dr Joachim Allgaier of RWTH Aachen University in Germany analysed 200 YouTube videos to see if they adhered to or challenged the scientific consensus. To do so, he chose 10 search terms: Chemtrails Climate Climate change Climate engineering Climate hacking Climate manipulation Climate modification Climate science Geoengineering Global warming The videos were then assessed to judge how closely they adhered to the scientific consensus, as represented by the findings of reports by UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 2013 onwards. These concluded that humans have been the “dominant cause” of global warming since the 1950s. However, Allgaier found that the message of 120 of the top 200 search results went against this view. To avoid personalised results, Allgaier used the anonymisation tool Tor, which hides a computer’s IP address and means YouTube treats each search as coming from a different user. The results for the search terms climate, climate change, climate science and global warming mostly reflected the scientific consensus view. Allgaier said this was because many contained excerpts from TV news programmes or documentaries. The same could not be said for the results of searches related to chemtrails, climate engineering, climate hacking, climate manipulation, climate modification and geoengineering. Very few of these videos explained the scientific rationale behind their ideas, Allgaier said. Most of these videos also supported the chemtrail conspiracy theory, which claims toxic substances are sprayed on to members of the public from the condensation trails from aircraft to modify the weather, control our brains, for biological or chemical warfare, or other sinister reasons.  Allgaier noted, however, that although chemtrails videos received a lot of views, it does not mean the people watching them believed what they were told. He said it was important to examine the algorithms that decide which videos to show people, but did not suggest YouTube should remove climate denial material. “Effectively, this would be censorship, and YouTube says they are against censorship,” Allgaier said. “Perhaps they could change their algorithms to prioritise factual information, especially for health and medicine.” A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow our community guidelines. “Over the last year we’ve worked to better surface credible news sources across our site for people searching for news-related topics, begun reducing recommendations of borderline content and videos that could misinform users in harmful ways, and introduced information panels to help give users more sources where they can fact-check information for themselves.” Allgaier suggested more scientists should start taking YouTube seriously as a platform for sharing information. “YouTube has an enormous reach as an information channel, and some of the popular science YouTubers are doing an excellent job at communicating complex subjects and reaching new audiences,” he said. “Scientists could form alliances with science communicators, politicians and those in popular culture in order to reach out to the widest possible audience. They should speak out publicly about their research and be transparent in order to keep established trustful relationships with citizens and society.” The research was published in the journal Frontiers in Communication."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned sea level expert and geoscience professor Nils-Axel Mörner recently published a paper in the Journal of Religious Studies, Buddhism and Living titled: “The New Religion of Global Warming and its Misconception in Science“.

Obviously the retired professor from Sweden believes that today’s climate science is best discussed in a forum reserved for faith a religion.
Exaggerated by a factor of three
As the pictured cover abstract above shows, Mörner concludes that AGW is a “new religion” built on “false premises” and that it violates physical laws. He adds that “the calculated temperature changes from 102 climate models lie above measured values by a factor of three“.
Few scientists have published as much on the subjects of sea level rise, paleo-geophysics and geodynamics as Nils-Axel Mörner has. He is also a co-founder of the Prague-based Independent Committee on Geoethics.
AGW “an illusion”
In a recent article Mörner also called CO2-driven global warming “an illusion” and that scientists “who insist that present climate changes are the function of CO2-driven global warming” place themselves in the “shameful box of anti-science“.

Tax evasion investigation clouds Vestas’s horizon. Image: Vestas
German online SHZ daily here reports that Danish wind energy giant Vestas saw its Hamburg and Husum, Germany, offices raided by German tax authorities earlier this year amid suspicions of tax evasion. Vestas executives deny any wrongdoing and said in a statement that they are cooperating with German authorities.
According to the SHZ, the raids of the German head offices took place on February 9th and involved cases over the time period of 2006 to 2011. Vestas German headquarters in Husum employ 2000 employees. The SHZ writes:
The case is connected to an earlier one involving former Vestas former directors who were accused of bribery in Germany. Over the past years Vestas has replaced almost the entire company management, and for this reason Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen sees little danger for the company’s image.”
Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal here reports that the SEC is investigating solar energy giant SunEdison’s “financial disclosures to investors about how much cash the solar-power company had on hand as its stock price collapsed last year.” The Journal writes:
Officials in the SEC’s enforcement unit are looking into whether SunEdison overstated its liquidity last fall when it told investors it had more than $1 billion in cash, the people said.”
SunEdison shares have collapsed since last summer, with shares down 96% from a July high. “The company’s market value has fallen to around $400 million from nearly $10 billion in July.”
These are just the latest examples of the woes dogging the world’s renewable energy companies. With so many in trouble, it’s hard to see any future for the branch.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat’s going on in Europe this summer?
It seems this summer is getting regularly punctuated by fall-like or even winterlike weather.
Snow is once again in the forecast – during the hottest time of the year!

Wintry conditions forecast for some parts of the Alps next week. Photo: NTZ (not Alps region, for illustrative proposes only).
A couple of weeks ago (mid July!) I reported here how snow had fallen down to elevations of 1600 meters – a “rare event” according to meteorologists, stunning Europeans.
Well, the white stuff may be back! Today meteorologist Dominik Jung here writes that once again snow is expected to fall in the Alps region, possibly even down to elevations under 2000 meters.

Of course caution needs to be exercised here, as this forecast is some days out, and so there’s uncertainty in it.
But the fact that the models could show this happening during the hottest time of the year is already impressive in itself.
What follows is the press release from wetter.net:
================
Wiesbaden (wetter.net) 03 August 2016 – After a few nice days starting Sunday, things could get drastically worse next week. Polar air could even deliver snow to the Alps.
It’s scary what the weather model is calculating for the next 10 – 14 days. After a few nice days with warmth this coming weekend and on Monday and Tuesday, afterwards things could really be falling through the floor! Already yesterday and today many clouds and continuous rain have been the rule. We are a long way from peak summer, even though we are right in the middle of the dog days – the hottest time of the year! Today one year ago in Germany were highs of near 35°C in the shade. Today in some places will not even see 20°C.
On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday there could be a small peak summer event, after that it appears there is going to be a crash over the days that follow. Temperatures will drop considerably. From Northern Europe cold polar air will sweep down to Germany. In January this would bring a peak winter weather pattern. For the current time of the year it is simply going to be cool, wet and overall autumn-like. In may be wintry foremost in the Alps.
After the middle of next week the snowfall elevation could drop at times below 2000 meters. Whoever thought this summer could not be worse, August is poised to show us otherwise.”

"The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has written to all heads of state asking countries to outline their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, but at this stage the Australian government is only engaging on commitments to 2030. Ahead of a climate action summit in New York on 23 September, Guterres has reportedly asked leaders to flag plans they will set next year for 2030 emissions reduction commitments, and their plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesman for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, says Australia will respond formally to the UN chief in due course, but when asked by Guardian Australia what commitments would be outlined, only addressed the 2030 target. The spokesman said the Morrison government recognised “the serious challenge climate change presents, which is why Australia’s 2030 target is one of the strongest efforts among G20 countries”. “The government has beaten Australia’s 2020 targets by 367 million tonnes and has already clearly outlined Australia’s plan to meet our 2030 target which will cut the emissions intensity of our economy by two thirds and reduce our emissions per person by half,” Morrison’s spokesman said. Ahead of a climate meeting in Bonn in June, the Morrison government was challenged by the European Union and by China about whether it can meet its Paris commitments given the trend of rising emissions evident since the repeal of the carbon price, including increased pollution from vehicles. The EU pointed out “on the basis of reported projections with existing policies and measures” Australia did not appear to be on track to meet the Paris commitment. It asked whether Australia would need further policies to meet the commitment, given the current trends. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In their responses, Australian government officials defended Australia’s policies, but in defending the status quo, officials also restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. “This approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes,” Australian officials said in June. Under that process, Australia needs to submit a new pollution reduction goal for post-2030 as part of the “review, refine and ratchet” mechanism under the Paris agreement. The EU and Canada ahead of the June talks in Bonn also queried the Coalition’s decision to use carry-over credits from the Kyoto Protocol in the carbon budget it outlined before the May election. The Coalition is counting a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet Australia’s 2030 target. Australia’s carbon budget also factors in emissions reduction from the Snowy Hydro expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy that the government has not yet unveiled; pollution reduction from the rebadged emissions reduction fund and just under 100Mt of abatement from “technology solutions” which aren’t specified and “other sources of abatement” such as projects under development but not yet contracted. The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, has found himself under pressure post election for presiding over a clear trend of emissions increases. During the last parliamentary sitting week, Taylor was asked repeatedly whether emissions had risen in recent years, not fallen, with official data showing increases for the past three years. The minister for emissions reduction argued pollution went “up and down” but he acknowledged emissions had risen, arguing the trend was attributable to booming liquefied natural gas exports, which he claimed helped lower global emissions. In sharing that rationale, which experts have contested, Taylor did not mention Australia’s coal exports, which increase global pollution."
"James Lovelock, the scientist and writer, is 100 years old on Friday and remains a combination of environmental Cassandra and Old Testament prophet. Unlike them, though, he changes his mind about what the future holds. Foolish consistency, Emerson wrote, is the hobgoblin of little minds, and Dr Lovelock’s mind is not little. More than 10 years before the record high July temperatures, Dr Lovelock flatly told the Guardian that 80% of human life on Earth would perish by 2100 because of the climate emergency. He imagined a dystopian end of humanity where “the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable” by the end of the 21st century. As a scientist (his first letter to Nature was published in 1945, on the subject of writing on petri dishes), Dr Lovelock’s life has been studded with insight. He invented an electron capture detector that could pick up minute traces of pollutants – such as the pesticides that spurred Rachel Carson to write the 1962 book Silent Spring. At home he built instruments that ended up on Mars, helping Nasa to establish that the red planet was lifeless.  Dr Lovelock’s imagination has not narrowed, but his vision has become bleaker with time. His new book Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence proposes that the 300,000-year Anthropocene era of Earth’s human domination is ending. Novacene is a new age where our species is doomed to a worse fate than clinging on for dear life at the north pole as previously imagined. Instead we will become lackeys of cyborgs able to think 10,000 times faster than humans. We will be kept on to ensure there are habitable temperatures for these superior intelligences. Novacene’s thesis is a straight-line extrapolation of Dr Lovelock’s breakthrough idea which he began to develop while a consultant at Nasa in the 1970s; the thought that the planet was a superorganism. In 1974, he and biologist Lynn Margulis proposed the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is in some way alive. The paper suggested our planet metabolises and responds to changes in its environment to survive. In bestselling books such as The Revenge of Gaia, Dr Lovelock argued that humans have exploited Earth and the “old lady” would eliminate us unless we treated her with greater reverence. That is why the Novacene will start, he now reasons: because a superintelligence will recognise that all living tissue will be consumed by climate crisis and will act with Gaia to keep the life going. When it came out, the Gaia theory immediately chimed with the incipient green movement. Tough-minded scientists, though, initially reacted as if – as one critic put it – Dr Lovelock had let off a bad smell at the vicar’s tea party. Its appeal, they wrongly sneered, was to devotees of faith-healing and mysticism. But Dr Lovelock has stuck to his guns and refused to be co-opted by environmentalism. He backs nuclear power and has zigzagged on global heating, saying that some alarmist books – including his own – had made unwarranted predictions. He even told the Guardian: “We’ve got to really make it clear to those very silly people who think we can save the planet to cease and desist.” And what of the Gaia hypothesis? Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould described it as “a metaphor not a mechanism”. Its truth is poetic not literal. That echoes how Dr Lovelock sees himself. “I’m a romantic,” he said once. “I’m much more of a poet by nature than anything else.” He might be best seen then as a 21st-century William Blake – one whose words are no more testable than verse, but no less valuable for that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s ridiculous enough politicians are blaming the refugee crises on man-made climate change, even though everyone knows they are really caused by foreign policy ineptitude and debacles.
But now climate change hysteria has taken on new, more extreme witch-hunting dimensions that are on par with, if not even surpassing, those of the Dark Ages – a time when bad weather and crop failures were blamed on sorcerers, devils and witchcraft. The very same lunacy is happening today. But this time the responsible witchcraft is even on the other side of the planet!
NTV German public television here reports (and does so seriously) on a Peruvian farmer who is currently suing Europe’s largest power company, RWE, for its emissions 10,000 kilometers away in Germany – claiming that these emissions have caused the nearby Andes glaciers to melt through green-house gas induced climate change.
It is reported that the melting glacier has caused a nearby lake to expand, and it now threatens to burst its dam and flood the town where the farmer lives. NTV reports:
Small Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya is suing Germany energy corporation RWE for 20,000 euros in compensatory damages because of hazards arising from the melting of Andes glaciers.”
The farmer says that the dam needs to be upgraded, and RWE should pay its share of the cost.
Normal people of course realize this is nothing but a rigged enviro-publicity stunt that is designed to look like serious news by the German sensationalist media. This stunt of course likely will hurt the climate movement more than it will help because it is in fact so far-fetched that it is serving to vividly demonstrate just how far out of control the climate activism and hysteria have gotten.

According to environmental group Germanwatch, which helped organize the lawsuit filed in Essen, Germany, the farmer fears a flood from the nearby rapidly melting glaciers, claiming that because RWE is “Europe’s largest coal-fired CO2 emitter”, it must be held accountable for the damage to the glaciers from its emissions, and the hazard posed to local property.
This story is actually being presented (abused) by the German media as a legitimate grievance.
So how can a farmer in Peru claim that a power company some 10,000 kilometers away is responsible for nature not behaving the way he would like it to? After all, when compared to the global total emissions, RWE’s coal-fired emissions are puny. Firstly the suit was arranged at least in part by German environmental activist group Germanwatch, who is likely using it to get attention-grabbing headlines. Here the farmer is cynically being used as a publicity-stunt pawn.
Concerning the basis underpinning the claim itself, Germanwatch cites the IPCC, claiming that climate change is causing the glacier to melt and overfeeding the lake which lies just a few kilometers uphill from the town. The dam holding back the water risks breaking. It wouldn’t be so had RWE not emitted CO2, the suit appears to claim.
NTV writes that because RWE is Europe’s largest CO2 emitter, “the company should contribute to the financing of the protection measures against the growing glacier lake located above the town and correspond to the company’s share on the cause of climate change.”
Gee, now that I think about it, my last vacation was ruined by lousy weather. Shouldn’t it be possible for me to get fossil-fuel power companies to compensate for the damage I had to endure. Also the weather for my wife’s last outdoor birthday party was ruined by rain last June.
Yes, the neurotically hysterical witch-hunting days of the Dark Ages are back. The bonfires are being lit.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe FDP Free Democrat party in the state of Hesse (central Germany) writes in a press release how local utilities and communities are suing wind park development company JUWI, accusing it of “making unrealistic promises” regarding wind energy projects, and calls them “highly speculative business with enormous risks for public budgets“.
Over the years German local utilities and communities have invested tens of millions of euros in local wind parks with the hopes of seeing a ruddy return on investment and making a noble contribution to climate protection at the same time. That dream, it is turning out, has shattered.
The FDP press release in English:
Millions in losses with wind power projects
WIESBADEN – Once again wind projects are producing negative headlines. In the spotlight is “wind energy pioneer” JUWI, which is one of the largest project developers in Hesse. With the Pfalz City Utility and the City Utility of Mainz, two large community electric utilities are suing currently JUWI because the wind prognoses made never came materialized, and thus the returns fell way below the planned budget. Instead of posting profits after more than ten years in operation, community company “Pfalzwind GmbH“ has seen double-digit millions in losses. Pfalzwind operates more than 60 turbines.

‘We see the same result in Hesse as well. Everywhere communities, utilities and energy co-ops were lured by large profits, but in the end most wound up with losses that the citizens will have to cope with. Not only are they stuck with damage to the environment and the landscape, but now they also have a financial disaster to cope with,’ says René Rock, energy policy speaker of the FDP faction in the Hesse state parliament.
Rock adds:
‘The lawsuits by the community utilities once again show that promises made by the wind industry are unrealistic. And due to the falling feed-in rates, the economic prospects are worsening in addition. Also large utilities in Hesse, such as Mainova AG in Frankfurt, are losing money with their stakes in wind parks.
Currently alone in Hesse some 470 wind turbines are in the permitting process. Instead of blindly trusting the promises made by project developers, planned wind power projects involving investment by communities should be halted based on economic sense. In truth wind parks are highly speculative businesses with enormous risks for public budgets.'”
And never mind the industrial blight and environmental destruction they are causing to Germany’s once idyllic landscape, and the threat to human health and wildlife.

"Greta Thunberg is to sail across the Atlantic in a high-speed racing yacht next month to attend UN climate summits in the US and Chile as part of a sabbatical year the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist will spend in the US. “Good news! I’ll be joining the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, COP25 in Santiago … I’ve been offered a ride on the 60ft racing boat Malizia II. We’ll be sailing across the Atlantic Ocean from the UK to NYC in mid August,” Greta tweeted. The journey will take two weeks. The campaigner, whose solo protest last year sparked the Fridays for Future global school climate strike movement, said in June she would be taking a year off school to attend the summits, on 23 September in New York and 2-13 December in Santiago, which she described as “pretty much where our future will be decided”. But she said she did not yet know how she was going to get there. “It’s on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,” she said. “And there are no trains going there. And since I don’t fly, because of the enormous climate impact of aviation, it’s going to be a challenge.” In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. Owned by a German property developer, Gerhard Senft, based in Brittany and sponsored by the Yacht Club de Monaco, the 18-metre (60ft) yacht is a high-speed planing monohull built for the 2016-17 single-handed, non-stop round-the-world Vendée Globe race. The club said on its Facebook page it was “honoured to be able to sail Greta Thunberg emission-free over the Atlantic”. The yacht is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate zero-carbon electricity. Greta will be accompanied on the voyage by Malizia II’s skipper Boris Hermann, her father Svante, Pierre Casiraghi, the grandson of Monaco’s late Prince Rainier III and the actor Grace Kelly, and a film-maker. Greta told the Associated Press before the announcement that she had not wanted to travel to the US by cruise ship because of their notoriously high emissions, while the Atlantic could be dangerous for sailing boats in August because of the high risk of hurricanes. “Taking a boat to North America is basically impossible,” she said. “I have had countless people helping me, trying to contact different boats.” In a joint Guardian interview with the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June, Greta said of her planned visit to the UN climate summit: “I don’t fly for climate reasons so it’s not 100% yet, but we are figuring it out. It’s very hard, but I think it should be possible.” Referring to her congressional district, Ocasio-Cortez said: “If you land in New York, we will give you a Queens welcome!” After New York, where she will take part in several meetings and protests, Greta aims to travel by train and bus to the annual UN climate conference in Chile with stops in Canada, Mexico and other countries. The activist, the daughter of an actor and an opera singer, has spoken to policymakers at last year’s UN climate conference in Poland, to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and politicians including the French and British parliaments. She has also met Pope Francis. Greta, who has encountered fierce criticism from climate deniers and some politicians, told AP she was not sure how her message would go down in the US, where Donald Trump leads broad opposition to the radical measures scientists say are required to limit global warming. She said meeting the US president would probably be “just a waste of time”, adding: “I have nothing to say to him. He obviously doesn’t listen to the science and the scientists. So why should I, a child with no proper education, be able to convince him?” This weekend, British Vogue said that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, would be guest editor of its September issue and had chosen Greta as one of 15 women it described as the “trailblazing changemakers” who would feature on the cover."
"Unilever has warned it will sell off brands that do not contribute positively to society, with British favourite Marmite and Magnum ice-cream among the big names thought to be vulnerable to a cull linked to the company’s sustainable business agenda. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, said it was no longer enough for consumer goods companies to sell washing powders that make shirts whiter or shampoos that make hair shinier because consumers wanted to buy brands that have a “purpose” too.  Unilever has tasked its marketers with devising sustainable business plans for its portfolio of more than 400 brands, with Marmite, Magnum and Pot Noodle thought to be among the businesses that will need to find a raison d’être if they are to remain part of the group in the long term. “Can these brands figure out how to make society or the planet better in a way that lasts for decades?” said Jope, outlining the company’s thinking. Unilever is not working to a set timetable but Jope, who took over from Paul Polman in January, said it was possible that a brand or even whole product category “is not going to be able to find its purpose”. His comments raised the possibility of the company selling off profitable brands, potentially hurting the bottom line, but Jope said: “Principles are only principles if they cost you something.” Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of the business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals, which include increasing the positive impact it has on communities. Unilever is also looking at ways to respond to shoppers’ concerns about single-use plastic, with the launch of Cif refills (so spray bottles can be reused) and wrapper-less multipacks for its Solero ice-cream lollies. Jope said its sales data had not detected a change in shopper behaviour yet but there was evidence of attitudes changing amid a heightened debate about the environment. Jope’s comments came as Unilever updated investors on its performance in the first six months of 2019. Operating profits were up slightly at €4.6bn (£4.1bn) that fell short of analyst expectations of €5bn. The 3.5% increase in underlying sales for the second quarter was slightly weaker than expected. Although many parts of Europe are experiencing record temperatures, the company said the cool start to the summer season had hit demand for its ice-cream brands, which also include Cornetto. The shares closed down 2% at £48.96. Steve Clayton, the manager of HL Select funds which holds a position in Unilever, said: “Unilever themselves describe their markets as mixed, and most investors will look at these numbers as something of a curate’s egg.”"
"The Trump administration’s hostility towards climate science is not new. Interior climate staffer Joel Clement’s reassignment and the blocking of intelligence aide Rod Schoonover’s climate testimony, which forced both federal employees to resign in protest, are just two of the innumerable examples. These attempts to suppress climate science can manifest themselves in many ways. It starts with burying important climate reports and becomes something more insidious like stopping climate scientists from doing their jobs. In February 2019, I lost my job because I was a climate scientist in a climate-denying administration. And yet my story is no longer unique.  This is why on 22 July I filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration. But this is not the only part to my story; I will also speak to Congress on 25 July about my treatment and the need for stronger scientific integrity protections. I have worked at the National Park Service (NPS) for a total of eight years. I started out as an intern during the Bush administration, where I experienced nothing like this. I returned in 2012 after earning my PhD, when the NPS funded a project I designed to provide future sea level and storm surge estimates for 118 coastal parks under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This kind of information is crucial in order for the NPS to adequately protect coastal parks against the future effects of the climate crisis. I handed in the first draft of my scientific report in the summer of 2016 and, after the standard rigorous scientific peer review process, it was ready for release in early 2017. But once the new administration came into power, publication was repeatedly delayed, with increasingly vague explanations from my supervisors. So for months, I waited. And waited. I was still waiting when I went on maternity leave almost a year later in December 2017. It was while I was on leave that I received an email from another climate scientist at the NPS who warned me that the senior leadership was ordering changes to my report without my knowledge. They had scrubbed of any mention of the human causes of the climate crisis. This was not normal editorial adjustment. This was climate science denial. A months-long battle ensued. Senior NPS officials tried repeatedly, often aggressively, to coerce me into deleting references to the human causes of the climate crisis from the report. They threatened to make the deletions without my approval if I would not agree, to release the report without naming me as the primary author, or not release it all. Each option would have been devastating to my career and for scientific integrity. I stood firm. And I prevailed. Media inquiries and open records requests about my report eventually led to letters from members of Congress, and the NPS was essentially forced to publish my report as I had written it. The NPS continued to retaliate against me. I was forced to accept pay cuts and demotions while I continued to lead several other projects. By February of this year, the NPS declined to renew my funding, despite common knowledge that my branch at the time had ample surplus funding. When I received this news, my immediate supervisors, who wished for me to stay, asked me to apply to be a volunteer so that I could continue my work. My volunteer application was denied without explanation. If there was any question about whether my termination had to do with legitimate budget constraints or with punishing me for not altering my report to suit the Trump administration’s agenda, that answered it. Politics has no place in science. I am an example of the less discussed methods the administration is using to destroy scientific research. I wasn’t fired and immediately told to leave; instead they sought retribution by discretely using governmental bureaucracy to apply pressure and gradually cut funding. I have been cut off from projects that I created and was working on, including one that would have provided the public with a valuable interactive way to see for themselves how sea level rise will impact our parks. This is why we need to support stronger protections for scientists. Ultimately it will be the taxpayers who will pay the true price for our apathy towards these violations. It will become progressively costlier to alter our infrastructure to accommodate the incoming tides. And we will watch as our historic structures are swallowed by the sea. As these things are happening, remember that there were probably multiple scientists like me who warned of these dangers but were silenced. The current administration may only last a matter of years, but its actions may potentially impact our planet for centuries.

"I am an ordinary mid-career professional. I work a nine-to-five job in the city, and I’m well respected and growing in my career. I have never broken the law. And recently, I joined Extinction Rebellion, blockading traffic. I have never done anything like this before. It was way out of my comfort zone, and I felt like vomiting at the idea. But climate change makes me want to vomit even more. I am a scientist, and I can say with confidence: the science is absolutely terrifying. So I went.  Here’s my reflections on the experience: I found it surprisingly calm, peaceful and friendly. The heavy media and police presence was intense, but I felt safe, and I didn’t feel like I was at risk of being arrested at any point. I just followed clear instructions from organisers and the police. Those who were arrested chose to be arrested, and even that was very calm. I’d genuinely feel safe bringing a child, just like to any other peaceful rally. Also, it was fun! There was lots of chanting, and it felt positive and upbeat. I’m really glad I had courage and went, despite feeling so nervous. I don’t intend to get arrested, but there are a hundred other ways to support and contribute, and I intend to do them. Until recently, I thought that these sorts of tactics are ridiculous and just irritate people and lead to more divisiveness. I thought blocking traffic was no way to develop consensus and get things done. But then I saw the news on Extinction Rebellion blockading London for more than a week, with more than 1,000 arrests. Soon after, the UK government adopted a climate emergency resolution.  I started reading about Extinction Rebellion. I found out that it’s been carefully and deliberately constructed, drawing upon the best research on how to create massive social change, of the kind we need to address the climate emergency. I found out that the suffragettes got women the vote by smashing windows and chaining themselves to railings, facing hate and ridicule in the media. And how Martin Luther King combated racial inequality by rallying people to violate laws and provoke mass arrests, and was arrested 29 times. And this was deliberate, carefully orchestrated and inspired by the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. I learned how the research shows nonviolent civil disobedience can bring rapid and sweeping changes, and that we’ve never seen an example fail once 3.5% of the population becomes actively involved. I started to hope. Let me tell you a story. Many of us already know the climate catastrophe story, so let me tell you a different one. Right now, we are sleepwalking. We go about our daily lives assuming that buying a house and putting money in our superannuation are appropriate ways to plan for the future. If we hear about the climate crisis, we tell ourselves, surely it can’t be that urgent if no one is doing anything? We need to wake people up, fast. This requires massive, sustained media attention. Disruption is very effective at creating this, especially by blockading major urban centres. The aim is to make people pay attention, and they’re much more likely to do so when it impacts their daily lives. If there are arrests, that’s great too, because that’s also newsworthy. Most people will hate the disruption tactics, and get irritated or angry. They’ll ridicule the people involved and say negative things in the media. A small percentage will join the movement. It’s OK that this is only a small percentage. Remember that we only need 3.5% of people to get active. We do, however, need most people to be sympathetic.  People start by discussing tactics (with lots of hate), but then move on to the issue (“but we really should be doing something about climate, it’s actually quite scary”). More people start to realise that this is an actual emergency. Proper debate starts happening, and people are talking about it everywhere. As more people wake up, more of them join the protests. And there’s safety in numbers, so as it gets bigger, more people feel they can join. Politicians can no longer ignore the issue. More and more people are getting arrested for nonviolent and relatively harmless activities, and they have growing public support for their sentiments. Grandfathers are glueing themselves to roads because they want a safe future for their grandchildren. Economic activity is suffering from longer blockades, and businesses are demanding that the government does something. Politicians are forced to address the issue. And now, we finally start working together in collaboration with other countries. People all around the world have been inspired to rebellion. I have no idea if this story will ever happen but I think there’s a chance. It depends entirely on how many of us get on board. It’s uncomfortable to disrupt people’s lives, but the courageous folks doing it are putting themselves on the line to save us all. I still benefit from the sacrifices of those suffragettes and all the others who’ve fought so hard, at great personal cost. Now it’s my turn. • The author of this article is a scientist living in Australia"

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists: Warming causes Antarctic ice sheet growth, and lower sea levels
By Kenneth Richard
While many scientists are projecting rapid sea level rise as a result of a warmer Antarctica and consequent ice sheet melting, other scientists are projecting that the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet will gain in mass because a warmer Antarctica means snow and ice accumulation will outpace the melting.

Antarctica ice mass growing. Photo: NASA-JPL, public domain.
For example, Jan Lenaerts and 4 other scientists recently published a paper in the journal Climate Dynamics that projects (via modelling) the Antarctic ice sheet will show a net gain of about 70 billion tons of ice per year for every degree of warming induced by anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Below are the highlighted portions of the Lenaerts et al. (2016) paper.
We present climate and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) as simulated by the global, coupled ocean–atmosphere–land Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a horizontal resolution of ∼1∘ in the past, present and future (1850–2100). CESM correctly simulates present-day Antarctic sea ice extent, large-scale atmospheric circulation and near-surface climate, but fails to simulate the recent expansion of Antarctic sea ice. The present-day Antarctic ice sheet SMB equals 2280±131 Gtyear−1, which concurs with existing independent estimates of AIS SMB. When forced by two CMIP5 climate change scenarios (high mitigation scenario RCP2.6 and high-emission scenario RCP8.5), CESM projects an increase of Antarctic ice sheet SMB of about 70 Gtyear−1 per degree warming. This increase is driven by enhanced snowfall, which is partially counteracted by more surface melt and runoff along the ice sheet’s edges. This intensifying hydrological cycle is predominantly driven by atmospheric warming, which increases (1) the moisture-carrying capacity of the atmosphere, (2) oceanic source region evaporation, and (3) summer AIS cloud liquid water content.”
This warming-causes-ice-sheet-growth-and-sea-levels-to-decline conceptualization is not new. Back in the mid-1980s, when the Greenland ice sheet was still in a cooling phase, Dr. R.K. Klige (USSR Academy of Sciences), concluded that a future rise in temperatures would cause a positive mass balance for both Greenland and Antarctica and “ultimately a lowering of sea level” due to the “increased accumulation on the major ice sheets.” Here is the abstract with key points of emphasis from Klige, 1985.
The author attempts to quantify the amount of water released (by various means) by the world’s glaciers, and to determine the variations in these figures provoked by the warming trend which was observed for the first half of this century, and the cooling trend observed in the 1960s and 1970s. Unfortunately Antarctica has generally had to be excluded from these calculations since data on a number of components of the water balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are simply not available. Perhaps most significant are the author’s predictions that the anticipated future rise in air temperatures will provoke increased precipitation and hence increased accumulation on the major ice sheets. Even despite increased melting in coastal areas of Greenland and Antarctica the net effect will be a positive mass balance and ultimately a lowering of sea level.”
Observations defy the models
Not only is the Antarctic ice sheet growing in mass and lowering sea levels in modelled projections, it is doing so in observational studies. According to NASA and Zwally et al. (2015), during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century (1992-2008), the gains in ice accumulation in East Antarctica outstripped the losses in West Antarctica, leading to a net gain of about 100 billion tons of ice per year on the Antarctic ice sheet during this period.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




During the last 6 years of the study, the net gain in ice removed -0.23 mm per year from sea levels. The total sea level lowering equivalent was -0.28 mm per year when including the 1992-2001 rates of net ice gain for Antarctica. It should be pointed out that, unlike Lenaert  et al. (2016), Dr. Zwally (and co-authors) prefer to believe in different models that say future warming on the Antarctic continent will produce a net ice sheet loss rather than an ice sheet mass gain. Below are excerpts  from NASA’s press release for the paper.
According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. […] Zwally’s team calculated that the mass gain from the thickening of East Antarctica remained steady from 1992 to 2008 at 200 billion tons per year, while the ice losses from the coastal regions of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula increased by 65 billion tons per year. […] ‘The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,’ Zwally said.”
But it might only take a few decades for Antarctica’s growth to reverse, according to Zwally. ‘If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years — I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.'”
Settled science?
So, according to scientists and climate modelling, we have good news from Antarctica. Warming from a rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions causes the Antarctic ice sheet to grow, and this lowers sea levels. In the future, we can expect that more warming due to human activity will cause more ice sheet growth and a further reduction in the Antarctic contribution to sea levels.
And if those models are not preferred, one can believe in the models that say warming from a rise in anthropogenic CO2 causes the Antarctic ice sheet to melt, and this, in turn, will cause sea levels to rise.
Unfortunately, the RSS satellite temperature dataset indicates that Antarctica and the South Polar region has not warmed in the satellite era, but has instead cooled slightly in the last 3 and a half decades.
Therefore, it appears we will have to patiently wait for Antarctica to actually warm due to the increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
If Antarctica does warm in the future, perhaps then we can see which of these projections  — (a) anthropogenic CO2 warming causes ice sheet net growth or (b) anthropogenic CO2 warming causes ice sheet net decline — become settled science.

Spring has definitely arrived late this year. Fortunately that is about to change as warm temperatures are forecast for upcoming long holiday weekend.
Germany’s DWD national weather service has published the preliminary weather results for Germany for the month of April 2016. Data recorded by its approximately 2000 weather stations placed across the country show that the month was 0.3°C cooler than the 1981 – 2010 long-term meteorological mean.
The month started on the warm side, but the second half deteriorated as air Arctic plunged across the country, delivering unexpected late April snows and frosty .conditions.
Yesterday, May 1st, even saw half a meter of fresh snow at the Northern Italian Prali Ski Area!

The bitter cold has hit southern Germany’s winemakers hard, so reports the online SWR here:
The cold nights of the past week have damaged the blossoms of the vineyeards across vast areas of Rhineland Palatinate. In unfavorable areas massive losses are feared.”
Precipitation for April 2016, the DWD reports, was exactly normal with 58 liters of precipitation falling per square meter. All in all April was an entirely a normal one with no sign of any climate change. If anything, it was right colder than it is supposed to be.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service has released the preliminary mean temperature for the country for January, 2016.
The data show the month was 1.2°C above the long-term mean.
So far the European winter has been a mild one – thanks to a persistent mild weather pattern that has brought warm and moist Atlantic air over the continent most of the time since early November. That pattern led to December 2015 setting an all-time record for the month for Germany. In January the westerly pattern go interrupted twice by polar air.
Overall the DWD remains silent on the overall trend. The January mean temperature trend continues downward. It’s not warming; it is cooling as the chart prepared by Josef Kowatsch shows:

The chart shows the temperature anomaly from the long-term mean since 1988.
And despite the current massive El Nino, meteorologist Joe Bastardi shows at his weekly Saturday Summary that globally January temperatures failed to set a new record, according to what Joe calls the gold standard for measuring global temperature, NCEP. The month so far is coming in at 0.556°C above the mean.

Warm, but not the warmest. January 2016Source: here:
What’s more, Tony Heller at Real Science here shows us that NASA has been busy rewriting history by adjusting past temperatures data. Back in the 1970s, NASA data were showing a rapid cooling since the 1940s. Over the past years NASA has been busily rewriting the data, and consequently the mid 20th century cooling has disappeared, á la George Orwell.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPaul Dorian of the excellent weather science site Vencore Weather here brings us up to date on the latest on one of the most powerful natural cycles driving our North Atlantic climate: North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) cycles.
Here I’ll sum up the main points. Of course do read the entire post at Vencore for all the details.
In a nutshell the sites writes that the North Atlantic “is now showing signs of a possible long-term shift back to colder-than-normal sea surface temperatures (SST) and this could have serious implications on US climate and sea ice areal extent in the Northern Hemisphere”.
Vencore supplies the following chart of North Atlantic heat content (0 – 700 meters deep):

Data source: National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), climate4you.com. Last period shown: October-December 2015.


The next chart Vencore provides below is one of Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) since the 1870s.
Clearly we see that huge climate driver has been cyclic and that the past 20 years have been marked by very warm SSTs.

Little wonder the North Atlantic region has been seen warmer than normal conditions over the past 2 decades.
But that warmth appears to be waning as the North Atlantic is now heading toward its cool phase. That cooling down is confirmed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).  Note how the transitions take place quickly, in a matter of just a few years.
Serious impacts on sea ice and winters
Vencore writes that the North Atlantic cooling is likely going to have some “significant impacts on Northern Hemisphere (NH) sea ice areal extent over the coming decades“, and thus could be a major blow to climate science forecasts of a melting Arctic. If the North Atlantic cooling continues, then Vencore warns we should expect Arctic sea ice to return to 1990s levels, if not even greater.
The cooling North Atlantic will also have serious ramifications for North America’s climate. Vencore reports that winters over large parts of North America are much colder during cool North Atlantic phases, and significantly warmer during the warm phases. So if these trends should continue, it means that the days of the global warming scare are numbered, or they will have to move to the other hemisphere.

"Extreme climate events such as heatwaves, floods and drought damaged 45% of the marine ecosystems along Australia’s coast in a seven-year period, CSIRO research shows. More than 8,000km of Australia’s coast was affected by extreme climate events from 2011 to 2017, and in some cases they caused irreversible changes to marine habitats.  The study collated all the published research by leading scientists, who have examined the effects of marine heatwaves, heavy rainfall from tropical storms, cyclones and droughts on coral, kelp, mangrove and seagrass communities. It paints a bigger picture of the extent to which the climate crisis is fuelling widespread change across Australia’s marine ecosystems. The study found that big climate events were exacerbating the effects of human-induced climate change. Heatwaves, for example, compounded the effects of the underlying global heating trend and left little time for organisms to adapt. “All of the people around the country working on these systems for years have done a great job of documenting the impacts and repercussions,” Russ Babcock, the study’s lead author, said. “If you stand back and have a look at how many [climate events] have happened between that period of 2011 to 2017, it really backs up that it’s not just the Great Barrier Reef that we have to think about. It’s all around the country.” The team of scientists looked at events, including the 2011 marine heatwave in Western Australia, cyclone Yasi, the back-to-back mass bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and the mangrove dieback in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 2015-16. They also examined what the longer term repercussions of these events could be, given some areas had shown little, if any, sign of recovery. “Some of our models showed it can take 15 years to recover from impacts like this,” Babcock said, noting that during that timeframe it was likely that more extreme events would occur. He cited the large areas off the Western Australia coast where kelp canopies had not recovered since the 2011 marine heatwave. Babcock said the long-term effects of such events affected other species, such as large animals that fed off sea grasses, which could lead to changes in the composition of entire marine communities. “So things that we value about those habitats – the diversity of plants and animals there and the amount of things like fisheries you can harvest from them – can be affected,” he said. “I think one of the important things is going to be to study the factors that make a difference in terms of the recovery of these habitats and therefore learn what we might be able to do to help them recover more quickly.”  Coral reef scientist Terry Hughes is one of the researchers whose work was referenced in the CSIRO study. Hughes said the paper showed how serious the outlook was for all marine systems, not just coral reefs, which typically received more public attention. “Other marine systems – kelps, seagrasses, mangroves – are just as vulnerable as reefs but they’re not the poster child,” he said. “I wasn’t surprised ... but it’s good to have the big picture and make the point that it’s a huge issue for all coastal areas of Australia. It’s not just a Barrier Reef issue.”"
"About 350m trees have been planted in a single day in Ethiopia, according to a government minister. The planting is part of a national “green legacy” initiative to grow 4bn trees in the country this summer by encouraging every citizen to plant at least 40 seedlings. Public offices have reportedly been shut down in order for civil servants to take part. The project aims to tackle the effects of deforestation and climate change in the drought-prone country. According to the UN, Ethiopia’s forest coverage was just 4% in the 2000s, down from 35% a century earlier. Ethiopia’s minister of innovation and technology, Dr Getahun Mekuria, tweeted estimates of the number of trees planted throughout the day. By early evening on Monday, he put the number at 353m. The previous world record for the most trees planted in one day stood at 50m, held by India since 2016. Dr Dan Ridley-Ellis, the head of the centre for wood science and technology at Edinburgh Napier University, said: “Trees not only help mitigate climate change by absorbing the carbon dioxide in the air, but they also have huge benefits in combating desertification and land degradation, particularly in arid countries. They also provide food, shelter, fuel, fodder, medicine, materials and protection of the water supply. “This truly impressive feat is not just the simple planting of trees, but part of a huge and complicated challenge to take account of the short- and long-term needs of both the trees and the people. The forester’s mantra ‘the right tree in the right place’ increasingly needs to consider the effects of climate change, as well as the ecological, social, cultural and economic dimension.”"
"Buckle in, Britain: it might have been late getting started, but it looks like we’re set for another sweltering summer, with record-breaking highs of 37C forecast for Thursday. By this point, you know the drill: swap the duvet for a sheet (and a shared bed for a single), wear shorts if your employer allows, carry water with you on the train, and get off at the next stop if you’re feeling unwell. The temperature will drop eventually; in the meantime, the spirit is broadly one of keep calm and carry on. We’ve been here before. Last year was marked not just by England’s rocket-fuelled run through the football World Cup, but the concurrent six-week spell from late June to mid-August, when daytime temperatures in parts of Britain consistently topped 30C (86F). Even climate deniers were perturbed. That summer was  the joint hottest on record. But then the mercury dropped, bringing with it relief – from the discomfort of the sweltering heat, yes, but also having to confront the visceral threat of climate crisis.  In Britain we are lucky. Our temperate climate has given us the option of ignorance for so long. In Australia, Asia and the Middle East, the apocalyptic vision that the Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts and I described in our piece on “the city at 50C” is already a reality. Britain is not immune. Exactly one year ago the Met Office issued a heatwave warning on the hottest day of 2018 – but for many, the arrival of autumn quite literally took the heat out of the issue. We can’t afford to let that happen again – to let it keep happening. We cannot slide into record-breaking summer after record-breaking summer, sedating ourselves with Mr Whippy ice-cream, until the crisis reaches a point where it will occur to no one to suggest a lower-tog duvet as the solution. When we talk of these ever-increasing temperatures, we tend to talk of treating the symptoms, not the cause: wear breathable fibres, freeze your water bottle, head to a beer garden. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. The trouble is – unless you are elderly or otherwise already vulnerable – it is just so easy, even enjoyable, to weather the hot temperatures. You raise your hemlines, you buy a fan, then the temperature drops and the fan goes away until next year. The problem of heat is, to a large extent, swept from view with the change of the seasons (or what passes for them these days). But – out of sight, maybe out of mind, but very much still the backdrop – the problem continues to grow. Even under the most optimistic predictions for emissions reductions – which it is almost unimaginable that we will be able to achieve – we face many more decades of intense heat. Experts say that almost half the world’s population will be exposed to potentially deadly temperatures for 20 days a year by 2100. We reckon with the flicker of this possibility every summer – nearly 700 more deaths than average were recorded in the 15-day peak of last year’s heatwave in England and Wales – yet we are still slow to act to mitigate those of the future. We continue to build housing designed to keep heat in, creating “death traps in hot weather”, and leave cooling measures to those who can afford them. We privatise precious green spaces that help to reduce the impact of heat and we build with asphalt, brick, concrete and glass, which exacerbate it. We have learned to change our behaviour in response to rising temperatures – lingering in the frozen goods aisle of the supermarket, organising our lives around air conditioning – when what urgently needs to change is the structure of society. Not now – but yesterday. Yes, tackling wider climate change by reducing emissions should be the pre-eminent priority. But – in the knowledge that heatwaves will be worse even under the (unlikely) best-case scenario – at the same time we need to be making practical, structural changes to ease the impact of prolonged periods of extreme temperatures on our systems and society. Introducing measures to protect against overheating in planning regulations would be an obvious step, as would protecting access to green spaces, if not increasing their number. An analysis today from the Office for National Statistics found that there was more concrete than greenery in the average urban residential garden, inevitably compounding the “heat island” effect. For that to happen, we need to keep heat front and centre, even when the weather is cooler; and we must recognise that it can’t be left to individuals to find ways to cope. The issue may recede with the seasons, but it is not going to go away. Look to Asia, Australia and the Middle East for a glimpse of what the future might hold – we may reflect on this period and wonder why we did not act while the sun merely shone. In the meantime, recognise this heat for the harbinger that we know it to be. Feel the sweat drip off your elbows, the heat pummel your skin. It may be uncomfortable now, but it can’t be simply endured for ever. • Elle Hunt is a commissioning editor for Guardian G2"

========================================
Collapse of the IPCC AGW theory
by Kyoji Kimoto
Dr. Syukuro Manabe was given many prizes for the discovery of greenhouse effect with Fig. 16 in Manabe & Wetherald (1967) utilizing one dimensional radiative convective equilibrium model (1DRCM) with the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5°K/km for the atmospheric CO2 of 300 ppm (1xCO2) and that of 600 ppm (2xCO2).
It gave the zero feedback climate sensitivity CS (FAH) of 1.3°K under the fixed absolute humidity for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2, which was the starting point of the modern anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory. The Manabe method was followed by Hansen et al. (1981) and Schlesinger (1986) to obtain the similar results that the CS (FAH) is 1.2-1.3°K with the radiative forcing of 4W/m2 for 2xCO2.

Fig. 16 in Manabe & Wetherald (1967)
The lapse rate of 6.5°K/km is defined for 1xCO2 in the U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1962).There is no guarantee, however, that the same lapse rate will be maintained in the perturbed atmosphere with 2xCO2 because it depends on radiation, convection, large scale dynamics and moisture etc. Therefore, the lapse rate for 2xCO2 is a parameter for which a sensitivity analysis is needed. 
From Fig.4 in Manabe & Strickler (1964), below, we can calculate the sensitivity of the surface temperature (Ts) with the variation of lapse rate (LR) in 1DRCM as follows:
Radiative equilibrium     LR=17°K/km   Ts =332°K

Thermal equilibrium      LR=10°K/km    Ts=311°K
Thermal equilibrium      LR=6.5°K/km    Ts=300°K
Sensitivity: dTs/dLR = 3°K/1(K/km) = 0.3°K/0.1(K/km)

Fig. 4 in Manabe & Strickler (1964)

As shown above, the CS (FAH) greatly changes with a minute change of the lapse rate for 2xCO2, while it varies from 4°K/km to 10°K/km generally. Therefore, the CS (FAH) of 1.2-1.3°K is theoretically meaningless in Manabe & Wetherald (1967), Hansen et al. (1981) and Schlesinger (1986), furnishing a theoretical basis to the 14 GCMs studies for the IPCC AR4 in Soden & Held (2006).
Thus, the AGW theory of the IPCC is collapsed due to the lack of parameter sensitivity analysis of the lapse rate for 2xCO2 in the 1DRCM studies with the fixed lase rate assumption of 6.5°K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2.
It is a standard procedure to check the validity of obtained results in scientific studies.
