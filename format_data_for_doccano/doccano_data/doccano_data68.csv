"For most Peruvians, this year’s floods have been the worst in living memory. Ten times the usual amount of rain has fallen on Peru’s coast, swelling rivers which caused widespread flooding, and triggering huge landslides which tore through shanty towns. More than 100 people have died, nearly 158,000 are displaced and 210,000 homes are damaged, according to Peru’s emergency operations centre. The country’s infrastructure took a big hit: 260 bridges collapsed and nearly 3,000km of roads are unusable, cutting off hundreds of villages and towns.  Peru’s rainy season falls broadly in the first quarter of every year. It is also known as “landslide season”, but few can remember huaycos, as they are known in the local Quechua language, of such intensity and scale. As Peru’s weather service reported record rains in the north of the country in March, usually dry rivers turned into raging torrents – and never have so many people lived in their path. The country is ill-prepared for seasonal floods at the best of times, let alone those of such brutality that have laid bare Peru’s patchy infrastructure, its disorderly and informal growth, and its often non-existent urban planning.  “In the midst of disaster a big opportunity has opened up for the country,” Jorge Nieto, Peru’s defence minister, told the Guardian in the flood-hit town of Huarmey. “I believe we’ve learned the hard way that this country needs a reconstruction of historic proportions.” Nieto, who has been leading recovery efforts and deploying armed forces across the country, said cities and towns lacked basic flood defences, and that the 30-odd rivers which flow from the Andes to the Pacific would need to channelled, particularly in urban areas.  As Peru lurches between drought and floods, reservoirs should also be installed in the mountains, Nieto said, so that rainwater can be stored in the water-stressed country. “That way we would guarantee our water supply so that the rains become a blessing, rather than a problem,” he added. The natural disaster, which meteorologists are calling a “coastal El Niño” has caused $3.1bn (£2.5bn) worth of damage, chipping 0.5% off the country’s projected GDP for 2017 from 3.4% to 2.9%. The reconstruction will cost around $9bn, President Kuczynski said last week. The first stage would pay for the “immediate reconstruction” of cities and towns. The second, longer phase would involve building infrastructure to make Peru a more “modern and organised” country, faced with the likelihood of more unpredictable and extreme climate events. The floods also temporarily threatened the water supply in Peru’s capital. More than 25 landslides, carrying tree trunks, dead livestock and rubble from destroyed homes clogged water treatment plants on the Rimac river, forcing the waterboard, Sedapal, to suspend the intake and treatment of water for five days. The second-biggest desert city after Cairo, Lima is more used to having too little water than too much, and the city’s water infrastructure was “insufficient” to deal with the deluge, admits Sedapal’s board director, Rudecindo Vega. “Three months ago, the government was preparing for a drought. Weeks later, we have had a quantity of rain that is exactly the opposite of a drought,” he told the Guardian. The natural disaster highlights with “brutal clarity” Lima’s insufficient water provision infrastructure just as President Kuczynski had made a commitment to provide Peruvians with 100% water coverage, 24 hours a day, by the end of his five-year term. Around 1 million Peruvians in Lima lack access to running water. “People are living in places where they shouldn’t,” Kuczysnki said last month, referring to the tens of thousands of flood victims who lived in areas hit by landslides. “We have to control the local councils so they don’t allow land trafficking in gullies and on hills. We are seeing the results,” he insisted. Around half a million people live in floodplains in Peru, according to a report by the Autoridad Nacional del Agua, Peru’s water agency. Mass migration from rural areas to cities means that people have “squatted wherever they can in marginal areas where nobody would want to live if they were not forced to by poverty,” says Ernesto Ráez, a tropical ecologist and former adviser to Peru’s environment ministry. The reconstruction of parts of Lima and other towns and cities on Peru’s coast must be “adaptive or corrective” says Ráez, and could involve the relocation of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people. Climate change will mean extreme weather is more frequent. The United Nations has also warned that Peru must invest in multi-hazard warning systems and ensure its citizens better understand the risks of such disasters. “This is a large-scale singular event which needs to be viewed in the context of a warming planet, where episodes of extreme weather variability are becoming more evident,” says Robert Glasser, the UN special representative of the secretary-general for disaster risk reduction. “If we are to succeed in preventing disasters like this, and to reduce disaster losses, then we need to ensure there is a much broader understanding of the nature of disaster risk in society. This includes better understanding of the impacts of climate change and how it alters local weather patterns.”  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"US scientists are set to send aerosol injections 20km up into the earth’s stratosphere in the world’s biggest solar geoengineering programme to date, to study the potential of a future tech-fix for global warming. The $20m (£16m) Harvard University project will launch within weeks and aims to establish whether the technology can safely simulate the atmospheric cooling effects of a volcanic eruption, if a last ditch bid to halt climate change is one day needed.  Scientists hope to complete two small-scale dispersals of first water and then calcium carbonate particles by 2022. Future tests could involve seeding the sky with aluminium oxide – or even diamonds.  “This is not the first or the only university study,” said Gernot Wagner, the project’s co-founder, “but it is most certainly the largest, and the most comprehensive.” Janos Pasztor, Ban Ki-moon’s assistant climate chief at the UN who now leads a geoengineering governance initiative, said that the Harvard scientists would only disperse minimal amounts of compounds in their tests, under strict university controls. “The real issue here is something much more challenging,” he said “What does moving experimentation from the lab into the atmosphere mean for the overall path towards eventual deployment?” Geoengineering advocates stress that any attempt at a solar tech fix is years away and should be viewed as a complement to – not a substitute for – aggressive emissions reductions action. But the Harvard team, in a promotional video for the project, suggest a redirection of one percent of current climate mitigation funds to geoengineering research, and argue that the planet could be covered with a solar shield for as little as $10bn a year. Some senior UN climate scientists view such developments with alarm, fearing a cash drain from proven mitigation technologies such as wind and solar energy, to ones carrying the potential for unintended disasters. Kevin Trenberth, a lead author for the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change, said that despair at sluggish climate action, and the rise of Donald Trump were feeding the current tech trend. “But solar geoengineering is not the answer,” he said. “Cutting incoming solar radiation affects the weather and hydrological cycle. It promotes drought. It destabilizes things and could cause wars. The side effects are many and our models are just not good enough to predict the outcomes” Natural alterations to the earth’s radiation balance can be short-lasting, but terrifying. A 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption lowered global temperatures by 0.5C, while the Mount Tambora eruption in 1815 triggered Europe’s ‘year without a summer’, bringing crop failure, famine and disease. A Met Office study in 2013 said that the dispersal of fine particles in the stratosphere could precipitate a calamitous drought across North Africa. Frank Keutsch, the Harvard atmospheric sciences professor leading the experiment, said that the deployment of a solar geoengineering system was “a terrifying prospect” that he hoped would never have to be considered. “At the same time, we should never choose ignorance over knowledge in a situation like this,” he said. “If you put heat into the stratosphere, it may change how much water gets transported from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and the question is how much are you [creating] a domino effect with all kinds of consequences? What we can do to quantify this is to start with lab studies and try to understand the relevant properties of these aerosols.” Stratospheric controlled perturbation experiments (SCoPEX) are seen as “critical” to this process and the first is planned to spray water molecules into the stratosphere to create a 1km long and 100m wide icy plume, which can be studied by a manoeuvrable flight balloon. If lab tests are positive, the experiment would then be replicated with a limestone compound which the researchers believe will neither absorb solar or terrestrial radiation, nor deplete the ozone layer. Bill Gates and other foundations are substantially funding the project, and aerospace companies are thought to be taking a business interest in the technology’s potential. The programmme’s launch will follow a major conference involving more than 100 scientists, which begins in Washington DC today. Solar geoengineering’s journey from the fringes of climate science to its mainstream will be sealed at a prestigious Gordon research conference in July, featuring senior figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Oxford University. Pasztor says that most scientific observers now see the window to a 1.5C warmed world as “practically gone” and notes that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will continue rising for many decades after the planet has reached a ‘net zero emissions’ point planned for mid-late century. But critics of solar radiation management approach this as a call to redouble mitigation efforts and guard against the elevation of a questionable Plan B. “It is appropriate that we spend money on solar geoengineering research,” said Kevin Anderson, the deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. “But we also have to aim for 2C with climate mitigation and act as though geoengineering doesn’t work, because it probably won’t.”"
"A towering iceberg is causing traffic jams in a remote town on Canada’s east coast, as tourists jostle for a glimpse of the mass of ice sitting in shallow water just off Newfoundland. The iceberg, which has dwarfed the nearby small town of Ferryland, is estimated to measure some 46 metres (150ft) at its highest point. “It’s the biggest one I ever seen around here,” mayor Adrian Kavanagh told the Canadian Press. “It’s a huge iceberg and it’s in so close that people can get a good photograph of it.”   The light blue behemoth has become a tourist attraction in recent days, as locals from across Newfoundland sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic for a chance to snap photos of the glacial giant. Their shots have flooded social media, showing the massive structure looming over local homes and sitting large compared to a helicopter hovering over it.  Icebergs are no strangers to these parts – a large number drift through from the Arctic each year, earning the area the moniker “iceberg alley” and giving rise to a local industry focused on iceberg tourism.  “You can see off in the distance on a clear day, you can see five or six big ’bergs,” said Kavanagh. Most of them simply float past the town, but this latest visitor appears to be grounded and could remain in place, he added.  So far this year the number of icebergs moving into the North Atlantic shipping lanes has spiked, forcing vessels to either slow down or make long detours. Some 616 icebergs have moved into the shipping lanes so far this year, as compared to 687 in all of 2016.  Experts say uncommonly strong counterclockwise winds may be drawing the icebergs south. Global warming has also been linked to the increase, as it has accelerated the process by which chunks of the Greenland ice sheet break off and float away."
"In the rising chorus over the past few weeks, one migratory bird has stood out as insistent, persistent, and more variable in its simple song than most books would have us believe.  Chiffchaffs are on the up; climate change has warmed their advance northwards, and here in the south they seem to be filling every copse, every patch of scrubland. They are often heard, but far less frequently seen.  On my five-mile morning run along the river and past the gravel pits, six birds sang. At the top of a wooded hill, a seventh. On the down slope, I stopped under the trees to locate caller number eight. I thought I was directly beneath it, but I drew blanks among several trees, hundreds of branches, and thousands of twigs unfurling their leaves. Bird guides tell us that this bird sings its name, a disyllabic “chiff-chaff, chiff-chaff”. The first two birds of the morning stuck to the script of this see-saw mnemonic, tempting me to rock my head in time with the beat. However, caller number three was one of a sizeable minority offering up a loose waltz in its opening salvo – “chiff, chaff-chaff”. Hilltop bird seven was what I would call a chopper, leaving the tiniest pauses between notes hurled out with dramatic emphasis: “Chiff! Chaff! Chiff! Chaff!” The day before, a bird in the willows overlooking Bedford’s medieval fish ponds had sung with even more startling originality, breaking out from the percussive norm to end each phrase with a frantic-sounding “cheree-cheree”. A conventional see-saw chiffchaff sang in opposition from bushes at the other end of grassy trenches, the remnants of the old ponds. What would the opposite sex think of this difference? Would it be heard as an alluring improviser or an aberrant to be shunned? I pinpointed the eighth bird in the topmost branches. This singer was a compulsive fidget, shuffling its feet and turning one way, then the other, a mobile speaker wanting to spread its song about. Down below, I stood listening carefully, trying to separate the chiff from the chaff. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary"
"Climate change will fuel acts of terrorism and strengthen recruiting efforts by terrorist groups such as Islamic State and Boko Haram, a report commissioned by the German foreign office has found. Terrorist groups will exploit the natural disasters and water and food shortages expected to result from climate change and allow them to recruit more easily, operate more freely and control civilian populations, argues the report by Berlin thinktank Adelphi.  “Terrorist groups are increasingly using natural resources – such as water – as a weapon of war, controlling access to it, and further compounding, and exacerbating resource scarcities,” Lukas Rüttinger writes in the report, titled Insurgency, Terrorism and Organised Crime in a Warming World. “The scarcer resources become, the more power is given to those who control them, especially in regions where people are particularly reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods. “As climate change affects food security and the availability of water and land, affected people will become more vulnerable not only to negative climate impacts but also to recruitment by terrorist groups offering alternative livelihoods and economic incentives.” The Adelphi report cites several examples where the impacts of climate change are already spurring or exacerbating terrorism. In the drought-ravaged region around Lake Chad in central Africa, food and water shortages, near-economic collapse, and weak governments are providing a ripe recruiting ground for Islamist fundamentalist group Boko Haram. “In north-eastern Nigeria, the region closest to Lake Chad and where Boko Haram is strongest, 71.5% of the population live in poverty and more than 50% are malnourished … This kind of economic deprivation provides an ideal breeding ground for recruitment by Boko Haram.” In Syria, the now six-year civil war and rise of Isis was, not caused, but exacerbated by one of the worst and widest droughts in the country’s history, which drove hundreds of thousands from the land, and sent millions into extreme poverty and food insecurity. Isis is using water as a weapon of war, the report argues, controlling dams to harm enemies and expand its own territory.  “In 2015, Islamic State closed the gates of the Ramadi dam to more easily attack regime forces further downstream. Weaponisation of water can also take the form of using it as a source of funding by taxing it, as Isis did in Raqqa. In other instances, Isis did not cut the supply, but rather used water to flood land in order to expel people from their homes.” And in Afghanistan, a country riven by internecine conflicts and acutely vulnerable to climate change, more than half of local conflicts are over land and water. Diminishing rainfall and advancing desertification are likely to spark further violent clashes between nomads and pastoralists over access to pastures and water and food. Rüttinger told the Guardian climate change alone did not cause terrorism, but “creates an environment where terrorism can thrive” and exacerbates existing tensions and conflicts. Former US deputy undersecretary of defence Sherri Goodman told the Guardian this month that climate change was a “threat multiplier” for unstable regions around the world, but that its impacts would be felt globally, and by countries distant from the source conflict. “Climate is a threat multiplier because it aggravates others tensions and conflicts that already exist.” Militaries around the world, across the Americas, UK, Europe, and the Asia Pacific, have highlighted the “threat multiplier” impact of climate change and extreme weather events. The Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change has warned the impact of global warming will drive massive refugee movements of an “unimaginable scale”, and that climate represents “the greatest security threat of the 21st century”. The US secretary of defence, James Matthis, told his confirmation hearing in January climate change posed a real and current security threat to American troops. “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. It is appropriate for the combatant commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.” In March, the United Nations, in passing a resolution on the Lake Chad crisis, emphasised the “interconnectedness” of the climate and security challenges in the region, emphasising “the adverse effects of climate change and ecological changes among other factors on the stability of the region”.

"Today, Donald Trump signed an executive order taking aim at America’s climate policies. On the heels of a report finding that the world needs to halve its carbon pollution every decade to avoid dangerous climate change, Trump’s order would instead increase America’s carbon pollution, to the exclusive benefit of the fossil fuel industry.  One part of the executive order tells the EPA to review and revise (weaken) its Clean Power Plan and methane regulations. However, revising these regulations isn’t so simple. It requires proceeding through the same years-long rulemaking process the EPA used to create the rules in the first place. This involves considering the scientific evidence, crafting draft rules, responding to millions of public comments, and defending the new plan in court. Environmental attorneys are confident “this is another deal President Trump won’t be able to close.” A second part of the executive order tells the EPA to ignore the government’s estimated price on carbon pollution. The Republican Party wants to lower the current estimate, but most evidence indicates the government is dramatically underestimating the cost of carbon pollution. Trump gets around this inconvenient evidence by ordering the EPA to simply deny the existence of those costs. A third part of the executive order ends a moratorium on new coal leases on public lands before a review is completed to determine if taxpayers are being shortchanged due to the lands being sold too cheaply. Environmental groups are set to immediately challenge this order. Regardless, lifting the moratorium would have little effect on coal production or mining jobs. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt would undoubtedly be happy to follow Trump’s orders. In his previous job as Oklahoma Attorney General and fossil fuel industry puppet, one of Pruitt’s 14 lawsuits against the EPA was aimed at the Clean Power Plan. However, the Clean Air Act requires the government to cut carbon pollution. Trump and Pruitt may not like it, but the law, scientific evidence, and public opinion fall squarely against them. A few weeks ago, Donald Trump released his first proposed budget, and it’s also fiercely anti-science and anti-climate.  Trump budget director on climate change funding: “We’re not spending money on that anymore. We consider that to be a waste of your money.” pic.twitter.com/eTqjL1RcRQ Among other cuts, it would slash nearly one-third of the EPA budget, hundreds of millions of dollars from the NOAA research budget, and terminate four NASA Earth science missions as part of a $102 million cut to the agency’s Earth science program.  The Trump budget attack on science, in one chart https://t.co/OT7OTmAozt pic.twitter.com/oxPusBh7ot The budget even goes as far as to propose eliminating Energy Star – a purely voluntary program that helps companies certify energy efficient products, saving Americans money while cutting carbon pollution in the process – possibly out of pure spite for the climate. Trump’s anti-science and anti-climate agenda doesn’t come as a surprise; before he even took office, there were early signs that Trump would put public health at risk by scrapping climate and other environmental policies. He began by nominating numerous anti-climate, pro-industry individuals to powerful positions in his administration. Those appointees quickly made their influence known, launching an inquisition into Department of Energy staffers who had worked on climate change, trying to gag government scientists, and scrap the EPA climate webpage. In the face of public outcry, the Trump administration retreated on these fronts. But they regrouped, and over the past several weeks have surged forward with a rejuvenated attack on climate science, environmental protection, and the future of our planet and its inhabitants, to the benefit of big polluters with big wallets. Meanwhile, a Washington Post analysis found that Trump has moved to fill just one out of 46 key government science and technology positions. And for the position of presidential science advisor, he seems to only be considering climate deniers. With its new administrator Scott Pruitt confirmed by Senate Republicans, “EPA” now seems to stand for “Environmental Plunder Agency.” In an interview on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, Pruitt sounded more interested in trying to bring back coal jobs than in protecting the environment. To that, America’s top coal boss said: I suggested that he temper his expectations ... He can’t bring them back. In one of his first Tweets after taking the job, Pruitt spoke of the stakeholders whose interests he sought to protect: I’m dedicated to working w/stakeholders - industry, farmers, ranchers, business owners – on traditional values of environmental stewardship. Soon thereafter, the EPA’s Office of Science and Technology Policy mission statement no longer used the word “science.”  A few days later, Pruitt rejected decades’ worth of climate science research, giving the following answer when asked on CNBC if carbon dioxide is the primary control knob for the climate: No, I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So, no, I would not agree that’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. Pruitt was wrong on both points – carbon dioxide is the main climate control knob (NASA scientists even published a 2010 paper with those exact words in the title), and there is a 97% expert consensus on this question. Predictably, Pruitt’s comments evoked harsh responses, not just from climate scientists but also from business, military, faith, and conservative leaders and elected officials. For example, leading climate scientist Kevin Trenberth said: Pruitt has demonstrated that he is unqualified to run the EPA or any agency. There is no doubt whatsoever that the planet is warming and it is primarily due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels … Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and we can demonstrate clearly that the observed warming of the planet would not have occurred without that change in atmospheric composition. These are scientific facts, not opinion This is like the Surgeon General saying cigarettes don't cause cancer, or head of NASA saying the Earth is flat.https://t.co/rBUAqtezyL Pruitt has been filling EPA staffing positions with climate deniers from Senator James “the greatest hoax” Inhofe’s office. Trump recently selected coal lobbyist and former Inhofe advisor Andrew Wheeler to be Pruitt’s EPA deputy chief. Pruitt also hired Washington State Senator Douglas Ericksen, who actively fought the state’s proposed carbon tax, and who invited an obscure climate denier blogger named Tony Heller to testify before a Washington State Senate committee for 40 minutes. To put that in perspective, invited witnesses are normally given just a few minutes to testify. University of Washington climate scientist Sarah Myhre - an actual climate expert - had spoken to a State House committee two weeks earlier, for 8 minutes.  As the Trump administration unleashed its assault on science and the climate, we learned that huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef are dead or dying, 30 years sooner than expected. Despite the last El Niño event ending nearly a year ago, the first two months of 2017 were the second-hottest on record, behind only the El Niño-amplified 2016, pushing the world into what the WMO calls “truly uncharted territory.” Arctic and Antarctic sea ice are at record-shattering low levels. Research is finding increasingly strong links between climate change and extreme weather. Americans across the political spectrum are now more worried about global warming than at any time in the past 8 years. Fortunately, Trump’s efforts to roll back environmental regulations will be fought in court, and his budget proposal only tells Congress what he’d like to see. Nevertheless, it’s a dangerous time for America’s leaders to be denying climate change, defunding its scientific research, and unraveling its climate policies. Science always wins in the end, and if we fight it, we will lose. During the announcement of his anti-climate executive orders, Trump announced, “My administration is ending the war on coal.” Their wars on science and the Earth’s climate, on the other hand, are in full force."
"As we inch towards day 100 of his ignoble reign, it is becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump is going to remain president of the United States for a fair while yet (bar a sudden and unlikely show of courage from Republican politicians). Which means at some point we’ll have to start thinking about those big questions around the legacy of POTUS 45. What, for example, will a Trump presidential library look like? Will it contain three books or four? Which of the faces on Mount Rushmore is Trump going to replace with his own visage? And most importantly of all, for film fans at least – who will direct Trump: The Movie? Because make no mistake, there will be a Trump movie. We’re only a few months into his presidency and already HBO have announced that a miniseries about his election win is in the works. From cable news to late-night chat shows, television has turned the Trump presidency into a licence to print money, which you have to imagine is attracting envious glances from the film industry. Surely it’s not a question of if but when – and of who should direct it.  Certainly, there is no shortage of people who could lay claim to being the best auteur for the job of depicting the Donald. Michael Bay would surely capture the explosive bombast of the man – plus he seems to love trucks as much as Trump himself. Oliver Stone, meanwhile, has already tackled three different presidents in JFK, Nixon and George W Bush, and his paranoid style looks well-matched to the conspiracy-theorising of the current presidency. Kathryn Bigelow looks best suited to illustrate the bruising results of Trump’s foreign-policy follies. (This is the man who wants to seize Iraq’s oil, lest we forget.) Mike Judge is often cited as the director whose work most eerily predicted Trump’s rise with his film Idiocracy. Christopher Nolan has the dubious honour of having possibly inspired the rhetoric of Trump’s own inauguration speech. And then there are the film-makers who could claim unique insight into Trump’s mindset, having directed the man himself in such cinematic titans as Home Alone 2, Little Rascals and – of course – Ghosts Can Do It. In my opinion though, there’s only one director who could really pull off a Trump biopic, and that’s Werner Herzog. The austere German director is more than qualified. Consider the evidence. The temptation with a Trump film would be to make it polemical, and amp up his grotesque nature. The thing is, we’ve had an awful lot of that already. Would another depiction of Trump as a one-dimensional monster really add anything? What we need is someone who treats Trump with clinical detachment. Herzog tends to approach his subjects in the manner of a lepidopterist pinning butterflies to a board, and Trump would be no different, judging by an interview the director gave with Rolling Stone last week. “He’s the first time you have a real independent,” Herzog said. “He’s turned against the Republican party, and he’s vehemently against the media, justifiably so to some degree, and I find this a very significant novelty. It’s mysterious how Trump is getting away with literally everything. I see it with great, strange fascination. Very, very unusual.” Herzog’s fascination with Trump is unsurprising, because in a sense he’s been making films about people like him for much of his career. Herzog has always had a preoccupation with wild, often irrational ambition, particularly in his collaborations with Klaus Kinski – who would have made a cracking Trump, FYI. Glimpses of the president’s defining characteristics can be seen in the protagonists of Aguirre, the Wrath of God, or Fitzcarraldo. Trump is precisely the sort of person to have a steamship dragged up the side of a mountain, you suspect. Another of Herzog’s recurring cinematic themes – man’s fierce battle with nature – would apply quite well to Trump too, given the potentially devastating ideological war he’s currently waging on the planet by dismantling environmental regulations, elevating climate change deniers to prominent cabinet positions and even deleting scientific data relating to global warming in the Arctic. Herzog has witnessed the results of such wrongheadedness firsthand in his documentary Encounters at the End of the World, so he’d be well-placed to depict the destruction Trump is likely to wreak. And, of course, Herzog loves an unhappy ending, from Woyzeck to Aguirre to The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, and there’s a fair chance of one of those – for Trump or for the rest of us - at the conclusion of this presidency (though it’s unlikely he’ll get eaten by a bear, a la Grizzly Man). So, yes, Herzog is the only choice of director for our Trump biopic. Now we just need someone to star in it. Nicolas Cage, anyone?"
"The European Union has led criticism of Donald Trump’s effort to unravel Barack Obama’s measures to combat climate change, suggesting that Europe will now take the lead in global efforts. The US president signed an executive order on Tuesday aimed at eliminating the clean power plan, Obama’s landmark policy to set limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit. America’s commitment to the Paris accord of nearly 200 countries now hangs in the balance.  Miguel Árias Cañete, the EU’s climate action commissioner, said: “We regret the US is rolling back the main pillar of its climate policy, the clean power plan. Now, it remains to be seen by which other means the United States intends to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement.” He added: “The continued leadership of the EU, China and many other major economies is now more important than ever. When it comes to climate and the global clean energy transition, there cannot be vacuums, there can only be drivers, and we are committed to driving this agenda forward.” The EU has the most ambitious emissions reduction target, Árias Cañete said. “We will stand by Paris, we will defend Paris, and we will implement Paris.” Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Trump’s action risked putting the US on the back foot. “I don’t know anyone who wants to breathe dirty air, who wants to worry about their water source, or who wants to leave a dangerous world to their children,” she said. “And because we are all united by these common desires, I am optimistic that Paris will endure, with world leadership remaining resilient in its commitments to Paris.” The president’s executive order also throws out the government’s method for counting the benefits of cutting carbon pollution and abandons a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands. Reaction on Washington’s Capitol Hill broke down along party lines, with Republicans welcoming the move towards energy independence. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said: “Today’s executive order is based on a fundamental truth: energy drives our economy. President Obama disregarded this, and the result was a barrage of regulations that crippled America’s energy industry. That is all in the past now. President Trump’s executive order will help America’s energy workers and reverse much of the damage done.” The clean power plan had “ravaged coal country”, he added, and deserved a “full repeal”. There was anger and dismay on the opposite side of the aisle as Democrats lined up to knock Trump’s order, with the notable exception of a senator from a coal-friendly state. They accused the president of denying scientific evidence to favour special interests. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, said: “If there was any doubt that big oil was back in charge under the Trump administration, today’s executive order lays that to rest. It reads as if it was written in an Exxon boardroom, with no regard for the health and safety of the American people, or the planet. “This executive order is nothing more than a giveaway to big oil at the expense of the health and safety of our children and the bank accounts of hard-working middle-class families. Simply put, the Trump administration has put the health of the American people and the future of our planet on the back burner all for the sake of lining the pockets of big oil and extreme-right special interests.” Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said: “President Trump and congressional Republicans’ contempt for clean air, clean water, and our clean energy future endangers the health of our children and the strength of our economy. The administration’s spiteful assault on the clean power plan will not bring back jobs to coal country, it will only poison our air and undermine America’s ability to win the good-paying jobs of the future.” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, noted that global temperature records had been broken over the past three years. “At a time when we should be urgently investing in clean energy jobs and technology, Trump is giving the worst polluters free rein and pretending it’s all about the economy,” he said. “True leadership is a president who had the political courage to move aggressively on carbon polluters, while leaving office with the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record. Instead, we have a president who has called climate change a hoax, picked an ExxonMobil CEO as his secretary of state, put a climate science denier at the head of the EPA, and gives a disgraceful handout to his rich friends in the fossil fuels industry.” Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, a Democratic member of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus and Bicameral Task Force on Climate Change, warned against a withdrawal from the Paris agreement. “Today’s executive order sends a dangerous signal to the world that the United States does not want to lead in one of the greatest fights of our time: combating global climate change,” he said. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and the Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine co-authored the Super Pollutants Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill to reduce short-lived climate pollutants in the atmosphere. Murphy said: “Future generations will judge President Trump for this attack on our health and our safety. The Republican party is going to extraordinary lengths to deny that this meteor that is global warming is careening toward us.” But not for the first time, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a state in coal country that Trump won in a landslide, broke ranks with his Democratic colleagues. “We need to strike a balance between the environment and the economy,” he said. “The clean power plan never achieved that balance. Rolling back this regulation is a positive step towards preventing further job loss, increases to consumer energy bills, and more damage to our economy. We must stop ignoring the damage these regulations caused our energy sector, our economy and our way of life in West Virginia.” Trump’s attack on the clean power plan will not produce instant results. It faces bureaucratic wrangling and legal challenges that could take years. On Tuesday, a coalition of 23 states, cities and counties declared its intention to resist. “We won’t hesitate to protect those we serve – including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump’s actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change,” said the group, led by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. Industry groups have expressed scepticism about whether the measures will create employment as Trump claims. Robert Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy, the US’s largest private coal producer, said Trump’s moves were unlikely to significantly increase the number of coal jobs. Chris Wood, CEO of the fishing advocacy group Trout Unlimited, said the executive order would hurt sportsmen, who depend on the resilience of American watersheds, in a multitude of ways. Wood sees the clean power plan as made up of “commonsense” requirements for the energy industry that protect public land for mixed use.  He said: “We’re not talking about hi-tech wizardry here. It was updating rules that hadn’t been touched in 30 to 40 years. It says, hey, treat your frack water once you’re finished with it. Make sure you have hardened concrete casings so they don’t leak. With the repeal of the clean power plan, waterways will not only be more vulnerable to avoidable pollution but also to the varied impacts of climate change. Wood added: “Anyone who has seen these big fires in the west understands the effects on fish.”  Watchdogs and pressure groups joined the chorus of condemnation. Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: “This is an all-out assault on the protections we need to avert climate catastrophe. It’s a senseless betrayal of our national interests. And it’s a short-sighted attempt to undermine American clean energy leadership. “Trump is sacrificing our future for fossil fuel profits – and leaving our kids to pay the price. This would do lasting damage to our environment and public lands, threaten our homes and health, hurt our pocketbooks and slow the clean energy progress that has already generated millions of good-paying jobs. “We won’t surrender our children’s future to fossil fuel profits without a fight.” The alarm was also raised over potential economic consequences. Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a not-for-profit organisation that rallied hundreds of companies to support the clean power plan, said: “By taking this backward step, the US risks a stalled transition to a low-carbon economy, thus giving China and other countries the upper hand as they embrace renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies that are proliferating all across the globe.”"
"Light to moderate traffic is easing along the Pacific motorway connecting the Gold Coast and the Tweed, with no particular sign of storm damage or delays. But in Chinderah, just inside New South Wales and just off the highway, John Anderson is in full-tilt disaster recovery mode, contending with the aftermath of the flooding rains that ex-cyclone Debbie sent south. At the Gateway Lifestyle Tweed Shores over-50s community, in between dealing with a stream of tradies coming in and out the office door – “Righto mate, do what you’ve gotta do, we’ll pay for it” – Anderson describes how last week the water went through “probably 140” cabin-style homes in this complex that he manages.  “On Thursday the tide met the downstream flooding and we were inundated with a metre, metre and a half of water – not a flood, but slowly rising water.”  By Friday afternoon evacuation was well under way “for those residents happy to go”. “Gas bottles ripped off their moorings, leaking gas, electricity in residences filled with salt water,” Anderson recalls. “By 10 o’clock Saturday night the park was basically isolated and only accessible by rubber ducky.” He and his wife, Beth, opted to stay and keep an eye on things, sleeping on foam mattresses on the upper level of their manufactured home, with water swilling around on the floor below, until they could get out and about to assess the damage. Days later, there’s still so much to be done before things even faintly resemble normality. A jotting on the desk blotter says “Copper gas line missing – gone”. Anderson’s mobile rings and flashes up the caller details: “Shade Sail Andrew”. Out front of the park is a pile of ruined possessions that stretches for maybe 100 metres down the road. “It represents in a lot of cases everything that people own, or did own.” The villas are about 85% privately owned, 15% rented. “Some people are insured, a lot are not because of the cost, being flood-prone.” Anderson lauds a “magnificent response from the community, individuals” who are pitching in to help out. The ladies from nearby Cudgen public school have been turning up with hot food, and in the top bit of the Gateway park where the water couldn’t reach “we had ladies there cooking sausage rolls and bringing them round. Just the most magnificent response.”  A short drive away in Tumbulgum it’s clear from the comprehensive inventory of household goods in jumbled heaps at the end of every driveway that some people lost more or less everything. A woman throws her hands up in resignation as a man adds more ruined belongings to one such growing pile. Everywhere is silt and sludge. At the entry to Riverside Drive a chalked sign says “Please stop to help residents”. Nearby a woman, looking newly arrived on the scene, unloads from her car a little yellow water blaster. It seems hopelessly dinky for the mammoth job at hand, but every bit helps and you know she will not go unthanked. Compounding the heartbreak for Tumbulgum is the death on its doorstep of Stephanie King, 43, her son Jacob, 7, and daugher Ella Jane, 11, after their car plunged off Dulguigan Road and into the swollen Tweed on Monday afternoon. Daughter Chloe May, 8, managed to escape from the sinking car. I arrive on the other side of the river at 11.45am on Tuesday and line up with the rest of the media in a sludgy riverside park. We are being kept at bay as police divers continue their work after having to stop overnight. Even at this distance the water can be seen roiling with bubbles from their difficult work in the murk. Pixie Bennett clutches a Jack Daniels in a can as she stands near me watching the recovery effort. Like everyone else she was stranded by the waters and stripped of everything that she couldn’t get upstairs. “Sorry we’re drinking in the middle of the day but we’re still in shock – it’s a double whammy for the little town of Tumbulgum,” she says, nodding towards the emergency services at work on the opposite bank. She moved her car on to a high bridge before the water came but lost boxes of possessions when the water rose “two steps from the top of our 13 steps”. A plastic box floated past and she grabbed it, to find a Barbie doll’s clothes packed inside. “Our neighbour rowed over in a canoe and rowed us back next door so we could have dinner with them.” Further back from the river in Bawden Street, earthmoving contractor Ben May is opening the jaws of his Bobcat loader, plunging it into those roadside piles, clamping down on whatever he can pick up – a fridge, a hot water system – and then mechanically hoiking it into his tip-truck. He’s guided by concreter Geoff Percy, a 16-year Tumbulgum resident. Good over-the-road mates, they have both been badly hit – “I lost my ute, lots of white goods, it was about seven feet deep through here on Friday” – but have turned away from their own troubles to help others. “Nah, we’ll be right,” says Percy. The tip-truck went under but once the water receded “Ben just changed all the oils and got it going. We’ll do this load and then head further up the street.”  The words and phrases that come out at these times – like “resilience” and “community spirit” – can sound like cliches until you walk into the sort of situation that gives rise to them. Two ancient pinball machines sit outside a neighbour’s place waiting for disposal. In their heyday, “Duotron” and “Firepower” cost you 20 cents a go. The owner bustles back and forth clearing up, not wanting to be photographed. “He’s had enough,” says Percy. “Here for 18 years. He’s leaving. Had enough of the floods.”  Three quarters of an hour after I arrived, the grim task down by the riverside is more or less done. The bodies have been removed and a crane waits to fish out the still-sunken family car. For a while this site has been the focus of the east coast flood story. Now the cameras will swing north to Rockhampton, where the Fitzroy river is approaching its flood peak. Everyone in Tumbulgum has been at it for days cleaning up. But it looks like they have only just started. It smells like a muddy cattleyard from my country boyhood. Leaving town there’s a hedgerow of household debris tangled in trees along the riverbank. On the road towards Murwillumbah, through Condong, the same scene repeats itself over and over. Flood-ravaged sugarcane paddocks, pile after roadside pile of everything from barbecues to microwaves to baby strollers to chests of drawers and other buggered stuff. It is like an endless waterlogged forlorn jumble sale. Where will the council ever bury it all? The makeshift sign in bedraggled Condong is a bit more firm than the one in Tumbulgum. “No tourists please. Help welcome.” Understandable in the circumstances. A floodline can be a thin topographical boundary between chaos and business as usual. This is brought home when I pull into Murwillumbah. Nearest the river there are familiar scenes of mopping up. Competition for parking spaces pushes me further up the main street than I would have otherwise gone, until I find a spot in front of the old-fashioned Austral Cafe (Established 1919).  Inside, not so far above that fateful floodline, I get to enjoy a midday breakfast of bacon, eggs, and toast varnished with butter, all in perfectly dry surroundings. The walls are fittingly decorated with historical pictures of the district’s past floods and fires, putting the current events in context. There’s friendly chatter and laughter amid the tinkle of cutlery on crockery in the Austral. But snatches of the day’s inevitable conversations reach me as well. “They found some of his gear on South Stradbroke Island” … “It went floating past the boat ramp” … “He slept through it, which is probably for the best” … “That’s the hardest part. I mean we’re lucky, but …” I think about the people in Tumbulgum making the most of their sausages on bread and whatever else neighbours have chucked together, volunteers have brought, or providence has left unspoiled. I hope they can dine somewhere like this when it’s all over.  The scenic route back from Murwillumbah to the Gold Coast is over the “Queensland road” that crosses the mountains via Tomewin to the Currumbin Valley. The road is damaged and open to “local traffic only”, but when a Falcon station wagon hoons impatiently past me and around the road closed sign, I decide to chance it. I have taken the route plenty of times on my motorbike, I know it well, I’m in an all-wheel drive, it can’t be too bad. And a trek back to the motorway through that landscape of muddied piles of ex-goods and former chattels doesn’t appeal. It’s a mistake. The weather that caused all the devastation down below has left fallen trees, debris and landslips littering the road up here. Council crews are doing what they can to clear the way through, but like everywhere in these parts they are mere days into what looks like weeks or months of work. At one blockage I wait behind a campervan for a bit, but then people start getting out of their cars, so I pull a U-turn. On the way down there’s a Toyota 4WD lying on its roof at the bottom of an embankment. The Stop/Go man with one of the road gangs says things are better on the Numbinbah Valley Road, another of my favourite motorbike routes back to the Gold Coast. There are bad patches, he reckons, but you can get through. And the road is indeed passable, but only just. It is still partly blocked or extremely damaged in sections. I find myself having to steer around tonnes of earth that a saturated hillside has disgorged into my path, or skirt patches where chunks of bitumen have been torn out by whooshing waters, or dodge areas where the road verges have collapsed away, leaving gashes that could swallow the car. On this familiar route it would be easy to lapse into an accustomed pace and come to grief. I remind myself to take it easy. There’s a rural version of the recovery effort that is happening back in the Tweed Valley. Unsalvageable belongings being put out for collection, busted fences being put right. In one spot a little Suzuki ute is being used to pay out a coil of barbed wire along a boundary. Flooding has wrecked the road in areas where you wouldn’t even have noticed a waterway before. Trees lie flattened in creek beds. Not far short of Numinbah village there’s been a huge cascade of boulders that looks like it should have swept the whole road away. It’s down to one lane, marked by temporary guide posts. From the ridge above, the little waterfall that no doubt swelled to a roar and caused all this damage has shrunk back down to an innocuous trickle over the rocks. Things aren’t fantastic further west in the Scenic Rim country either. Beaudesert’s state MP, Jon Krause, has been on ABC 612 radio reminding us that rural communities are likewise dealing with the effects of this natural disaster. Crops have been lost and ruined paddocks will take a lot of work to rehabilitate before they can be planted again.  Pretty soon I’m back in suburban Nerang and not far from home. There’s the odd tree lying on the ground here and there, whipped down in the high winds of the previous days, roots having given up their grip on the soaked ground. We’d already had more than a week of downpours when the remnants of Debbie arrived and upped the tempo.  In the park across the road from my house a council crew is mucking out the kids’ sandpit. But that’s about as devastated as it gets round here. The park is part of the local stormwater drainage system, and when the rain arrives the boogie boards come out. Last year we put on a new roof on our late 70s, early 80s brick-veneer bungalow, and consequently had to follow the 21st-century regulations. That meant threading steel cyclone rods down through the walls, tying the roof to the concrete slab foundation. Many of the houses around us in this brick-and-tile suburb are of a similar era, but still have their original roofs. Which means they don’t have those rods. This time around the winds were less than cyclonic. If more of north Queensland’s most extreme weather comes south in future years as feared, we may see those structures tested. To the north, the south and the west of us, there are thousands of people dealing with such consequences in the here and now."
"Next Saturday, in Washington, DC, and in hundreds of rallies around the world, scientists and their supporters will stage what is likely to be the largest gathering of its kind in history. The March for Science, an idea hatched by a few enthusiastic people on Reddit, has mobilised scientists and their supporters as never before. As a colleague observed: “You know you’re in trouble when scientists take to the streets.” He’s right. I’ve worked closely with scientists for decades and, by training and temperament, they tend to be happiest in the lab, testing and retesting experiment results – among the last groups of people you might expect to find protesting.  So, why are they grabbing placards now? Because an unprecedented attack on science, scientists and evidence-based policymaking is underway in the US federal government. Nowhere is the attack more ferocious than on the issue of global warming, where the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the modest but important policies put in place by President Obama. First among them is the Obama administration’s signature Clean Power Plan, the nation’s first-ever limit on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which Trump has vowed to repeal. He has also pledged to “reopen” (which could well mean “weaken”) hard-won vehicle fuel economy standards that have already begun lowering carbon emissions and oil consumption. Meanwhile, in a tragic example of wilful blindness, Trump has abolished a rule requiring federal agencies to consider how large federal projects affect climate change and how climate impacts, such as sea level rises and drought, might affect the long-term viability of the projects themselves. This is akin to erecting a building on a fault zone without considering earthquakes. Thankfully, bureaucratic hurdles make it hard to accomplish these goals with a stroke of the president’s pen. But if the administration succeeds, it may increase by billions of tons the emission of global warming gases and other pollutants that endanger our health; burden our children with much higher costs of fighting climate change; cede the United States’ clean energy prominence to other countries and make it much harder to meet the goals the US set as part of the 2015 international Paris agreement on climate. There is nothing subtle about Trump’s antipathy to science. As a candidate, he dismissed decades of established scientific evidence by calling global warming a “hoax” and he has displayed an unprecedented disregard for facts and evidence throughout his brief presidency, even on matters as trivial as the size of the crowd at his inauguration. He picked cabinet members for crucial posts who prominently display their ignorance about or disdain for science. Scott Pruitt, his choice to lead the US Environmental Protection Agency, has stated publicly that he does not accept that carbon dioxide emissions are a primary cause of climate change. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, thinks funding research on global warming is a waste of taxpayer dollars. The anti-science approach extends far beyond climate science. In one of Pruitt’s first official acts, for example, he overruled the recommendation of his own agency’s scientists, based on years of meticulous research, to ban a pesticide shown to cause nerve damage, one that poses a clear risk to children, farmworkers and rural drinking water supplies. What’s more, Trump hasn’t even yet followed in the time-honoured tradition of appointing a presidential science adviser. His proposed budget cuts government science across the board, reducing vital research and data gathering on topics such as sustainable farming methods, weather prediction, the fate and transport of air pollutants and clean energy technologies. The attack on science is coming not only from the Trump administration. Private groups, such as the fossil-fuel funded Heartland Institute, have mailed extraordinarily misleading booklets entitled Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming (sic), vowing to make sure that every school science teacher receives this disinformation presumably to weaken the consensus the climate change is real and burning fossil fuels is its primary cause. Even more worrisome, Congress is using a radical tool called the Congressional Review Act to eliminate numerous public safeguards that took years to develop and is actively working to pass bills that make it harder for federal agencies to issue science-based safeguards for public health and safety. One bill, for example, would prevent academic scientists – but not industry-funded scientists – on federal advisory boards from weighing in on scientific issues within their expertise.These attacks are profoundly unacceptable to many scientists and collective outrage over them has propelled the March for Science and the People’s Climate March planned for the following Saturday. Yet something even bigger also seems to be brewing. For a long time, many of us have believed that facts speak for themselves, and scientists could remain on the sidelines to avoid “politicising” their work. The recent election and its aftermath have clearly triggered a dramatic re-evaluation of these norms. We have learned – the hard way – that we can’t take respect for facts and science for granted and a large and growing “fact-based” community is rising up. This grouping includes those who rushed to airports to protest against the ban on Muslim immigration and the public and private attorneys who demonstrated in court that the policy had no facts to support it. It includes those who have packed town hall meetings to block a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and shown that the replacement bill fixed no problem at all (except perhaps the tax increases that were levied on the rich to pay for expanded healthcare). This fact-based community includes journalists who are calling out falsehoods despite being branded enemies of the American people. It includes political leaders from both parties who have insisted upon a thorough investigation into allegations of Russian influence over the election and taken seriously the information assembled by career intelligence officials. What unites these disparate acts is the principle that demonstrable facts and evidence – not fake news, alternative facts, supposition or innuendo – must form the backbone of public decisions. It is what separates a democracy from a theocracy, monarchy, or dictatorship, all forms of government in which “the truth” is whatever the ruler says it is. My organisation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, with its more than 500,000 members and supporters, has joined with allies from the climate, environmental justice and labour movements to help organise both the March for Science and the People’s Climate March. As the demonstrations are likely to show, an enormous number of people understand what is stake. The greatest attack on science in memory may wind up spurring the greatest mobilisation of scientists, and allies far and wide, we have ever seen. Kenneth Kimmell is president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based nonprofit organisation  "
"Para la mayoría de los peruanos, las inundaciones de este año han sido las peores desde que se tiene memoria. Las lluvias fueron de un volúmen diez veces mayor que el habitual, incrementaron los caudales y causaron inundaciones generalizadas e inmensos deslaves que arrasaron con barrios marginales. Más de 100 personas han muerto, casi 158,000 han sido desplazadas, y 210,000 hogares han sido dañados, según el Centro de Operaciones de Emergencia Nacional de Perú. La infraestructura se llevó un golpe fuerte: se derrumbaron 260 puentes y casi 3,000km de caminos han quedado inutilizables, dejando sin comunicación a cientos de pueblos y ciudades.  La temporada de lluvias del Perú cae por lo general en el primer trimestre del año. También se le conoce como la “temporada de deslaves”, pero pocos recuerdan huaycos, como se les conoce en el idioma Quechua local, de una intensidad y una escala como esta. Mientras que el servicio de meterología del Perú reportaba en marzo lluvias sin precedente en el norte del país, los ríos que normalmente están secos se convirtieron en torrentes furiosos – y nunca antes había vivido tanta gente en su camino. El país está mal preparado para las temporadas de inundaciones, incluso cuando éstas son más clementes. Pero la brutalidad de la temporada este año en Perú ha puesto en evidencia la infraestructura desigual, el crecimiento desordenado e informal y la muchas veces inexistente planeación urbana en el Perú. “En medio del desastre se ha abierto una gran oportunidad para el país,” dijo a The Guardian Jorge Nieto, ministro de defensa de Perú, en el pueblo Huamey, afectado por las inundaciones. “Creo que hemos aprendido por las malas que este país necesita una reconstrucción de proporciones históricas.” Nieto, que ha estado al frente de los esfuerzos de rescate y despliegue de las fuerzas armadas a través del país, dijo que las ciudades y pueblos carecen de defensas básicas contra las inundaciones, y que los ríos que fluyen de los Andes hasta el Pacífico, que son aproximadamente 30, necesitarían ser canalizados, en particular en zonas urbanas. Ya que el Perú se sacude entre sequías e inundaciones, también deberían instalarse reservorios en las montañas, dijo Nieto, para que el agua de lluvia pueda ser almacenada en el país cuando hay escasez. “De esa manera garantizaríamos nuestro suministro de agua para que las lluvias sean una bendición y no un problema,” agregó. El desastre natural, al que los meteorólogos están llamando un “El Niño de la costa” ha causado daños equivalentes a $3.1 billones (£2.5 billones), llevándose 0.5% del PNB proyectado para el país en 2017, de 3.4% a 2.9%. La reconstrucción costaría alrededor de $9 billones, dijo el presidente Kuczynski la semana pasada. La primera fase pagaría la “reconstrucción inmediata” de ciudades y pueblos. La segunda fase, más larga, implicaría construir infraestructura para hacer del Perú un país más “moderno y organizado”, al enfrentarse con la probabilidad de más eventos climáticos impredecibles y extremos.  Las inundaciones también amenazaron de manera temporal al suministro de agua en la capital peruana. Más de 25 deslaves, que arrastraron troncos de árboles, ganado muerto y escombros de casas destruídas, obstruyeron las plantas de tratamiento en el río Rimac, con lo cual, la comisión del agua, Sedapal, se vio obligada a suspender la captación y tratamiento de aguas durante cinco días. Lima, la segunda ciudad más grande del mundo ubicada en un desierto después de El Cairo, está más acostumbrada a tener escasez que un exceso de agua, y la infraestructura de la ciudad fue “insuficiente” para lidiar con el diluvio, admite el director del consejo de Sedapal, Rudecino Vega. “Hace tres meses, el gobierno se estaba preparando para una sequía. Semanas más tarde, hemos tenido una cantidad de lluvia que es el diametral opuesto de una sequía,” comentó a The Guardian. Poco después de que el presidente Kuczynski se comprometió a brindar a los peruanos 100% de cobertura de agua, 24 horas al día, antes del fin de los cinco años de su presidencia, el desastre natural puso de manifiesto con “brutal claridad” la insuficiencia de la infraestructura de suministro de agua. Alrededor de 1 millón de peruanos en Lima carecen de acceso al agua potable. “La gente está viviendo en lugares donde no deberían,” dijo Kuczysnki el mes pasado, refiriéndose a las decenas de miles de víctimas que vivían en las zonas afectadas por las inundaciones. “Tenemos que controlar a las municipalidades para que no permitan el tráfico de tierras en barrancos y montes. Estamos viendo los resultados,” insistió. Alrededor de medio millón de personas habitan en las llanuras aluviales en el Perú, de acuerdo con un reporte por la Autoridad Nacional del Agua. La migración masiva de las zonas rurales a las ciudades significa que las personas “se han asentado en donde quiera que han podido en zonas marginales donde nadie querría vivir si no se vieran obligados por la pobreza,” dice Ernesto Ráez, ecologista tropical y otrora consejero del Ministerio del Ambiente en Perú. La reconstrucción de partes de Lima y otros pueblos y ciudades en la costa de Perú debe ser “adaptativa o correctiva”, dice Ráez, y podría implicar la reubicación de cientos de miles, o hasta millones, de personas. El cambio climático traerá condiciones meteorológicas extremas con más frecuencia. Las Naciones Unidas también ha advertido que el Perú deberá invertir en sistemas de alerta para peligros múltiples y asegurar que sus ciudadanos comprendan mejor los riesgos de tales desastres. “Este es un evento único a gran escala que necesita ser visto en el contexto del calentamiento del planeta, donde los episodios de variabilidad extrema del tiempo se están haciendo más evidentes,” dice Robert Glasser, representante especial del secretario general de las Naciones Unidas para la reducción del riesgo de desastres. “Para tener éxito en la prevención de desastres como éste, y para reducir las pérdidas a causa de los desastres, necesitamos asegurar que haya una mucha mayor comprensión de la naturaleza del riesgo de desastres en la sociedad. Esto incluye un mejor entendimiento del impacto del cambio climático y cómo altera los patrones climáticos locales.” Únete a nuestra comunidad de profesionales del desarrollo y humanitarios.

"Scientists are using 3D printing technology to create prosthetic coral that could be used to help the Great Barrier Reef recover from bleaching and storms. Researchers at the University of Sydney are creating virtual 3D maps of coral reefs to precisely model how their structure is altering as a result of environmental change.  With her supervisor, associate professor Will Figueira, Dr Renata Ferrari established the Ecological 3D Modelling Hub to precisely quantify the structure of the delicate reef ecosystem. “The idea behind that was to map, monitor and model the coral reefs and other marine ecosystems in three dimensions,” she said. “If you can create a 3D map, then you can measure it, because you literally have a map of the corals on your computer. You can get anything you want out of it.” The technology is relatively new, based on photogrammetry: the science of making 3D reconstructions from photography. These virtual models are being used to print models of the coral that could be planted on the reef to give it support as it recovers from adverse events such as bleaching and storms. The 3D-printed coral would provide a habitat for fish, which eat the algae that kills the coral, as well as a structure on which developing coral can grow. Artificial reefs have been created with cinder blocks or deliberately sunk ships, said Ferrari, “but we’ve never had an artificial reef that resembles a natural reef structure”. “With the 3D-printed reefs, that’s the main advantage. You’re providing the exact same structure that an actual natural reef provides, because we got the models from the reefs before they bleached. We are literally replicating it.” Having tested the 3D-printed corals’ resilience in water, Ferrari hoped to plant some on the Great Barrier Reef this year. The extent of the operation and the number of sites depends on funding, though a pilot program would cost around $150,000.  Ferrari was hopeful about the potential to save the Great Barrier Reef, she said, despite the doomsaying about its prospects. Though large parts of the northern end had died from sustained bleaching, the south was “pretty much intact”. “Coral reefs have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years,”she said. “Because of the connectivity of the Great Barrier Reef, this type of approach will still work. You put the reefs down and the coral larvae will arrive from other parts of the reef.”   But, she warned, any local initiatives will be redundant if climate change – the number-one threat to reefs around the world – is not addressed at a global level. Mass bleaching brought on by increasing ocean temperatures, acidification caused by carbon emissions, and more frequent strong storms are “smashing” coral reefs on multiple fronts, said Ferrari. Without global policy to target the impacts of climate change, targeted initiatives such as the one she was proposing were essentially futile. “But if carbon emissions are curbed ... local and regional interventions can have a huge, positive impact and effect on the health and resilience of the reef. “What local initiatives can do is buy the reef a little bit of time to recover.”"
"Last week, the House “Science” committee held one of its regular hearings to dispute the validity of climate science research. Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) articulated the purpose of the hearing when speaking at a recent Heartland Institute climate science denial conference: Next week we’re going to have a hearing on our favorite subject of climate change and also on the scientific method, which has been repeatedly ignored by the so-called self-professed climate scientists  For that, Smith was rightly called out by Jeffrey Mervis at Science magazine: the chairman of the science committee in the U.S. House of Representatives acknowledged that the committee is now a tool to advance his political agenda rather than a forum to examine important issues facing the U.S. research community. Climate scientist Michael Mann was one of the witnesses testifying in last week’s hearing. In the event’s defining exchange, Mann quoted The Princess Bride, and then proceeded to quote Mervis’ condemnation of Lamar Smith: Smith responded by asserting “that is not known as an objective writer or magazine,” to which the scientific community collectively gasped in horror. This is the magazine associated with Science which, along with Nature, are the two most highly-respected peer-reviewed scientific journals in the world. Mervis has been writing about science policy for Science magazine for 24 years. Lamar Smith, on the other hand is a contributor to Breitbart, entered a Wall Street Journal op-ed into the congressional record, and said this shortly after President Trump’s inauguration: Unfortunately, as is usually the case in these hearings, despite being presented with the opportunity to learn from climate experts, most of the committee members seemed more interested in expressing their beliefs, however uninformed they might be. At the 2:04:05 mark in the hearing video, Rep. Dan Webster (R-FL) provided a perfect example of this behavior. He began by asking witness Judith Curry what causes ice ages (Milankovich cycles, which we’ve known for nearly 100 years), so that he could make the point that natural factors caused past climate changes – a point that usually leads to a common logical fallacy (presented here in cartoon form). Webster proceeded to claim it was “the standard belief of most scientists” in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an ice age. This is another long-debunked myth; in reality, most climate scientists in the 1970s were predicting impending global warming.  However, some scientists had projected that if the amount of sulfur dioxide pollution in the atmosphere were to quadruple, that would block enough sunlight to cause dramatic cooling. But since that pollution was also causing acid rain, governments developed regulations like the Clean Air Act, and sulfur levels soon declined.  The scientists’ projection wasn’t wrong; rather, the scenario didn’t happen because we took action to prevent it, much like if we take sufficient action to cut carbon pollution, we can prevent dangerous global warming. But Rep. Webster spent most of his allotted time expressing his ideologically-convenient beliefs about how clueless climate scientists are, rather than learning from the experts sitting in front of him. Dr. Mann could easily have explained this myth, but wasn’t given the opportunity. Curry spent most of her time exaggerating climate uncertainties, as she has done for years. In his first question to the witnesses, Lamar Smith made it clear that’s why she was invited (emphasis added):  What are the uncertainties, complexities, biases involved with climate science or the study of climate science that need to be considered before we can actually make informed decisions about what to do about climate science?  To be clear, it’s been decades since we’ve known enough about climate science to understand the need to take action to mitigate its risks. In fact, greater uncertainty translates into greater urgency. When driving a car on a foggy night, slowing down is the wise response to impaired vision; putting the pedal to the metal because of uncertainty as to whether there’s a brick wall ahead would be stupid. In fact, as Mann explained at the 1:09:36 mark in the video, many climate impacts are happening faster than expected. The brick wall is coming into view. Even one of the Republicans’ own witnesses, Roger Pielke Jr. argued at the 1:57:05 mark for Congress to act: My view – which may not be popular among anyone here – is that scientific uncertainty is not going to be eliminated on this topic before we have to act ... you guys might think about a low carbon tax Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) half-jokingly called this “blasphemy.” There was also a consensus among the witnesses that the Trump administration’s proposed slashing of climate research funding would be damaging and counter-productive. If Republicans want to argue that we don’t know enough to take action on climate change, cutting research funding would be grossly hypocritical. That’s like turning off the headlights and putting on sunglasses. Speaking of consensus, Mann was the only witness who accurately represented the conclusions of 97% of climate science research – a point that was frequently raised during the hearing. Fellow witness John Christy, for example, is among the less than 3% of publishing climate scientists who minimize human-caused global warming. His testimony focused on wrongly claiming that climate models have been falsified, using a flawed, debunked graph. Eventually, Lamar Smith claimed “there is no consensus; the 97% was derived from a small sample of a small sample.” My colleagues and I have a new paper addressing this claim that will be soon be published, so we’ll return to this myth within the next few weeks. There was one particularly McCarthyesque exchange at the 1:28:50 mark in which Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) inquired:  Dr. Mann, are you affiliated or associated with an association called the Union of Concerned Scientists? Dr. Mann, are you affiliated or associated with an organization called the Climate Accountability Institute?  This brought to mind a scene from The American President: Higgins’ concern is that members of the Climate Accountability Institute have suggested that if documents reveal that ExxonMobil knew of the threats its product poses (they did – we now know Exxon knew), like the tobacco industry, the company could be sued under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.  Rep. Higgins doesn’t like this idea and confronted Mann, who is a scientific advisor to many climate organizations, including the Climate Accountability Institute. However, 17 state attorneys general have already formed a coalition to investigate ExxonMobil’s activities and determine if it’s guilty of fraud, so it’s difficult to understand why Higgins would attack Dr. Mann about this in what was supposed to be a scientific hearing. Unfortunately, last week’s hearing confirmed that far too many Republican Party leaders are more interested in protecting the profits of big oil and coal companies than preserving a livable climate for future generations."
"And so it begins: the end of days. The Great Barrier Reef is bleaching for the second year in a row and now, according to the results of helicopter surveys released on Monday, it is the middle part (all 300 miles-plus of it) that is suffering the awful reef stress that comes courtesy of a warming ocean.  Coral bleaching is incredibly serious. In especially warm summers, the complex balance between the symbiotic algae and the coral becomes disrupted. To save themselves, the coral expels the algae in the hope of better times ahead. In this state, the coral becomes whitened. That’s what bleaching is. Without the algae to synthesise most of its energy, the coral operates on a kind of “standby” mode. It is vulnerable in this state. Only one third of the entire Great Barrier Reef remains unbleached. The bell, it seems, is tolling for one of the most biologically active parts of planet Earth. I watched this Great Barrier Reef story unfold, and what started out as quite a conservative bit of science reporting quickly morphed into something else. By midday, many news outlets started running with the line that the Great Barrier Reef was now in a “terminal stage” – a phrase used by one (understandably frustrated) expert in the Guardian’s coverage of the story and recycled into all sorts of other online reports, which then did loops on Twitter. “Oh Christ,” I thought, “James Delingpole is going to love this.” Skip forward a few hours and the columnist did his thing on Breitbart – don’t go looking for it, but let’s just say I was proved right. For a bleached reef is not a dead reef as you no doubt know – and the climate-change deniers have enjoyed the chance to throw around more allegations of “scaremongering” and their accusations that “Greenies don’t do science” – which is, of course, ridiculous. Such backlash from climate-change deniers like Delingpole is inevitable. But in this case, I think the conservation hand really was overplayed. Is the Great Barrier Reef really in terminal decline? Is it really done and dusted? I don’t think so. Because coral bleaching, though incredibly serious and concerning, quite simply is not death. (Indeed the scientists involved in the study themselves said: “Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals …”). Coral reefs can recover. There is reason for hope, therefore. Hope, but not complacency. Looking at other reefs around the world offers us some perspective. Of 21 reefs monitored by scientists in the Seychelles, for instance, 12 have since recovered after a coral bleaching episode in 1998. (The other nine? Now seaweed-covered ruins). In Palau, many reefs recovered within a decade after being hit by the same 1998 temperature spike. Likewise, in an isolated reef system in Western Australia, that same bleaching episode also affected 90% of the corals. For six years the reef remained bleached, but by 2010 it had recovered. This isn’t to say that all reefs can recover. But given time and enough protection from other threats, there is hope. Though bleaching events have never been known to occur back-to-back (for example in 2016 and 2017) as they have in parts of the Great Barrier Reef this year, the reef has recovered from bleaching events before in 1998 and 2002 – and no doubt before that. It can recover, given time and the security a commitment to global carbon emission targets would bring. It can, and must, survive this latest episode of bleaching. After all, the Great Barrier Reef is worth £3.5bn to the Australian economy each year, and keeps 69,000 people in work. As well as being a bubbling, spiralling three-dimensional maze of biological interactions, it’s also an economic nest-egg for Australia. What sort of government would want to squander that? So it’s not terminal, yet. Instead, the bleaching is an indicator that yet another wild place is taking a battering. That yet another flag is waving. That the climate is changing. That the incredible symbiosis of algae and coral is breaking down. We must act immediately."

"Global warming is reshuffling the ranges of animals and plants around the world with profound consequences for humanity, according to a major new analysis. Rising temperatures on land and sea are increasingly forcing species to migrate to cooler climes, pushing disease-carrying insects into new areas, moving the pests that attack crops and shifting the pollinators that fertilise many of them, an international team of scientists has said.  They warn that some movements will damage important industries, such as forestry and tourism, and that tensions are emerging between nations over shifting natural resources, such as fish stocks. The mass migration of species now underway around the planet can also amplify climate change as, for example, darker vegetation grows to replace sun-reflecting snow fields in the Arctic. “Human survival, for urban and rural communities, depends on other life on Earth,” the experts write in their analysis published in the journal Science. “Climate change is impelling a universal redistribution of life on Earth.”  This mass movement of species is the biggest for about 25,000 years, the peak of the last ice age, say the scientists, who represent more than 40 institutions around the world. “The shifts will leave ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in their wake, radically reshaping the pattern of human wellbeing … and potentially leading to substantial conflict,” the team warn. “Human society has yet to appreciate the implications of unprecedented species redistribution for life on Earth, including for human lives.” Climate change driven by human greenhouse gas emissions is not just increasing temperatures, but also raising sea levels, the acidity of the oceans and making extreme weather such as droughts and floods more frequent. All of these are forcing many species to migrate to survive. “Land-based species are moving polewards by an average of 17km per decade, and marine species by 72km per decade” said Prof Gretta Pecl at the University of Tasmania in Australia, who led the new analysis.  There are many documented examples of individual species migrating in response to global warming and some examples of extinctions. But Pecl said: “Our study demonstrates how these changes are affecting ecosystems, human health and culture in the process.” The most direct impact on humans is the movement of insects that carry diseases, such as the mosquitoes that transmit malaria shifting to new areas as they warm and where people may have little immunity. Another example is the northward spread in Europe and North America of the animal ticks that spread Lyme disease: the UK has seen a tenfold rise in cases since 2001 as winters become milder.  Food production is also being affected as crops have to be moved to cooler areas to survive, such as coffee, which will need to be grown at higher, cooler altitudes, causing deep disruption to a global industry. The pests of crops will also move, as will their natural predators, such as insects, birds, frogs and mammals. Other resources are being affected, with a third of the land used for forestry in Europe set to become unuseable for valuable timber trees in the coming decades. Important fish stocks are migrating towards the poles in search of cooler waters, with the mackerel caught in Iceland jumping from 1,700 tonnes in 2006 to 120,000 tonnes in 2010, prompting a “mackerel war” with neighbours in whose waters the fish had previously been. The benefits to humans being provided by species, and the complex ecosystems they live in, are also at risk. Mangroves, for example, are migrating polewards in Australia and in the southern US, meaning the storm protection and fish nurseries provided are being lost in some places.  The shifting of animals and plants into new areas can sometimes lead to drastic changes, as those areas have not evolved with the incomers and lack natural defences. In Australia’s seas, kelp forests are being destroyed by an influx of tropical fish that eat them, threatening the important rock lobster trade. The scientists also warn of feedback effects that can exacerbate climate change, citing the poleward spread of bark beetles in northern hemisphere forests. The beetles attack trees that may already be weakened by warmer, drier conditions, leading to more severe pest outbreaks and tree deaths. This in turn provides more fuel for forest fires, releasing more planet-warming carbon dioxide. “Climate-driven species redistributions shouldn’t only be a concern for conservation biologists – they should worry everyone,” said Nathalie Pettorelli, at the ZSL Institute of Zoology in the UK, and one of the analysis team. “The world as a whole isn’t adequately prepared to handle the range of issues emerging from species moving across local, national, and international boundaries.” She said plans to cope with climate change urgently needed to take these issues into account and said everyone could play a part in collecting much needed data on shifting species. “Citizen science can really help,” she said, with people reporting when they see new species in a region and some schemes are already set up."

"The leading conservationist Jane Goodall has condemned Donald Trump’s bid to rip up America’s climate change policies as “immensely depressing” and flying in the face of scientific evidence. The US president signed an executive order on Tuesday aimed at dismantling Barack Obama’s clean power plan, intended to limit greenhouse gases from power plants. Trump’s move calls US commitment to the Paris accord into question.  “I find it immensely depressing because many of us – not just my institute – have been working really hard to create the Paris agreement and global effort to cut carbon emissions,” Goodall told journalists ahead of a speech at American University in Washington. “Thinking that the USA isn’t going to play its part, such a major industrial country, is really very, very sad and it just means we’re going to have to work harder.” The British primatologist, renowned for her work with chimpanzees, expressed dismay that Trump and others in his administration have questioned the scientific basis of climate change. “Because I’m traveling all over the world 300 days a year, I have seen the result of climate change and we know, science has shown, that global temperatures are warming and these so-called greenhouse gases are blanketing the globe,” she said, noting that ice was melting, sea levels rising and oceans losing their ability to absorb carbon dioxide. “There’s no way we can say climate change isn’t happening: it’s happened. The argument that people give is, ‘Well, we can’t prove that human activities are the main cause of this,’ and I just heard the other day that one of the president’s people [Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency] said, ‘Well, we don’t think carbon monoxide is the main greenhouse gas.’” Speaking with quiet, calm and piercing authority, Goodall continued: “So being not a scientist in that field, I tend to listen to scientists who do work in that field, like Nicholas Stern, and I would not dream of refuting the science that shows climate change is happening. It’s happening everywhere. It’s already having devastating effects in many parts of the word and the droughts are getting worse, flooding’s getting worse, storms, hurricanes are getting more frequent and more violent. And the main thing is unpredictability: everywhere I go, people say, ‘Well, it’s not normally like that at this time of year.’” Asked whether the global effort to combat these changes could survive without the US, Goodall pointed to China and the United Arab Emirates as major investors in green energy. “I think it depends a little bit on how many coal mines the president is able to open up again, ’cos that is a problem.” In addition to the climate issue, the 82-year-old also has cause to worry about Trump’s plans to slash funding to USAid, which could hurt the Jane Goodall Institute, a wildlife and environment conservation organisation she founded in 1977. Working in six African countries, its projects include community-based conservation, girls’ education, family planning and forest protection and restoration.  Goodall is a regular visitor to the US but this is her first trip since Trump’s staggering election win last November. “It does feel different,” she acknowledged. “There is definitely a feeling of gloom and doom among all the people I know. If we allow this feeling of doom and gloom to continue then it will be very, very bad, but my job is to give people hope, and I think one of the main hopes is the fact that people have woken up: people who were apathetic before or didn’t seem to care. “Now suddenly it’s like they’ve heard a trumpet call: ‘What can we do? We have to do something.’ These are people thinking about future generations, not just themselves.” The Guardian asked Goodall what she thinks about Trump. “I’m not going to tell you, because you’ll print it,” she replied, with a laugh. Meanwhile, nearly 30 years after Gorillas in the Mist, a film starring Sigourney Weaver as the primatologist Dian Fossey, Goodall is finally going to receive the Hollywood treatment, too. The movie will be produced by the actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio’s company but Goodall does not have a view on which actor should play her. “It’s creepy to me,” she mused. “Two Janes out there.”"
"Australia will need to review its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change if Donald Trump follows through with his threat to withdraw from the treaty, according to the chair of the Turnbull government’s backbench committee on environment and energy. Craig Kelly told Guardian Australia on Wednesday he’d predicted immediately after Trump’s election that the Paris climate deal was “cactus” and he stood by that assessment. Trump on Tuesday night Australian time signed a new executive order to unravel a number of Barack Obama’s regulatory measures to combat climate change, including eliminating the clean power plan, which sets limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit. The latest executive order is seen as a prelude to the US following through with the campaign commitment to withdraw from the Paris deal. Australian conservatives are watching events in the US closely. Kelly said he was aware of the new executive order, and if Trump went the extra step and withdrew from the Paris agreement: “I think we have to review it.” The former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi, who now sits on the crossbench, holds the same view. “It is clear America intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement and it would be folly for Australia to be part of it,” Bernardi said. “I don’t think we should subsume our national interest to international bodies.” Bernardi this week sparked a rebellion inside the government by proposing to disallow an extradition treaty with China on the basis the country’s legal system was deficient. The disallowance motion prompted a number of Liberals to express opposition to the extradition treaty. If Trump withdraws from the Paris deal, Bernardi will likely use the development as a recruitment drive for his new Australian Conservatives movement, which will put pressure on conservative MPs in the government. Kelly, who chairs the government’s backbench committee on climate and energy, has been campaigning internally for months, arguing that the federal renewable energy target should be frozen at its current level. The Sydney Liberal backbencher said regardless of what the US ultimately did, he had concerns about what the Paris deal could achieve. Kelly said even if you accepted that fiddling with “the CO2 knob” could influence climate change, he had doubts that countries could meet their Paris commitments “without a technological breakthrough”. Asked whether a majority of his Coalition colleagues would be in favour of quitting the Paris deal in the event Trump pulled out, Kelly argued “it would be a close run thing”. He said government MPs were under pressure from voters who believed renewable energy targets were responsible for higher power prices. The prime minister has signalled Australia will stay the course if the Trump administration follows through with its threats to quit the Paris deal. Turnbull told reporters last November it would take four years to withdraw from the agreement after ratification."

"When Hazelwood stops generating electricity this week, it will be the first Australian power station to close, at least in part, because of climate change. Hazelwood’s owner, French energy giant Engie, has said it is “making climate a priority” and has committed to retiring its most outdated coal plants worldwide.  Hazelwood’s closure will bring the total to nine coal power stations in Australia that have retired in the last five years – including the Port Augusta power stations in South Australia, the Munmorah and Wallerawang power stations in New South Wales and the smaller Energy Brix and Anglesea power stations in Victoria. It’s a clear indication the global industrial transition from coal to renewable energy across the world has reached our shores.  Like all such transitions, this one will involve a big upheaval for the affected workers, but never before has an industrial transition had so much else at stake. Never before has the end of one industry been so essential to the wellbeing of the rest of society.  Burning coal for electricity accounts for a third of Australia’s greenhouse gas pollution. It is the country’s largest single source of carbon dioxide, and it’s likely to be the easiest to reduce – cutting climate pollution from more diffuse sectors such as transport and agriculture will be more challenging. Globally, the International Energy Agency identified phasing out inefficient coal power stations as a key plank in any effective global agreement on climate change. Domestically, the Australian Energy Market Operator has estimated  we would need to close the equivalent of another five large coal power stations (a total of about 8700MW of capacity) by 2030 in order to meet even the Turnbull government’s manifestly weak climate targets. Targets more in line with keeping global warming under 2C involve closing one Hazelwood-sized power station each year from now on. While coal generators have been closing, they have not necessarily been closing in a way that serves local communities: the closures at those nine power stations in the past five years have given workers an average of just four months’ notice from announcement to turning off the boilers. For communities where coal is a large part of the regional economy, this is too little notice.  But neither have they been closing in the best way for our climate. Economics has driven decisions. Unprofitable generators – the lame animal in the moving pack that is the National Electricity Market – have stumbled and fallen quite suddenly, but these power stations aren’t necessarily the worst or biggest polluters. A Senate inquiry into the retirement of coal-fired power stations, due to report this week, provides an opportunity to move the public debate beyond political blame games and into the realm of responsible policymaking. In recent months, green groups, business groups, unions and even the energy industry itself have called for a greater government role in planning the phaseout of coal-burning power stations. For communities, knowing when a power station will close gives much-needed impetus to diversify the regional economy. While Hazelwood’s closure came with just five months’ notice, the state and federal governments have pulled together transition plans worth over $300m. Time will tell whether this is sufficient to smoothen the local impacts, but repeating this level of funding for the remaining 20 coal generators could mean finding $6bn in government budgets in coming years. For clean-energy investors, knowing when a power station will close gives confidence about when new renewables projects will be needed. A timeline for the retirement of Australia’s remaining fleet of coal-burning power stations would provide this certainty. There’s a compelling case that to avoid energy market chaos, we need to set closure dates from now until 2030. Even some big power companies are on board. AGL, owner of three large coal power stations, has previously advocated for setting 50-year lifetime limits on each generator. Energy Australia recently argued that companies should be required to provide much earlier notice of when their own generators will close. As of next week, Energy Australia’s Yallourn power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley will be the dirtiest coal generator in the country, and one of the oldest. The company’s public position that it will remain open until 2032 seems unlikely at best and deceptive at worst – a deception that has consequences for workers, communities and energy markets. Scepticism is warranted: Hazelwood’s owners gave the same 2032 closure date just months before announcing the power station would bow out in March 2017. Last month the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority warned that companies need to appropriately manage their exposure to climate risks, effectively putting the owners of coal-burning power stations on notice. Telling shareholders an asset might be open for another 15 years when a much shorter life is likely, or even possible, could have serious legal consequences. We don’t have to choose between coal power and renewables – community attitudes and energy markets have already decided. The choices now are about speed and justice. Will this industrial transition be fast enough to avoid the worst risks to our climate, and fair enough to sustain regional communities? Will it be chaotic and disruptive, or planned and orderly? Hazelwood stops generating this week, but these questions will linger until we finally have a national, long-term plan to phase out Australia’s remaining coal-burning power stations."

"For the out-of-work coal miners in West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is the pied piper leading them nowhere. Dismantling the Obama administration’s clean power plan will not bring back coal jobs or save the withering towns of Appalachia. It will only serve to make America sicker and disappoint some misguided people.   On Tuesday, flanked by company executives and miners, Trump signed an executive order to swiftly nullify Barack Obama’s efforts to combat climate change. The clean power plan would have closed hundreds of coal-fired power plants, frozen construction at new ones and replaced them, in time, with wind and solar farms. Whether Trump withdraws from the Paris agreement or not, he will all but guarantee that American doesn’t meet the ambitious goals of the accord to drastically reduce greenhouse gases and slow the warming of the planet.    Some sneer at the largely white and poor people who depended on coal for their livelihoods, but their distress is understandable. Morally bankrupt political leaders have lied to them repeatedly, blaming the Environmental Protection Agency for the vast decline of coal country’s fortunes. While Republicans deserve far more blame, Democrats in states such as West Virginia have encouraged this canard: all you have to do is deregulate everything, they say, and the boom times will return.   Even coal executives understand how simplistic this narrative really is. Competition from natural gas is the culprit for coal’s struggles. Renewable energies are gaining a greater market share. And automation at coal plants means fewer jobs for the working class, even when executives increase their profit margin.  Cheap natural gas has changed the energy landscape. New drilling techniques in shale fields across the country have lowered production costs and driven energy prices down. Hydraulic fracturing, where millions of gallons of sand, water and chemicals are pumped underground to break open rock and release gas, is driving this energy revolution – while also polluting groundwater.   There just isn’t a market demand for coal. Production peaked two decades ago. Trump’s electoral sweep of Appalachia – in once Democratic West Virginia, he crushed Hillary Clinton by 42 points – undoubtedly motivated him to kill the clean power plan as quickly as he could, since his voters are particularly desperate. Political leaders keep failing them, and they want easy answers.   In the short term, Trump’s actions may make a slight difference. Share prices of energy companies soared this week. A few coal mines may stay open slightly longer.   But as with Trump’s Twitter bullying of companies to keep jobs in the US, stripping Obama regulations is no strategy for saving the jobs and towns of one of the country’s most economically depressed regions. America’s fraying social safety net and capitalism’s capriciousness punished coal country for decades, forcing poor people to rely on the whims of executives who once profited off the destruction of the planet.   Trump offers no serious hope for the millions of blue-collar workers who are losing their jobs to machines. Rather than shred environmental regulations, he can offer a vision for a future that is phasing out the reality of well-paid laborers with only a high school degree. A stimulus plan to put them to work elsewhere or even something akin to a guaranteed minimum income may be needed – not a shortsighted evisceration of what Trump Svengali Steve Bannon dubbed the “administrative state”. When coal country keeps foundering, what will the loud-mouthed president say then? What lies will he proffer? Even his supporters deserve better. "
"Just before the Rio Earth summit 25 years ago, John Major, in whose cabinet I then served as environment secretary, made a bold prediction: reducing Britain’s carbon emissions in line with recommendations of climate science would not, he said, harm our economy: “Our initial measures ... will bring a worthwhile economic payoff to the country, to business and to ordinary people.” This was a controversial statement at a time when solar energy, for example, was a costly technology better suited to spacecraft than British rooftops. And indeed the argument can still be heard that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will ruin our economies – even that it will return us to a pre-industrial living standard.  A quarter of a century later, the approach that we took has been richly vindicated. As research published on Monday by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit demonstrates, in that period the average Briton has grown richer faster than citizens of any other G7 nation; at the same time, his or her carbon footprint has fallen faster than in any other G7 nation. While it would be stretching reality to argue that Britain’s economic success has been driven by its climate change policies, no one can seriously argue any more that our climate policies have generated economic harm. I would argue that there are three principal factors why Britain tops the G7 league in terms of growing our economy while reducing our carbon emissions. We started earlier than most, we have been consistent, and we have used market forces wherever possible. Certainly our decision now looks to have been a prudent investment. British companies in low-carbon goods and services already turn over an estimated £83bn per year; and with Brexit opening the door for a new era of free trade with major countries in Asia and Latin America, most of which are pursuing their own clean energy transitions, this sector has the potential to become a major engine of trade and growth. When I was negotiating the UN climate convention 25 years ago, the reality was that we did not know what it would cost to fulfil the treaty’s goal of preventing “dangerous” climate change. Science had not clearly told us what degree of global warming would be “dangerous”; nor did any government have a fully fledged plan for reversing the upward tide of carbon emissions. We acted in the absence of perfect information because we had to. Margaret Thatcher had warned world leaders three years previously that humanity was “changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways”, and that the only route to curbing it was a global treaty that did not constrain economic growth – because only growing economies would be able to afford the investment necessary to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. To a certain extent, her global climate treaty was a leap of faith in both the probity and the innovative capacity of humankind. Since 1992 science has shown us ever more clearly what “dangerous” climate change looks like. Meanwhile, evidence has been growing that a transition to a low-carbon economy is economically feasible, and will bring added benefits such as cleaner air in major cities. These two factors drove all governments to conclude the Paris agreement in 2015. Globally, carbon emissions have remained flat for the past three years, even as the world economy has grown by 7.5%. China and India are fast reversing their previous policies of building greater fleets of coal-fired power stations. Replacing our own use of coal with gas and renewable energy has brought UK carbon emissions down to a level last seen during the general strike of 1926. Yet neither these remarkable developments nor the Paris agreement will secure a stable climate. The latest science tells us that greenhouse gas emissions need to start declining by 2020 at the latest in order to give reasonable confidence that global warming will stay well below the 2C limit, the target governments adopted in Paris. So, having halted the once unstoppable tide, the next logical step is to reverse it – and quickly. This is the mission on which a new initiative launched by Christiana Figueres, until recently the UN’s top climate official, will embark this coming week. Figueres is to be commended for her vision. The rationale remains exactly that which the British government put forward 25 years ago: thatunchecked, climate change presents unacceptable risks for the future. Fortunately these are not risks that we have to take. Britain has proved the doom-mongers wrong: economies can thrive while emissions fall. Now let us put our collective weight behind the Figueres initiative, and finish the job."
"The fossil fuel industry is rejoicing. Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that would tear up many of the so-called burdensome climate protections – those regulating things like power plant emissions and leasing to coal companies – put in place by the Obama administration. Horrified by this move, many have vowed to jump to their defense.  That’s not enough.  The clean power plan, perhaps the biggest target of today’s executive order, is far from perfect. It’s a parallel of sorts to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare. Both policies – however flawed – address deeply pressing crises that will kill millions if left unaddressed. Each are far preferable to nothing, of course. But they were each crafted to appease Republicans, many of whom are funded by the industries (insurance and fossil fuels, namely) that the measures set out to curtail. So while the clean power plan was not a result of the kind of legislative sausage-making that birthed Obamacare, it still bears the trademark of the Democratic establishment’s politics of compromise. That’s why we must do more than simply defending existing policies: now is the moment to fight for something better. Like the ACA, the clean power plan is wildly complicated, creating a patchwork of regulations alongside a vast and incomprehensible new marketplace. States who don’t comply in creating their own plans would be automatically entered into a national emissions trading scheme.  Unlike the ACA, the clean power plan has yet to save any lives. It’s also horrendously difficult to explain – let alone appeal – to ordinary Americans. Given all this, its gutting is unlikely to provoke the same kind of public outcry that helped saved the ACA. Defending the clean power plan shouldn’t obscure the fact that we need so much more. A 2013 study in Nature, co-authored by 14 climate scientists, predicts that, left unchecked, warming will reach a “point of no return” by 2020 in the tropics, triggering still more disastrous impacts in a part of the world already dealing with climactic fallout.  The global north could experience similarly “unprecedented warming” by 2047. To put that in perspective, when the proverbial shit really starts hitting the fan, vis-a-vis climate in the US, I’ll still be seven years away from being able to collect Social Security. “Within my generation,” lead author Camilo Mora told Bloomberg, “whatever climate we were used to will be a thing of the past.” A new and slightly more hopeful study in the journal Science outlines a roadmap to keeping warming below 2C (3.6F), the target set out by world leaders in the Paris climate deal. Chief among the researchers’ recommendations is cutting global emission in half every decade from the 2020s to the 2040s, with the most rapid decarbonization occurring in wealthy nations like the US – a far cry from the just over 30% cuts to one sector outlined by the clean power plan.  “By 2020, all cities and major corporations in the industrialized world should have decarbonization strategies in place,” the papers authors write, adding that industrialized countries should stop selling gas-powered cars in the next 10 years. Any earnest attempt at staying below 2C, then, means a head-on collision with oil, coal and natural gas executives. It also presents a chance to upend who holds power in our economy. Mustering anywhere near the political will necessary to enact changes as ambitious as the ones science demands means giving working people a stake in the climate fight and the policies it’s pushing for.  Technocratic jargon won’t cut it, but the silver lining of the climate crisis careening toward us is that the solutions to it lend themselves to populist times. In addition to taking on a fossil-fueled 1%, curbing greenhouse gas emissions also means fueling job creation in everything from clean energy to insulation to grid electrification to already low-carbon parts of our economy, such as nursing and healthcare. In this vein, greens should take a page from those who fought to defend the ACA, itself a horrifically insufficient program. While the Republican’s doomed replacement would have left 52 million people uninsured by 2026, the ACA itself stands to leave 28 million uninsured along the same timeline.  Neither figure is acceptable in a society which claims to care about keeping people healthy and alive. That’s why several unions – joined by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders – have used the opportunity provided by the Republicans’ “Trumpcare” debacle to push for single-payer healthcare, or “Medicare for All”, and to extend healthcare to all Americans. A livable planet is no less of a right than healthcare, and climate policy should treat it as such. So defend the clean power plan from Trump’s attacks, because God knows we need it. But don’t forget to demand the changes we really need along the way."
"It was only a few weeks ago that I wrote about changes to extreme weather in a warming world. That prior article dealt with the increase of extreme precipitation events as the Earth warms. I termed the relationship a thermodynamic one; it was driven by local thermodynamic processes. But extreme weather can also occur because of large-scale changes to the atmosphere and oceans. This issue is the topic of another just-published paper that makes a convincing case for a whole new type of influence of humans on extreme weather. In a certain sense, this study confirms what was previously reported here and here. With the march of science, the tools, methods, and evidence get better each year. Before getting into the study, a little background. The jet stream(s) are high-speed rivers of air that flow in the upper atmosphere. There’s more than one jet stream; they blow west to east and they mark the separation of zones of different temperatures. A good primer on jet streams is available here.   If you were to stand at the northern pole and travel southwards, you would experience a gradual increase in temperature. However, when you reached the first jet stream (the Polar Jet), temperatures would rapidly become warmer. That is, the Polar Jet separates two different temperature air regions. Typically, if you are north of the jet stream, you are in a colder zone whereas if you are south of the stream, it is warmer. Sometimes, the jet streams undulate as they encircle the planet and these undulations move. So, sometimes you happen to be in a position north and sometimes south of the stream, even though your location is fixed.  The interface between warm and cold temperatures creates a lot of weather-pattern changes. In addition, if the undulations of the streams become fixed, it means your weather patterns will get stuck. For instance, you could find yourself in an upward undulation for weeks or longer and experience warm and potentially dry weather. Alternatively, if your location is north of a stuck jet undulation, you may experience persistent cold weather. Perhaps even more importantly, these stuck waves can become larger in their magnitude. So, scientists really want to know what affects these undulations – both their magnitudes and their persistence. We also want to know whether these undulations will change in a warming planet. This is precisely where the new study comes in. The researchers used both weather observations and climate models to answer these questions. What they found was very interesting.  Using measurements, the authors documented what conditions led to extreme weather patterns that persisted for extended durations. They found that many occur when the jet stream becomes stationary with the undulations stuck in place. They also saw that under certain situations, the jet stream undulations do not dissipate in time; they become trapped in a wave guide.  Interestingly, this pattern of a stuck jet stream would occur when the number of undulations was between six and eight. When these circumstances all lined up, according to study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf: the same weather persists for weeks on end in one region, then sunny days can turn into a serious heat wave and drought, and lasting rains can lead to flooding And this is also how humans come into the story. As humans emit greenhouse gases, the planet warms. We know that, we predicted it, and it is occurring. However, the warming is not uniform. The Arctic, for instance, is warming more rapidly than the rest of the planet. As a result, the temperature difference between the Arctic and the rest of the world is reducing. It is this temperature difference that maintains the jet stream patterns. As stated by lead author, Michael Mann:  The warming of the Arctic, the polar amplification of warming, plays a key role here. The surface and lower atmosphere are warming more in the arctic than anywhere else on the globe. That pattern projects onto the very temperature gradient profile that we identify as supporting atmospheric waveguide conditions.  The authors compared the observations to computer models and they found similar patterns. The authors went on to say in a press release: Using the simulations, we demonstrate that rising greenhouse gases are responsible for the increase ... We are now able to connect the dots when it comes to human-caused global warming and an array of extreme recent weather events. This is really where the science is. We know humans are causing climate change and we know that weather will change as this process evolves. What we really want to know is how human-caused climate change will influence extreme weather. It’s extreme weather like droughts, floods, heat waves, etc. that cause high social and economic costs. These authors have concluded a convincing study that connects the dots. Perhaps the study is best summarized by Michael Mann, who said: We came as close as one can to demonstrating a direct link between climate change and a large family of extreme recent weather events."
"This week brought fresh outrage from conservatives as the new secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, told the National Press Club “neoliberalism has run its course” and Paul Keating, seen by many as a neoliberal champion, agreed with her. But rather than provoke cries of communism and class warfare, for anyone who has been paying attention over the past decade, the correct response to McManus and Keating’s assertions should be “well, duh”. McManus’s speech, in which she not only rang the death knell for neoliberalism but reiterated the right for unions to resist unjust laws (pretty much a central tenet of unions ever since unions were first illegally formed in the 1800s) drew the expected shrieks from the right. The Australian’s editorial, for example, referred to it as “class warfare”, and Peter Dutton called her a “modern-day communist”.  It’s always class warfare when those representing the low paid worry about inequality. When the most powerful business executives in Australia come to parliament and demand their companies get a tax cut – as occurred on the same day as McManus’s speech – class warfare is never mentioned.  That’s because neoliberals see company tax cuts as good for workers. A lower company tax, so the theory goes, leads to increased investment, which in turns increases productivity and leads to better pay for workers. It’s a nice theory, and one that works nicely so long as you ignore that over the past decade productivity has risen while real wages have barely grown.  The great thing about neoliberalism (a bit of a dopey term, that really just means “small government-pro-market” policies) is that it always works so long as you ignore all the times it doesn’t. In the 1980s, neoliberal economic reforms did work well, if you ignore the 1987 stock market crash and the deepest post-second world war recession Australia has ever seen. The great period of moderation from the early 1990s onwards, where monetary policy took over the role of stimulating the economy from government spending, also worked well so long as you ignore rising inequality, declining levels of infrastructure, housing affordability, the global financial crisis and the growth of radicalism which has seen racism and xenophobia come into major parties, and a situation where a senator of this country can actually lament in a mainstream newspaper that “many Jews want to suppress Holocaust denialism”. And the reality is we didn’t need to wait for the GFC to know there were problems with letting the market rule. In climate change, we have the biggest market failure in the history of economics.  For pro-free marketers climate change is a nasty bur in their shoe. If you accept climate change could lead to rising sea levels, coastal inundation, dislocation of large masses of people, increased intensity of tropical storms and droughts, and grave risks to food and water supply, then you have to accept the market failed to account for such impacts and not only allowed, but ensured they would happen. Little wonder many free marketeer thinktanks and political parties have instead embraced lunatic theories about climate change being a conspiracy involving the UN, Nasa, every university in the world, China, all major meteorological bodies, the World Bank and the makers of tin foil hats.  Delusion is preferable to admitting fault.  The love of neoliberalism also sees in Australia an odd nostalgia for the 1980s – a time where under the Hawke government “reform” flourished. Much like the belief in the infallibility of the small government/pro-market policy, the conservative nostalgia for the 1980s only makes sense if you ignore many things. Yes, when the Hawke government took power in 1983 it brought with it a smaller government outlook – where balancing the budget was crucial, and where lowering tariffs, privatising assets and letting the market operate was championed. But it was also a government that introduced the capital gains tax, the fringe benefit tax, the petroleum resources rent tax, Medicare and the Accord.  It was also a long time ago. We are now as close to the 1983 election of the Hawke government as people at that time were to the 1949 election of the Menzies government. Arguing Hawke and Keating’s approach to the economy is the path to follow is roughly as sensible as someone in the 1980s suggesting Ben Chifley’s policy to nationalise the banks was worth exploring.  Policy moves forward and good policy should react to failures. And right now there is a lot of failure. From 1990 to 2007 the seven largest economies in the world grew on average by 2.3% each year; since 2010 (which leaves out the two horror GFC years of 2008 and 2009) that growth has averaged just 1.7%.  In Australia over the same two periods the average growth level has gone from 3.3% to 2.6%. Things have flatlined so greatly since the GFC that the Treasury now views Australia’s long-term average growth level as 2.75% rather than the previous level of 3%. And remember this is at a period where interest rates and wages growth are at record lows and industrial disputes at near record lows.  So when Paul Keating this week responded to McManus’ statement by saying that “since 2008 ... we have a comatose world economy held together by debt and central bank money”, he was stating the bleeding obvious.  Such has been the record of the world economy over the past 10 years that you would start to question Keating’s intelligence were he not to assert that “liberal economics has run into a dead end and has had no answer to the contemporary malaise”. It is a view even the IMF – the former arch champions of neoliberalism – are also arguing. Last year researchers for the IMF argued the benefits from austerity measures (the most beloved neoliberal measure) were “fairly difficult to establish” but that “the costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent”. That doesn’t mean we need to return to the 1970s, but neither does it mean we regard all the movements since the 1980s as positive – whether it be the push for ever lower company taxes, greater industrial relations flexibility, reduced government spending, falling real Newstart payments, failed work-for-the-dole schemes, taxation policy that rewards property speculation and lack of government intrusion to deal with climate change either through a price on carbon or investments in renewable energy and the energy market.  Sally McManus isn’t being radical when she argues that neoliberalism has run its course, she is merely responding to evidence. "
"The fingerprint of human-caused climate change has been found on heatwaves, droughts and floods across the world, according to scientists. The discovery indicates that the impacts of global warming are already being felt by society and adds further urgency to the need to cut carbon emissions. A key factor is the fast-melting Arctic, which is now strongly linked to extreme weather across Europe, Asia and north America.  Rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have long been expected to lead to increasing extreme weather events, as they trap extra energy in the atmosphere. But linking global warming to particular events is difficult because the climate is naturally variable. The new work analysed a type of extreme weather event known to be caused by changes in “planetary waves” – such as California’s ongoing record drought, and recent heatwaves in the US and Russia, as well as severe floods in Pakistan in 2010. Planetary waves are a pattern of winds, of which the jet stream is a part, that encircle the northern hemisphere in lines that undulate from the tropics to the poles. Normally, the whole wave moves eastwards but, under certain temperature conditions, the wave can halt its movement. This leaves whole regions under the same weather for extended periods, which can turn hot spells into heatwaves and wet weather into floods. This type of extreme weather event is known to have increased in recent decades. But the new research used observations and climate models to show that the chances of the conditions needed to halt the planetary waves occurring are significantly more likely as a result of global warming. “Human activity has been suspected of contributing to this pattern before, but now we uncover a clear fingerprint of human activity,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Pennsylvania State University in the US and who led the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.  Kai Kornhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany and another member of the research team, said: “We looked into dozens of different climate models, as well as into observational data, and it turns out that the temperature distribution favouring planetary wave stalling increased in almost 70% of the simulations.” Large scale wind patterns are largely driven by the temperature difference between the poles and the tropics. But global warming is altering this difference because the Arctic is heating up faster than lower latitudes and because land areas are heating up faster than the oceans. Recent changes in the Arctic are particularly striking, with record low levels of ice cover and extremely unusual high temperatures. “Things in the Arctic are happening much faster than we expected,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, also at PIK.  “It is not just a problem of nature conservation or polar bears, it is about a threat to human society that comes from these rapid changes,” he said. “This is because it hits us with increasing extreme events in the highly populated centres in the mid-latitudes. It also affects us through sea level rise, which is hitting shores globally. So these changes that are going on in the Arctic should concern everyone.” Other climate research, called attribution, is increasingly able to calculate how much more likely specific extreme weather events have been made by global warming. For example, the heatwave in south-eastern Australia in February was made twice as likely by climate change, while Storm Desmond, which caused heavy flooding in the UK in 2015, was made 40% more likely."
"When does a social attitude become morally unacceptable enough that it is OK to challenge and confront it? That is the question that motivated a new study conducted at the University of Exeter in which participants were given descriptions of people being confronted after expressing certain views. When the views expressed a disregard for racial equality, the confrontations were approved of. But challenging – even politely – a disregard for climate change was seen as carrying a social cost by the students taking part in the experiment.   Participants in the study felt less warm towards the character in the scenario (and were less likely to want to be friends with them) when they challenged views dismissive of climate change. The findings add to a long line of research showing the importance of social norms in guiding people’s attitudes and behaviours. But they might also tell us something important about the value of publicly debunking climate change contrarians. Clearly, neither people nor the planet are well-served by accepting, propagating or ignoring myths and falsehoods. But the potential collateral damage caused by challenging climate denial is important to consider too. It is well known that what drives people’s views on climate change are values and political ideology rather than levels of knowledge about climate science. Dismissing climate change has become a social norm on the right of US politics – reaction to the Republican party’s dismantling of Barack Obama’s energy policies is the most vivid current example – and is present to a lesser extent in the UK. What if debunking climate sceptics allows minor battles to be won, but risks losing the bigger fight for public opinion by stepping over invisible but powerful social lines? Bridging the ideological divide on climate change is essential. But that means changing the prevailing social norms – not ignoring them. While a lot of attention has been given to communicating the scientific consensus on climate change and concerns raised about the fact that people consistently underestimate it, the social consensus may be just as important. Several studies have shown that while most people in the UK are in favour of renewables, they don’t think other people are. Because of the continuing social silence around climate change and the space given to contrarian views in the media, the sense that other people don’t care is widespread – even when they do. Emphasising positive social norms is an important way of dispelling misconceptions around others’ views, and can help build momentum for a society to move towards lower carbon emissions. A commitment to the truth is a non-negotiable component of any credible communication around climate change, but campaign strategies also need to go with the grain of human behaviour. And if the unsettling swing towards “post-truth” discourse has taught us anything, it is that being right is not the same thing as being persuasive. Climate communicators need to get better at doing both at the same time. "

"The cooling effect of Cyclone Debbie will not be enough to prevent further mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, a leading marine scientist has said. The category-four tropical storm made landfall on the north Queensland coast on Tuesday, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Airlie Beach, Proserpine and Bowen were among the worst hit, though Hamilton, Hayman and Daydream islands were also affected. The extent of the devastation wrought by the slow-moving cyclone on the embattled reef remains to be seen but suggestions that the wild weather could prevent further mass bleaching have been downplayed. The environmental charity OceanWatch had expressed hope that the cooling effect of Cyclone Debbie on ocean temperatures could have alleviated the pressure the reef is under and prevented further bleaching. Temperatures of between 23C and 29C are optimum for coral but the Great Barrier Reef has suffered through unusually warm waters in 2017 and much of 2016, prompting sustained, and in some cases, severe bleaching. OceanWatch suggested that the wild weather would have brought deeper, cooler water to the surface while shading the coral from the sun, reducing light stress. But Prof Terry Hughes, the director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told Guardian Australia that the effects of Cyclone Debbie would not prevent further mass bleaching events, as the most severe damage this year had occurred north of her path. “Cyclone Debbie has come a month too late and in the wrong place to prevent mass bleaching,” he said. The centre began reef-wide aerial surveys on 16 March, though further activities were delayed by Debbie. Preliminary information from the first survey showed that all reefs assessed between Cairns and Lockhart river showed some signs of bleaching, ranging from mild to severe. Last week Hughes had flown over the reefs between Mackay and Townsville, which he said were “only very lightly bleached compared to reefs further north”. “The cloud and wind has cooled down the sea temperature, which might help the lightly bleached corals near the cyclone recover their colour more quickly. But it’s too late for further north.” The storm had also likely caused structural damage to some coral that, already weakened by bleaching, may struggle to recover. Earlier this month, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority confirmed “moderate to severe” mass coral bleaching for the second consecutive year. The Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson raised the devastating impact of the bleaching in the Senate on Wednesday. He quoted Hughes’s tweet last year: “I showed the results of aerial surveys of bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, and then we wept.” I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept. pic.twitter.com/bry5cMmzdn This drew a mocking response from the Liberals, with the South Australian senator Simon Birmingham replying that “Senator Whish-Wilson needs a lot more than a hanky ... [he] needs a reality check”. I quoted @profterryhughes saying ""I showed the results of bleaching on the reef to my students & then we wept"". Watch the govt response. pic.twitter.com/uSTf3zUGMc"
"The former Liberal party leader John Hewson and sustainable energy entrepreneur Simon Holmes à Court are among the signatories to a new open letter urging Malcolm Turnbull to implement three urgent reforms to the energy market to lower prices and emissions, and improve network security. The Australia Institute has taken out a full-page advertisement in Wednesday’s Australian Financial Review calling on the government to act before the peaks in electricity demand hit next summer.  The group says demand peaks can be reduced by “changing market rules to allow very large consumers such as smelters to profit from demand management, such as via the proposed five-minute settlement rule.” It says the government should adopt software systems to aggregate large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers into virtual peak plants that will provide safe and scheduled reductions in load, on commercially competitive terms. The group also says new markets need to be built for additional services to reflect changing demands and technology. The call to action is backed by the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill. With national energy politics locked in a bitter partisan battle, the SA government recently unveiled a $550m plan to boost energy self-sufficiency in the state. Weatherill told Guardian Australia: “It’s clear there’s now broad acceptance the national energy market is broken.” “We’re supportive of the measures advanced in the letter, and we’ve been advocating for them at the national level,” the premier said. Weatherill said South Australia would also continue to press the Turnbull government to introduce an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity market. The Turnbull government has ruled out pursuing carbon trading despite a growing consensus among business, scientific and energy experts that an intensity scheme would create certainty for investors and lower emissions at least cost to households and businesses. The push is also backed by the leader of the NXT, Nick Xenophon – who used a company tax deal with the Turnbull government last week to extract some undertakings on energy policy. Xenophon said the Australia Institute, and the signatories to the open letter had “a positive role to play in suggesting changes to market rules.” “I think this is an important contribution to the debate,” he said. The Australia Institute’s executive director, Ben Oquist, says the problems in Australia’s energy market require a medium-term fix, but that doesn’t preclude the government taking immediate remedial action. “While major new energy infrastructure can take years to finance and build, there are several actions that Australian governments could adopt immediately and in the medium term that would lower costs, enhance security and reduce emissions,” Oquist said. He said the five minute settlement rule had the backing of the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Energy Regulator, as well as other key industry and energy experts. “It’s a straightforward change with wide-ranging benefits, most important of which will be create conditions to attract investment from fast responding energy technologies, such as batteries,” Oquist said. The current rules see generators bid to supply power to the national market in five-minute intervals, but prices are determined over 30-minute intervals. Critics of the current system say it is open to gaming by generators, who can create price spikes at the opening of a trading period before lowering their bids at the tail end of the interval – which has the practical effect of increasing wholesale prices. Proponents of a change to a five-minute rule says the current process doesn’t allow sufficient capacity for battery technology to be part of a solution to smoothing out price spikes. The Australian Energy Market Commission is considering submissions on potential rule changes, and is expected to provide a preliminary view this month."
"Countries need to stop using outdated fiscal policies for agriculture. In some places, such as Brazil and Indonesia, the amount spent by their governments on subsidising agriculture is more than 100 times higher than the international funding provided to those countries for forest conservation. It sends out a contradictory message if a government is signing up to zero deforestation commitments on one hand, whilst simultaneously making deforestation more attractive to farmers.   Some countries are taking positive steps, however. Ecuador, for example, has 27 different subsidies to support palm oil production. Once they found out that some of these subsidies can harm forests, the ministers of environment and agriculture got together and agreed to review the country’s fiscal policy framework, to better align it with sustainable development. We need more of these types of holistic, coherent policy reforms. Tim Christophersen, UN-REDD team leader, UN Environment, Nairobi, Kenya @TimChristo Forest dwellers are best placed be the first ones to indicate threats and call for help. In the past, radio units were installed in some indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon and they did wonders. I think the more we invest in getting low cost tech resources like this to people living in forests, the more we will get in return to fight deforestation. There are 20 million people living in the Brazilian Amazon, we should support their role in protecting their forests. They are the best park rangers as their cultures and livelihoods depend on healthy forests. Yet support rarely reaches them. Rachel Biderman, director for World Resources Institute Brazil, World Resources Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil @rachel_biderman There is a lack of understanding about the pressures and demands being placed on forests and dialogue around alternative sustainable options. For example, we know that in sub-saharan Africa the vast majority of wood is used for household energy – this puts enormous pressure on local forests and reflects the really tough choices poor local communities have to make every day. Elsewhere the choice is often between keeping forests standing or removing them for agriculture to take place. It appears a binary choice but it should not be. Going forward we need to think about how these pressures can be best absorbed - having a full and frank dialogue with all the people involved is essential. Ian Gray, coordinator, Forest Investment Program, Washington DC, USA It’s essential for the protection and restoration of tropical forests to actively dispute the false dichotomy between environmental stewardship and economic development.  Even in the short term the evidence is that countries are generally much better off – in terms of the productivity of their agriculture, in terms of local environmental benefits, in terms of social justice – through well-managed land use that combines forest protection and restoration with sustainable management of forests and higher productivity agriculture, than with the model now often prevailing.  Several governments are realising this and taking measures to change the paradigm. Brazil’s remarkable reduction in deforestation in the Amazon went hand in hand with impressive agricultural growth. Per Pharo, director, The Norwegian Climate and Forest Initiative, Oslo, Norway If companies want to meet the zero deforestation target by 2020, they need to increase their ambitions and be more effective at implementation. They have to set up effective monitoring systems that are transparent, so consumers can hold them accountable. Governments also have a role to play in supporting companies meet these targets. For example, Brazil has a lot of data that would help companies to control their whole supply chain, but it is not available. The commercialisation of illegally sourced cattle is an example. The information that would allow companies to monitor indirect suppliers is not shared with them. Cristiane Mazzetti, Greenpeace Amazon campaigner, Greenpeace Brazil, Manaus, Brazil @crmazzet Companies need to activate partners in forested countries to closely monitor their supply chains. They cannot do it by satellite images only. NGOs, communities and indigenous groups can all help in monitoring what is going on close to the ground, but companies need to invest some money if they want the job done properly. Rachel Biderman In a previous role I was responsible for implementing such commitments for a large multinational firm and I can tell you from direct experience the primary bottleneck is cost. Sustainable supply chains, especially in forest products, are expensive. A verified sustainable source generally costs about three times more than a traditional source. However, there are some environmental NGOs who are amazing partners in helping develop unique approaches to building sustainable forest product supply chains. Greenpeace for example, has consistently provided accurate and genuine guidance. Guardian commenter Cateernaut Brazil has shown the effectiveness of indigenous territories in maintaining forest cover. The Xingu reserve can be seen from space! But national policy action is needed to give those territories the status of legally recognised protected areas backed up by the state. Similarly, the Katingan Project in central Kalimantan, Indonesia has been effective in controlling peat fires but in order to operate, the project needs a government permit, as well as protection from ill-thought-out national policies. Thus, local and national action should go hand-in-hand. Frances Seymour, senior fellow, Center for Global Development, Washington DC, USA @FrancesJSeymour @CGDev Incentive-based forest protection schemes can work if the incentives are sufficiently strong. But presently there is not enough funding around for that to happen. There is also a very important question of who to incentivise. Under the UN Climate Change Convention the answer has been that countries must be incentivised because this is a public policy issue. Then countries must decide how to structure their efforts: taxes, enforcement, regulations or incentives, but most likely a mix of all.  Deforestation is rising again in the Amazon and there is a good case to be made that this has been caused by less vigilance on enforcement, not over-reliance on incentives. Bottom line: laws and regulations that are well enforced are essential to protect forests. Without this, any incentive structure is bound to fail. Per Pharo Read the full Q&A here.

"Propaganda works by sanctifying a single value, such as faith, or patriotism. Anyone who questions it puts themselves outside the circle of respectable opinion. The sacred value is used to obscure the intentions of those who champion it. Today, the value is freedom. Freedom is a word that powerful people use to shut down thought. When thinktanks and the billionaire press call for freedom, they are careful not to specify whose freedoms they mean. Freedom for some, they suggest, means freedom for all. In certain cases, this is true. You can exercise freedom of thought, for instance, without harming others. In other cases, one person’s freedom is another’s captivity.  When corporations free themselves from trade unions, they curtail the freedoms of their workers. When the very rich free themselves from tax, other people suffer through failing public services. When financiers are free to design exotic financial instruments, the rest of us pay for the crises they cause. Above all, billionaires and the organisations they run demand freedom from something they call “red tape”. What they mean by red tape is public protection. An article in the Telegraph last week was headlined “Cut the EU red tape choking Britain after Brexit to set the country free from the shackles of Brussels”. Yes, we are choking, but not on red tape. We are choking because the government flouts European rules on air quality. The resulting air pollution frees thousands of souls from their bodies. Ripping down such public protections means freedom for billionaires and corporations from the constraints of democracy. This is what Brexit – and Donald Trump – are all about. The freedom we were promised is the freedom of the very rich to exploit us. To be fair to the Telegraph, which is running a campaign to deregulate the entire economy once Britain has left the EU, it is, unusually, almost explicit about who the beneficiaries are. It explains that “the ultimate goal of this whole process should be to … set the wealth creators free”. (Wealth creators: code for the very rich.) Among the potential prizes it lists are changes to the banana grading system, allowing strongly curved bananas to be categorised as Class 1, a return to incandescent lightbulbs and the freedom to kill great crested newts. I suspect that the Barclay brothers, the billionaires who own the Telegraph, couldn’t give a monkey’s about bananas. But as their business empire incorporates hotels, shipping, car sales, home shopping and deliveries, they might be intensely interested in the European working time directive and other aspects of employment law, tax directives, environmental impact assessments, the consumer rights directive, maritime safety laws and a host of similar public protections. If the government agrees to a “bonfire of red tape”, we would win bent bananas and newt-squashing prerogatives. On the other hand, we could lose our rights to fair employment, an enduring living world, clean air, clean water, public safety, consumer protection, functioning public services, and the other distinguishing features of civilisation. Tough choice, isn’t it? As if to hammer the point home, the Sunday Telegraph interviewed Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, in an article claiming that the “red tape burden” was too heavy for listed companies. He described some of the public protections that companies have to observe as “bloody baggage”. The article failed to connect these remarks to his company’s own bloody baggage, caused by its unilateral decision to cut red tape. As a result of overriding the safety mechanism on one of its rides at Alton Towers – which was operating, against the guidelines, during high winds – 16 people were injured, including two young women who had their legs amputated. That’s why we need public protections of the kind the Telegraph wants to destroy. The same ethos, with the same justification, pervades the Trump administration. The new head of the environmental protection agency, Scott Pruitt, is seeking to annul the rules protecting rivers from pollution, workers from exposure to pesticides, and everyone from climate breakdown. It’s not as if the agency was overzealous before: one of the reasons for the mass poisoning in Flint, Michigan, was its catastrophic failure to protect people from the contamination of drinking water by lead: a failure that now afflicts 18 million Americans. As well as trying to dismantle the government’s climate change programme, Trump is waging war on even the most obscure forms of protection. For instance, he intends to remove funds from the tiny US chemical safety board, which investigates lethal industrial incidents. Discovering what happened and why would impede freedom. On neither side of the Atlantic are these efforts unopposed. Trump’s assault on public protections has already provoked dozens of lawsuits. The European council has told the UK government that if it wants to trade with the EU on favourable terms after Brexit, companies here cannot cut their costs by dumping them on the rest of society. This drives the leading Brexiters berserk. As a result of the pollution paradox (the dirtiest corporations have to spend the most money on politics, so the political system comes to be owned by them), politicians like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have an incentive to champion the freedom of irresponsible companies. But it also puts them in a bind. Their primary argument for deregulation is that it makes businesses more competitive. If it means those businesses can’t trade with the EU, the case falls apart. They will try to light the bonfire anyway, as this is a question of power and culture as well as money. You don’t need to listen for long to the very rich to realise that many see themselves as the “independents” Friedrich Hayek celebrated in The Constitution of Liberty, or as John Galt, who led a millionaires’ strike against the government in Ayn Rand’s novel, Atlas Shrugged. Like Hayek, they regard freedom from democracy as an absolute right, regardless of the costs this may inflict on others, or even themselves. When we confront a system of propaganda, our first task is to decode it. This begins by interrogating its sacred value.

"Donald Trump launched an all-out assault on Barack Obama’s climate change legacy on Tuesday with a sweeping executive order that undermines America’s commitment to the Paris agreement. Watched by coalminers at a ceremony at the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, the president signed an order to trigger a review of the clean power plan, Obama’s flagship policy to curb carbon emissions, and rescind a moratorium on the sale of coalmining leases on federal lands.  But the move was swiftly condemned by environmentalists as a “dangerous” and “embarrassing” attempt to turn back the clock that would do little to revive the US coal industry while threatening cooperation with major polluters such as China and India. In a speech before he signed the order, Trump promised “a new era in American energy and production and job creation”. He said: “The action I’m taking today will eliminate federal overreach, restore economic freedom and allow our workers and companies to thrive and compete on a level playing field for the first time in a long time. I’m not just talking eight years.” Trump promised the measures would be “bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams and making America wealthy again”. He praised coalminers in the room as “amazing”and “incredible”, recalling that he heard about their struggles over the past two years. “I made them this promise: we will put our miners back to work … Today I’m putting an end to the war on coal.” Trump also pledged a future of “clean coal”, and dismissed “the so-called clean power plan” as “a crushing attack on American industry”. The executive order also lifts a moratorium on the sale of new coal leases on federal land, removes “job killing restrictions” on energy production, and returns power to state level. Trump’s acceptance of climate change science has long been in question. In 2014 he tweeted: “Global warming is an expensive hoax!” On Tuesday his press secretary, Sean Spicer, ducked a question over whether he still takes this view. “I think you’ll hear more today about the climate and what he believes,” Spicer said. “I think he understands – he does not believe that … there is a binary choice been job creation, economic growth, and caring about the environment, and that’s what we should be focusing on. I think at the end of the day, where we should be focusing is making sure that all Americans have clean water, clean air and that we do what we can to preserve and protect our environment.” The clean power plan – introduced by Obama in 2015 but blocked by the courts last year – was intended to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.  Spicer said that Tuesday’s order included “a review of the new performance standards for coal-fired and natural gas-fired plants that amount to a de facto ban on new coal plant production in the United States”. He told reporters: “This is great news for states like Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and others.” All the states listed voted for Trump in last November’s presidential election. The executive order continues his aggressive endeavour to unravel his predecessor’s policies and strip away regulations in what his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has called “the deconstruction of the administrative state”. This includes radically diminishing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Spicer said: “For too long the federal government has acted like a barrier to energy independence and innovation.” The president has previously condemned the clean power rule and other regulations as placing an unnecessary burden on American workers and the struggling US coal industry, which faces growing competition from natural gas, wind and solar. Trump accused Obama of a “war on coal” and has promised to revitalise the coal industry. At a rally last week in Kentucky, he said he had already removed some burdensome regulations and insisted the new executive order would go further. “We are going to put our coalminers back to work,” he told the crowd. Spicer said on Tuesday: “The miners and the owners are very, very bullish on this. The people who are actually in the business applaud this effort, believe that it will do a lot to revive the industry.” But the order was condemned by climate change activists, including Al Gore, the former vice-president, who describe it as “a misguided step away from a sustainable, carbon-free future for ourselves and generations to come”. Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator, accused the Trump administration of wanting “us to travel back to when smokestacks damaged our health and polluted our air, instead of taking every opportunity to support clean jobs of the future”. She added: “This is not just dangerous; it’s embarrassing to us and our businesses on a global scale to be dismissing opportunities for new technologies, economic growth, and US leadership.” Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate environment and public works subcommittee on clean air and nuclear safety, said: “Just a few years ago, Donald Trump and his children supported ‘meaningful and effective measures’ to fight climate change, calling it ‘scientifically irrefutable’ and its consequences ‘catastrophic’ and ‘irreversible’. Today he began to unravel the clean power plan, one of the most important actions we have taken to fight climate change, just like the big polluters wanted.” He added: “The most voracious and malign special interest in American politics – the fossil fuel industry – has captured the Trump administration, installed its top henchmen at the EPA, and gone to work trying to unwind any environmental and public health safeguard that gets in the way of its profits.” Obama was dubbed the first “climate president” for acknowledging the real threat of global warming, although critics argued his record was blemished by investments in dirty fuels around the world. In 2015, the clean power plan was billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a US president. Under the subsequent Paris accord, the US agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26-28% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels. Trump and his allies, including the EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, have previously criticised the Paris agreement involving nearly 200 countries. A senior administration official said on Monday: “In terms of the Paris agreement, whether we stay in or not is still under discussion.” Tuesday’s order seeks to suspend, rescind or review more than half a dozen measures in an effort to boost domestic energy production. These include Obama’s 2013 climate action plan, a major fracking regulation, guidelines published by the White House Council on Environmental Quality last August, and estimates of the social costs of carbon and other greenhouses gases. The 2015 clean power plan has been on hold since 2016 while a federal appeals court considers a challenge by coal-friendly states and more than 100 companies. The attempt to roll it back completely faces a complex process of rewriting rules and fending off legal challenges from states such as California and New York, environmental groups and sections of industry. “Whatever process was used create it, that process will have to be used to undo it,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law expert at Harvard University. “The more they rush in, the more likely they make a mistake.”  Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation. said: “Sending the clean power plan back to the drawing board might earn President Trump a few political points from a narrow interest group, but should this see the light of day, it will hurt the vast majority of Americans as it will propel the economy backwards so that it resembles something from the 19th century. “The good news is that it will take much more than today’s order to stop domestic climate action in the US – indeed, this document is likely to spend years in court. What’s more, there are countless countries ready to step up and deliver on their climate promises and take advantage of Mr Trump’s short-termism to reap the benefits of the transition to the low-carbon economy.” Lease applications blocked by the Obama moratorium included more than 1.8bn tons of coal from two dozen mines, the Associated Press reported. Burning that coal would unleash an estimated 3.4bn tons of carbon dioxide – equivalent to a year of emissions from 700m cars, it said. But coal still faces competition from cheap and abundant natural gas, partly due to advances in drilling such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. From 2011 to 2016, the coalmining industry lost about 60,000 jobs, leaving just over 77,000 miners, according to preliminary government figures. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, said: “No matter what any elected official says, rescinding commonsense climate change regulations and popular public health protections will not revive the coal industry or put thousands of miners back to work. “Market forces, including consumer preferences and technological advancement, are the primary reason for the surge in cleaner forms of energy. In fact, even without the clean power plan, we are likely to hit its emissions targets ahead of schedule – because consumers, cities and businesses will continue leading on public health and climate change even when Washington won’t.” But the president’s actions were praised by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank. Nick Loris, a fellow in energy and environmental policy, said: “Wealth equals health. It’s not about being a fossil fuel stooge; it’s about allowing them to be competitive.” Additional reporting by Dominic Rushe in New York"
"Back-to-back severe bleaching events have affected two-thirds of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, new aerial surveys have found. The findings have caused alarm among scientists, who say the proximity of the 2016 and 2017 bleaching events is unprecedented for the reef, and will give damaged coral little chance to recover.  Scientists with the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies last week completed aerial surveys of the world’s largest living structure, scoring bleaching at 800 individual coral reefs across 8,000km. The results show the two consecutive mass bleaching events have affected a 1,500km stretch, leaving only the reef’s southern third unscathed.  Where last year’s bleaching was concentrated in the reef’s northern third, the 2017 event spread further south, and was most intense in the middle section of the Great Barrier Reef. This year’s mass bleaching, second in severity only to 2016, has occurred even in the absence of an El Niño event. Mass bleaching – a phenomenon caused by global warming-induced rises to sea surface temperatures – has occurred on the reef four times in recorded history.  Prof Terry Hughes, who led the surveys, said the length of time coral needed to recover – about 10 years for fast-growing types – raised serious concerns about the increasing frequency of mass bleaching events.  “The significance of bleaching this year is that it’s back to back, so there’s been zero time for recovery,” Hughes told the Guardian. “It’s too early yet to tell what the full death toll will be from this year’s bleaching, but clearly it will extend 500km south of last year’s bleaching.” Last year, in the worst-affected areas to the reef’s north, roughly two-thirds of shallow-water corals were lost. Hughes has warned Australia now faces a closing window to save the reef by taking decisive action on climate change. The 2017 bleaching is likely to be compounded by other stresses on the reef, including the destructive crown-of-thorns starfish and poor water quality. The category-four tropical cyclone Debbie came too late and too far south for its cooling effect to alleviate bleaching. But Hughes said its slow movement across the reef was likely to have caused destruction to coral along a path up to 100km wide. “It added to the woes of the bleaching. It came too late to stop the bleaching, and it came to the wrong place,” he said. The University of Technology Sydney’s lead reef researcher, marine biologist David Suggett, said that to properly recover, affected reefs needed to be connected to those left untouched by bleaching. He said Hughes’ survey results showed such connectivity was in jeopardy. “It’s that connection ultimately that will drive the rate and extent of recovery,” Suggett said. “So if bleaching events are moving around the [Great Barrier Reef] system on an annual basis, it does really undermine any potential resilience through connectivity between neighbouring reefs.” Some reef scientists are now becoming despondent. Water quality expert, Jon Brodie, told the Guardian the reef was now in a “terminal stage”. Brodie has devoted much of his life to improving water quality on the reef, one of a suite of measures used to stop bleaching. He said measures to improve water quality, which were a central tenet of the Australian government’s rescue effort, were failing. “We’ve given up. It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed,” Brodie said. “Even though we’ve spent a lot of money, we’ve had no success.” Brodie used strong language to describe the threats to the reef in 2017. He said the compounding effect of back-to-back bleaching, Cyclone Debbie, and run-off from nearby catchments should not be understated. “Last year was bad enough, this year is a disaster year,” Brodie said. “The federal government is doing nothing really, and the current programs, the water quality management is having very limited success. It’s unsuccessful.” Others remain optimistic, out of necessity. Jon Day was a director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years until retiring in 2014.  Every moment we waste, and every dollar we waste, isn’t helping the issue Day, whose expertise lies in protected area planning and management, said the federal government’s approach to protecting the reef was sorely lacking. He said it was taking too relaxed an approach to fishing, run-off and pollution from farming, and the dumping of maintenance dredge spoil. The government was far short of the $8.2bn investment needed to meet water quality targets, he said, and Australia was on track to fail its short-term 2018 water quality targets, let alone achieve more ambitious long-term goals.  “You’ve got to be optimistic, I think we have to be,” Day said. “But every moment we waste, and every dollar we waste, isn’t helping the issue. We’ve been denying it for so long, and now we’re starting to accept it. But we’re spending insufficient amounts addressing the problem.” The Queensland tourism industry raised questions about the reliability of the survey, saying scientists had previously made exaggerated claims about mortality rates and bleaching.  “There is no doubt that we have had a significant bleaching event off Cairns this time around,” said Col McKenzie, of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators. “The far north probably did a little bit better, Port Douglas to Townsille has seen some significant bleaching,” he said. “Fortunately we haven’t seen much mortality at this time, and fortunately the temperatures have fallen.” McKenzie said more money needed to be invested in water quality measures, and criticised what he saw as a piecemeal and uncoordinated approach to water quality projects up and down the coast.

"The cause of the so-called “little ice age”, when frost fairs were held on the Thames and there was a run of cold winters, has puzzled scientists. These uncertainties have given American sceptics opportunities to claim that global warming is nothing more than a natural variation in the climate.  However, new research by the Royal Astronomical Society shows that the period between the 16th and 19th centuries may have had cold winters but it also suffered scorching summers, so it was not an ice age at all. At most the average temperature during this period was half a degree centigrade lower across the Northern Hemisphere, whereas during actual ice ages it was down 8C. Close examination of the data also reveals that not all the winters were cold, so the natural variability of the climate continued throughout the period. The causes of the slight cooling were a combination of lower solar activity, volcanic eruptions and manmade changes to the landscape. Solar activity is again on the wane now, but this will not save us from rises in temperature. Greenhouse gases that have been pumped into the atmosphere in the last 160 years have already pushed the temperature up by 1C and it will continue to rise. While a frost fair on the Thames is probably now a most unlikely occurrence, the scientists point out that the fairs stopped in the first place not because the weather got warmer but because London Bridge was replaced in 1825. Until then the low arches and large supports trapped ice as it flowed down the river – allowing the river to freeze over upstream. "
"The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Michael Gannon, has said the health benefits of closing down brown-coal power plants need to be considered against the health impacts of unemployment and blackouts. The Hazelwood power station will permanently close on Friday, affecting 500 staff and 300 contractors who will lose their jobs. Hazelwood, in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, is Australia’s dirtiest power station and one of the most polluting power stations in the world.  The executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, Fiona Armstrong, said the community would reap significant health benefits from the closure. “People in the Latrobe Valley have suffered a burden of ill health from the pollution caused by the burning of coal over a long period, given it is linked to cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases, as well as lung cancers,” she said. “For children with asthma, the elderly, and people with respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, this announcement is good news.” But Gannon said that while it was accepted that brown coal is the dirtiest way to produce power, he was not convinced there were enough alternatives available to immediately replace the power generated by Hazelwood. “I’m not convinced we have that right,” Gannon said. “We need a mature debate about the power supply because it powers our hospitals, our schools and other essential infrastructure. “There is also the health affects of unemployment that need to be considered. The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense. “We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.” In it’s submission to the 2013 Senate inquiry into air quality, the Australian Medical Association warned that increasing pollution from road transport and mining, combined with the growing effects of climate change, was exposing communities to an increasingly toxic mix of airborne chemicals and particles that were harming health. The submission warned that “thousands of Australians are dying prematurely or being hospitalised for asthma attacks and heart complaints because of lax standards and enforcement that leave millions exposed to harmful levels of particulate matter, diesel fumes and other airborne pollutants”. While Gannon said there was “no question” brown coal was the worst way to generate power, he said the industry needed more certainty. “It’s our industries that pay the taxes that pay for services in our society, like healthcare and hospitals,” he said. “I don’t have a puritanical view of renewable energy. We must have secure energy supply in our country. The desire of health groups is to see a greater proportion of power coming from renewables, but we can’t be risking blackouts that can also effect hospitals.” Armstrong said she agreed with Gannon that energy security was a pressing issue for hospitals and other essential services. But she said climate change was causing extreme weather events such as cyclones and increased flooding which was impacting hospitals and patients.  “We’ve seen examples where hospitals had supply interrupted from extreme weather events,” she said. “Brown coal fuels climate change which causes these events to occur more frequently and more severely.” According to Environment Victoria, Hazelwood uses 27bn litres of water and emits 7,800 tonnes of hydrochloric acid each year. Burning coal is responsible for approximately 95% of air pollution in the Latrobe Valley, according to the Victorian Environment Protection Authority, while the CSIRO have estimated the cost of poor indoor air quality in Australia may be as high as $12bn per year. A Melbourne emergency physician, Dr Stephen Parnis, said from a health perspective moving away from coal could only be positive.  He was president of the AMA Victoria in 2014 when the devastating Morwell fires spread into the Hazelwood mine. “We are still watching closely to see if there are any long-term impacts to people’s health from that fire,” he said. “Exposure to inhaled pollutants is known to be a cause of chronic heart disease, and anything that improves air quality such as reducing the burning of fossil fuels can only be a good thing for the health of the population of the La Trobe Valley.” "
"There is nowhere else on the planet right now where the dichotomy between two potential futures – one where we address the climate change crisis, one where we ignore this momentous threat and continue with business as usual – is playing out in such a dramatic and explosive way as Australia. In the US, Donald Trump is decimating decades of hard-fought environmental and climate standards – it’s all 18th century all the time. But the ageing fossil fuel assets and recent “market failure” of the Australian electricity grid is pushing political leaders to all-out brawling, pitting conservative inaction against the demand for solution-focused action.   A recent wave of blackouts and near misses and the proposal of the biggest coalmine in the world – the Adani Carmichael mine in Queensland – has created tinder-dry conditions that only needed one spark to go up in flames. The spark finally came recently, via Twitter, from renewable energy entrepreneur Elon Musk who offered to sell the batteries that would remove the last argument against renewable power. It turned the deadlocked debate over how to fix Australia’s fossil fuel-ladenand often failing energy “market” into an open war between those backing the dying coal industry with those set on using the moment to transition to renewable energy. Indeed, one of the icons of the ageing coal fleet, the dirtiest coal power station in the developed world – Hazelwood in Victoria – turns off its turbines this week as it shuts down. The symbols couldn’t be clearer: Musk’s batteries or Adani’s mega-mine and dirty coal power. Which one represents the future? As you formulate the answer, remember that the war is of course playing out against a tragic backdrop: the ongoing destruction of the Great Barrier Reef that is Australia’s great natural treasure, the thing it’s been charged by the world to protect. That horror is a human-created disaster, caused directly by man-made global warming that is increasing ocean temperatures by an alarming rate. The decision about the future is also a decision about what kind of democracy you want. As in the US, the Aussie mining industry has for decades has a disproportionate amount of power over politicians. It cares about one thing only – not the greater good, but its own perpetuation. But now the coal industry is starting to lose its grip. And it won’t necessarily be a slow process. The fractures are running through all stratas of Australian governance: states are closing coal stations and opting for renewable energy and battery storage (a la the Musk Tweet); and companies and businesses that have traditionally been allies of the coal industry are advocating for climate policies that would essentially spell the end of coal-powered energy; individuals and communities in great numbers are breaking free of the grid. A marooned and thoroughly isolated Malcolm Turnbull is left on the losing side advocating for an industry and a coalmine we all know he doesn’t believe in to appease a small number of rightwingers in his party so he can continue to call himself the prime minister. Without a doubt, he will be swept aside by the arc of change – he who had the chance to lead on the issue of our time but chose to give in to vested interests and the fringe of his party. As your electricity grid fails and industry holds on to the myth of an ever-growing coal export industry, Australians must draw a line in the sand and decide whether they continue to support coal, or whether the future is renewable. Backed against the wall, the coal lobby and Turnbull’s fossil fuel-obsessed colleagues have gambled everything on the construction of the Adani coalmine. This mine would be the largest coalmine in history and, if constructed, it would do much to push the planet beyond 2C of warming. The politics of coal are changing and this mine is that line in the sand. Last week a historic alliance of environmental groups representing more than 1.5 million people launched the largest climate movement in Australia’s history. Led by Bob Brown, who I had the honour of meeting last year, the battle to stop Adani is shaping up as the most important environmental fight ever down under, the likes of the Tar Sands battle we’ve seen in North America. People are engaged and will take action to preserve the climate, the Great Barrier Reef and the rights of the traditional owners whose land will be destroyed by this mine in ways that hasn’t before been seen. In my many visits there, I have found Australians to be obliging and deeply passionate about protecting their unique environment. Never has the contrast between the fossil fuel present and the clean energy future been in such stark relief. I now implore all Australians to take a stand – for the sake of the world’s climate – to ensure this mine never goes ahead."
"A new study published in Nature Communications looks at changes in solar activity and carbon dioxide levels over the past 420 million years. The authors found that on our current path, by mid-century humans will be causing the fastest climate change in approximately 50 million years, and if we burn all available fossil fuels, we’ll cause the fastest change in the entire 420 million year record.  The study relates to a scientific conundrum known as the “faint young sun paradox” – that early in Earth’s history, solar output was 30% less intense than it is today, and yet the planet was warm enough to have a liquid ocean. A stronger greenhouse effect due to higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere may be one explanation. Over time, solar output has grown stronger, and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have fallen due to an effect known as “weathering” of rocks and an increase in plant life. The authors of this study found that over the past 420 million years, the slow heating of the sun and slow decline of the greenhouse effect have roughly offset each other, leading to a fairly stable long-term global climate. In particular, as shown in the first chart above, Earth’s climate has been fairly stable over the past several million years. The wiggles in the blue line represent transitions in and out of ice ages, due to wobbles in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, amplified by changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (these are known as Milankovich cycles). The bottom frame in the chart shows the change in forcing (global energy imbalance) caused by the combination of changes in solar activity and the greenhouse effect. When the line is flat, the Earth’s energy balance is stable, and thus so is its climate. When there’s a steep change, something is upsetting that balance and causing a rapid climate change. The five colored lines toward the end of the chart show potential pathways we’ll follow, depending on how much fossil fuels humans burn over the coming decades. In every case the line is already quite steep due to the hundreds of billions of tons of carbon pollution humans have dumped into the atmosphere thus far. The size of the global energy imbalance we’ve caused is already on par with those previous blue wiggles – Earth’s ice age transitions. If we keep burning lots of fossil fuels, we could soon cause higher carbon dioxide levels and faster climate change than the Earth has seen in 50 million years. If we burn all available fossil fuel reserves (the black “Wink12k” line), we’ll see faster climate change than in the entire 420 million year record. It’s an alarming proposition. Climate deniers will often argue against taking action to curb carbon pollution because climate changed naturally in the past and carbon dioxide levels were higher in the past. One Republican congressman repeated these talking points in the latest House “Science” committee hearing. While both arguments are technically true, they miss several important points.  First, the rate at which we’re currently causing climate change is alarmingly fast – much faster than in most natural climate change events. Second, similar past rapid climate changes have caused mass extinction events. Third, the sun’s cooler past helped keep temperatures lower.  As renowned climate scientist Wallace Broecker once said, “The climate system is an angry beast, and we are poking at it with sticks.” As this new study shows, our poking sticks are getting bigger and bigger, and we’re poking the beast faster and faster. Meanwhile, climate deniers are egging us on because the beast has been angered in the past, and we’re not sure just how soon it will decide to maul us."
"It could be black humour. The faded, red HAZELWOOD sign has been switched off for years – perhaps to save electricity, who knows? – but a fortnight ago it was turned back on. HAZELVOOD now lights up the night sky in neon for miles. The letter W is dodgy, but nobody could be bothered to fix it now. It’s not a joke. It’s sentimental, a kind of tribute instantly understood by the people of the Latrobe Valley east of Melbourne. On Friday, the Hazelwood power station will close after 52 years, its deafening hum silent, its boilers cooling, its eight stacks idle, its gigantic dredges ceasing to dig coal around the clock. Most of the workforce will be gone too.  Whatever the international urgency of climate change and the imperative to move away from burning coal, and whatever the confusion around energy policy in Canberra, and whatever the real reasons for Hazelwood’s owners in France and Japan announcing the plant’s closure five months ago, there is sadness in the valley. There’s a bittersweet nostalgia for a way of life passing, and a fear about what’s to come. Has there ever been a folksong serenading a power station, let alone the “dirtiest” one, a hulking, badly maintained relic that has the dubious claim of having the highest emissions intensity of any plant in the country? There is now. Musician and station worker Danny Boothman, 54 and about to be unemployed, has recorded The Hazelwood Song: So let’s all have a drink to Hazelwood Lift your glasses high Let’s have a drink to Hazelwood It’s sad to watch the old girl die.  Other coal-fired power stations have closed in Australia, but none as big or as symbolic as Hazelwood. The workers will gather for lunch on Friday in the car park, and have hired an AC/DC cover band. On their private Facebook page, they joke about what might be the perfect song to belt out: Dirty Deeds, perhaps, or High Voltage? There are rumours that bagpipes will play the workers out of the gate for the last time.  Mark Richards is 46, and has worked at Hazelwood since he was offered a coveted traineeship with the old government State Electricity Commission (SEC) when he was just 17. His father Geof worked in the industry all his life, starting at Hazelwood and retiring 15 years ago from Yallourn. Those with jobs in the power industry have been the lucky ones, and their luck has kept the grocery stores, hairdressers, newsagents and car yards afloat. There are 450 direct employees at the Hazelwood station and mine, and about 250 contract workers. Their wages have been pumping more than $100m into the local economy each year. Richards is now a unit controller, a senior job he compares to an airline pilot. He keeps his boiler and a turbine going – one of eight in the station - adjusting the controls if needed, watching out for faults or dangers. It will be strange walking in for his last shift, and stranger still to hear the noisy plant silent. “It will be eerie,” he says.  His final shift finishes at 7am Saturday morning – April Fool’s Day, he notes with a grimace. I meet him for dinner in Morwell, a town of 14,000 people just a few hundred metres from the giant open-cut coalmine. The eight stacks of the adjacent power station loom over Morwell, visible from almost anywhere. Eventually the stacks will be demolished and many people can’t quite believe it. Most were expecting a staged closure, the shutting of a few units at a time over a number of years, with enough breathing space to plan. He orders a beer and a huge meal called a Bogan Parma. He’s the CFMEU delegate at Hazelwood – it’s a voluntary job – and his phone is always on. The last few months have been frantic. On his wrist, Richards wears, along with his Fitbit, a beyondblue band, “so if I see anyone who’s desperate I can give it to them. Wives have said to me things like ‘my husband says he’s worth more dead than alive.’”  Morwell already has an unemployment rate of 20%, even before Hazelwood workers join the dole queue. By any measure, from health to life expectancy, from education to crime, it is among the most disadvantaged towns in Australia. The other towns of the valley – Traralgon, Moe and Churchill – are also struggling, particularly with unemployment, but Morwell is hurting more.  For generations, coal has been the valley’s lifeblood. Brown coal, too moist and volatile to export but very cheap to burn, was discovered in the valley in 1873. The towns grew up around them. The state government has an ambitious renewable energy target, but today, the valley’s four power stations still provide around 85% of Victoria’s energy needs. Hazelwood is the oldest and biggest, alone producing about a quarter of the Victoria’s electricity, and 5% of the country’s. Not all of the workers will be unemployed on Friday – the company says 135 will stay on, as well as about 100 contractors. There’s work to “decommission” the station, cleaning it up, removing asbestos, demolishing it and eventually rehabilitating the mine, perhaps by filling it with water to create a lake. Over time, those jobs will disappear. The rumours that Hazelwood was about to shut have been so regular for so many years that many people shrugged when they heard the latest. So when Hazelwood’s owners, Engie, announced in November that it was shutting the plant and mine, it still came as a shock. Since then, there has been lots of bad news, but at least one piece of good news. The CFMEU’s construction arm is criticised for its behaviour on building sites, but out here, a worker transfer scheme was the union’s idea. It will mean that redundancies will be offered to workers in the valley’s three other stations – Yallourn, Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B. The idea is that older workers will take a package – funded in part by the state government – to make way for younger workers from Hazelwood to move across. As many as 150 jobs could be saved this way and it offers hope, even if the details are far from sorted and only one company, AGL, has so far signed on. Engie, which owns Loy Yang B as well as Hazelwood, has agreed in principle. Richards will apply when the scheme opens, but “being a unionist I might not be on the list, who knows”. His parents are elderly and unwell, which makes making a decision hard. “I’d love to stay in the area,” he says. “Originally I was looking to pack up and go overseas for work because the work is overseas – you have to go to the Middle East, secondly maybe India, and China as a last resort. But with my parents I really don’t want to go, so I might just hang around a bit.”  There are all sorts of rumours in the valley, all kinds of resentments. The workers are angry at the announcement by Engie that the average payout would be $330,000, a fortune for most of the valley’s people. Richards points out that the figure is skewed because some workers close to retirement have been at Hazelwood for decades, and it includes long service and holiday leave. Contractors receive no redundancy at all. Salaries, including penalty rates for shift and weekend work, are healthy by average standards, and many workers are well over 50. Rob Dugan, the production manager of the mine, says the average age of his workforce is 51, and the average length of service is 25 years. People get a job, and stay.  “They’ve never had to go for another job, so with some of the age groups, like the 40 to 50 year olds that have to continue to work, it’s very daunting for them.” There are scores of younger men (there are very few women at the plant) who will be out of work in a region with already high unemployment. Everyone has a coal story. The local newsagent Ray Burgess, who is still fighting an 11th hour battle to keep Hazelwood open for a few more years, once worked as a scientist for the SEC. Lindsay Mills’ industrial laundry cleans the dirty work wear from the power stations. He took a redundancy package from Yallourn more than 20 years ago to start his business from scratch.  Jason Sumner, 31, is a big man with a full red beard, and he’s just woken up from night shift at Hazelwood. He’s an electrician by trade, a coal and ash operator at the station, helping manage the bunkers before the coal is fed into the boilers. He has been doing the job for two-and-half years and will get 13 weeks’ redundancy pay, a little over $20,000. Sumner is frustrated because he took the job at a time when Engie was assuring workers that Hazelwood would be around until at least 2025. He and his wife, Jess, grew up in the valley, and moved back to work and live close to their families. They bought a house last year in a leafy street in Traralgon, 20 minutes from Morwell, and worry they could lose it if Jason can’t find work quickly. “I was devastated, it’s taken my career out from under me,” he says. “It’s pretty scary really. Small businesses, everybody’s trying pretty hard, but there’s less money going around now, and a lot of skilled people are going to have to leave the area in search of work.” Sumner is aware of the argument that coal-fired power stations will inevitably close as a result of climate change, and he doesn’t dismiss it. “Look I care, I definitely care. I don’t disagree eventually Hazelwood should have been closed down, but it shouldn’t be closed down without replacing it. “Without Hazelwood, it’s been made pretty clear that the stability of the electricity market or grid really isn’t going to be very secure. There’s been no planning.” That’s a common view. Coal-fired power stations, especially the old ones, are going to close, so why hasn’t this been planned for? Why react when they fall over? People in the valley feel they are paying the price for politics and the lack of clear policy. Mayor Kellie O’Callaghan’s dad Gus worked for the Yallourn station and she remembers as a kid meeting him at the gate after his shift.  O’Callaghan was born in Morwell and is now the mayor of Latrobe city. On her Twitter feed, she’s been counting down the days until Hazelwood closes and she doesn’t shy away from taking a swipe at the state government. “[Treasurer] Tim Pallas we have called your office daily. Won’t meet with us to discuss decentralisation 2 assist Latrobe City. Why?” she tweeted last month. And: “What about Latrobe? All we have are promises. Where are the jobs?” O’Callaghan says the council knew last year that Hazelwood’s closure was imminent, but governments, state and federal, didn’t respond in a serious way until it was announced. “When the announcement happened, and it was total closure and they set a date, there was no window to do much. It literally for the community felt like the bottom fell out of it.” At an Engie community consultation meeting a fortnight ago, one man let fly: “I hope everybody here wakes up to that fact, because that’s what it’s going to be like, it’s going to hit like a sledgehammer.” The feelings are so deep, and the wariness so great, because of the privatisation of Victoria’s electricity industry in the 1990s. The wisdom of privatisation is now being seriously questioned, but at the time it seemed like easy money. The Victorian premier Jeff Kennett was saddled with a big state debt and received $23bn for breaking up the old SEC and selling it off. The valley saw little of it. About 15,000 jobs disappeared. The region fell into deep recession, housing prices collapsed, and crime and drug abuse rose. It took at least a decade to crawl its way back out of the slump and O’Callaghan says the community fears the same will happen again. “It’s a vulnerability … it’s just about feeling like you’ve been smashed around for so long.” O’Callaghan hasn’t given up on brown coal; few in the valley have. There is 500 years worth of it under their feet, and the idea of leaving it there – as climate change scientists say needs to happen if we are to avoid dangerous warming of the planet – is for most, unimaginable. Myriad ideas to do something else with brown coal have amounted to little so far. A $90m scheme, funded by the federal and Victorian governments, has stalled, with two out of three projects to receive taxpayer money to develop new ideas shelved. One remains: a plan to produce fertiliser and other products in the valley. Still, the council’s transition plan insists that brown coal remains the key to the area’s future. It wants the state and federal governments to establish “one of the world’s first zero emission brown coal power-generating facilities” in the valley, and it backs carbon capture and storage. “The richness and versatility of this resource cannot be left to languish,” it says. It wants government departments to relocate to the valley, as much to send a signal to a nervous population that governments believe in their future. It wants better and faster rail to slash commuter times to Melbourne. There might be new industries in building components for the renewable energy sector, using the valley’s skills for manufacturing in rail and other projects. And it’s not ready to give up on brown coal. O’Callaghan doesn’t want the mine filled with water, because that would make the coal unusable forever. Let’s wait, she says, let’s see. Mostly, people want someone in government to make a decision. “At some point, someone has to tell us: is it coal? How long is it coal for and if it’s not coal, when will that change? When your whole community and industry has revolved around coal ... if someone wants to step back and relinquish that, we need to know what the timing is. [Governments] need to make some decisions and give us some guidance, and we’ll be on it.” Wendy Farmer set up community group Voices of the Valley after the Hazelwood mine caught fire in 2014, spewing coal dust and ash across the town for 45 days. She can imagine a future beyond coal, but knows she is a minority. “You don’t mention climate change in this town, you don’t,” she laughs.  She says, too, that “coal is in our blood”, a psychological as much as an economic dependence. Her husband, Brett, has worked at the Hazelwood mine for a quarter of a century and this week will take a redundancy package at the age of 57. Farmer doesn’t pretend to be an expert, but she suggests that, with the valley’s transmission infrastructure and skilled workforce, perhaps it could play a role in the development of renewable energy, perhaps manufacturing wind turbines, or being a centre for large-scale storage. “We have to stop thinking that our only asset is coal. Our asset here is the people, it’s the community, and we have to start thinking about what we can do differently.”  It was the mine fire that politicised Farmer – before that, she says, she never questioned the health impacts of living so close to a coalmine. She never thought much about politics at all, barely knowing which party she would vote for until she turned up at a polling booth. She quit her job to focus on Voices of the Valley. She agitates, and it was her small group’s work that was central to the reopening of the mine fire inquiry, specifically to look at rehabilitation of the mine, and the health impacts of the fire. She has had pushback from a community that believes in coal – more than once, people tell me that her group are “nutters” and that closing Hazelwood will make little difference to global warming, anyhow. Farmer receives nasty emails attacking her for daring to question the role of the power stations. Brett has put up with some flak at his work at Hazelwood, too. “We don’t talk about it a lot because I think it hurts too much,” she says. “When you have a loss there’s always blame and there’s always anger and I’m an easy scapegoat. I’m not saying that I don’t sit at my computer at night and cry my eyes out sometimes, but it’s the people who say ‘thank you for standing up for what is right’ that keep me going.” Amid it all, there is the optimism of youth. Three weeks ago, Abbie Mills, 28, opened Vault, a restaurant and bar in Church Street in Morwell. Walk down the street and it’s a shock – there are five empty shops for lease or for sale, one after another. Mills was on the brink of deciding to open her restaurant when Hazelwood announced it would shut. “I did have a week or two when I thought, nah, I’m not going to do it,” she says. “It was very negative, a lot of people were saying, ‘it’s just going to ruin the valley’.” Even her brother, Brendan, said she was crazy. He was working at Hazelwood as a contract worker at the time, and has now left to search for work. He travels to a job in Pakenham, an hour’s drive each way. Mills renovated the restaurant in bright blue and white and so far, though she’s working 16-hour days, it’s going well. “I thought Morwell needed something and people still need to eat,” she says. This is conservative, National party country, but some will give Daniel Andrews’ government credit for, as Mark Richards says, “putting its money where its mouth is”. So far, it’s committed $266m as a rescue package for the valley. From that, $85m will be spent on new sports and recreation facilities. It has established the Latrobe Valley Authority to help workers retrain and to coordinate bureaucracies to ease red tape. The valley has been designated the country’s first “health zone” to try to improve people’s health, and low-income people can get up to $4,500 to upgrade energy efficiency in their homes, such as installing solar panels. If there’s a gripe, it is that people desperately want to see real industries and long-term employment, but it’s far more than the Kennett government offered when it privatised the power industry. Businesses that relocate to the valley can have state taxes, such as stamp duty, waived. And businesses that put on unemployed workers will get cash incentives, too. Mills is likely to benefit from that. “It will help me a lot,” she says.  Mills’s father Lindsay has been out looking for new business. He runs an industrial laudromat, and the bulk of the business is cleaning the power stations’ dirty work wear. Hazelwood accounts for 22% of the business, and it’s about to dry up. The impact of the closure trickles through the valley, everywhere you look. Mills was “born and bred” in Morwell, and he is stoic. “Morwell will survive,” he says, “how we will, we don’t know yet.”  First, there’s Hazelwood to farewell. In the past few weeks, Engie has been taking journalists through it for one last tour. The control room looks like a museum piece, because it is, all mint green and much of it still manually operated. The plant could be the setting for an end-of-the-world movie – greasy, a maze of pipes and turbines, cobwebs hanging from the ceiling. It’s kind of beautiful, a relic of another age.  Most people in the valley will be sad to see it go. Some would like the power plant turned into a tourist attraction, because in 20 years or so, nothing like it will exist. Engie says it’s so run down it would be too dangerous. The plan is to pull it down, piece by piece, but that is years away.  There’s little room for nostalgia. Engie, majority owned by the French government, is getting out of coal across the globe. It doesn’t see a future in it, and will concentrate on renewable energy instead. So it will be left to Danny Boothman to sing the Old Girl out.  So as the dredges stop, the fires go out, the turbines cease to spin  We’ll all have to deal with the winds of change As the winds are blowing again."
"It’s easy for all concerned about air, water and nature to descend into despair as we watch brazen rollbacks of environmental legislation in the US. Just last week, developments included an executive order to rewrite US carbon emissions rules, jeopardising the country’s ability to uphold its Paris climate talk commitment; the end of a moratorium on new coal leases; and the green-lighting of a pesticide claimed to cause harm to children. But as apathy is not an option, let’s try to think beyond the usual strategies. For one, we can recognise that the way we talk about our environmental challenges has interfered with our ability to truly grapple with them: that we limit ourselves by creating too simple a story. Specifically, the story we tell about climate.  Now I’m not speaking of climate-change denial. For at this juncture, with wild temperature swings and record-breaking weather becoming the norm, outright denial amounts to a kind of temper tantrum, a primitive railing against the inconvenience and indignity of elemental change. Rather, I mean the way that we understand climate change, the story we tell ourselves. In a popular TED talk, Nigerian-born author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie introduced the concept of the “single story”: the tendency to uncritically embrace received wisdom. While she referenced social and ethnic narratives, the “single story”, and its inherent risks of limiting perspective, applies to other beliefs as well. By shifting to a more complex, multifaceted story we can envision solutions that better reflect the realities of climate and how the natural world processes heat. Our characterisation of climate change – the “single story” – is this: “Climate change is global warming caused by too much CO2 in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. We stop climate change by making the transition to renewable energy.” This is certainly a key aspect of the story, and we absolutely need to shift away from fossil fuels … like, 20 years ago. But there are several problems with this narrative. One is the uncomfortable fact that even if, by some miracle, we could immediately cut emissions to zero, due to inertia in the system it would take more than a century for CO2 levels to drop to 350 parts per million, which is considered the safe threshold. Plus, here’s what we don’t talk about when we talk about climate: we can all go solar and drive electric cars and still have the problems – the unprecedented heat waves, the wacky weather – that we now associate with CO2-driven climate change. Climate is not a function of one sole metric; it is not a single story. And this is where we find opportunities. When faced with an environmental predicament, it can be useful to inquire as to how nature has approached similar scenarios. For instance, in the case of wildfire, one can ask what processes used to keep that landscape hydrated and therefore resilient to fire. We learn that in the American west, beavers created wetlands and acted as “shock absorbers” that minimised fire risks. And when we ask what maintains our climate, the answer is water. Were it not for the blanket of water vapour that buffers the Earth, our planet would be too cold to inhabit. The phase changes of water – from solid to liquid to gas, and back – represent an extraordinary transfer of heat. According to Australian microbiologist Walter Jehne, water-based processes in the atmosphere and the oceans, over land and across ice, govern some 95% of Earth’s natural heat dynamics. It is the sheer immensity of water’s role in climate that led scientists to conclude that humans could not have interfered with it. And yet, once we understand how water works – and how water intersects with factors we can influence, such as land use and plant cover – we can help to restore the processes that sustain the heat and energy balance, and therefore sustain our climate. Water doesn’t move and transfigure on its own: much of its movement is determined by biology, particularly by plants. Consider transpiration, in which plants draw up water and release it as vapour. This is a cooling mechanism, as it consumes and dissipates heat from the sun. According to Czech botanist Jan Pokorný, on a sunny day a good-sized tree may transpire more than 100 litres (21 gallons) of water – a process that represents three times the cooling power of an airconditioning system in a five-star hotel room. Brazilian scientist Antonio Donato Nobre says that collectively, the trees of the Amazon rainforest create a “vertical river” even greater than the Amazon river itself. This is moisture in motion, embodying and conveying heat. The “single story” has been that climate change will affect the availability of water. The more complex – and complete – story is that water can also have an effect on climate. And that this is activated by plants. Peter Andrews, a farmer and author in Australia, made a statement that has stuck with me: “Plants manage water. And in managing water, they manage heat.” Worth noting: we have de-vegetated a quarter of the planet – including destroying most of our natural forests. When we talk about “energy”, certainly in terms of policy, we usually mean what fuels our cars and heats our homes. Let’s look at energy in a very basic sense, as in what happens when sunlight meets the ground. Say you have pavement, or land marked by degraded, exposed soil – the condition of much of the world’s surface. When the sun beams down on that bare soil, solar energy is absorbed; it becomes sensible heat, or heat you can feel. Now amble over to a nice meadow, or well-managed rangeland with a thick carpet of grasses. Here solar energy touches down on plants that are transpiring. The solar heat is dispersed and becomes latent heat, embodied in water vapour, to be condensed and released as rain. There is nothing magic about any of this: throughout human history – the climatically benign period known as the Holocene – climate moderation has derived from functioning ecosystems. The important thing to realise is that we can restore ecosystems, these environments that have nurtured and sustained us, and bring heat and water dynamics back into balance. Because natural processes are so entwined, every step toward regeneration brings multiple co-benefits: more plants mean more photosynthesis, which means more carbon pulled from the atmosphere into the soil, where it adds fertility; every 1% increase in soil organic carbon represents an additional 250,000 litres per hectare that can be held on the land; the more water held on the land, the greater resilience to floods and drought. Here’s another climate subplot worth mulling over: Walter Jehne points out that based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, every square metre of Earth’s surface receives an average of 342 watts of solar energy a day. Because of how humans have altered the environment, we now radiate back about 339 watts per square metre – a difference of less than 1%. If we managed our ecology better, how might we make up that three-watt differential? How about if we had a lot more plant cover and a lot less bare ground? One challenge to reckoning with climate change is that despite all the weather anomalies we’ve been seeing, it’s difficult to confidently link climate change to any one event. This perpetuates the notion that climate change is an abstraction to be pushed off into the future, and leads to cognitive dissonance in that it seems impossible to “prove” what we know to be so. Let me now introduce an alternate definition of climate change: “manifestations of distorted carbon, water and energy cycles”. That doesn’t negate the single story of fossil fuel-borne carbon but broadens it in a way that creates opportunities beyond fighting fossil fuel interests. At this moment of reckless distraction and denial, it is crucial to find meaningful paths forward."
"Harvard engineers who launched the world’s biggest solar geoengineering research program may get a dangerous boost from Donald Trump, environmental organizations are warning. Under the Trump administration, enthusiasm appears to be growing for the controversial technology of solar geo-engineering, which aims to spray sulphate particles into the atmosphere to reflect the sun’s radiation back to space and decrease the temperature of Earth.  Sometime in 2018, Harvard engineers David Keith and Frank Keutsch hope to test spraying from a high-altitude balloon over Arizona, in order to assess the risks and benefits of deployment on a larger scale. Keith cancelled a similar planned experiment in New Mexico in 2012, but announced he was ready for field testing at a geoengineering forum in Washington on Friday. “The context for discussing solar geoengineering research has changed substantially since we planned and funded this forum nearly one year ago,” a forum briefing paper noted. While geoengineering received little favour under Obama, high-level officials within the Trump administration have been long-time advocates for planetary-scale manipulation of Earth systems. David Schnare, an architect of Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition, has lobbied the US government and testified to Senate in favour of federal support for geoengineering. He has called for a multi-phase plan to fund research and conduct real-world testing within 18 months, deploy massive stratospheric spraying three years after, and continue spraying for a century, a duration geoengineers believe would be necessary to dial back the planet’s temperature. Geoengineers argue that such methods would be an inexpensive way to reduce global warming, but scientists have warned it could have catastrophic consequences for the Earth’s weather systems. Scientific modelling has shown that stratospheric spraying could drastically curtail rainfall throughout Asia, Africa and South America, causing severe droughts and threatening food supply for billions of people. “Clearly parts of the Trump administration are very willing to open the door to reckless schemes like David Keith’s, and may well have quietly given the nod to open-air experiments,” said Silvia Riberio, with technology watchdog ETC Group. “Worryingly, geoengineering may emerge as this administration’s preferred approach to global warming. In their view, building a big beautiful wall of sulphate in the sky could be a perfect excuse to allow uncontrolled fossil fuel extraction. We need to be focussing on radical emissions cuts, not dangerous and unjust technofixes.” A White House report on climate change research submitted to Congress in January called for the first time ever for research into geoengineering. Within Republican ranks, former House speaker and Trump confidant Newt Gingrich was one of the first to start publicly advocating for geoengineering. “Geoengineering holds forth the promise of addressing global warming concerns for just a few billion dollars a year,” he said in 2008, before helping launch a geoengineering unit while he ran the right-wing think tank American Economic Enterprise. “We would have an option to address global warming by rewarding scientific innovation. Bring on American ingenuity. Stop the green pig.”  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also appeared to support geoengineering, describing climate change as an “engineering problem.” ExxonMobil’s funding of the climate denial industry is under investigation by attorney generals in the United States, but it’s less well known that ExxonMobil scientists under Tillerson’s reign as CEO were leading developers of geo-engineering technologies like carbon dioxide removal. Asked about solutions to climate change at an ExxonMobil shareholder meeting in 2015, Tillerson said that a “plan B has always been grounded in our beliefs around the continued evolution of technology and engineered solutions.” “We are not unalterably committed to doing the experiment,” said David Keith on Friday. “We’re headed down the road of doing that, but depending on what an advisory committee says and what we learn technically we’re certainly willing to stop. Our long term goal is to build a sustainable effort in solar geoengineering research that allows us to say more about ways it might actually provide public benefit.”  Critics like Riberio point out that those who don’t believe in human-induced climate change may still support geoengineering, which can be presented as a method to deal with the consequences of a warming planet without stopping the burning of fossil fuels. The Harvard experiment may fly in the face of a moratorium on geoengineering adopted in 2010 by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which was reaffirmed in December in Mexico. The United States is one of the few countries to not ratify the UN convention, creating a potential loophole for experiments. The experiment’s site in Tucson, Arizona may also invoke issues of jurisdictional controversy with Mexico – stratospheric winds can blow up to 200 miles per hour, and the border is only 75 miles away. Other geoengineering experiments like cloud whitening may go ahead in the United States, as well as experiments supported by the governments of China and Russia, though both are signatories to the UN moratorium."

"California’s governor, Jerry Brown, officially declared an end to the state’s historic drought Friday, but warned that it must be prepared for the future.  “This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” Brown said in a statement. “Conservation must remain a way of life.”   The governor lifted the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies.  The governor’s order, which came as a springtime storm bears down on the waterlogged state, keeps in place some conservation measures. Water conservation will become a way of life in the nation’s most populous state, said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the state water resources control board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe.   “There’s a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,” she said. “We’ve got to plan for longer droughts.”  Cities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor’s order, which also bans wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and running sprinklers when it rains. New rules are expected to make such bans permanent. Officials say they will work aggressively to stop leaks that waste water. The drought strained native fish that migrate up rivers, killed millions of trees, and forced farmers in the country’s leading agricultural state to rely heavily on groundwater, with some tearing out orchards. It also dried up wells, forcing hundreds of families in rural areas to drink bottled water and bathe from buckets. Brown declared the drought emergency in 2014, and officials later ordered mandatory conservation for the first time in state history. Regulators last year relaxed the rules after a rainfall was close to normal.  But monster storms this winter erased nearly all signs of drought, blanketing the Sierra Nevada with deep snow, California’s key water source, and boosting reservoirs.  Susan Atkins of the charity Self-Help Enterprises said the drought was not over for more than 900 families who have large water tanks in their yards because their wells dried up during the years-long drought.  Most of them are in Tulare County, a farming powerhouse in central California’s San Joaquin Valley. Atkins said she still received calls from people whose wells were running dry and needed a tank and bottled water.  “In no way is it over,” she said of the drought. “We will run out of money before we run out of people that need help.” "
"In the dark clouds gathering over the future of the Great Barrier Reef, there has been a small silver lining for the people who make their living showcasing the natural wonder. When the reef was rocked by an unprecedented second mass bleaching event in the space of a year, the coral hardest-hit by heat stress lay mostly in the tourist-heavy latitudes between Cairns and Townsville.  But despite last year’s damage compounded by new cases dotted across 800 reefs in a 1,500km stretch, not a single reef tourism operator has been forced to seek out new ground to take visitors. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which licenses operators to visit designated reef sites, confirmed it has received one request to change a permit. And that was not because of bleaching but Cyclone Debbie further south, which damaged that other hub of reef tourism, the Whitsundays after it escaped the bleaching. By an accident of geography, the tourist operators say, the most wondrous sites for public viewing, which tend to fall on the edge of the continental shelf near cooler, deeper waters, are the ones also spared the worst damage from bleaching. For now at least. “Look, if we get another year of this, we’ll be in an absolute world of hurt and I know that,” Col McKenzie, chief executive of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators says. Just 7% of the reef is set aside for tourism. But McKenzie says he is frustrated that “the story being put out there that there’s been severe bleaching throughout the whole area: it’s just not true”. Aerial surveys released by scientists on 10 April showed back-to-back bleaching had occurred in a range along two-thirds of the world’s largest living structure. It indicated bleaching levels of more than 60% of coral this time were concentrated in reefs between Port Douglas and Townsville. It was the fourth mass bleaching to hit the reef in recorded history – all since 1998 – and coral scientists are alarmed the increasing regularity of these events gives stressed coral precious little chance to recover. After last year’s bleaching, which killed off 22% of coral mainly in the isolated northern section of the reef, US magazine Outside went so far as to run an obituary on the reef: “25 million BC - 2016”. The latest findings prompted further grim forecasts for the reef, which water quality expert Jon Brodie said was now in a “terminal stage”.  While acknowledging significant bleaching in their region of the reef, tourism operators want this to be reported with more precision. For example, McKenzie says, there could be more emphasis on the fact bleached coral is not necessarily dead, and bleaching across two-thirds of the reef does not equate to two-thirds of the reef being entirely bleached. McKenzie says the industry “can’t afford to lie” by talking up its designated sites and then showing tourists a place where “all the coral’s dead and there’s nothing but algae”. “You will not have a business in 12 months. Social media will kill you. We have to tell people what’s there.” The “smart operators” are highlighting the moderate cases of bleaching for tourists and talking about it, McKenzie says. “But most of the tourists come back and they’ve seen this fluorescent coral and they’re really excited with how bright and vibrant it is. They don’t realise that that fluorescent coral is in the process of being very, very sick.” At least the fluorescent coral, as opposed to the more-stressed stark white coral, has a better chance of bouncing back, he says. McKenzie’s concerns about the portrayal of a dying reef are shared by Claire Zwick, a former GBRMPA boat skipper and now co-owner of Coral Sea Dreaming in Cairns. Coral Sea Dreaming has 28 permitted sites, the largest number of any Cairns operator, “a pretty cool thing to be able to boast”, Zwick says. Zwick, who did coral bleaching surveys in the past with GBRMPA, says some of those sites last year had 90% bleaching in stages 1 to 3, with “the hardest hit being our middle reef sites” closer to shore from the continental shelf.  She estimates her staff saw 1-3% of corals averaged across their sites die last year, with similar levels of bleaching this year. But she wants the world to know that “the reef is still alive and beautiful”. From her company’s prized mooring at Michaelmus Cay, for example, she says she can see “100% coral cover – magic”. “That was even after the bleaching event of last year, as far as my eye can see, coral.” Zwick is a self-described conservationist who is very concerned about the climate impact of Adani’s proposed north Queensland coalmine and hopes it does not go ahead. She was among more than 170 businesses and individuals who signed an open letter to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, calling for the scrapping of the mine and urgent climate change action after last year’s bleaching. Zwick wants climate change action not just on coal exports but in energy use in Australian households. Her grave concern is that while some corals prove resilient to warmer seas, the “butterfly effect” of others dying off will trigger “a huge reduction in richness of species on the reef”. “While everyone can sit here and say, ‘The reef’s fine, it can withstand it’ – well, yeah, it can, but they’re not looking at the big picture.” But Zwick says reef tourism operators have a “pretty weak voice” politically. This is in part because the industry is largely made up of small to medium businesses where “everybody’s working seven days a week and it’s really hard to fit in a political agenda”, she says. Tony Fontes, a Whitsundays reef tour operator who also signed the open letter to Turnbull, says the industry can only wish it had the influence of the mining lobby when it comes to decisions that affect the reef. But with $5.2bn in income and 64,000 jobs attributed to the reef, the tourism industry could gain a large amount of sway “if they could get their act together and jump and down as a unit”, Fontes says. “It’s just a matter of getting them to operate together, that’s like herding bunch of cats,” he says. Meanwhile, Fontes, like many others in the Whitsundays, is busy “mopping up my house” as the Easter tourism season sinks into oblivion with visitors staying away in droves in the cyclone’s wake. “It’s going to be hard to catch up,” he says.  Despite the bleaching, and dire forecasts of the reef’s survival, visitors keep coming in record numbers. The past year saw those escorted into the marine park by a commercial operator – as recorded in the number of people paying their $6.50 environmental management levy – again top 2 million, according to the Queensland Tourism Industry Council. The council’s chief executive, Daniel Gschwind, says the reef is now “possibly more famous than Australia”. “Everybody has heard of it, most people want to come and visit some time, many people report fond memories of it,” he says. “I can’t readily think of many more iconic landscapes, or seascapes, than the reef.” Gschwind says it is not “an excuse or a defence” for not grappling with the conservation imperative to point out that “some reefs being visited are to an extent affected by bleaching but not to the point where you wouldn’t take visitors anymore”.  “In fact, we’re not shy about showing visitors what it can look like.  “We are very committed to the conservation of the reef but we clearly also want to make sure that the information and the description of the bleaching is accurate and not deterring visitors from continuing to visit. “And also, by the way, not discourage people from continuing to put the effort into conservation and reach the conclusion that all is lost, we might as well give up.” The QTIC has joined forces with environmental groups and the National Farmers Federation to lobby the federal government for more funding for reef conservation by pitching the reef as economic infrastructure that requires significant upkeep. Gschwind says he would like to think the tourism industry now has a louder voice in Canberra on the reef given its well-publicised environmental damage is “hard to ignore and hard to hide”. This would only grow louder if another bleaching event follows closely, for example. “We should have a political voice on behalf of the community because what we defend is a public asset,” he says. Gschwind acknowledges the future for tourism industry also points towards advocacy on global climate goals. “The reef is often referred to as the canary in the mine shaft and I think we have an opportunity, if not an obligation, to encourage the global community to do the right thing not just to keep the reef alive but to allow us all to continue living on this planet, because the reef is only an indicator of what’s in store for all of us if we don’t get it right.”"
"Even if the world were to cut emissions to zero tomorrow, global temperatures and sea levels would rise for decades. If our roll of the climate dice is unlucky, they could rise for centuries. It is in this context that some climate researchers have begun to reluctantly take seriously ideas first proposed in the 1960s: the possibility of using solar geoengineering to help restore the world’s climate, alongside aggressive actions to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions to zero and below. Fear of solar geoengineering is entirely healthy. Its mere prospect might be hyped by fossil fuel interests to thwart emissions cuts. It could be used by one or a few nations in a way that’s harmful to many. There might be some yet undiscovered risk making the technology much less effective in reality than the largely positive story told by computer models.  Yet that healthy fear can distort discussion in unhealthy ways. A reader glancing at recent coverage in the Guardian, especially a piece by Martin Lukacs, might assume we were capitalistic tools of Donald Trump, eager to geoengineer the planet, democracy and justice be damned. That reader might miss the fact that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that, “Models consistently suggest that [solar geoengineering] would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no [solar geoengineering]”, or that many scientists, including the UK Royal Society and US National Academy, support research. So do many environmentalists, including the Environmental Defence Fund and the Natural Resources Defence Council. With all that in mind, we have begun to study solar geoengineering more closely. The emphasis here is on study. It would be reckless to deploy solar geoengineering based on today’s limited research. What makes Harvard’s effort different is that we are planning on doing so in an integrated, multi-disciplinary programme spanning many faculties and points of view. That integrated programme is the context for a proposed outdoor experiment. Prof Frank Keutsch and one of us (Keith) are proposing to fly a balloon about 20km into the air. Its objective is to quantify the microphysics of introducing tiny particles into the stratosphere to improve estimates of the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering in large atmospheric models. It is not a “test” of planetary cooling. The amount of material we would release is tiny compared to everyday activities. For example, if we tested sulphates, we would put less material into the stratosphere than a typical commercial aircraft does in one minute of flight. Our material of choice for the first flight? Frozen water. Later flights might include tiny amounts of calcium carbonate or indeed sulphates. That said, we do not ask anyone to take our word about the safety or legal compliance of the experiment. Risk must be independently assessed, and legal compliance assured, or we will not fly. Governance of experiments is currently inadequate. To that end, we are seeking advice from Janos Pasztor’s Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative, major environmental NGOs, and various other civil society organisations to develop an independent advisory process for the experiment. It’s a bootstrap process with the goal of fostering international governance for future experiments. Crucially, we will only proceed with the experiment if doing so does not imperil the long-term ability to develop a solar geoengineering research programme with broad public and stakeholder support. Facts matter, or at least they should. Friday’s Guardian article implied that the experiment is funded by Bill Gates, but it is not. Gates will in future likely fund the interdisciplinary solar geoengineering research program at Harvard, but his funding will amount to less than 40% of the total, and this experiment is not funded by him. Other funders already include the Hewlett foundation, itself among the largest funders of climate research and advocacy. (Our public forum this past Friday, in turn, was funded by the Sloan foundation.) It is possible that the broader programme will end up supporting the experiment in later years, but at least through the first flights, the experiment is funded by internal Harvard research funds given to new professors. Martin Lukacs’s analysis piece is in an entirely different league. It comes after a similarly biased piece four years ago, which severely distorted our proposed experiment. The current piece hypes a link to Trump, but if Trump were to push solar geoengineering while gutting climate science, we believe the only appropriate response is active resistance. Fear of solar geoengineering is justified. So is fear of the largely unaccounted-for tail risks of climate change, which make the problem much worse than most realise. Ending fossil fuels will not eliminate climate risks, it just stops the increase of atmospheric carbon. That carbon and its climate risk cannot be wished away. There is a prudent case for an international, transparent, and sustainable solar geoengineering research programme that includes field experiments with appropriate governance. We welcome debate on the merits of such a research programme."
"A surge in the use of wind and solar energy helped Europe to cut its fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by about 10% in 2015, an authoritative new report has found.  Energy use from renewables rose to 16.7% of Europe’s total, up from 15% in 2013, and accounted for 77% of the continent’s new power capacity.  But the clean energy burst is still not moving fast enough to prevent a “lock-in” of already-commissioned fossil fuel capacity, which will otherwise transform into stranded assets. It was also unevenly spread across Europe, with renewables expanding to take up 30% of the power load in many Scandinavian countries, but only 5% in Malta. The UK had Europe’s seventh best record for the intensity of its greenhouse gasemissions, but was a mid-table performer in terms of emissions per capita, according to figures compiled by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Mihai Tomescu, who authored the EEA study, said Europe’s renewable roll-out was accelerating, but not fast enough to halt global warming at 2C. “The current level of effort needs to be stepped up and this is not necessarily going to happen without additional focus,” he told the Guardian. The EEA’s report suggests that the EU is broadly on track to achieve its goals of 20% emissions cuts and 20% renewable energy share by 2020. But a more challenging target for 2050 – of reducing emissions by at least 80% – will require acceleration after 2030, when tough decisions about phasing out internal combustion engines and oil supplies will have to be taken. James Watson, the chief executive of SolarPower Europe, which represents Europe’s solar photovoltaic industry, said that today’s figures were in line with a 50GW spike in global solar capacity last year.  “This is a good start and we must be positive about that but if we are truly to meet our obligations under the Paris agreement, we will need to see a much faster growth of renewables and a commensurate, much faster reduction of fossil fuels, and coal power in particular,” he said. Renewables have replaced 100m tonnes of oil equivalent electricity generation this decade, but will only need to replace 20m tonnes in the 10 years ahead, according to SolarPower Europe’s analysis. Tomescu noted that Europe’s growth in renewable energy was already coinciding with a drop in fossil fuel consumption. “In broad terms, we are talking about a substitution and this has an impact not only on import dependency but also avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” he said."
"It was one of the most extreme heatwaves in south-eastern Australian history. During late January and early February 2009, temperature records were toppled across Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.  Then, on 7 February, 24 of Victoria’s 35 long-term stations recorded record high temperatures: Melbourne reached 46.4C while Hopetoun broke a state record with 48.8C.  These extreme temperatures were said to have caused an estimated 374 deaths in Victoria.  And it could happen again. Research from the University of Melbourne shows that many Melbourne apartments aren’t designed to withstand heatwave conditions and could become dangerously hot for residents. As temperatures continue to soar each summer, the researchers are calling for an upgrade to the Australian building code to include measures of apartment overheating during design, and for retrofit improvements to vulnerable apartments – and to bring the guidelines in line with international practice in a warming climate. Using data from the 2009 January-February heatwave, the researchers modelled the performance of six apartment designs typical to Melbourne. The apartments were run without artificial cooling, to see “what happens from a health and safety perspective if the air conditioner breaks or the grid power goes out”, according to the lead researcher, Chris Jensen. All apartments failed the international “summer comfort” standards from the UK, France, Germany and the United States.  Housing comfort isn’t simply a matter of being a little hot and bothered: heat stress claims more Australian lives than all other natural hazards. But the building code of Australia contains no standards to guard against this. Standards now focus on reducing energy requirements for cooling rather than directly addressing measures of heat stress. After the deaths of 14,800 people from heat stress in France in 2003, the French building code now requires that buildings can maintain a “comfortable” indoor temperature without the need for active cooling systems. It stipulates that room temperatures do not exceed 28C for more than 260 hours throughout a year.  Jensen says modelling the effects of retrofit strategies, such as changing thermal mass, insulation, light-coloured walls and natural ventilation, resulted in even the worst-performing apartment improving enough to meet two of the four international standards.  “There is one fairly glaringly obvious outcome: that proper use of natural ventilation by the occupants was reported both in the literature and in the study to be highly effective and very under-used,” he says.  Jensen says the study could be expanded to analyse apartments across the country, although other areas have different heatwave profiles. “The further north you are in Australia, the less temperature variation there is – further inland also has higher variations, so one would expect Mildura to be pretty severe (but there are basically no apartments).” He says it would be worthwhile considering other states: “I would expect Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne to be the worst, possibly Canberra as well, but … it is subject to there being apartments, and a weather pattern with severe heatwaves.” The research confirms the thinking behind measures taken by a growing number of progressive Australian architects. Maintaining a comfortable temperature without using air conditioning was a priority when designing the Brunswick apartment building the Commons for Jeremy McLeod, an architect and founding director of Breathe Architecture.  “It’s really important to have well-performing windows,” McLeod says. “We paid more for that and it helped us increase our star rating. It also helped our thermal modelling, which told us we could then take out the air conditioning.” He says the key message from the study is that cooling strategies should be applied together, adding that thermal mass and natural ventilation have worked well at the Commons.  “We have incredibly stable temperatures through winter and summer and to be able to get through the [January 2014] heatwave with no air conditioning, I think was incredible.” As a result, they’re putting more thermal mass into their new Nightingale housing model.  “Everyone has been naive, so people have been ignoring climate change – they thought they could deal with it with bigger and bigger air conditioners,” McLeod says. “Until what happened in South Australia last year, no one had pondered the possibility that our grid would fail, and of course you need to allow for that possibility.” He’s investigating the idea of heat refuges in co-housing – for example, a basement communal room with a high-efficiency air conditioner that can run on solar in emergencies.  Andrew Maynard, co-director of Austin Maynard Architects, isn’t surprised by the results of the study. “We know the health risks from some of the studies coming out about suburban living, but then to see that these things just turn into ovens and cook people, that’s alarming,” he says. The recommendations are encouraging, he adds. “There’s a way out.”  Maynard says the liveability of apartments in Australia suffers because they’re seen as commodities rather than homes.  “We need to remember that what’s legislated will be the norm. Why would they put expensive external shading on a western facade when they can just throw in a cheap air conditioner? We absolutely need to legislate this stuff because it’s the only reason developers would do any of it.”  He says their designs consider building orientation, maximise passive sunlight in winter and minimise it during summer, and optimise through-breezes. They know that if they need to introduce air conditioning “we’ve somehow designed it wrong”. Another priority is helping residents understand how to passively manage the buildings’ temperature themselves. This understanding is important when people are looking at apartments, to drive demand for sustainable design, Maynard says.  Dimitri Kapetas, a co-director and designer at Fremantle-based architecture group EHDO, says their projects draw inspiration from designs in similar climates. An example is the Persian wind-catcher, which can be combined with an underground canal, using air pressure differences to draw air down over the water and reduce the temperature.  “You can almost get it down to iced temperatures; I’ve been to a couple in North India and it was freezing down there on a 40C day,” Kapetas says.  Diluted versions of these ideas can easily be applied to new buildings, he says. “If you put a water source and/or vegetation in front of a large opening in a building on the south-western side – where the cool breeze comes from in Fremantle – and a small, high opening at the other end of the house, the breeze drops around 1-2C,” Kapetas says. For Western Australia’s first Nightingale project, they plan to make the warmer winds from the north-east travel over water and vegetation to cool before they hit the building. The design will also involve a six- to seven-metre-wide “green street” that channels wind through deciduous trees, with little wind-catchers to funnel the air into the apartments on either side. All apartments will have two north-to-south windows. “I don’t want to be preachy,” says Kapetas, “but those [suggestions in the report] are things that should almost just be standard design … there are really simple things that can be done for not much more cost.”"
"There’s no shortage of measures that homeowners and businesses can take to lessen their environmental footprint – from better insulation and double glazing, to easing up on air-con usage and swapping in LED lights.  One part of the house that seems to be attracting more than its fair share of attention is the roof. Replacing a standard roof with a lovingly cultivated green roof of plants or adorning it with increasingly trendy solar panels can do wonders for reducing a building’s carbon footprint.   Rooftop solar panels are an obvious option for many, and increasingly affordable. The average price of a residential solar photovoltaic (PV) system has been steadily dropping, from $2.40 per watt in 2012 to $1.58 per watt in March this year, according to Solar Choice’s PV price index. On the commercial front, too, prices are at an all-time low of just $1.23 per watt.  Add to this the advent of affordable battery storage systems, and Tesla’s plans to roll out roof tiles that dispense with the need for separate solar panels over the coming months, and rooftop solar has never been more attractive.  But a building’s rooftop can be used for more than just harvesting the sun’s rays. Indeed, cool roofs aim to do exactly the opposite, reflecting as much of the sun’s energy as possible. A flat roof in the midday sun receives about 1,000 watts of sunlight per square metre. A dark roof will absorb most of this energy, heating the roof and underlying building, as well as the surrounding air. Air conditioners that suck in this hot air can further exacerbate a building’s cooling requirements.  “If you have a cool roof, that problem can be eliminated,” says Geoff Smith from the University of Technology Sydney, a specialist in green roofing technologies.  The easiest way to reflect the sun’s rays is to paint a roof white – something the Greeks have been doing for centuries. A white roof reflects around 85% of the sunlight that hits it – at least when it’s clean – and heats to just a few degrees warmer than the outside air temperature. A black roof, by contrast, can heat to more than 80C, according to sustainable construction expert Chris Jensen from the University of Melbourne.  “On a black tile roof, you could fry an egg, and on a cool roof you could walk on it in your bare feet,” says Jensen, “that’s the magnitude of the difference.”  Recently, Smith’s group and others have produced roof coatings that keep roof temperatures even lower than the ambient temperature. They achieve this by reflecting sunlight using thin plastic sheets – akin to a plastic food wrap – often combined with layers of silver and other reflective nanoparticles.  But there’s a catch. “These experiments might look marvellous in the scientific literature,” says Smith, but in most cases, they “just won’t work in practice.” That’s because most of these super-reflective coverings look essentially like a mirror. For a sloped residential house, the result would be an eyesore, if not a danger to nearby road users.  Unlike green roofs, which can require considerable infrastructure to support and maintain, cool roofs can be achieved with a painted-on coating to an already existing roof. While white reflects the most visible light, coloured roofs can also be made cooler by coating with materials designed to reflect light in the infrared spectrum, which also contributes to how hot a roof gets. When combined with an elastomeric weatherproof coating, upgrading to a cool roof can add years to the life of an ageing roof, says Jensen. The benefits of a cool roof extend beyond the building it sits upon. The heated air that sits above dark roofs is a large contributor to the urban heat island effect, which can put urban temperatures three to four degrees warmer than surrounding areas. Modelling of urban heating in Chicago estimated that the air temperature above cool roofs would be reduced by 7-8C compared with conventional roofs. Cool roofs even outperformed green roofs – by about a degree. The energy savings are also large. Increasing a roof’s reflectivity from 10-20% to around 60% can cut a building’s cooling costs by more than 20%. But not all buildings benefit – a high-rise apartment or office block won’t reap anywhere near the same benefits as a sprawling low-rise warehouse, shopping centre or airport, or even a single-story dwelling. As an added bonus, work by Jensen and his colleagues has shown that solar panels installed on a cool roof produce almost 7% more electricity on a typical day than those installed on a conventional roof. At a global level, the impact is nothing to be scoffed at. In 2009, researchers at the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in the US estimated that some 24 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year could be offset if the world’s cities adopted cool roofs – not bad considering that urban areas constitute just 1% of Earth’s land area. The offset for a single house with a 100 sqm roof area is around 6 tonnes of carbon dioxide – a decent chunk of the 26 tonnes per capita of greenhouse gases that Australians are currently emitting.  One criticism of cool roofs is that the benefits of cooling in summer can be outweighed by an increased demand for heating in winter. But according to Smith, roofs are rarely the main culprit for heat loss in Australian buildings. Sealing leaks is far more effective in preventing heat loss, according to modelling that he and colleagues conducted in 2012. One of the main challenges, says Smith, is confronting the aesthetics. Although lighter-coloured roofs are becoming more popular in the hotter climate of Queensland, he says, “a lot of people shy off the idea of a white roof.”"
"Luxury car owners may seem like an unlikely target for organizing a political resistance movement, but to Doug Derwin, it’s all about the make: Tesla.  Derwin is investing up to $2m in an effort to persuade Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, to speak out against Donald Trump’s climate change policy and resign from his positions in groups advising Trump on business and manufacturing jobs. On Monday, Derwin launched the website ElonDumpTrump.com laying out his argument that Musk’s role in the administration is inconsistent with his role as a leader on climate change.  Full page ads will run in the New York Times, Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News on Sunday. Television ads will air during Morning Joe, Meet the Press and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. Over the past month, Derwin has deployed mobile billboards around the offices of Musk’s various companies with messages including “Elon: The Trump Won’t Wash Off” and “SpaceX: Is Mars Worth Global Warming Here?” He is also asking owners of Tesla vehicles to sign a petition and send personal messages to Musk. Those on the waitlist for Tesla’s coveted vehicles are encouraged to withdraw – an action Derwin took when he learned of Musk’s ties to Trump. (Derwin said that he lost his deposit and donated the $150,000 cost of the car to the American Civil Liberties Union.) So far, Derwin estimates that he has spent $750,000 on the campaign. If Musk accedes to his demands, he has pledged to donate $1m to a charity of Musk’s choice.  The Elon Dump Trump campaign is just one of several nascent efforts to pressure the tech industry to push back against the Trump administration, but it may be the best funded. Derwin said he experienced a windfall due to the post-election stock market rally.  “Donald Trump’s election has made me a lot of money,” he said. “I consider that blood money. I’ll use it to oppose Trump.”  While Derwin thinks that Trump’s presidency is “a travesty” on multiple levels, he is particularly outraged by his rollback of climate change regulations. The fact that Musk has posed for photo-ops with Trump is particularly galling, Derwin said, because Musk is “recognized as being a leader on climate change”.  “I want Musk to speak up against Donald Trump’s climate change policies,” he said. “His failure to do so sends the message that it’s not really a big deal and not worth his time.”  Though Musk has yet to respond to Derwin’s call, Tesla is certainly paying attention. Sam Teller, director of the office of the CEO at SpaceX and Tesla, contacted Derwin by phone after his billboards started popping up.  Teller told Derwin that Musk’s “sincerity shouldn’t be questioned” on climate change, and that speaking out against him was the wrong thing to do, according to Derwin. Last week, Derwin was invited to a meeting at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, where he sat down with Teller, Tesla general counsel Todd Maron, and Tesla’s vice-president of business development, Diarmuid O’Connell.  Though Derwin voluntarily agreed to keep the contents of the meeting confidential, he did say that “it didn’t accomplish anything”. As for the presence of Maron, Derwin said, “I was a lawyer and still am … When you take a lawyer to a meeting like that, it’s intended to send a signal.” Tesla did not respond to repeated inquiries about its interactions with Derwin. Asked for comment on Musk’s view of Trump’s climate change policy, a Tesla spokesman initially shared a statement by Musk from early February, when he was first under pressure to withdraw from Trump’s business advisory group. On Wednesday, a Tesla spokesman provided the following additional statement: “It’s quite ironic that the reason being given for attacking Elon is to help the environment. Tesla’s entire reason for existing is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. If someone wants to spend money to promote a pro-environment objective, we can think of better ways to do that than attacking the people who are most committed to that very purpose. Mr Derwin believes those who want a more sustainable future should not have a seat at the table. We obviously disagree.” In the weeks since Musk met with Trump, the president has rolled back fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, signed an executive order to undo Barack Obama’s clean power plan, and proposed a budget that would gut the Environmental Protection Agency’s climate change, pollution and energy efficiency programs. "
"It takes a very special person to label the photographed, documented, filmed and studied phenomenon of mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef “fake news”. You need lashings of chutzpah, blinkers the size of Donald Trump’s hairspray bill and more hubris than you can shake a branch of dead coral at.  It also helps if you can hide inside the bubble of the hyper-partisan Breitbart media outlet, whose former boss is the US president’s chief strategist. So our special person is the British journalist James Delingpole who, when he’s not denying the impacts of coral bleaching, is denying the science of human-caused climate change, which he says is “the biggest scam in the history of the world”. Delingpole was offended this week by an editorial in the Washington Post that read: “Humans are killing the Great Barrier Reef, one of the world’s greatest natural wonders, and there’s nothing Australians on their own can do about it. We are all responsible.”  Delingpole wrote:  Like the thriving polar bear, like the recovering ice caps, like the doing-just-fine Pacific islands, the Great Barrier Reef has become a totem for the liberal-left not because it’s in any kind of danger but because it’s big and famous and photogenic and lots and lots of people would be really sad if it disappeared. But it’s not going to disappear. That’s just a #fakenews lie designed to promote the climate alarmist agenda. Now before we go on, let’s deal with some language here.  When we talk about the reef dying, what we are talking about are the corals that form the reef’s structure – the things that when in a good state of health can be splendorous enough to support about 69,000 jobs in Queensland and add about $6bn to Australia’s economy every year. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered mass coral bleaching three times – in 1998, 2002 and 2016 – with a fourth episode now unfolding. The cause is increasing ocean temperatures. “Is the Great Barrier Reef dying due to climate change caused by man’s selfishness and greed?” asks Delingpole, before giving a long list of people and groups who he thinks will answer yes, including “the Guardian” and “any marine biologist”. “Have they been out there personally – as I have – to check. No of course not,” says Delingpole. Yes. James Delingpole has been out there “personally” to check, but all those other people haven’t. He doesn’t say when he went but he has written about one trip before. It was back in late April 2012. Everything was fine, he said, based on that one visit. I can’t find any times when he has mentioned another trip since.  So here’s the rhetorical question – one that I can barely believe I’m asking, even rhetorically. Why should there not be equivalence between Delingpole’s single trip to the reef (apparently taken 10 years after a previous severe case of bleaching and four years before the one that followed) at one spot on a reef system that spans the size of Italy [takes breath] and the observations of scientists from multiple institutions diving at 150 different locations to verify observations taken by even more scientists in low-flying aircraft traversing the entire length of the reef? I mean, come on? Why can those two things – Delingpole making a boat trip with mates and a coordinated and exhaustive scientific monitoring and data-gathering exercise – not be the same?  So it seems we are now at a stage where absolutely nothing is real unless you have seen it for yourself, so you can dismiss all of the photographs and video footage of bleached and dead coral, the testimony of countless marine biologists (who, we apparently also have to point out, have been to the reef ) and the observations made by the government agency that manages the reef. Senator Pauline Hanson and her One Nation climate science-denying colleagues tried to pull a similar stunt last year by taking a dive on a part of the reef that had escaped bleaching and then claiming this as proof that everything was OK everywhere else. This is like trying to disprove to a doctor that you have two broken legs by showing him an MRI scan of your head (which may or not reveal the presence of a brain), and then being annoyed when he doesn’t accept your evidence. It’s as though we’ve reached peak denial. Last year’s bleaching on the reef was the worst episode recorded to date. The current fourth mass bleaching has scientists again taking to the field. This month a study published in Nature, and co-authored by 46 scientists, found these three episodes had impacted reefs “across almost the entire Great Barrier Reef marine park”. Only southern offshore reefs had escaped. Corals bleach when they are exposed to abnormally high ocean temperatures for too long. Under stress, the corals expel the algae that give them their colour and more of their nutrients.  Corals can recover but, as the study explains, even the fastest growing and most vigorous colonisers in the coral family need between 10 and 15 years to recover. After the 2016 bleaching, a quarter of all corals on the reef, mostly located in the once “pristine” northern section, died before there was a chance for recovery. In a further blow, the study looked at factors such as improving water quality or reducing fishing pressure and asked if these had helped corals to resist bleaching. In each case, they found they did not (although they do give reefs that survive a better chance to recover). Essentially, the study found the only measure that would give corals on the reef a fighting chance was to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The lead author of the study, Prof Terry Hughes of James Cook University (who is this week carrying out aerial surveys of the current bleaching episode), told my Positive Feedback podcast: We can’t climate-proof reefs. Sure, there’s stuff we need to do be doing locally around water quality and fisheries management, but doing these two things alone is not going to protect the reefs in the long term. The elephant in the room here is climate change. Some commentators have suggested a key cause of the 2016 bleaching was the El Niño weather pattern that tends to deliver warmer global temperatures. But Hughes says that before 1998, the Great Barrier Reef went through countless El Niños without suffering the extensive mass bleaching episodes that are being seen, photographed, filmed and documented now. Dr Mark Eakin, head of Coral Reef Watch at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the cause of the modern-day mass bleaching episodes on reefs across the world was the rise in ocean temperatures. This, says Eakin, is “being driven largely by humans and our burning of fossil fuels”. Government ministers at federal and state levels, of both political stripes, claim they want to protect the reef. They are running this protection racket, somehow, by continuing to support plans for a coalmine that will be the biggest in the country’s history. That’s some more hubris right there."
"In an almost unbroken line from Monkey Mia, down across the Bight and then all the way up the other side to Mackay, the Australian coast is etched in various shades of brown. This is the historical precipitation map. Annual rainfall has dropped, it shows, across this enormous stretch of coastline, by as much as 100 millilitres since 1951. In another map, concentric rings of increasingly angry red emanate from the centre of the continent. This one shows that, assuming we keep going as we are, the temperature in our country will increase by as much as 5C by the end of the century. Eight, if we’re unlucky.   This, by the way, is not the marketing material of some lefty environmental organisation. This is the product of thousands of the world’s top climate scientists, using some of the most sophisticated computer models ever built, to generate projections so fine-grained they simulate even the amount of moisture in every parcel of soil on the planet, and in the poles, the thickness of every chunk of sea ice.  These models give a glimpse of the Australia we are creating. They show the nation’s wheatbelts, from Esperance to the Wimmera, dried to a crisp. They show the Queensland coast being thrashed more relentlessly by fiercer storms. They show a rash of summer bushfires that make Black Saturday look like candles on a cake. But they do not show the reef. By the end of the century, we will have boiled it to death.  This is the Australia we are creating. Even more, it is the Australia we will have to accept if the Adani mine is approved.  Research published last year by four Oxford economists and scientists concluded that to keep climate change to below 2C, no new coal plants can be built after 2017 unless they have zero emissions. That means perfectly efficient carbon capture and storage would have to be deployed on every coal plant in the world – an absurd fantasy. The paper also finds we already have in place sufficient “capital stock” – the global network of mines and electricity generators – to push us over 2C. At the same time, global coal demand has already peaked and is now falling, China and India have frozen construction on over 100 coal plants, and the economics of energy are pointing only in one direction: renewables.  This points to a stark lose-lose equation for potential new mines like Adani’s: either we burn their coal and induce dangerous climate change, or we don’t and waste billions of dollars.  Unless, of course, we take the third option: don’t build the thing. This is not, then, just another coalmine. It is a turning point. If we build Adani, we commit to irreparably harming Australia’s precious environment. If we don’t, we might still have a chance to save it. This is where we as a nation decide if we will be Asia’s rockpit for another 50 years, or a prosperous nation for the next 500.  Research just released shows that to avoid dangerous climate change, we need anthropogenic emissions to halve every decade. Building the biggest coalmine in history, when there is already a global glut and sufficient investment to tip us over the edge, is not what responsible conservative governments should be doing. They should be conserving all that is precious to us. Serving us. Instead, they are preparing to betray us.  If the world in 2077 is still burning as much coal as we are today, and the financial model of the Adani assumes it will, Australia as we know it – our wheatbelts, our reefs, our cities, and our lifestyles – will cease to exist.  Our government, sworn to protect the nation, should be doing everything it can to avert this looming crisis, not be falling over themselves to pay for the executioner’s bullet. If the government approves this monstrous mine, and the banks fund it, it will be committing environmental treason against every Australian who values our farmers, our coasts, our bush, and our way of life. We are about to choose Adani or Australia.  The argument against Adani achieves that rare distinction of finding purchase among all parts of society: patriots and cosmopolitans, environmentalists and economists, parochialists and internationalists, the job-hungry regions and the growth-hungry cities. We must all stop this affront to our nation. We must choose Australia."
"Significant majorities of Conservative voters want EU environmental regulations to be maintained or even strengthened in the wake of Brexit, a poll carried out for the Tory thinktank Bright Blue has found. While a handful of prominent Conservatives, such as the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, have argued that leaving the EU will allow Britain to revamp its rules on the subject, the survey found huge support for the status quo.  The Populus-conducted polling found Conservative voters wanted to keep not just relatively uncontroversial protections such as beach standards, but also EU fishing quotas and targets for renewable energy production. Onshore wind farms won majority support, while the survey found that even two-thirds of leave-supporting Tory voters were proud of the UK’s international role in protecting the environment. Rebecca Pow, the Conservative MP for Taunton Deane, who works with Bright Blue on environmental issues, said the findings were not a surprise to her. “I have found huge support among Conservatives from old to young for protecting our precious environment,” she said. “In this Brexit world we should adopt wholesale the current EU environment legislation relating to areas including water, wildlife, habitats, beaches and climate change and tailor it to our particular needs, as time goes on. “Conservatives have always cared for and been custodians of the environment but this report demonstrates we can be even bolder in our future approach to this area and I shall be working to encourage this endeavour.”  The polling found support of 90% or more for the maintenance or strengthening of regulations connected to water quality and beach cleanliness, habitats protections, and targets for curbing air pollution and combating increasing household waste. Renewable energy generation targets saw 85% backing, with nearly two-thirds supporting existing fishing quotas and a ban on the production of genetically modified crops. The survey found 60% of those polled accept the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change, while more than half of the voters ranked renewable energy generation as one of their top priorities. Two-thirds backed policies to phase out coal from electricity generation. Even more of those asked support measures to oblige all homes being sold to meet a minimum energy performance standard (70%) and to tighten regulations on new diesel engines (74%). Sam Hall, a senior researcher at Bright Blue who wrote the report based on the polling, said that as parliament prepared to debate the so-called “great repeal bill”, which would shift EU rules into UK law, “there is no mandate from Conservatives to dilute current environmental regulations”. He said: “Most Conservatives do care about climate change and the natural environment. They support ambitious environmental policies, including closing Britain’s remaining coal-fired power stations to introducing new low-emission zones in air pollution hotspots. There is a clear mandate from its own voters for the Conservative government to adopt a more ambitious, conservative agenda on the environment.”"
"On Saturday, thousands of scientists are set to abandon the cloistered neutrality of their laboratories to plunge into the the political fray against Donald Trump in what will likely be the largest-ever protest by science advocates. The March for Science, a demonstration modeled in part on January’s huge Women’s March, will inundate Washington DC’s national mall with a jumble of marine biologists, birdwatchers, climate researchers and others enraged by what they see as an assault by Trump’s administration upon evidence-based thinking and scientists themselves. The march is a visceral response to a presidency that has set about the evisceration of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and many of its science-based rules, the dismissal of basic climate change tenets by the president and his appointees and a proposed budget that would remove around $7bn from science programs, ranging from cancer research to oceanography to Nasa’s monitoring of the Earth. Many scientists at federal agencies, concerned their work may be sidelined or censored for political purposes, will take the unusual step of publicly damning the administration.  “It’s important for scientists to get out of the lab and talk about what’s important,” said Andrew Rosenberg, who spent a decade at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and is now at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “You don’t check your citizenship at the door when you get a PhD. No one would tell an architect they can’t have a view on HUD [the Department of Housing and Urban Development]. That would be nonsense.” Rosenberg said younger scientists, in particular, are increasingly rejecting a stance of studied silence when faced with what they see as threats to their profession. “They don’t accept that they have to wait until tenure, comfortable in a lab to maybe then speak out,” he said. “Academia is less appealing to many of them these days, so they want to know how they can have an impact now. They aren’t content that people will just read their papers in academic journals. I think retreating to your lab and hoping it will all go away is not going to be the best strategy.” The idea to march was first tossed around on a Reddit thread in January. One of those on the discussion, University of Texas postdoctoral fellow Jonathan Berman, decided to put the idea into motion. A day or two after being set up, a Facebook page promoting the march had attracted more than 300,0000 members.  The march now has dozens of people grappling with the logistics of the DC march and more than 500 companion events around the world. More than 100 organizations have lent their support, including the institutional heft of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific organization, and the American Geophysical Union.  Retreating to your lab and hoping it will all go away is not going to be the best strategy In March, Bill Nye, the bow-tied embodiment of science for many Americans, and Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician who alerted the world to soaring levels of lead in the blood of children in Flint, Michigan, were named as honorary co-chairs. Organizers won’t commit to an expected number of protestors but are downplaying expectations that it will be anywhere near the scale of the Women’s March. The tone is expected to waver between pro-science and anti-Trump. The march will dovetail with the People’s Climate March, which will take place a week later. Signs reading “Make America Smart Again” and “What do we want? Evidence-based policy. When do we want it? After peer review” are expected to make an appearance at the science march. Copies of the Lorax will be handed out. There may well be a sea of brain-like knitted hats. “There will be plenty of ridiculous signs, it will be a lot of fun with serious moments too,” said Ayana Johnson, a marine biologist who became an organizer after seeing fellow scientists downloading climate data in case the administration removed it from public view. “I found that horrifying. That for me was the real alarm, but everyone has their own story.” The satellite marches around the world suggest Trump isn’t the sole cause of scientists’ unease. Globally, there is a “trend of anti-intellectualism”, said Johnson, where politicians play to voters’ base emotions rather than provide evidence-based policy.  “We have gotten ourselves into this situation because the public doesn’t understand how science benefits us in our everyday lives,” Johnson admitted. “We haven’t done a good job communicating the value of the work we do.” Some scientists, while sharing much of the anguish of the marchers, have questioned whether a protest in the heart of DC will in fact be counterproductive. Trump is probably more likely to respond to the march with an angry tweet than rethink cuts to cancer research, while Republicans who believe scientists are merely green-tinged activists with fancy titles will feel vindicated. “The march won’t change any minds in the Trump administration and it won’t convince rural and working class America that science is relevant to their lives,” said Robert Young, an expert in coastal geology at Western Carolina University. We're in this situation because the public doesn’t understand how science benefits us in our everyday lives “The march is on Earth Day, which plays into conservative and climate skeptic thinking that scientists are just environmentalists. Just watch how it will be covered by Fox News and conservative bloggers.” Young said he doesn’t think scientists should just “sit on their hands” and is similarly troubled that, for example, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt doesn’t accept the widespread understanding that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of global warming. “But we’ve convinced all the people we are going to convince,” Young said. “We can march and shout our heads off, but that won’t engage with people who have not bought the message.  “We need more face-to-face interaction in local communities. We should do AM radio talkshows. That can be quite a challenge, but that’s the radio that my family and my wife’s family listen to and they are regular working-class Americans. We need to meet these folks where they live.” While the public largely tells pollsters that it supports scientists and their work, there is underlying friction. Innovations in technology have helped drive automation of some jobs, while our ever-improving understanding of our environment has led to restrictions on some polluting industries. Trump tapped into this simmering angst and scientists’ challenge may well be explaining how their breakthroughs can help all of us. The March for Science “will exacerbate rather than address these tensions” according to Jason Lloyd, a program manager for the Consortium for Science, Policy, & Outcomes at Arizona State University. “The biggest issue confronting science is not a malicious and incompetent executive,” Lloyd wrote for Slate. “The critical challenge ... is figuring out how scientists can build an enduring relationship with all segments of the American public, so that discounting, defunding or vilifying scientists’ important work is politically intolerable.” Even some of the march’s supporters concede that the event won’t change administration thinking overnight. But even people who specialize in cool, rational thinking occasionally need to wail their frustration. “Scientists are very worried that we are losing science from the public sphere,” said Rosenberg. “I don’t think these events will prove a turning point but in Congress and in the states this will matter. Our representatives need to know that voters care about science.”"

"Sweden, Germany and France are the only European countries pursuing environmental policies in line with promises made at the Paris climate conference, according to a new ranking study. The UK is in fifth position in the table which assesses policy actions taken by EU states to meet Europe’s pledge of a 40% cut in carbon emissions by 2030.  Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and Italy are judged to be propping up the league, due to their support for forestry and carbon accounting dodges that weaken the greenhouse gas reduction effort. “EU politicians portraying themselves as climate leaders should put their money where their mouth is by closing loopholes in the EU’s key climate law and pushing for more ambition,” said Femke de Jong, the EU policy director for Carbon Market Watch, a campaign group that co-drafted the EU Climate Leadership Board survey. The ranking was compiled using ministerial statements and official documents submitted to the European commission, and was then cross-checked with country representatives. It focuses on behind-the-scenes lobby forays mounted by EU countries in negotiations over an “effort sharing regulation” to cover the 60% of European emissions that come from transport, buildings, agriculture and waste management. These fall outside the bloc’s flagship Emissions Trading System (ETS) which allocates tradable pollution permits to heavy industry. Several countries have tried to gain wiggle room in the talks by pushing for measures such as a later (and higher) baseline for measuring their CO2 cuts, or greater use of forestry credits to meet the EU’s climate goal. “Relying on credits from planting trees is troublesome as the carbon removals can be reversed at any time when trees are cleared and burned,” the report says. “Emissions from fossil fuels, on the other hand, stay in the atmosphere for centuries.” Other “loopholes” identified in the paper include a handout of 100m surplus ETS allowances, worth an expected €2bn, to nine countries to help them meet their emissions obligations on paper. When these were taken into account, only Sweden’s record was judged compatible with the Paris goals. Carlos Calvo Ambel, a spokesperson for Transport & Environment, the survey’s other co-sponsor, said: “The great majority of countries want to rig the law with loopholes so they can continue business as usual. Either Europe follows the lead of Sweden, Germany and France, which are going in the right direction, though not far enough, or we should forget about our climate leadership.”  An underlying problem confronting EU policy-makers is the profound, costly and rapid nature of the changes needed to limit global warming to 2C, as agreed at Paris.  Carbon emissions would have to halve every decade between now and 2050, with land use emissions following the same trajectory, according to a report published earlier this week."
"An immense river that flowed from one of Canada’s largest glaciers vanished over the course of four days last year, scientists have reported, in an unsettling illustration of how global warming dramatically changes the world’s geography. The abrupt and unexpected disappearance of the Slims river, which spanned up to 150 metres at its widest points, is the first observed case of “river piracy”, in which the flow of one river is suddenly diverted into another. For hundreds of years, the Slims carried meltwater northwards from the vast Kaskawulsh glacier in Canada’s Yukon territory into the Kluane river, then into the Yukon river towards the Bering Sea. But in spring 2016, a period of intense melting of the glacier meant the drainage gradient was tipped in favour of a second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination. The continental-scale rearrangement was documented by a team of scientists who had been monitoring the incremental retreat of the glacier for years. But on a 2016 fieldwork expedition they were confronted with a landscape that had been radically transformed. “We went to the area intending to continue our measurements in the Slims river, but found the riverbed more or less dry,” said James Best, a geologist at the University of Illinois. “The delta top that we’d been sailing over in a small boat was now a dust storm. In terms of landscape change it was incredibly dramatic.” Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Washington Tacoma and the paper’s lead author, added: “The water was somewhat treacherous to approach, because you’re walking on these old river sediments that were really goopy and would suck you in. And day by day we could see the water level dropping.” The team flew a helicopter over the glacier and used drones to investigate what was happening in the other valley, which is less accessible. “We found that all of the water that was coming out from the front of the glacier, rather than it being split between two rivers, it was going into just one,” said Best. While the Slims had been reduced to a mere trickle, the reverse had happened to the south-flowing Alsek river, a popular whitewater rafting river that is a Unesco world heritage site. The previous year, the two rivers had been comparable in size, but the Alsek was now 60 to 70 times larger than the Slims, flow measurements revealed. The data also showed how abrupt the change had been, with the Slims’ flow dropping precipitously from the 26 to 29 May 2016. Geologists have previously found evidence of river piracy having taken place in the distant past. “But nobody to our knowledge has documented it happening in our lifetimes,” said Shugar. “People had looked at the geological record, thousands or millions of years ago, not the 21st century, where it’s happening under our noses.” Prof Lonnie Thompson, a paleoclimatologist at Ohio State University who was not involved in the work, said the observations highlight how incremental temperature increases can produce sudden and drastic environmental impacts. “There are definitely thresholds which, once passed in nature, everything abruptly changes,” he said. Between 1956 and 2007, the Kaskawulsh glacier retreated by 600-700m. In 2016, there was a sudden acceleration of the retreat, and the pulse of meltwater led to a new channel being carved through a large ice field. The new channel was able to deliver water to the Alsek’s tributary whose steeper gradient resulted in the Slims headwater being suddenly rerouted along a new southwards trajectory. In a geological instant, the local landscape was redrawn. Where the Slims once flowed, Dall sheep from Kluane National Park are now making their way down to eat the fresh vegetation, venturing into territory where they can legally be hunted. The formerly clear air is now often turned into a dusty haze as powerful winds whip up the exposed riverbed sediment. Fish populations are being redistributed and lake chemistry is being altered. Waterfront land, which includes the small communities of Burwash Landing and Destruction Bay, is now further from shore. A statistical analysis, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests that the dramatic changes can almost certainly be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The calculations put chance of the piracy having occured due to natural variability at 0.5%. “So it’s 99.5% that it occurred due to warming over the industrial era,” said Best. The Yukon region is extremely sparsely inhabited, but future river piracy could have catastrophic effects on towns, villages and ecosystems that have sprung up around available water, according to an analysis accompanying the paper, by Rachel Headley, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. “If a river changes course so drastically that the drainage basin no longer reaches its original outlet, this change might eventually impact human and biological communities that have grown around the river’s original outlet,” she said. Thompson, who has documented glacial retreat on Mount Kilimanjaro, predicts that there will be an acceleration in the observations of river piracy events as glaciers retreat globally.  “I think we could see similar divergence in streams in the Himalayas as well as throughout the Third Pole region, the Andes of Peru, other sites in northern Canada and Alaska,” he said. “Often these events occur in remote and poor parts of our planet and thus go largely unnoticed by the larger population but greatly impact the livelihood of many families downstream.”"
"Over the last years, as the slow motion catastrophe known as climate change gathered momentum, many have people consoled themselves by imagining a tipping point, a specific manifestation of the crisis so grotesque and so extreme as to force our leaders to respond. The damage now evident throughout the Great Barrier Reef should dispel any illusion that such a point exists.  The reef’s a natural wonder: a complex miracle assembled over half a million years. As an instantly recognisable incarnation of the oceanic sublime, it provokes us to think about the less immediately photogenic aspects of our threatened marine ecosystems. We might struggle to imagine acidification or habitat destruction or coastal pollution but the bleaching of healthy coral makes palpable the less visible damage being done elsewhere. It’s not unreasonable, then, to see the reef as a red line, to expect its degradation to provoke some kind of acknowledgement of the state of the planet. Well, a few weeks ago the Greens’ Peter Whish-Wilson read to the Senate a widely-circulated tweet from reef specialist Professor Terry Hughes. “I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept.” I showed the results of aerial surveys of #bleaching on the #GreatBarrierReef to my students, And then we wept. pic.twitter.com/bry5cMmzdn The chamber responded with loud derision, as if the grief of a climate scientist constituted some tremendous joke got up for their especial amusement. Amid the jeers and hoots, Liberal frontbencher minister Simon Birmingham mockingly suggested that Whish-Wilson needed a hanky. The hilarity with which the senators responded to environmental disaster epitomised an administration whose leading members recently distinguished themselves by fondling lumps of coal during a debate in the lower chamber. Yet the undergraduate antics of the conservatives, shameful as they are, pall in comparison to the Queensland Labor government’s decision to back the Adani corporation’s bid to open the $21.7bn Carmichael mine near Rockhampton, in one of the biggest coal extraction projects anywhere in the planet. In March this year, 46 scientists co-authored a paper for the prestigious journal Nature in which they argued that only halting climate change would save the Great Barrier Reef. Think about that – and then consider that, if the Carmichael mine goes ahead, it will unleash some 128m tons of carbon dioxide each year of its operation – the equivalent of a quarter of Australia’s total emissions from fuel combustion – even as the huge infrastructure constructed for the project (a terminal located within the reef heritage area) will, we’re told, make other mines suddenly viable, potentially opening a new era for coal mining in the sunshine state. Despite the universally appalled response from environmentalists, the Queensland Labor government has declared the project “critical infrastructure” – and granted Adani unlimited water access for the next 60 years. In the past, activists sometimes suggested that climate politics transcended the old divisions between left and right. Even the greediest tycoon lived on the same planet as the rest of us. On that basis, the argument went, they could be won over in the fight to preserve it.  In reality, the environment’s always been a class issue. Climate change will devastate the poor – and the rich and the powerful will barely notice. Insulated by money, you can still treat nature as an inexhaustible resource to be endlessly abused, as per Donald Trump’s sons casually amusing themselves by slaughtering elephants and civets in Zimbabwe. When Pauline Hanson splashed about  off Great Keppel Island and then declared the Great Barrier Reef to be fine, the stunt hinted at a deeper truth. The politicians and tycoons with their stock options and property portfolios will still find pleasant locales for their holidays, no matter how degraded the oceans become. They have as little personal stake in combatting climate change as they do in fighting for housing affordability. Much has been made of the declining prices fetched by coal, with some arguing that, as renewables become more affordable, the free market itself will drive a shift to clean energy. But what’s happening in Queensland shows that capitalism doesn’t work like that. In the real world, the market isn’t akin to lemonade stands competing on street corners. As huge multinationals, the major polluters wield extensive power. The fossil fuel industry learned about climate change 40 years ago – and spent four decades preparing a political response. As a result, coal exerts far more influence in the corridors of Canberra than, say, the tourism operators dependent on the reef. Within the Liberal party, in particular, fossil fuels have become talismanic, as that parliamentary coal-stroking session exemplified. If Islamic State (Isis) pledged to bomb the Great Barrier Reef, the Coalition would demand soldiers installed on every kilometre of the iconic coastline. But because the threat’s environmental, the conservatives see inaction almost as matter of principle. In any case, the market necessarily operates within a system of competing national and regional governments. Witness Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s response to protesters heckling her in India about the Adani mine. “All of you have jobs,” she said, “and there are regional Queenslanders that are fighting for jobs. Ten thousand regional jobs.” The project might not be viable in the long term but, in the short term, it provides an economic boost to an impoverished region (even if the actual economic benefits have been overstated) – and for a politician that’s all that matters. The same logic drives Turnbull’s defence of coal, a commodity Australia possesses in abundance. As Andrew Norton from the International Institute for Environment and Development notes, “climate change is a highly inconvenient truth for nationalism, as it is unsolvable at the national level and requires collective action between states and between different national and local communities.” That’s why rightwing populism has become increasingly entwined with climate denialism, with, for instance, France’s far-right National Front denouncing international environmental talks as a “communist project”. In the US, most of the Republican party now shares Trump’s scepticism about climate change (something he famously dubbed a hoax “created by and for the Chinese to make US manufacturing noncompetitive”). In Australia, Pauline Hanson’s embraced denialism with the same fervour she adopted Islamophobia – and in both instances she’s dragged the right of the Liberal party with her. In other words, you’d be naïve to expect any serious action on climate any time soon. That’s why the inconceivable seems now depressingly likely: one of the great wonders of the world slowly dying before our eyes. As goes the reef, so goes the planet. The trajectory that Spaceship Earth’s currently traversing has been carefully plotted – and the course is set on disaster. Yet the mounting resistance to Adani offers a glimmer of hope. Bob Brown’s described the struggle against the mine as potentially the Franklin River campaign for a new generation. It’s worth thinking about what that means. Without the great social struggles of the past we would have lost most of the nation’s important ecological sites. As I’ve noted elsewhere, as late as the 1960s, the Queensland government saw the reef almost solely as a site for resource extraction, leasing over 20m hectares of it for oil extraction in 1967. At the time, Rhodes Airbridge, a professor of geology from Columbia University explained that the reef should be exploited “immediately and to the hilt”. Likewise, the Liberal premier of Tasmania, Robin Grey, famously dismissed the Franklin River as “brown ditch, leech-ridden, unattractive to the majority of people”. In a sense, then, protests did not so much save the Great Barrier Reef and the Franklin River as create them, as the campaigns taught Australians to value a country they’d never really seen before.  In the same way, a mass struggle against Adani might help us to think about global warming in a different way, to appreciate the reef as part of the global environment. If the nationalism of rightwing populism inevitably feeds climate scepticism, protest against fossil fuels pushes in the direction of internationalism, fostering a common interest across national borders against the corporations and politicians despoiling the planet. We all know resistance to be necessary. We need the kind of campaign that makes it feel possible."
"A century and a half ago, when springs were different, the poet John Clare wrote: “All bleaching in the thin March air / the scattered violets lie.” (March Violet). He may have meant violets growing under withered and bleached nettle stems, but for me, today, there are shining white violets “bleaching” on the hedge bank in one of the last cold, grey, “thin” mornings in March. Even though there are beautifully subtle violet violets scattered in the mossy shadows under trees and through the emerging leaves beneath hedges, the eye is drawn to the white ones. I wonder if bees prefer white violets to violet-coloured violets? The more common forms have ultraviolet markings on their petals called bee guides, which look like veins filled with iodine and must be as vivid as rope lights to insects.   Violets are hermaphrodites anyway, so they don’t rely on pollinators, which, given the scarcity of bees at this time of year, and their continued decline in Britain, is just as well. This is the blackthorn winter, that moment at the end of March when a snow of white flowers – from blackthorn, wild damson and cherry to wood anemone and white sweet violets – pulses through woods and hedgerows. This marks the becoming time of spring, when fragments of those seasonal signatures – wildflowers and birdsong, bumblebees and lambs – begin to join into a coherence, or at least the fantasy of one, that feels like spring. I wonder what Clare’s springs were like, when the populations of birds, insects and wildflowers were so much stronger and seasonal differences more acute. What would he make of this?  Violets have a built-in nostalgia, a belonging to something that is only ever new and so always fleeting and longed for. “Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring,” wrote the poet Christina Rossetti (in Autumn Violets).  Violets really do gladden the heart and, like love, they need nurturing; Clare for one could not help but follow his instincts as a gardener, to clear the winter debris from around the violets “And give them room to grow”.

"We are approaching two years into implementing the ambitious 2030 Agenda – a historic agreement to end poverty, combat inequalities, promote peaceful and inclusive societies, and protect the environment. The new global framework, with 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) at its core, commits to promoting development in an integrated way – economically, socially and environmentally – in all countries, ensuring that no one is left behind. Our recently published report identifies six megatrends that will shape the trajectories of – and could potentially undermine – progress on the SDGs. In the current context of a looming retreat from multilateralism, the choices governments and societies make to manage these long-term trends will be fundamental to whether the world can get onto a pathway of sustainable development.  Substantial progress has been achieved in multiple dimensions of poverty in the past decades, including the reduction of absolute poverty, decline in child and maternal mortality rates, and improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Income inequality between countries has also been falling, mainly due to the rapid growth in large developing countries. Despite these gains, the progress has been uneven and considerable challenges remain. These include rising income disparities within countries, persistent gender inequality and the recent resurgence of poverty across regions due to economic shocks and escalating conflicts. The Multidimensional Poverty Index, which measures deprivation in health, education and living standards, counted 1.6 billion people living in multidimensional poverty in 2016 – nearly twice the number of people living in extreme poverty measured by income alone. Progress towards eliminating poverty is more difficult during times of uncertain economic prospects, the report suggests. This is further complicated by weak labour market conditions, demographic changes, and conflicts and insecurity. Evidence shows that while economic growth is essential for reducing poverty, a critical link between growth and the reduction of poverty and inequalities is related to the nature and quality of growth, and a balanced distribution of gains across all segments of society. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda will be affected by demographic dynamics, including population growth, ageing, migration and urbanisation. In 2015, 12.3% of the global population reached the age of 60 or over (pdf), with rapid ageing expected to occur in Europe, North America, Asia and Latin America. In Africa, by contrast, populations are young, which provides an opportunity for a demographic dividend.  It has become easier for people to move, and factors such as poverty, unemployment, conflicts and natural hazards compel people to leave their homes in search of better lives. International migration has reached record levels (pdf), accounting for 244 million migrants worldwide in 2015. If managed well, migration will continue to bring profound benefits to sending countries through remittances, knowledge and networks, and to receiving countries by filling acute labour shortages and contributions in terms of taxes and care services. Internal migration is also growing, driving fast increases in urbanisation. On one hand, urbanisation fosters growth and provides a higher quality of life, with cities accounting for more than 80% of global GDP (pdf). On the other, it raises concerns about urban poverty, social tensions and disparities, changes in family patterns, and environmental risks. Major environmental challenges identified by the report include degradation of air and land, water scarcity, deforestation, marine pollution and a decline in biodiversity. Some of the underlying factors behind environmental degradation include population growth, polluting technologies, and overexploitation of ecosystems driven by unsustainable consumption and production patterns. The world is already witnessing the impact of climate change on natural systems. This is translated into the increasing frequency and severity of natural hazards (pdf), which lead to more disasters due to population growth (pdf) and patterns of economic development. Climate change is also projected to undermine food security, exacerbate existing health threats, adversely affect water availability and lead to increased displacement. In the coming decades, it is likely that this trend will continue, with more losses expected in livelihoods and assets. This underlines the link between poverty and vulnerability to natural hazards. It also exposes inequity, as countries and populations likely to be most harmed by climate change impacts are often the least responsible for causing them, and have limited capacity and resources to cope with the consequences. The report discusses various shocks and crises including economic and financial shocks, disasters, conflicts and disease outbreaks that have undermined the precarious livelihoods of millions of people and can affect progress towards sustainable development. Over the past decades, global forced displacement, for example, increased by 75% due to conflicts, violence and human rights violations. The first year of SDG implementation was marked by the slowest rate of economic growth since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis (pdf), weak investment growth and stagnant global trade. While progress has been made in reducing the global unemployment rate, nearly 201 million people worldwide (pdf) were estimated to be unemployed in 2016, including 71 million young people. Global economic prospects remain subject to various risks, including increasing policy uncertainty in major advanced and emerging economies, financial market disruptions and heightened geopolitical tensions. At the same time, remarkable achievements have been made in combating major infectious diseases and reducing hunger over the past decades, which can be attributed to political commitment, strong global partnerships and sound social protection policies. Despite this, the world continues to face significant challenges in addressing health issues and under-nutrition, with nearly 800 million people suffering from hunger worldwide, and high risks of famine. To achieve the SDGs, development finance strategies need to go beyond filling financing gaps. While official development assistance will remain a vital source of external public finance for the poorest and most vulnerable countries, it will not be sufficient. All sources of finance – public and private, domestic and international – need to be mobilised. In particular, effective domestic resource mobilisation will be at the core (pdf) of financing sustainable development. While resources allocated for development objectives are not adequate, there is no shortage of capital in the global economy. The challenge is to enhance the impact of available resources, while catalysing additional sources of finance into investments in long-term sustainable development. It is critical to better align private sector incentives with sustainable development objectives through strengthened policies and sound institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. As a positive trend, the private sector’s involvement in philanthropic giving, corporate social responsibility initiatives, impact investing, and inclusive business approaches has been expanding. A number of innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships such as the Global Fund and new financing mechanisms for development including green bonds have emerged since 2000. It will be essential to scale up the proven mechanisms in size, scope and geographical reach. Technology is an important means for implementing the SDGs. The biggest technological advancements over the past decades have occurred in health, education and the environment. For example, the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases is estimated to save nearly 3 million lives every year. Online courses and interactive applications expand access to education around the globe, providing new ways of learning, teaching and collaborative work. Renewable energy technologies are critical in addressing climate change and its negative impacts. While technologies have provided innovative solutions to many development problems, they have also added new challenges and risks, including security and privacy concerns, polarising opportunities and job replacement. Forecasts suggest that computers could do the work of 140 million knowledge workers by 2025, while 30% of middle-income jobs could be eliminated (pdf) due to innovation in artificial intelligence. The multiple crises and disasters in recent decades have highlighted unpredictability and volatility in the global economy, continued uncertainties and disruptions in people’s lives, and the vulnerability of development progress to external shocks. Against this backdrop, there is a challenge – and an opportunity – for a sophisticated policy response of preparedness, investment and cooperation. The report points to four main factors that are crucial in addressing these trends: the importance of evidence in decision-making; policy coherence across the global goals and at different levels of policymaking and implementation; collective action to maximise the positive dynamics in these areas and minimise risk; and broad-based inclusive participation.

" If you were to fly a camera-laden drone several hundred feet above Pani Herath’s house in south Miami, Florida, it would become clear his rooftop is an oddity compared with virtually all of his neighbors. Despite living in a part of the world that bakes in the sun throughout the year, just a few thousand people across Florida, such as Herath, have installed solar panels. “Unfortunately, not many people know about solar. That’s why nobody around here has solar at all,” said Herath. He has become an object of curiosity in his tidy neighborhood, where watering the manicured lawn and scooping debris from the pool is of greater concern.  “I was telling my friend next door about it and he was wondering why I would want to go solar,” said Herath, who has had solar-heated water for the past six years and is now looking to lower his electric bills with more panels. “I wish that everybody would know about it.” Despite its Sunshine state moniker, Florida is barely harnessing its bountiful rays for energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association ranks the state third in the US for rooftop solar potential but just 12th in terms of installed capacity. Despite some growth in commercial solar, the number of Florida households getting solar panels is not projected to squeak past 100 a year until 2021, a paltry rate for a state with more than 20 million residents. The gloom of renewable energy and climate advocates in Florida is exacerbated by envy at the solar boom occurring in the north-east states and out west in California. “You see states with snow and far more cloud than Florida and they have more solar than us,” said Alissa Schafer, communications and policy manager at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “That can be a bit frustrating. These other states are kicking our butt, to put it bluntly.” This disparity is no longer a mildly diverting quirk. Donald Trump’s administration has been gleefully crushing any federal policy with any whiff of climate change about it, and the president is expected on Tuesday to sign an executive order undoing Obama’s clean power plan. So the urgent task of emissions cuts is starting to depend more heavily upon cities and states. Currently, Florida derives less than 1% of its electricity generation from solar.  “Political beliefs have held solar back in Florida, and the utilities like the way things currently are,” said Schafer.  Critics say the utilities are not active enough in helping develop the solar market, and rooftop capacity by homeowners, because it could be a threat to their roles supplying traditional energy sources. In many states, a solar company can lend panels to a homeowner and then sell the cheap power generated directly to the owner. But that isn’t allowed in Florida. Nor is a homeowner able to sell on his or her generated solar power to anyone else, such as a neighbor or tenants. By Florida logic, anyone with rooftop panels is providing a utility and therefore must be able to provide power 24 hours a day. And as only the state’s vast monopoly utilities, such as Florida Power & Light, can do this on demand, households are barred from this sort of third-party ownership. “It’s ludicrous that Florida outlaws such a thing,” said Justin Hoysradt, chief executive of Vinyasun. His West Palm Beach company has instead attempted to boost solar sales through loans structured like car or mortgage repayments. “Places like New York, Massachusetts and California have recognized the jobs and environmental benefit of solar. We have more of a challenge.” Florida Power and Light, which serves around 10 million people in the state, insists that it has been a proponent of solar power. “FPL has been leading the smart, cost-conscious expansion of solar in Florida since we built our first solar power plant back in 2009,” Eric Silagy, president and CEO of FPL, said in January. He spoke as it officially connected three new solar power centers to the grid and announced plans to build eight more plants, and other local schemes, by 2018. It said the plants built last year generated enough solar for 15,000 homes and the target for next year was 120,000. The challenge to move Florida up the league table of states providing solar power could have become much more difficult if a state ballot measure hadn’t narrowly failed last year. The measure, called amendment 1 and backed by more than $20m in campaign funding from various utilities firms, was presented as pro-solar and endorsed as such by Florida’s supreme court. But critics insist it would have deceptively opened the way for new fees on rooftop solar and snuffed out the industry. Al Gore, the former vice-president, called amendment 1 a “phony baloney initiative”. Jim Kallinger, chairman of the Florida Faith & Freedom Coalition and a supporter of the amendment, said the measure would have “said no to corporate welfare” while ensuring the right to have solar panels in the state constitution. Solar will continue to be a niche industry as long as Florida maintains its cheap electricity rates, Kallinger added. “It’s hard for solar PV [photovoltaic panels] to compete with other energy sources,” he said.  “I think solar is more of a novelty for folks who might have some disposable income. Yes, we have a lot of sunshine in Florida but we have a lot of cloud cover. In other states, you have the government intervening more, but here we have pushback against that sort of thing.” North-eastern states may not be bathed in sunlight as much as Florida is but the ambition for solar dwarfs that of the balmier southern state. This is driven by the retail politics of electricity prices as much as it is of acceptance of climate disruption – while New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has said warming temperatures are costing the state “not only in dollars but already in lives”, his Florida counterpart, Rick Scott, will be forever saddled by reports that he banned public servants from uttering the words “climate change”. Generous city and state tax breaks, combined with the plummeting cost of solar, are starting to reap dividends in New York City, where solar panels are popping up in unexpected rooftops in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Installed solar capacity has mushroomed 800% in the past five years, with state efforts to get panels on to churches and schools. In August, Cuomo announced that utilities would be required to source half of the state’s electricity from solar and wind by 2030. Florida has no such target. “Solar in New York City is finally hitting its renaissance, I think,” said Posie Constable, business development manager at New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC). “I think we’re at a point now where it was really just a matter of coming up with innovative financing models that allowed New Yorkers to catch up with what’s been happening across the country.” NYCEEC, a not-for-profit lender, has been using loans and other incentives to get different types of buildings to go solar. Cooperative dwellings are proving an increasingly fertile area, with a number of such residencies across New York City opting to get solar on their roofs. Elmo Homes, a co-op in the Brooklyn district of Sunset Park, got an $86,000 loan from NYCEEC for its panels. With the various city, state and federal tax credits, about three-quarters of the project’s $200,000 cost will eventually be wiped out. The 30-apartment building is making energy savings of around $10,000 a year. Eric Appleton, president of Elmo Homes, said residents were interested in the environmental benefit of adopting solar but the main attraction was financial. “Rather than just saving on energy costs, we’re actually collecting that money and then we can put it into the upkeep of the building, whether that’s maintaining the exterior, dealing with plumbing issues, fixing the roof,” he said.  “New York state is giving a lot of support to solar and it’s critical. I don’t think we would have been able to make this step without that support.” While renewable energy remains wildly popular with the public regardless of political outlook, a perception lingers in some quarters that it is flaky and propped up by taxpayer largesse. Trump is a member of this camp, writing in his 2015 book Crippled America that the push for renewables was being driven by “the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions”. The now president added: “If you don’t buy that – and I don’t – then what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.” The economic reality increasingly casts a shadow over these views. Job growth in solar is outstripping the rest of the economy, with more Americans now working on installing and maintaining panels than in the oil and gas sectors combined. “There is this stigma of solar being a bunch of hippies using the solar electricity to grow pot and go to a Grateful Dead show,” said Jeff Johnston, who has worked as a solar contractor in south Florida for the past two decades.  “But it’s far beyond that. It’s a trade. We want to be recognized as a trade. I don’t even like to think about what our commander-in-chief has said about climate change. But I think the ultimate consensus is that people do want solar no matter what their politics.”"
"Experts have argued against subsidising insurance premiums for people in cyclone or flood-prone areas as the multi-million dollar cleanup continues after Cyclone Debbie, saying that will only provide short-term relief. The insurance bill for damage caused by the cyclone, which struck near Airlie Beach on 28 March before causing widespread damage in northern Queensland and extensive and ongoing flooding in the state’s south-east and northern New South Wales, reached $410m on Thursday and is predicted to top $1bn.  A number of homes and businesses, particularly in the NSW town of Lismore, were reportedly uninsured or without flood insurance, because premiums for flood insurance had climbed as high as $30,000 a year. It has sparked renewed calls for a review of the insurance regulations covering natural disasters. But Justine Bell-James, an expert in environmental and insurance law from the University of Queensland, said moving to reduce premiums just pushed the cost of recovery on to government and would not reduce the scale of the damage. “If we are just covering the cost of the premium that isn’t going to improve anything in the future,” Bell-James told Guardian Australia. “All the other costs – loss of income, loss of residence, psychological damage, are still going to occur. We are going to have the same problems in the future with insurance premiums going higher and higher.” Bell-James said funding should instead go toward mitigation measures such as flood levees and ensuring houses are built to a cyclone standard. That was the conclusion of a Productivity Commission report following the 2011 Queensland floods, which recommended the federal government increase disaster mitigation funding to $200m a year, and also the conclusion drawn by the northern Australia insurance premiums taskforce in 2016. Bell-James said existing mitigation measures – such as the flood levee in Lismore, which was breached when flood waters reached the town last week – should also be reviewed to ensure they can withstand more severe flood and storm events under climate change. “We use the language of a one-in-100-year flood, but what that really means is there’s a 1% chance of that flood happening any given year,” she said. “Under climate change, that could increase to a 5% or even 10% chance.”  Insurance Council of Australia spokesman Campbell Fuller said government intervention in the insurance market “would have little impact on affordability, would risk encouraging inappropriate development, and would expose taxpayers to billions of dollars of losses”. Fuller said the industry was pushing for a greater government spend in permanent mitigation measures, including a stricter land use planning and building codes. He also defended the availability of flood insurance, saying 96% of all household policies included flood insurance, up from 3% prior to the 2011 floods.  “The premium charged reflects the flood or other natural hazard risk to each property based on the latest available government data and the insurer’s underwriting criteria,” he said.  Insurance premiums in northern Queensland increased by 80% between 2005/2006 and 2012/2013, the period covering Cyclone Larry, the Mackay storm, Cyclone Yasi, and the Brisbane floods, according to a 2014 report by Australian government actuary Peter Martin. Premiums for Brisbane in the same period increased by 45%, while premiums in Sydney and Melbourne increased 12%. Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said the price increase was unsustainable and left many people in the highest-risk areas unable to afford insurance. “When homeowners can’t afford insurance in disaster prone areas, there’s clearly a big problem with the market,” he said. Susan Quinn, insurance policy expert from the Consumer Action Law Centre, said there was currently no requirement that coverage offered by insurance companies is appropriate for the person seeking insurance, so long as the limits of the policy were clearly set out in the policy documents, which 80% of people do not read.  “Ultimately that assumption is that you buy insurance and automatically assume that is going to cover you for the things that might happen to your house, but that’s not guaranteed under law,” she said. Quinn said updating the minimum standard cover definition, which was set in 1984, and requiring insurance companies to explicitly state when they are offering less than standard cover, would make things fairer for consumers."
"The EU has approved a $130bn mega-merger between Dow and DuPont, heralding a new round of agribusiness takeovers that environmentalists fear will endanger the future of sustainable food production. Brussels is widely expected to clear another hookup between Syngenta and ChemChina in the next two weeks, with notification of a marriage between Monsanto and Bayer expected later in the year.  As a condition for Monday’s deal, DuPont will have to sell off large parts of its global pesticides business, including almost all of its global research and development group. But the US agrichem giant is the second biggest global seed supplier after Monsanto – Dow is the fifth – and green groups fear that just three mega-corporations could soon be left exercising “a toxic grip” over the world’s food and countryside. Adrian Bebb, a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, said: “This merger will mean a lack of choice for farmers and a lack of diversity in our fields. We rapidly need to diversify our farming to adapt to a changing climate, and having less seeds controlled by fewer corporation raises serious questions about our ability to feed future generations.” A letter sent to the commission by an alliance of 200 environmental groups on Monday says that about 60% of commercial seed supplies will be centralised in the hands of just three multinationals if the mergers are all approved.  The commission though believes that the line it has laid down by enforcing pesticides divestment will help to prevent higher prices or restrictions to market choice, while safeguarding innovation and pesticide safety. Speaking in Brussels on Monday, the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said: “This is literally a question about our daily bread and the ability for farmers to choose different seeds and different pesticides, in order to secure their crops. It is the heart of human life, so we take it very seriously.” Regulators in the US and China will still have to approve the Dow-DuPont deal, but Monday’s EU decision is being seen by some analysts as a marker for future deals.  Patrick Worms, a senior science policy adviser at the world agroforestry centre, cautioned that sustainable agriculture depended on a plurality of seed sources, farming methods and competing suppliers. “Corporate behemoths can’t deliver that,” he said. “They are smothered by processes, bureaucracies, and internal politics. And they know it, too. That’s why they want to capture as much of the market as they can.”"

"As humans put more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide, ice around the planet melts. This melting can be a problem, particularly if the melting ice starts its life on land. That’s because the melt water flows into the oceans, contributing to rising sea levels. Right now there are three main reasons that sea levels are rising. First, as ocean waters heat, they expand. Second, melting of ice in Antarctica flows into the ocean. Third, melting of ice on Greenland flows into the ocean. There is other melting, like mountain glaciers, but they are minor factors. Okay, so how much is melting of Greenland contributing to sea level rise? Estimates are that about 270 gigatons of water per year are melting. The melting of an ice sheet like that atop Greenland can occur from the surface as air temperatures and sunlight warm the upper layer of ice. It can also occur from the edges as ice shelves collapse and fall into the oceans in large chunks.  For ice-shelf collapse, there’s a complex process that occurs at the bottom of the ice. Part of the ice is floating out over water and part of it is grounded on land. Warm water can get underneath the ice, lift it up, and melt the ice from below.  The bedrock underneath the ice sheet is not flat or gradually changing. There are undulations that rise and fall and change the water-ice-ground connection. Topology called “retrograde” can make it easier for ice to melt and can increase the rate of ice shelf collapse. So, scientists have a real interest in learning about the topology of the land underneath ice sheets so they can better predict ice collapse and sea level rise.  This brings us to a new study published by the American Geophysical Union in a journal called Geophysical Letters Review. The scientists use gravitometry to obtain a high-quality picture of the land underneath a very fast moving part of Greenland ice called the Jacobshavn Isbrae. Basically, the scientists flew gravity sensors across the ice at low altitudes and low velocity. These sensors are called accelerometers and they can be used to determine the x, y, and z gravity components. The measurements of the gravity allowed them to attain the local height of the subsurface with greater accuracy than previously known.  As stated in the paper, the motivation for this work was clear:  the fjord bathymetry and glacier bed topography of the lower portion of Jacobshavn Isbrae have remained poorly known. At least not sufficiently to provide reliable information for ice sheet numerical models.  They found that the trough underneath the ice was not symmetrically shaped; the northern part of the trough was deeper than the southern part. Further, the trough was estimated to be 300-400 meters deeper than previously thought. They also showed that the trough is retrograde, which means that it favors a fast retreat of the glacier in the coming years and decades. Greenland ice is a great analogy for the Earth’s climate. It has inertia, meaning it acts slowly but once it gets going, it’s hard to stop. When the Greenland ice sheet starts to go, it may take a while to melt but it is nearly impossible to stop. Predicting how fast this melt will take is interesting from a scientific vantage point but there are also enormous social and economic consequences. Right now, 150 million people live within a meter (3 feet) of today’s sea level.  Greenland by itself has enough ice to cause many meters of sea level rise. If you live near the coast, the question of “when” is really important. This paper suggests that “when” may be sooner than we hoped."
"The first thing to know about reading Bee Quest is that it’s a fun adventure to several countries, including this one, made new again through Dave Goulson’s eyes. You’ll learn all sorts of interesting things without effort because he’s a natural storyteller with a particular gift of understatement that is often laugh-out-loud funny – which you don’t expect from a bee book. The second thing is that this endearing account of his search for rare bees is also an unofficial travel guide to some extremely appealing places that I don’t even want to mention here, lest they fill up with other adventurous readers this summer, because I’m planning to follow in Goulson’s footsteps to at least one of them. OK: Poland. Also, an amazing-sounding lodge in Ecuador. You’ll have to buy it for more details.  And the third thing is that camouflaged throughout this very entertaining and accessible book about rare bumblebees are some pretty shocking facts about the environment. But there is never the feeling – at least not until literally the last two pages – that Goulson is on a soapbox; he’s too skilful for that, he just lets the evidence speak for itself. So here and there – amid the incantatory poetry of the natural world, the names of flowers, the habits of the animals – are some bits of information that work like the equivalent of the cartoon frying pan in the face. For instance, I’m thoroughly enjoying the chapter in which he’s searching for the shrill carder bee in the foothills of the Tatra mountains. I’m drinking beer and eating pierogi with him, taking in vivid details of farming methods that are about 100 years behind those of the UK – when all of a sudden we’re into the common agricultural policy and for the first time all those fragments of information make awful sense, because Dave Goulson is so very good at showing how the macro (the laws or the lack of them, the things that are so ungraspably large and hard to think about, such as climate change) affect the micro. How following the second world war the laudable intention to increase food production led to “the destruction of the European countryside to make way for industrial farming, created huge surpluses of food, flooded the world with cheap subsidised produce, and gave EU farmers an artificial advantage over farmers in developing countries, thus condemning millions of farmers elsewhere in the world to a life of poverty”. Sit on the fence, why don’t you. But I do really like that he doesn’t, even though he tempers his own thoughts with the rational allowance that “there are often no right answers in conservation”. No matter what scale he’s thinking on, the bee is our key to a greater understanding of the natural world as we humans affect it with our unpredictable and chaotic antics. I’m worried I’ll make this book sound dry and boring, or depressing – it’s anything but. It’s warmly personal, and stuffed full of the inescapable poetry and beauty of the natural world, as well as details of his many packed lunches, dinners and various beers. He doesn’t so much wear his erudition lightly as pack it away somewhere at the bottom, under the sandwiches. But it is most definitely there. You’ll effortlessly learn about the link between agriculture and empire, between neonicotinoid pesticides, monocultural farming and the decline of honeybees – and about the price of creating a global network of protected areas for most of the endangered species on earth. Jorn Scharlemann, Goulson’s colleague at Sussex University, recently put this at £42bn a year, which sounds astronomical but, as he points out, “is just 20% of the global annual spend on fizzy drinks, and less than half of what is paid out each year in bonuses to bankers in Wall Street’s investment banks” – to say nothing of the cost of waging wars. Dave Goulson is generous, he credits his colleagues and PhD students – and he frequently draws on his vivid adventurous childhood, which is always imaginatively close to hand and inspires his writing with unselfconscious freshness. Adventure is not only a word he uses a lot, but something he prizes and wants for everyone. Going on Bee Quest with him puts the natural world within our reach – to enjoy but also to protect. There’s no two ways about it, we have to act in some way, and now, or it will continue to be paved over, sprayed into submission, and restricted to oblivion. But despite this underlying serious awareness, this is a truly positive and empowering read – you close it better informed, filled with poetry, pies and ready to get out there and make a difference. •Laline Paull’s novel The Bees is published by Fourth Estate.

"Members of the Australian Medical Association have threatened to quit over comments by the national president, Dr Michael Gannon, that the impact of job losses from Victoria’s Hazelwood power plant closure should be considered as well as the health benefits. Gannon has been accused of contradicting clear AMA policy on clean air and going back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor, but the head of Australia’s peak medical body has denied both accusations.  The AMA’s former vice president Dr Stephen Parnis told the Doctors for the Environment Australia conference on Sunday that Gannon’s comments were “a wilful distortion of AMA policy”. On Wednesday Gannon told Guardian Australia the health benefits of closing down brown coal power plants need to be considered alongside the health impacts of unemployment and blackouts. While he said the closure of the coal-fired plant was “good news” for children with asthma, the elderly and people who suffered respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, “there is also the health effects of unemployment that need to be considered”.  “The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense,” he said. “We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.” The AMA has received several letters of complaint from its members, including threats to quit the organisation, and accusations that Gannon has gone back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor. One letter accused the AMA of supporting political statements instead of an “evidence-based approach” to health. “Yes, doctors know that unemployment is destructive to health, but [that] didn’t prevent the AMA from making a stand against the tobacco industry, with resultant lack of jobs,” the letter said. “Unless this issue is addressed urgently, the world is likely to overshoot the 2C guardrail of warming, creating huge health, social and economic disruption. I would hope the AMA looks at the science rather than the politics, and actually leads rather than follows the politicians from both our major political parties.” A response by the AMA’s director of public health, Simon Tatz, sought to reassure that the AMA “believes that climate change poses a significant worldwide threat to health, and urgent action is required to reduce this potential harm”. “While I can understand your concern at the comments that were recently made, I urge you to consider the AMA’s stated policy positions on climate change and human health,” Tatz said.  On Sunday Parnis said Gannon’s comments were a “wilful distortion of AMA policy” and could be interpreted as “trying to put a handbrake on the health benefits of what was a commercial decision to close the Hazelwood power station”. “I have some hesitation in saying that, but I think it was a distortion, a misrepresentation of the AMA policy, of which I remain very proud,” he said. Parnis also suggested Gannon had not acknowledged the health effects of the power station on the people of the La Trobe valley over decades, which Gannon has disputed. Parnis had not spoken publicly about the AMA since he left his role as vice president in May, but told Guardian Australia he though the issue was too important to stay quiet. Parnis oversaw the renewal and review of the clean air policy in 2015 and told Guardian Australia he “took exception” to Gannon’s comments, as did a number of other members. “It’s hard to be clear about the level of antipathy towards what was said,” he said. “There is a spectrum of opinion in a broad church like the AMA, but I certainly didn’t hear anyone happy with them.” Gannon said he was aware of the complaints, but said neither he nor the AMA equated the loss of jobs at Hazelwood with the environmental and health benefits that would come from its closure. “The AMA is one of the leading advocates on the issue of climate health,” he said. “It’s just that the AMA has a global view on all of these issues, and I think we can walk and chew gum at same time.” Gannon said he was pointing out there were health impacts from unemployment and carbon abatement, but was at no stage suggesting it was of equal priority to the health benefits of closing a power station which relied on “the dirtiest form of coal”.  “We need to be cleverer and smarter about carbon abatement and the necessary changes in society to reduce the impacts of climate change,” he said. “The necessary changes in changing our energy mix and reducing pollution will have victims and we just need to think about that.” Asked to elaborate on his earlier comments suggesting the right balance had not yet been struck before closing Hazelwood, Gannon said a safe base-load power had to be ensured as Australia moved towards a greater renewable proportion in the energy mix, and cited the South Australian blackout. “We just need a secure energy supply, and that does not for one minute diminish very clear AMA policy which is there,” he said.  “Every member that telephoned or emailed the AMA was responded to and they were pointed in the direction of our policy which talks about all of this – the need to reduce the carbon footprint of our society.” Gannon said he wasn’t being political as the power plant was being shut down by a French multinational corporation, and said while climate change was “highly political” he had not been taking a political line."
"A new “carbon law”, modelled on Moore’s law in computing, has been proposed as a roadmap for beating climate change. It sees carbon emissions halving every decade, while green energy continues to double every five years. The carbon law’s proponents are senior climate-change scientists and they argue it provides a simple, broad but quantitative plan that could drive governments and businesses to make urgently needed carbon cuts, particularly at a time when global warming is falling off the global political agenda.  Christiana Figueres, who as the then UN’s climate chief delivered the landmark Paris climate change deal in 2015, said: “The carbon law for keeping us on track with Paris – something we can all follow – is such a valuable contribution at this critical time.” Moore’s law is the observation that innovation doubles the number of transistors on a computer chip about every two years and it has held true for 50 years. The researchers behind the carbon law say similar laws of exponential growth can already be seen in clean energy. “We are already at the start of this trajectory. In the last decade, the share of renewables in the energy sector has doubled every 5.5 years. If doubling continues at this pace fossil fuels will exit the energy sector well before 2050,” said Johan Rockström, at Stockholm University in Sweden, the lead author of an article published in the journal Science which sets out the carbon law. The researchers also set out milestones for each decade, with coal disappearing by 2030, and oil by 2040. “It is both a tale of extreme urgency, reminding the world community of what was agreed [in Paris], and also saying it’s not more difficult than it was establishing Moore’s law in IT which came through investment, innovation and economies of scale,” said Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, another author of the article and who has advised Angela Merkel, the Pope and the EU. He said the aim of the carbon law was to provide “a really compelling story of how decarbonisation can be achieved”, and to bridge the gap between the pledges made by nations in Paris and what will be needed in the long term to keep global warming well below the danger limit of 2C.  “Short-termism has been a problem for all the 25 years I have been involved in climate negotiations,” Schellnhuber said. “This has exacerbated in 2016 and 2017. The climate issue has disappeared from the radar screens of the international policy makers.”  However, the carbon law shows how global warming can be beaten, said Gareth Redmond-King at WWF: “It’s important to remember that there is genuine hope. This inspiring vision of change reaffirms that we still have time, provided we commit to serious, ambitious and urgent action to control our environmental impact. Every journey, however long and complicated, is easier with a clear map.” The carbon law and accompanying roadmap sees what the authors call “no-brainer” policies in place by 2020, including ending the huge subsidies enjoyed by fossil fuels, a $50 per tonne price on carbon emissions and a crackdown on energy efficiency. The 2020s are the most challenging decade on the route to a zero emissions world in 2050, said Schellnhuber, as both coal and polluting vehicles have to be phased out at the same time as new clean technology is developed to be deployed in the 2030s. This could include building on pilot projects already underway, such as developing new materials to replace concrete in buildings, and superconducting electricity grids. Schellnhuber believes all this is possible, saying India will lead the coal phase-out in favour of solar and that no country will allow new combustion engine cars on the road by 2030: “I talk to the CEOs of big car companies and they know the time of the combustion engine is over, in particular for the diesel engine.” He said potential solutions already exist across all sectors, but that ambition was needed in every area to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “What we are saying [in the article] is that if you play your cards right, you win the game – all the jokers and high value cards are in the pack already.” Prof Chris Rapley, a climate scientist at University College London, said: “The article performs a helpful function by offering a way to re-express the Paris goal in practical terms that defines what those actions would need to achieve, ie halving emissions each decade plus building up capacity to draw down CO2 from the free atmosphere. There are other possibilities, but the idea of a ‘Moore’s Law’ analogue is quite attractive.” However, Rapley cautioned against scientists being too prescriptive in the policies governments should adopt, which could make it easier for those opposed to climate action to dismiss the analysis. Setting out the scale and pace of carbon cuts needed and then helping various sectors such as energy and transport make their decisions could be more effective, he said."

"A coalition of 17 US states filed a legal challenge on Wednesday against efforts by Donald Trump’s administration to roll back climate change regulations, deepening a political rift over his emerging energy policies.  Led by New York state, the coalition said the administration has a legal duty to regulate emissions of the gases scientists believe cause global climate change.   “The law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants,” the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement announcing the challenge.  Trump signed an executive order last week targeting climate change regulations ushered in by President Obama, saying they hinder US energy production and jobs without providing meaningful environmental benefits.  The order’s main target was Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a law that would require states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, but which was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states.  Trump’s order directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the regulation to decide whether to “suspend, rescind, or revise it”. Shortly after, the EPA filed a legal motion asking the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit to delay ongoing court proceedings on the regulation to allow for the review.  The New York-led coalition’s motion on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the EPA’s request to delay court proceedings, saying the delay “would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation”.  “This case is ripe for decision now, and nothing that EPA has proposed to do obviates the need for this court’s review,” according to the statement.  The coalition includes attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington – along with the District of Columbia and a number of smaller localities.

"The key crossbench senator Nick Xenophon has signalled publicly to the Turnbull government he will look at cutting tax for big companies if the government guarantees it will implement a bipartisan emissions intensity trading scheme in the electricity sector. The NXT leader has been saying for months he is not inclined to support tax cuts for business with annual turnover of more than $10m but, on Monday, suggested he would come to the table if the government made a concrete offer on energy policy.  Xenophon criticised the government for walking away from an intensity scheme for electricity, which had been championed by Malcolm Turnbull in the late 2000s. “Not only has the opposition come on side but major businesses, the CSIRO looking at it scientifically, have all said an emissions intensity approach is the best and, in fact, I think the only way forward to get us out of this crisis,” Xenophon told reporters in Canberra on Monday. Asked for specifics about what he was looking for from the government as a quid pro quo in any company tax cut negotiations, Xenophon said he would be looking for “a guarantee [on an emissions intensity scheme] that is locked in in terms of bipartisan support”. “You would actually unleash billions of dollars of investment in this country but, as part of the equation, it could be a significant part of the jigsaw.” He also called for a “national approach” on gas to ensure domestic supply at reasonable prices and suggested the government should look at a Queensland scheme that reserves a certain area for development for domestic gas supply only. Xenophon said the businesses he spoke to in South Australia were much more focused on getting the problems in the Australian energy market fixed than on getting “marginal relief” from a tax cut. While he has been telegraphing interest in energy policy for some months, the NXT leader’s comments on Monday are the most specific and explicit he has given in terms of a wish list in any company tax cut discussion with the government. The Turnbull government wants consideration of its $48bn corporate tax cut package this week. The package is currently in the House of Representatives and this week is the final parliamentary sitting week before the May budget. After recent speculation that the government might split the package in order to legislate at least some of the reforms, the treasurer has signalled he will pursue the full package. The government’s business tax package is designed to reduce tax rates for all business to 25% by 2026-27. The first tranche would cut the tax rate for small businesses with annual turnover of less than $10m to 27.5% for the 2016-17 financial year. The government then wants to progressively extend that lower rate to all businesses by the 2023-24 financial year and further reduce the corporate tax rate in stages so that, by the 2026-27 financial year, the corporate tax rate for all businesses will be 25%. The package has been deadlocked politically for months because the government lacks the requisite Senate support to cut the tax rate for big businesses from 30% to 25%. Xenophon’s ask on emissions trading hits an acute point of sensitivity within the Coalition. The government ruled out pursuing emissions trading last December after a brief internal revolt. Various conservatives, and the frontbench moderate Christopher Pyne, insisted the Coalition could not adopt any climate policy that included carbon trading. Senior government players have continued to publicly rule out an intensity trading scheme as a number of influential business groups and energy market experts have used the Finkel review of energy policy to argue in favour of such a scheme on the basis it would lower emissions in the electricity sector at least cost to households and businesses. A string of peak bodies have already called on the Coalition to adopt a market mechanism to drive the transition to lower emissions power sources in electricity, including the National Farmers Federation, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Business Council of Australia, which explicitly called for an emissions intensity scheme. The current consensus around carbon pricing is a major turnaround in a very short period of time. Three years ago, some of the same groups urged the parliament to get out of the way so that Tony Abbott could repeal the Gillard government’s so-called “carbon tax”. While the government has been keen to telegraph the message it will not allow emissions trading in the electricity sector, a new discussion paper released by the government last Friday to help inform a scheduled review of its heavily criticised Direct Action climate policy is completely open-ended about what policies might be required to drive the transition to lower emissions technologies in Australia’s energy sector. With power prices a continuing political problem for the government, Turnbull government on Monday asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to scrutinise the behaviour of electricity retailers, and the contracts offered to residential and business customers, to ensure Australians are benefiting from competition. Xenophon said the new ACCC inquiry wasn’t enough to deal with the current problems and the country required swifter action. The prime minister, speaking to reporters on Monday, left open the idea retail electricity prices could be regulated as a consequence of the review to give consumers and businesses relief. Turnbull said there was a lot of regulation in the electricity market already but the government was expecting the Finkel review to recommend some changes in the regulatory arrangements. “You’ll no doubt see recommendations from this ACCC review and we will obviously take them all on board and consider them very carefully,” the prime minister said Monday."
"As an Arctic researcher, I’m used to gaps in data. Just over 1% of US Arctic waters have been surveyed to modern standards. In truth, some of the maps we use today haven’t been updated since the second world war. Navigating uncharted waters can prove difficult, but it comes with the territory of working in such a remote part of the world.  Over the past two months though, I’ve been navigating a different type of uncharted territory: the deleting of what little data we have by the Trump administration.   At first, the distress flare of lost data came as a surge of defunct links on 21 January. The US National Strategy for the Arctic, the Implementation Plan for the Strategy, and the report on our progress all gone within a matter of minutes. As I watched more and more links turned red, I frantically combed the internet for archived versions of our country’s most important polar policies.  I had no idea then that this disappearing act had just begun.  Since January, the surge has transformed into a slow, incessant march of deleting datasets, webpages and policies about the Arctic. I now come to expect a weekly email request to replace invalid citations, hoping that someone had the foresight to download statistics about Arctic permafrost thaw or renewable energy in advance of the purge.  In the waning days of 2016 we were warned: save the data. Back up the climate measurements. Archive the maps of America’s worst polluters. Document the education portals that teach students about backyard ecosystems. Anticipating a massive overhaul by the new administration, scientists around the world sounded the alarm to copy as many files off of government sites before they were altered or removed. As the inauguration neared, hundreds of guerrilla archivists took up the call. From Philadelphia to Toronto, hackers raced against the clock to protect crucial datasets before they disappeared. Volunteers tried tirelessly to save what they could, but the federal government is a massive warehouse of information. Some data was bound to get left behind. All in all, emails about defunct links of sites that weren’t saved are annoying, but harmless. Finding archived materials to replace them add maybe 20 minutes of internet searches to my day – and a bit of anger at the state of the country. The consequences of vanishing citations, however, pose a far more serious consequence than website updates. Each defunct page is an effort by the Trump administration to deliberately undermine our ability to make good policy decisions by limiting access to scientific evidence. We’ve seen this type of data strangling before. Just three years ago, Arctic researchers witnessed another world leader remove thousands of scientific documents from the public domain. In 2014, then Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper closed 11 department of fisheries and oceans regional libraries, including the only Arctic center. Hundreds of reports and studies containing well over a century of research were destroyed in that process – a historic loss from which we still have not recovered.  These back-to-back data deletions come at a time when the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average. Just this week, it was reported that the Arctic’s winter sea ice dropped to its lowest level in recorded history. The impacts of a warming, ice-free Arctic are already clear: a decline in habitat for polar bears and other Arctic animals; increases in coastal erosion that force Alaskans to abandon their homes; and the opening up of shipping routes with unpredictable conditions and hazardous icebergs.  In a remote region where data is already scarce, we need publicly available government guidance and records now more than ever before. It is hard enough for modern Arctic researchers to perform experiments and collect data to fill the gaps left by historic scientific expeditions. While working in one of the most physically demanding environments on the planet, we don’t have time to fill new data gaps created by political malice.  So please, President Trump, stop deleting my citations.  "
"More than 400 icebergs have drifted into the North Atlantic shipping lanes over the past week in an unusually large swarm for this early in the season, forcing vessels to slow to a crawl or take detours of hundreds of kilometres. Experts are attributing it to uncommonly strong counter-clockwise winds that are drawing the icebergs south, and perhaps also global warming, which is accelerating the process by which chunks of the Greenland ice sheet break off and float away. As of Monday, there were about 450 icebergs near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, up from 37 a week earlier, according to the US Coast Guard’s international ice patrol in New London, Connecticut. Those kinds of numbers are usually not seen until late May or early June. The average for this time of year is about 80. In the waters close to where the Titanic went down in 1912, the icebergs are forcing ships to take precautions. Instead of cutting straight across the ocean, trans-Atlantic vessels are taking detours that can add around 650km (400 miles) to the trip. That’s a day and a half of added travel time for many large cargo ships. Close to the Newfoundland coast, cargo ships owned by Oceanex are throttling way back to three or four knots as they make their way to their home port in St John’s, which can add up to a day to the trip, said executive chairman Captain Sid Hynes. One ship was pulled out of service for repairs after hitting a chunk of ice, he said.   “It makes everything more expensive,” Hynes said. “You’re burning more fuel, it’s taking a longer time, and it’s hard on the equipment.” He called it a “very unusual year”. US Coast Guard Commander Gabrielle McGrath, who leads the ice patrol, said she had never seen such a drastic increase in such a short time. Adding to the danger, three icebergs were discovered outside the boundaries of the area the Coast Guard had advised mariners to avoid, she said. McGrath is predicting a fourth consecutive “extreme ice season” with more than 600 icebergs in the shipping lanes. Most icebergs entering the North Atlantic have “calved” off the Greenland ice sheet. Michael Mann, director of the earth system science center at Pennsylvania State University, said it was possible climate change was leading to more icebergs in the shipping lanes, but wind patterns were also important. In 2014, there were 1,546 icebergs in the shipping lanes – the sixth most severe season on record since 1900, according to the patrol. There were 1,165 icebergs in 2015 and 687 in 2016. The international ice patrol was formed after the sinking of the Titanic to monitor iceberg danger in the North Atlantic and warn ships. It conducts reconnaissance flights that are used to produce charts. In 104 years, no ship that has heeded the warnings has struck an iceberg, according to the ice patrol."
"Three of Australia’s big four banks are reviewing their exposure to fossil fuels, including their lending practices to households and farmers, in response to climate change.  The Commonwealth Bank is conducting a “detailed climate policy review” that will be released publicly pending board approval, and NAB has a working group reviewing the risks from global temperatures rising two degrees.   ANZ is conducting portfolio analysis to identify changes in the financial position of business customers in sectors “most exposed” to climate change. It is also working with the Bureau of Meteorology to understand variability in average annual rainfall over recent decades to understand how climate change is affecting Australia’s traditional farming areas. Executives from the three banks shared this information with the House of Representatives’ standing committee on economics, as part of a review of the four major banks. The revelations, written in response to questions on notice from the committee, were published on the federal parliamentary website on Friday afternoon. It comes two months after the banking regulator warned climate change posed a material risk to Australia’s financial system, and urged companies to start adapting.  Geoff Summerhayes from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), in a major speech to the Insurance Council of Australia’s annual forum in February, warned it planned to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various adverse climate shocks. He pointed to the Paris Climate Agreement, ratified by Australia in November, as a significant policy moment for all governments, including Australia’s. Summerhayes said the Paris Agreement provided an “unmistakable signal” about the future direction of policy and adjustments that companies, markets and economies “will need to make”. The revelations from CBA and NAB come after ANZ’s chief executive, Shayne Elliott, said last month he was examining the impact of sea level rise and other climate impacts on housing mortgage risk. Adam Bandt, the Greens’ climate and energy spokesman, has welcomed the revelations. He also questioned why Westpac has not ruled out funding Adani’s giant Carmichael coalmine in Queensland given its competitors’ concerns about climate change. “Following ANZ’s revelation that sea-level rises might make it tougher to grant a mortgage, CBA and NAB seem to be examining whether to follow suit,” Bandt said. “The penny doesn’t seem to have fully dropped, because banks like Westpac still think they can commit to a two degree target but leave the door open to expanding coal mines. “Westpac’s refusal to rule out funding Adani is especially concerning; as the bank seems to think it can have its climate cake and eat it too. But the days of dealing with climate change simply by putting a polar bear in your ad are long gone.”  Last year, financial activists Market Forces said Australia’s big four banks could act on their stated ambition to help achieve a 2C warming target simply by giving no new loans to coal projects."
"Donald Trump’s aides have abruptly postponed a meeting to determine whether the US should remain in the Paris climate agreement, with an unlikely coalition of fossil fuel firms, environmental groups and some Republicans calling on the president to stick with the deal. Trump’s top advisers were set to meet on Tuesday to provide the president with a recommendation ahead of a G7 meeting in May. However, a White House official said the meeting had been postponed due to conflicting schedules. It is unclear when it will now take place.  Trump has already signed executive orders to start the demolition of the clean power plan, throw open federal land to coal mining, and halt new vehicle emissions standards but has so far not acted on his campaign pledge to “cancel” the Paris compromise. His aides are understood to be split on whether the US should stay in the voluntary agreement, which was fully ratified last year. Barack Obama pledged that the US would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% by 2025, based on 2005 levels, as part of a landmark global effort that for the first time required emissions reduction goals from all nations, including the large developing emitters China and India. Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon and the Environmental Protection Agency head, Scott Pruitt, are both in favour of ditching the Paris agreement. Last week, Pruitt called the agreement a “bad deal” for the US that imposes a burden that other countries do not have to bear.  However, the weight of opinion may be in favour of those who support the agreement. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both advisers to the president, have positioned themselves as defenders of the agreement, while Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, has supported the idea of “keeping a seat at the table”. Other advisers at the meeting were expected to include Rick Perry, the energy secretary; Gary Cohen, an economic adviser; and HR McMaster, the national security adviser. Support for the Paris deal has come from seemingly unlikely quarters – the oil giant ExxonMobil wrote to the White House to advocate it as an “effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change”. BP and Shell have also previously endorsed the Paris deal, along with dozens of other businesses including Gap, General Mills and the Kellogg Company.  A group of Republicans in Congress also warned against withdrawing from the agreement. The Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo, in his role as co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, said it was “imperative that we maintain our seat at the table”. “The world’s leading nations must work together to not only reduce the impact carbon emissions have on climate change, but also mitigate and prepare for the effects, which communities like ours are dealing with every day,” Curbelo said in a joint statement with Ted Deutch, a Democrat who is his fellow co-chair.  “It’s our hope the administration will take a responsible approach on this issue.”  Proponents of remaining in the deal cite the severe diplomatic fallout of leaving, which could damage the US position on other issues, as well as the imperative to cut emissions to avoid dangerous climate change. “Withdrawing from the Paris agreement would send a clear message that America is an unreliable partner that fails to live up to its commitments,” said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, chief program officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.  “It will also handicap the competitiveness of American businesses in clean energy – a $1.3tn yearly global market. It is essential that the US not withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.” Conservative and free market groups have rallied to urge Trump to follow through with his pledge to exit the agreement. Among those organizations is the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian thinktank that includes Myron Ebell, who was part of Trump’s EPA transition team. The group has launched an online ad that tells Trump: “Don’t listen to the swamp. Keep your promise. Withdraw from the Paris climate treaty.”  If Trump decides to exit the deal, it will require a three-year notice period before the process begins. In order to speed up the process, he could remove the US from the overall UN climate change framework or submit the deal to the Senate to be ratified as a treaty, where it will probably fail.  A third, and perhaps most likely, option is to remain in the agreement in name only, retaining a modicum of US prestige abroad while dismantling Obama-era rules designed to reduce emissions. The US will face no penalty for not meeting its emissions targets, although some other countries have raised the possibility of imposing a “carbon tariff” on American goods. Regardless of whether the US stays within the Paris deal, its chances of making deep cuts in its emissions have receded since Trump took office. Without the clean power plan, more stringent emissions standards on vehicles and gas and oil drilling operations or any sort of tax on greenhouse gases – a plan recently floated by some Republicans – the US will pull back from the effort to help avoid more severe heatwaves, droughts, the disappearance of coral reefs and coastal inundation. “Regardless of what Trump does on Paris, he has abrogated our position,” said Tom Steyer, a leading hedge fund manager and climate campaigner. “This is an administration trying as hard as possible to bring back coal mining; they have given up American leadership on energy and climate. They have already walked away.”"
"Australia could be on the frontline of a new wave of “climate refugees” displaced by extreme weather events, droughts and rising seas, a US expert on the national security impacts of climate change has warned. Sherri Goodman, a former US deputy undersecretary of defence, argues the impact of climate change – rising seas, extreme weather, prolonged droughts – will be a “threat multiplier” for security challenges, and could be the spark that ignites conflict and drives new waves of mass forced migration.  The Asia-Pacific region was acutely vulnerable, she said. “You may be on the frontlines here in Australia for climate refugees,” she told the Guardian in Sydney. “The first wave will be those who have to flee the low-lying Pacific islands, because many of them will be uninhabitable, even in our lifetimes.” “But you’re also in ‘disaster alley’ here in the Asia-Pacific region and while there have begun to be efforts to reduce risks of disasters, I’m concerned that we’re not acting as quickly as we should to protect our societies from those risks, which is going to mean more migration.” Goodman cited the example of the ongoing civil war in Syria, which has produced more than five million refugees over six years of fighting. But the political conflict in Syria was exacerbated by a long-running drought which drove people into food insecurity, poverty and rapid, unsustainable urbanisation. “From 2006 to 2010, 60% of Syria had its worst long-term drought and crop failures since civilisation began,” Goodman says. “About 800,000 people in rural areas lost their livelihood by 2009. Three million people were driven into extreme poverty, and 1.5 million migrated to cities.” “Those conditions enable terrorists like the Islamic State of Boko Haram in parts of Nigeria or al-Qaida in Iraq to rise and take advantage of desperate people in desperate circumstances.” Goodman is careful not to posit climate change as the sole cause of future conflicts, but argues it will be a contributory, compounding factor. “Climate is a threat multiplier because it aggravates others tensions and conflicts that already exist. “Climate-exacerbated water insecurities could eventually become a tipping [point] to wider conflict or instability in the region. We see this now playing out in various ways around the world, but particularly here in the Asia-Pacific region.” Regionally, Goodman sees the example of Pakistan and India, where historical enmity, long-running religious, political and cultural fractures, and territorial disputes over Kashmir, could be reignited by conflict over water or other resources. Low-lying Bangladesh, the eighth-most populous country in the world with more than 160 million people, has been identified as being extremely vulnerable to climate change, on some measures the most vulnerable country in the world. “Another extreme weather event, combined with sea-level rise and storm surge, could send upwards up 10 million people or more along that low-lying coastline in Bangladesh fleeing towards higher ground, which is towards India, which is building a massive wall to keep Bangladeshis out. “I think that could create consequences for which we’re currently unprepared. India shows no signs of wanting or being able to absorb those numbers of refugees. And then where do they flee? These are mostly people who can’t afford to get on a cruise ship and leave. And if they can’t flee by land into India does that mean they, there’s either a massive loss of life or head off in rickety boats, where they might lose their lives at sea.” In 2008, the then president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, speculated about buying land in Australia in order to house his country’s population when the archipelago nation was consumed by the rising Indian Ocean. Under the global standard for refugee protection, the 1951 refugee convention, there is no such thing as a “climate change refugee”. The refugee convention, written in the aftermath of the massive displacement caused by the second world war, only recognises refugees displaced from their home countries, and suffering a “well-founded fear of persecution” on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. Some regional treaties – such as Latin America’s Cartagena declaration – have a broader definition, recognising as refugees people displaced by “circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order”, which is taken to include natural disasters and food insecurity. Goodman argues national governments, and supranational organisations, will need to redraw, or add to, the current global protection framework.  “We do need to rethink the governance for refugees better to reflect the types of refugees we face today. Current governance structures are just inadequate for the modern era.” Governments and militaries around the world are becoming increasingly cognisant of the national security threat posed by climate change. In his confirmation hearing in January, the US’s new secretary of defence, James Mattis, said climate change posed a current security threat to America. “Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. It is appropriate for the combatant commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.” In 2015, Australia’s Climate Council released a report, co-authored by the former chief of the Australian defence force, Chris Barrie, that argued climate change “poses a significant and growing threat to human and societal wellbeing, threatening food, water, health and national security”. In 2016, the army chief, Angus Campbell, made climate security a focus of the annual chief of army’s exercise. He said climate change was “immediately relevant” for militaries and “the scale of climate change problems, their unpredictability, and the level of support required from land forces are key issues for us to better understand”. The Centre for Policy Development policy director, Rob Sturrock, co-authored a report in 2015 arguing that Australia’s struggle to deal with climate vulnerabilities domestically and across the region was the country’s “longest conflict”.  The report recommended the federal government appoint a climate security advisory council, connecting the defence, environment and foreign affairs departments to develop a national climate security strategy. Goodman, founder of the CNA Military Advisory Board, is speaking this week in Sydney at the Lowy Institute, Canberra at the ANU, and Melbourne at the Breakthrough Institute at screenings of The Age of Consequences documentary, about the security threat posed by climate change."
"Europe’s energy utilities have rung a death knell for coal, with a historic pledge that no new coal-fired plants will be built in the EU after 2020. The surprise announcement was made at a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, 442 years after the continent’s first pit was sunk by Sir George Bruce of Carnock, in Scotland.  National energy companies from every EU nation – except Poland and Greece – have signed up to the initiative, which will overhaul the bloc’s energy-generating future. A press release from Eurelectric, which represents 3,500 utilities with a combined value of over €200bn, reaffirmed a pledge to deliver on the Paris climate agreement, and vowed a moratorium on new investments in coal plants after 2020.  “26 of 28 member states have stated that they will not invest in new coal plants after 2020” said Kristian Ruby, Eurelectric’s secretary-general. “History will judge this message we are bringing here today. It is a clear message that speaks for itself, and should be seen in close relation to the Paris agreement and our commitment to provide 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2050.” “Europe’s energy companies are putting their money where their mouths are,” he added.  Coal has been central to Europe’s development, powering the industrial revolution, trades union history, and even the EU’s precursor, the European coal and steel community. But it also emits more carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel, plus deadly toxins such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, which are responsible for more than 20,000 deaths each year. Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network Europe, hailed the new move as “the beginning of the end for coal”.  “It is now clear that there is no future for coal in the EU,” he said. “The question is: what is the date for its phase out in the EU, and how hard will the coal industry fight to keep plants open, even if they are no longer economically viable?” The coal industry though was sceptical about the utilities’ announcement. Brian Ricketts, the secretary-general of the Euracoal trade group said: “Steam engines were replaced by something better,cheaper and more productive – electric motors and diesel engines. When we see a new energy system – with lots of energy storage – that works at an affordable price, then coal, oil and gas will not be needed. In the meantime, we still rely on conventional sources.” Renewable industry sources also welcomed the news, albeit with the caveat that it would allow continued new investments in the industry for another three years. “The debate about coal is over,” one industry insider told the Guardian. “This is the only way that we can go forward with decarbonisation. But it would be good to see a phase out of existing coal plants.”  The energy utilities’ initiative faced initial resistance in Germany which is relying on coal to bridge a move away from nuclear energy to renewables under the “energiewende” transition. In the end though, only Poland which depends on coal for around 90% of its electricity and Greece, which still plans new coal plants, bucked what is becoming a global trend. New coal plant constructions fell by almost two thirds across the world in 2016, with the EU and US leading the way in retiring in existing coal capacity. The move is also in line with a pathway for meeting the 2C target laid out by climate scientists last month, as a way of limiting future stranded asset risks. Europe will have to phase out all of its coal plants by 2030 or else “vastly overshoot” its Paris climate pledges, climate experts say. António Mexia, the CEO of Portuguese energy giant EDP and president of the Eurelectric trade association, said: “The power sector is determined to lead the energy transition and back our commitment to the low-carbon economy with concrete action.” “With power supply becoming increasingly clean, electric technologies are an obvious choice for replacing fossil fuel based systems, for instance in the transport sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” “The challenge for policy makers in the next two years will be to target the political instruments, ensure that they are complementary and advance decarbonisation and electrification at the same time,” said Ruby.  Ruby called for a ratcheting up of the cap on CO2 emissions under the EU’s emissions trading system, to speed the transition to a low carbon economy. "

"We don’t yet know whether the $5bn Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) will be – as was alleged in parliament this week – a “slush fund” used to pursue the government’s “pro-coal agenda”. But we do know some government ministers are absolutely determined to promote coal mining and generation – in particular the Indian conglomerate Adani’s $21bn Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – without a thought for how it will contribute to the global warming that is bleaching the Great Barrier Reef up and down the Queensland coastline and increasing the intensity of cyclones. And we do know Adani has put its hand up for a $1bn concessional loan from the facility to help build a $2.2bn rail line that is essential for the mine to proceed. We also know Adani’s chief executive said with surprising certainty on Friday that engineering work on that rail line would start in June, and that construction was scheduled for September. And we certainly know the NAIF rules are way too opaque and the publicly available information way too sparse, to be absolutely sure it won’t, or couldn’t, be used to achieve a political end.  The “slush fund” claim was made by former treasurer Wayne Swan, who told parliament the facility’s procedures were “as dodgy as Lehman Brothers”, the bank that sparked the global financial crisis. Swan has written to the auditor general demanding an investigation. The NAIF is supposed to be an independent statutory authority that makes recommendations to resources minister Matt Canavan about how concessional loans can be used to boost the economy of northern Australia. The minister gives final approval for any loan, but according to the legislation setting up the fund, he cannot direct its recommendations.  Asked how Australians could be assured of the NAIF’s independence, its chief executive, Laurie Walker, told Senate estimates this month that “the minister has no ability under our act to direct the NAIF board to support any particular project or individual, and the board will absolutely adhere to its obligations under the act”. At that point the minister, Canavan, interrupted. “Can I just add to that, too, that I support everything Ms Walker just said, but I do see it as part of my role to help promote the fact that we have a Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility that investors to this country should, certainly, be considering as an option.” And he had just finished telling the committee: “I think, unfortunately, there has been a view that various Australian governments have not been supportive of the coal sector, but it is fantastic that we have a prime minister that has said loud and clear that we back the coal industry and we think it is a very strong and important sector for our economy.” And he has repeatedly said how confident he was in the Carmichael project’s future and how beneficial it would be for his home state. (Adani and governments repeatedly claim it will provide 10,000 jobs, although evidence from an economist commissioned by Adani itself – Jerome Fahrer of ACIL Allen – given in the land court in Queensland stated that “over the life of the project it is projected that on average around 1,464 employee years of full-time equivalent direct and indirect jobs will be created”.) And late last year, just before the mine’s billionaire proponent, Gautam Adani, was due to meet state and federal political leaders, Brisbane’s Courier Mail “exclusively” reported that $1bn had already been “set aside” for it, and it had recevied conditional approval. The minister said that while he was confident, that “exclusive” was a bit premature. This week the paper was again extolling the project’s benefits and puzzling out loud over why environmentalists were opposed to it, in an article written by a journalist who declared he had recently travelled to India as a guest of Adani. In fact, the only reason we even know the Adani mine is one of four projects now in the “due diligence” stage for NAIF funding is that the minister announced it, after speaking to the fund and the company. The NAIF itself hasn’t made public any of the companies it is working with, and says it won’t. Swan compared the checks and balances for the NAIF (a body set up to provide loans to projects that can’t get private financing) with the $10bn Clean Energy Finance Corporation that Labor established – a body the Abbott government repeatedly sought to dismantle precisely because it was established to provide loans to projects that couldn’t get private financing. The CEFC, Swan pointed out, was required to deliver a designated rate of return on taxpayers’ money. The NAIF has no such specific requirement, and had provided no documentation about how it would decide whether a loan was likely to be repaid, or even how it would determine whether a loan was needed. “The few policies they do have they are now keeping a secret ... the Turnbull government wants to turn it into a boondoggle machine in pursuit of its ideological and political pork-barrelling. But the NAIF appears to have been intentionally set up, in the first instance, with no ability to operate independently; with a board that has been stacked in favour of mining investments; and with an investment mandate so broad and vague that minister Canavan can essentially treat the NAIF as his own personal slush fund,” Swan fumed. “For months, ministers Canavan and Joyce have repeatedly promoted a $1bn loan to Adani to partly fund the Carmichael railroad while simultaneously claiming that investment decisions of the NAIF are independent. If the Adani mine is to go ahead, it must be able to stand on its own merit – it should not get one-fifth of minister Canavan’s slush fund to help make it a profitable investment.”  The Australia Institute – one of many groups campaigning against the Adani mine – requested documents about the NAIF’s application and approvals processes, including how it would assess risk and how it would determine whether a project was in the public interest.  The FOI request was refused on the basis that it “would reveal to proponents and other interested parties the NAIF’s methodologies beyond what is required or appropriate to disclose publicly”. And this week the Labor party got the Senate to back a demand that Canavan deliver similar documents in the Senate. The minister eventually replied that he couldn’t because he was “not in possession of the documents mentioned”. Given that the “documents mentioned” included a statement of how much risk the NAIF was prepared to take while lending $5bn of taxpayers’ money and given the act says “the facility will develop a risk appetite statement to guide its investment decisions, in consultation with the responsible minister” (that is, Canavan) it seems astonishing the minister would not have it. And if the facility hasn’t got a risk policy yet, how can it be considering a $1bn loan for a project that is set to start engineering works in June? There is nothing wrong with a government looking for ways to promote development in northern Australia with concessional lending. But there would be everything wrong with providing a massive government-backed concessional loan to achieve a political end without proper public scrutiny or process, or even a definition of how it was determined to be in the public interest."

"Scientists and science supporters will take to the streets in a global March for Science on 22 April . What began as a small Facebook group in the US capital, Washington DC has spiralled into a global phenomenon that will now see marches and other events in more than 500 locations around the world, from Seattle to Seoul. It is great news that so many people are prepared to stand up and defend the need for evidence-based thinking and the scientific method. But it is also a sad comment on our times that a March for Science is needed at all. Post-truth populism has infected democracies around the world, scientific objectivity is under threat from multiple sources and there seems a real danger of falling into a modern dystopian dark age. It is clear that the old days of scientists staying in the lab, publishing papers in scholarly journals, and otherwise letting the facts speak for themselves are over. As the Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes reminds us: “The facts don’t speak for themselves because we live in a world where so many people are trying to silence facts.” In her book, Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes wrote about these efforts from the tobacco industry onwards; science denialist attempts that are paralleled in today’s climate sceptic, anti-vaccine and anti-GMO movements. These campaigners against truth take great pains to deny the existence of scientific consensus on their different issues. The fact that 97% of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change supports the consensus that most of global warming is human-induced is dismissed as mere elitism. But as Dr Sarah Evanega, director of the Alliance for Science at Cornell, writes: “The values we defend are those of the Enlightenment, not the establishment.” Expertise is real, and we reject it at our peril.  Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of the March for Science, and what may prove to be its most enduring legacy, is its truly global nature. Science is not western; it is everywhere and for everyone. I have worked with Alliance for Science colleagues to help get marches off the ground in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Uganda, Venezuela, Chile and other places. In between long Skype calls about logistics, fundraising, and media outreach I watched the lights flash on as the number of marches on the global map kept on increasing. It was like watching the world light up with knowledge. Bangladesh March for Science’s lead organiser Arif Hossain says: “I am marching to let the world know that we are united for science in Bangladesh. We have 160 million people to feed in the changed climate, and together we will make a better day with science and innovation.” Although the issues of most concern vary in different locations, appreciation of the need for science is global. As Nkechi Isaac, an organiser of the March for Science in Abuja, Nigeria, says: “Science is revolutionary. It holds the key to constant development and improvement for addressing climate change, food shortage and challenges in medicine. Science holds the solution to our food security.” Nigerians can testify to the tragic effects of anti-science activism. Efforts to eradicate polio in the country were held up for years because of conspiracy theories spread by those suspicious of modern medicine and vaccines. People die when science is denied.  So here’s what we will be marching for. It’s time to enter the post-post-truth era. And there is no time to lose.  • Mark Lynas is a science and environment writer and a visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science at Cornell University."
"Media Matters for America has published its annual review of American evening newscast climate coverage for 2016, and the results are stunning: In 2016, evening newscasts and Sunday shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as Fox Broadcast Co.’s Fox News Sunday, collectively decreased their total coverage of climate change by 66 percent compared to 2015  In all of 2016, these news programs spent a combined grand total of 50 minutes talking about climate change. More than half of that come from CBS Evening News, which nevertheless only spent half as much time talking about climate change in 2016 as it had in 2015. It’s certainly not as though 2016 lacked newsworthy climate stories. We learned in January that 2015 had smashed the record for hottest year, previously set just a year earlier. And 2016 just kept getting hotter, with nearly every month setting a new heat record. In September, the US and China agreed to formally ratify the Paris climate agreement. The list goes on and on, with newspapers like The Guardian constantly publishing important climate-related news throughout the year. During 2016 there was also an ongoing presidential campaign in which the candidates’ views on climate science and policy should have been featured prominently. Unfortunately, climate change was rarely raised in the primary debates, and never in the general election debates. In fact, on Sunday news programs, Bernie Sanders brought up climate change four times more often than the program hosts. Only after the election did news networks finally examine what a President Trump would mean for the Earth’s climate: ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox News Sunday did not air a single segment informing viewers of what to expect on climate change and climate-related policies or issues under a Trump or Clinton administration. While these outlets did devote a significant amount of coverage to Trump’s presidency, airing 25 segments informing viewers about the ramifications or actions of a Trump administration as they relate to climate change, all of these segments aired after the election. As Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) noted, this was a dismal failure by the American news networks: In a year when the American people were deciding who our next leader should be, you would think there would have been more discussions about climate change in our news programs, not less. This isn’t just shameful, it’s irresponsible. The climate is changing, and it’s affecting everything from the weather to our national security and our economy. Its impacts are already being felt and the American people deserve to know more about it. PBS was the oasis in this desert of climate news coverage. PBS NewsHour was the only show that examined what impact a Trump or a Clinton presidency would have on climate-related issues and policies before the election. The PBS news program aired more than double the number of climate news segments as any of its network competitors, and interviewed or quoted three times more scientists than even CBS Evening News. ABC World News Tonight failed to interview or quote a single scientist about climate change. Perhaps unsurprisingly given his climate denial, Trump’s proposed budget would completely defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which partially funds PBS. About half of that federal funding goes to local PBS stations that broadcast PBS NewsHour. Some of those stations – especially those in rural areas which rely particularly heavily on federal funding – would likely have to shut down, were Trump to get his budgetary wish. With so little news coverage on the subject, it’s also unsurprising how confused Americans are about climate change – just 49% of Americans realize that most scientists think global warming is happening, and only 53% understand that humans are causing the problem. While concern among Americans about global warming is at an eight-year high, only 64% worry a great deal or fair amount.  That’s entirely understandable – if our leaders deny the problem, and our news networks don’t report on it, Americans are lacking the information signaling that global warming is an urgent threat. That’s why, although Americans (including Trump voters) would prefer that their political leaders take steps to address the problem, they don’t few it as a high priority, and thus aren’t bothered by the lack of political action. When future generations look back in disbelief at our failure to take the needed steps to preserve a stable climate, the history books will take a harsh view of today’s media outlets and political leaders who refused to inform the public or protect its health and welfare in the face of such an immense known threat."
"Longer days are here at last, but in terms of air quality, spring is often our most polluted time of year. Pollutants left over from the northern hemisphere winter cause increased ozone at ground level. Coastal areas are most vulnerable and the problem tends to move south through spring.  During March, ozone on Shetland reached four on the UK’s 10-point warning scale. Heavy fertiliser use and spreading manure that was stored over winter causes big releases of ammonia each spring. This reacts chemically with pollution from traffic and industry to create particles that can stay in the air for a week or more. These caused pollution to reach eight on the UK’s 10-point scale across England in February, and six during March.  Industry and new vehicles have to meet ever tightening emission standards, but targets for controlling ammonia from farming are less ambitious. Over-use of fertiliser costs farmers money. It harms our rivers and our air and releases powerful greenhouse gases. Ammonia from farming decreased substantially in the early 1990s, but progress has stalled since. In Turkey and eastern Europe it has increased, while Denmark halved ammonia emissions between 2000 and 2010 showing what can be done. The particles from the ammonia, traffic and industry mixture can drift a long way. Around one third of the health impacts from western Europe’s particle pollution occurs in other parts of the world, but this is not the only way that we export pollution. Based on goods traded in 2007, western Europe’s consumption of Chinese products causes around 55,000 early deaths from air pollution deaths across China each year.          "
"Donald Trump will on Tuesday sign an executive order to unravel Barack Obama’s plan to curb global warming, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said on Sunday, claiming the move would be “pro-growth and pro-environment”.  “The president is keeping his promise to the American people,” said Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who has questioned accepted climate science, in an appearance on ABC’s This Week. During the interview, Pruitt also called the Paris climate accord a “bad deal” and said Obama-era standards on auto emissions were “counter-helpful to the environment”. Pruitt said the Trump order would undo the Obama administration’s clean power plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants. “With respect to this executive order that’s coming out on Tuesday,” he said, “this is about making sure that we have a pro-growth and pro-environment approach to how we do regulation in this country.” Earlier this month, Pruitt told CNBC he did not believe the release of carbon dioxide, a gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels, was pushing global temperatures upward – as scientists have known for decades. The clean power plan, which aims to cut emissions of CO2 and other substances and was implemented in 2015, has been on hold since last year while a federal appeals court considered a challenge by Republican-led states and more than 100 companies. Pruitt sued to halt the order while in Oklahoma. Trump’s intention, he said, was to bring back coalmining jobs and reduce the cost of electricity. “For too long, over the last several years, we have accepted a narrative that if you’re pro-growth, pro-jobs, you’re anti-environment,” he said.  “We have made tremendous progress on our environment,” Pruitt continued. “We can be both pro-jobs and pro-environment.” He argued that the Obama administration “had a very anti-fossil fuel strategy – coal, natural gas and the rest”, and that it made “efforts to kill jobs across this country through the clean power plan”.   Pruitt also discussed the Trump administration’s rollback of Obama-era limits on car pollution, which began this month. Following a meeting with auto executives in Detroit, Trump directed Pruitt’s EPA to review fuel efficiency standards. “We ought to focus on efficiency, fuel efficiency for cars that people really want to buy,” Pruitt said. “You know, this process of building cars that no one purchases in order to meet these standards that were previously set actually is counter-helpful to the environment, because people don’t buy the new cars. They keep older cars.” Pressed on whether the administration would block a measure by California to tighten its fuel emissions standards, Pruitt said only it was “something we’re going to be evaluating”. Supporters of the clean power plan, including some Democratic-led states and environmental groups, argue it would promote thousands of clean energy jobs and help the US meet ambitious goals to reduce carbon pollution set by an international agreement reached in Paris in late 2015. Pruitt criticised the Paris climate agreement, which Trump has reportedly said he will “cancel” and which Pruitt said was too lenient in its provisions for China and India, which, like the US, are among the world’s leading producers of carbon dioxide. “China and India got away, the largest producers of CO2 internationally, got away scot-free,” he said. “They didn’t have to take steps until 2030. “So we’ve penalized ourselves through lost jobs while China and India didn’t take steps to address the issue internationally.” Pruitt said the Trump administration was “making sure we operate within the framework of the Clean Air Act”. But, he added: “Paris was just a bad deal, in my estimation.”"
"Chinese state media has lambasted Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back many Obama-era environmental regulations, with a state-run tabloid saying that: “No matter how hard Beijing tries, it won’t be able to take on all the responsibilities that Washington refuses to take.”    In an editorial highly critical of Trump’s retreat on environmental regulation, the Global Times made it clear Beijing was uncomfortable taking over leadership of the fight against climate change and could not fill the vacuum left by the US. “Western opinion should continue to pressure the Trump administration on climate change. Washington’s political selfishness must be discouraged,” the editorial said. “China will remain the world’s biggest developing country for a long time. How can it be expected to sacrifice its own development space for those developed western powerhouses?” China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases responsible for global warming, followed by the US, and Chinese leaders firmly agree climate change is a real threat. Their rhetoric has often outpaced their commitments to curb emissions and the country also consumes more coal than the rest of the world combined, although coal use has plateaued in recent years. “China is not the kind of leader in terms of climate change that will pull other countries along,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace based in Beijing. “The Chinese government will only commit to targets it is very comfortable delivering and it needs to work with other major countries. China won’t strike out on its own.” China is both the worlds largest exporter of renewable energy, and at the same time one of the leading exporters of coal-fired power plants. Trump has also threatened to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, putting him at odds with China’s president Xi Jinping who has said the “hard-won” deal should remain in force. “All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations,” Xi said at the World Economic Forum in January. Even ExxonMobil, America’s largest oil company, has said the US should not back out of its commitments under the accord.  The Global Times editorial said: “Washington is supposed to take the lead in the global fight against climate change but the Trump administration could be the first to ditch the agreement, which is disappointing.” Trump has previously repeatedly called climate change a “hoax” and without proof has blamed China for rising temperatures. “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive,” he said in a 2012 tweet. China has committed to having its emissions peak by 2030 as part of a deal with the US, but many forecasts say the country will reach that target years ahead of schedule. For people living in smog-choked Chinese cities, relief might seem far off. Beijing plans to meet Chinese national air quality standards by 2030, but those levels are still three-and-a-half times higher than those recommended by the World Health Organisation. China has invested heavily in renewables, but coal remains heavily used in the power, steel and cement industries."
"Once upon a time, in the distant 60s and 70s, the Great Barrier Reef faced imminent destruction. Tenement applications for drilling and mining covered vast swathes of the reef, with both government and industry enthusiastically backing the plans for mass exploitation. In the face of the reef’s impending doom a motley collection of ordinary Australians shared a common determination that something had to be done. But the odds didn’t look good. The poet turned campaigner Judith Wright wrote that “if it had not been for the public backing for protection of the reef that we knew existed, we might have given up hope”. The optimism of the poet was well founded. First in the hundreds, then in the tens of thousands, a people’s movement grew to defend the reef. Everyday Aussies turned activists and campaigners. Scientists and lawyers came forward with vital expertise. At a crucial moment the Queensland Trades and Labour Council approved a total black-ban by all affiliated unions on oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. As hard as is now to believe, the Murdoch-owned Australian opined that the ban would have an unprecedented measure of public support and would probably succeed. It deserved to. Only finally did the politicians follow the will of the people. Through the power and determination of the Australian people, the greatest marine park in human history was established and the Great Barrier Reef lived to fight another day. Inherently democratic in its size and closeness to the shore, the Great Barrier Reef is truly the people’s reef. Looking back on the first great struggle for the reef between the Australian people and the fossil fuel industry, Wright wrote that “if disasters in the shape of weather, accident and climate change lie ahead, the work done already has shown what can be done to shield it from such dangers and has proved that people will agree, in the event, to supplying the help it needs”. Unhappily, those disasters are now upon us. Global warming brought the great bleaching of 2015-16 and the dreadful and unprecedented sequel over the summer that has just finished. Our reef is in dire trouble. But while the people’s reef is grievously wounded, it is still very much alive. And life fights for life. Innumerable animals are now doing what creatures do, navigating the hazards of life as best they can to survive and reproduce in the warming waters. Given time and the right conditions, the people’s reef can recover and life will flourish again. So how this time around do we supply the help the reef needs? The big lie propagated by Australian government and big business is that it is possible to turn things around for the reef without tackling global warming. As scientists have made clear, it isn’t – we have to stop climate pollution to give our reef a chance. It is true that Australia can’t save the reef alone because climate change is a global problem. But that does not mean we are powerless to act and we should not be deterred. Because when you love something deeply – as we Australians cherish our people’s reef – then you do all that is within your power to save that thing which you hold so dear. And there is much that is within our power to do. So what is to be done? The answer does not lie in false techno-fixes or the faux-democratic farrago of the government-business funded Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef. Australia’s greatest contribution to global warming is through our coal, exported and burned in foreign power stations. So our most determined Australian efforts to save the reef must be directed to closing down the coalmining industry, while ensuring decent new jobs and fair transitions for all affected workers and communities. Again, the balance of power seems loaded against us. First the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and now the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, have betrayed both the reef and the trust of the Australian people by snivelling across the seas, pledging allegiance to the Carmichael coalmine. All too often, the rest of big business is complicit in the crisis by explicitly or tacitly supporting the coal industry. Financial institutions such as CommBank continue to invest in the fossil fuel projects that are bringing disaster to the reef. But, once we are roused, never underestimate the power and determination of the Australian people to defend our iconic animals and the natural beauty of our lands and seas. The extraordinary success of the Stop Adani Roadshow – which sold out across the eastern Australian capital cities reaching an audience of thousands – is just a glimpse of the popular will to fight the coal industry for the future of our reef. We have the opportunity to write our own story, not of despair but of defiance. If we, the people of Australia, stand determined together against coalmining and the rest of the fossil fuel industry then the future of our reef is not bleak but hopeful. The roadmap to full recovery for our reef will be decades or even centuries in the making. And it is going to get worse before it gets better. But we, the Australian people, can again agree to supply the help it needs, to give the reef we love the best chance of future flourishing. Now is the time to get involved. • This op ed is a modified version of comments made at Global Warming and the Mass Bleaching of Corals, a public event held by the Sydney Environment Institute of Sydney University on 31 March."
