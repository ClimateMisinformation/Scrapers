Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Welt here reports that the EU plans to force consumers to save energy – 1.5% every year.According to plans by EU Commissar Günther Oettinger of Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party, energy suppliers in the future have to assure that their customers use less power and gas. Every year suppliers will have to reduce its market share by 1.5%
If that sounds economically retarded to you, you’re not alone.
I guess that means consumers must forget about expanding the family, or getting a bigger and more comfortable house, or buying an air conditioner. No – in Europe it’s downscale your lives – until you’re living in a cardboard box under a bridge. Die Welt writes:
Oettinger also expects public offices and buildings to join in. The draft law stipulates that beginning in January 2014, 3% of all buildings in all 27 member countries shall be made energy-efficient by renovation according to EU requirements.”
I wonder who is going to pay for all that. This sounds like one of the shovel-ready-jobs programs that worked so well under Obama. The proposed law will be introduced to the Parliament next month.
Of course, all the energy saving will be “voluntary” at first – at least during the years 2012 and 2013. But if the targets are not met, then in 2014 “the second bomb will be lit” and the Commission will enact “binding requirements”, Die Welt writes.
Not everybody is pleased about this state-controlled economy. For example, Herbert Reul, Chairman of the Industrial Committee in the EU-Parliament, says all this will lead to an “over-bureaucratization” and that the State “might as well just take over the entire energy sector and that what the EU proposes no longer has any semblance of a free market”.
For readers outside Germany, now you know how crazy on green Angela Merkel’s government truly is in pushing all this. The German CDU as it is today is a party that needs to go politically extinct – the sooner, the better. I can hardly differentiate it from the East German SED  in some areas.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne way to indoctrinate children on living green is to teach them in a green passive school that requires little energy consumption. This is what they are attempting in East German Schwarzheide, as reported at the online Lausitzer Rundschau daily.
 There’s only one small problem: The lesson in living repsonsibly to protect the climate has backfired. The school’s ventilation is so bad that it is making students and teachers get ill by the score. Hat-tip: EIKE.
In general, a passive building typically has very low air infiltration from outside and is heavily insulated to ensure low thermal heat loss. Indeed heating requirements can be as low as 15 kwh per square meter of occupancy space per year. In the wintertime air intake is heated, and in the summertime the building uses the cool night air along with lots of shading for cooling. These types of buildings, at least in north Germany, are not equipped with air conditioning.
Unfortunately at the Schwarzheide SeeCampus school in Niederlausitz, the climate system in the school building doesn’t work like the architectural models thought it would. According to the Lausitzer Rundschau:
Pupils and teachers dread every school day at the SeeCampus. If the deodorant of just one person fails to work, then half the classroom goes into a coma. The ventilation in the exemplary passive building is a catastrophe. There’s an extreme lack of fresh air on hot days. Because of concern over the health of the children, who complain about headaches and fatigue, parents are threatening to stop operation of the school through legal action.
The school building SeeCampus in Niederlausitz becomes completely overheated on summer days and is badly ventilated. Headaches and cardio-respiratory problems with pupils and teachers are the result. The number of sick days is climbing rapidly.”

According to the website of the proud window and door supplier, Wiegand, the 3-storey €23 million school was built in 15 months and was dedicated during a party-like ceremony in February 2011 by Brandenburg State Minister President Platzeck, and State Council member Heinze accepted the Certificate from the Passive Building Institute.
Pupils and teachers being used as human guinea pigs to test the green experiment. Despite all the complaints, authorities have taken no action and are playing down the problems. According to teacher and administrator Andrea Eisenblätter:
 The air is dry. Because of the lack of oxygen, many students constantly have headaches. Concentration is near zero. How is anyone supposed to get proper grades?“
Parent Frank Klonowska from the town of Lauchhammer says:
It is suffocatingly warm, you can hardly breath. I was completely drenched in sweat after just 3 minutes. It is simply incomprehensible that the technical design of the ventilation system at the SeeCampus even got approved.”
In the end expect hundreds of thousands of euros more to be spent on proper ventilation and climate control, and expect much more than the ballyhooed 15 kwh/m²/year to be consumed. Or, in the worst case, expect the place to be taken over by the weeds soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a press release here, the German Weather Service, DWD, announces the release of its so-called interactive Climate Atlas, which projects what the German climate will be like up to the year 2100. They’ve got some real prophets over there.Needless to say, the climatically correct DWD’s Climate Atlas projects many barbecue summers in the decades ahead for Germans, especially after 2050, when many of us will be gone and climate change hysteria will be something in the history books.
The DWD uses a composite of up to 21 climate crystal balls simulations for generating it’s climate projections.
Sorry for the sarcasm, but for me these 90-year projections are pretty much hocus pocus…just colourfully packaged PhD guesses. Can anyone tell me what the sun will be like in the year 2060? Oh sorry, I forgot.  The sun is only a backseat climate driver.
No barbecue summer this year, July 2011 was too cool.
In another press release, the DWD reports that July, 2011, in Germany refused to cooperate with the models and was colder than normal. So Germans will have to wait at least another year for hopes of the next barbecue summer.
Germany had a quite gray, cool and wet July according to the preliminary results of the DWD’s approximately 2000 measurement stations. Compared to the long-term mean, July 2011 came is at 16.1°C, 0.8°C cooler than normal. The coolest areas were the southwestern parts of Germany. The highest recorded temperature was 33.8°C on July 12 and the low was 2.0°C recorded on July 16. In Münsingen-Apfelstetten light frost was even recorded. Sea temperatures of the North and Baltic Seas remained below 20°C (last year they were up to 23°C).
July in Germany was also wet. About 114 l/m² fell on average – well above the normal of 78 l/m².  The wettest area: the town of Barth recorded 291 l/m² of rainfall – doubling its previous record.
July in Germany also recorded less sunshine, with an average of 162 hours, or 22% less than the normal of 209 hours. This made it the 8th grayest month since 1951.

"Lily Cole has backed calls for UK banks to “radically transform” and take the climate emergency much more seriously. The actor, model and activist is the latest high-profile name to emerge as a customer of the ethical bank Triodos, which has a current account which can be managed online and via a mobile app. Other famous customers include the actors James Norton and Sir Mark Rylance.  Cole says: “I’ve long believed in voting with your wallet for the change you want to see in the world – for example, supporting Fairtrade and organic food and fashion. Yet there are other subtle and powerful ways that our money shapes the world, such as the investments made by our banks, pensions and the institutions we work with.” She says as soon as Triodos offered a current account in the UK, “I immediately joined the bank, as I didn’t want to be accidentally investing in the arms trade and fossil fuel industry”. Triodos says that according to the organisation BankTrack, the top UK banks have poured nearly £150bn into financing fossil fuels since the Paris agreement on climate change was adopted in late 2016. It says banks should be using the money deposited with them in their customers’ long-term interests. “We want more people to know that switching banks is one of the most powerful environmental changes you can make as an individual… You can choose to prevent your money from financing arms, pesticides, plastic packaging or fossil fuels.” Triodos’s current account comes with an eco-friendly contactless debit Mastercard overdraft of up to £2,000 is available, but there is a £3 monthly account fee."
"Tough Is Not Enough seemed an apt title. When I was very young, playing cricket with a tennis ball seemed more sensible to me than the hard one that hurt. But something happened when I started playing rugby league at school: something deep inside me rebelled at any weakness in my character. That was the start of wanting to prove to myself that I was tough, but nothing was ever good enough until I was 54 years old.  It was 2007. I sold our manufacturing business and set off on a kayaking trip from Brisbane to Adelaide through the Murray Darling basin. There is a mountain range to cross on the way but the kayak had wheels and a pulling harness. As an engineer I was confident in the design, but concerned whether it was possible to drag 70kg up the mountain. An added problem was that 10 months before setting out I had shattered the ribs and clavicle on the right side of my chest. My scapula was displaced through the glenoid, making my shoulder dislocated by more than a centimetre. I needn’t have worried. The big hill was difficult but possible. My shoulder got better, and after two months on the journey I could wash my left armpit with my right hand. The trip wasn’t easy because the country was in drought and I ended up dragging the kayak for 1,080km out of 3,050km. I have since met a fellow Australian who has paddled the Mississippi, Amazon, and Volga Rivers who said that the Darling was by far the hardest. Talking with him was when I started to feel like I might be a real adventurer. My passion has always been water, but it had to come second to the threat of the climate emergency. Nothing else matters if we can’t get that right. I had intended to paddle North America from north to south, but discussing this with a friend, it quickly became south to north extending to Paris for COP21, the 2015 climate summit. Eventually the trip became Canberra to Paris and then back to Canberra. There was no question in my mind that it would happen, that I was tough enough to complete it one way or another. Well on the wrong side of 60 I also knew that I needed to seize the opportunity and not put it off. Paddling up the Mississippi was the hardest physical thing I have ever done. It was during a flood. You paddle in treetops with land at the levees behind the trees, meaning there is nowhere to stop for hours at a time. Barges line the shore for the first 800km necessitating long hard slogs out in the current. Log jams at bends coincide with underwater walls causing whirlpools and strong currents that are almost impossible to paddle through. Many times per day you risk your life in very difficult circumstances. And you are on your own – supporters are not on your journey. They have their own lives to lead. This feeling of abandonment can attack your core, a rot eating at your heart. On my first trip I managed to overcome such demons and on the river my thoughts stayed positive. Eventually the great river beat me and I resorted to buying a cheap bicycle from Walmart, riding 1,400km from Memphis to Greenville and then paddling up to New York. Paddling into New York was huge. I was so proud, almost overwhelmed. Then I paddled across England, through London, across the channel and up the Seine to Paris. As I sat under the Eiffel Tower I tried to make sense of the world. I wrote: The trip is now very clear to me. It is the same as the fight for climate change resolution, a tough hard slog with huge mental challenges. It will be won not by celebrities, and not by the rich and famous. There will be no accolades for the warriors. It will be won by ordinary people determined that the future of the human race is paramount, who will do whatever they can in their power to bring about the changes in our society that must come if we are to survive.” I had made it. Although I hadn’t realised it at the time, I had cheated death, taxed my body to the limit, and tortured my mind, but I had made it. It was nearly time to drag my kayak from the Eiffel Tower to COP21. Then the terrorists attacked. It shocked Paris, it shocked the world and it meant that my kayak would not be allowed on the streets. I was exhausted, numb and ready to just go home. It took two years to get my mind back together and complete the circle back to Canberra. This was different. It was uplifting. Even dragging Old Yella, the new name for my kayak, over a mountain range was fun. In the end, with the support of many dedicated people, we made a difference. I’m still a climate warrior but Old Yella has retired. I paddle for fun now and fight for the future through speaking engagements, my professional work as an engineer and through writing. I am finally content. • Steve Posselt is a civil and water engineer. He set off from Canberra to drag and paddle his kayak through three continents and attended the Paris climate conference COP21.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got a CFACT newsletter from Marc Morano about the EPA. It reads as follows:
Dear Pierre,
Last week dawn broke on marble head. Obama woke up and killed EPA’s new ozone rule before it could start killing jobs. 
Businesses, job seekers, taxpayers and electric ratepayers all raised a cheer. For the radical Greens, who have grown used to having their every whim met, not so much. 
There’s a full on hissy fit going on in left field.

MoveOn said, “This is a decision we’d expect from George W. Bush.” 
Natural Resources Defense Council wrote, “Obama has come down on the side of the polluters and those extreme forces who deny the value of government safeguards.”
Greenpeace wrote, “Corporate polluters don’t have to worry about dismantling the Clean Air Act, it appears that President Obama is doing it for them.” They announced Greenpeace will use its tremendous financial resources to launch a campaign to pressure Obama to reverse course.
The Sierra Club said that they were “appalled” by Obama’s decision and with temerity declared it would “literally cost lives.” They too are spending what it takes to put on the pressure.

That’s just a sample of the tooth gnashing going on. Obama’s EPA surrender was like a warning siren for every radical Green pressure group out there (and there are plenty). They are organizing right now to push their man back into line and keep him there.
CFACT is working just as hard and fast to debunk the coming propaganda wave with 
hard facts. 
Help us compete and win. Let’s start with this cogent analysis by CFACT Senior Policy Analyst Bonner Cohen. Please forward it to as many people as you can. Ask them to keep it moving. Let’s email, post to Facebook, tweet on Twitter and not neglect good old word of mouth.
Hard work, solid facts and good sense can carry the day.  We are reminded again that sunlight is a powerful disinfectant.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere I don’t mean models like Claudia Schiffer.Hans von Storch’s blog Klimazwiebel here brings up an interview by the University of Hamburg with climate scientist Eduardo Zorita, whose insights I always appreciate. The interview is well worth reading.
The following are two parts that stand out for me (emphasis added):
Klimazwiebel: What would be your advice for young researchers who want to work on climate simulations?
Zorita: …there are two dangers that a student should avoid. One is to get stuck in a daily routine of programming and launching simulations, and slowly forgetting that simulations are performed to answer some previous question. [… }The second danger is to fall in love with your model and lose sight of the real observations out there. Models are in this sense dangerous and climate models even more so.
Klimazwiebel: What would you do with an additional million Euros for your research?
Zorita: …I would set up a project to understand the behavior of tropical clouds in the Late Maunder Minimum, at the height of the Little Ice Age 300 years ago, from proxy records and model simulations. This could give us hints about cloud cover changes in climates a bit different from the present and thus help us say something about the future climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the climate conference now taking place in Bonn with the aim of coming up with a successor to the 2012-expiring Kyoto Protocol for Durban later this year, signs of success are non-existent.
Obituaries are now being written everywhere in the German press, also see here and here.
For that we can all breathe a big sigh of relief – saved again from another huge Soviet-scale bureaucratic folly run by enviro-zealots.
The latest obit appears today in the leftist online Frankfurter Rundschau titled Kyoto Dies, which frames the current conference as follows:
If the EU fails to give a signal of a breakthrough, then the conference in Durban in December threatens to be a flop. That would make the Kyoto process practically dead -– almost 20 years after it started at the UN Earth Conference in Rio de Janeiro.”
With the USA, Russia, Canada and Japan out, and only countries that represent 20% of the global emissions still in it, the death of Kyoto is assured.

Not everyone has given up hope. For example “climate expert” Christoph Bals of tree-mater (we’re talking about real enviro-perverts here) group Germanwatch hope that Europe will summon the courage to take the lead and be the first to leap into the abyss of economic suicide. The Frankfurter Rundschau writes:
He demands the EU increase its reduction targets for the year 2020 from 20% to 30%. In fact the EU has already reached 17%.”
Most of that 17% reduction came in the early 1990s from shutting down inefficient industries centrally-run by the Eastern European communists, whom the tree-maters admire so much.
Meanwhile here’s how Der Spiegel starts off:
Already at the start of the climate conference in Bonn hopes were next to zero. No one gave a successor protocol  for the 2012-expiring Kyoto Climate protocol a chance of being passed on time, said UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres. Now, 11 days later, the renewed failure is perfect: there is hardly any tangible progress.”

"School climate protesters who took to the streets in huge numbers across the UK last week are threatening to boycott the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship deal with BP. In a letter being sent to the RSC on Thursday, a group representing young people in towns and cities across the UK, says it will launch a boycott campaign unless the theatre company severs its ties with big oil. The move comes amid growing concern among young people over the escalating climate crisis. Last week, millions of children took part in the global climate strike and this week the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN headquarters in New York for their “betrayal” of young people. BP sponsors the RSC’s £5 ticket scheme for 16- to 25-year-olds, but the school strikers say the theatre company’s tie-up puts young people in an impossible position. “If we, as young people, wish to see an affordable play at your theatre we have to help to promote a company that is actively destroying our futures by wrecking the climate,” the letter says.  “As an organisation that appears to care about climate breakdown, it simply makes no sense for you at the Royal Shakespeare Company to be accepting sponsorship from a company that is the third biggest corporate source of greenhouse gases in history.” The pressure is growing on arts institutions to sever their ties with fossil fuel firms, and this year there have been a series of protests by artists and campaigners at UK cultural institutions such as the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Natural History Museum. In June Mark Rylance, who had been an associate artist with the RSC for 30 years, resigned from his position saying BP’s sponsorship deal allowed the company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities”, which he said threatened the future of the planet. School strike organisers say the RSC “needs young people far more than it needs BP, with children and young people making up the bulk of the audiences of its hit show Matilda the Musical”. Eden, a 19-year-old student at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London, is one of the organisers who has signed the letter. “Shakespeare said ‘the great globe itself shall dissolve’. By endorsing BP, the RSC is allowing his words of the past to become a horrifying reality. Continued support of the oil industry will not only destroy my future, but is already causing terrible suffering to people on the frontline of the climate crisis right now,” Eden said. “How can you sleep at night knowing that you’ve tied the purity and hope of the arts to BP’s dirty, colonial extractive practices?” Catherine Mallyon, the RSC executive director, and Gregory Doran, the artistic director, said: “We welcome the conversation around this issue and will respond once we receive the letter. We recognise the importance for a continuing, robust and engaged debate, we acknowledge the climate emergency and recognise the strength of feeling especially amongst our young people.  “Our work with over 500,000 students annually means their feedback and opinions are very important to us. This subject is very much live at the RSC with our artists, staff, board and our audiences and we look forward to reviewing the contents of the letter.”  A BP spokesman said: “BP has been supporting the arts in the UK for over 50 years and our support allows the institutions we partner to widen access and extend the reach of their productions and exhibitions. “Our position on climate is clear – the world is on an unsustainable path and needs to move to net-zero carbon emissions in the decades to come. Everyone will have to play their part in addressing this challenge: individuals, governments and companies such as BP.  “We are investing to grow low carbon businesses and activities and working and investing in our other businesses to reduce emissions from our operations.” Jess Worth, co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, which has been spearheading the campaign against fossil fuel involvement in the arts, said the move by young activists was a significant blow to the theatre company. “This is another example of young people finding their power and using it to create change in institutions that, until now, have taken their concerns for granted,” she said. “Education and schools work is one of the RSC’s priorities, and an important source of income. This is a chance for the RSC to demonstrate how much it values young people, by not just listening but acting on their passionately held concerns.”"

The Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)has a piece called: First The IPCC and Now The DWD: Tricked Series With Alleged Warming After the Year 2000. The piece alleges that both the IPCC and the German Weather Service (DWD) are playing it loose with temperature data sets to produce the illusion of global warming for the last 10 years.
========================================
First The IPCC and Now The DWD: Tricked Series With Alleged Warming After the Year 2000
By Josef Kowatsch, for EIKE
In February 2007 Working Group I of the IPCC released its Summary for Policymakers (SPM) on the status of the global climate for political leaders. It was already false at the time it was published and it certainly hasn’t gotten more correct since then.

Fig. 1 shows the B1 scenario with a CO2 increase to 600 ppm, A1B to 850 ppm, and the pessimistic A2 of 1250 ppm. The year 2000 scenario illustrates the optimistic case of CO2 remaining stable at 390 ppm.
Although the IPCC computer graphic appears colorful and pretty, it is completely remote of reality, and is a science sham.  To explain why, let’s begin by dividing up the graphic in 2 parts.
Part 1: 1900 to 2000
From the year 1900 to 2000, i.e. the left half, this part is made up of real measured data, even if the IPCC does not cite a data source.  According to the curve, there is a detectable temperature increase. No one disputes the fact that it has gotten warmer since the end of the Little Ice Age.
Here one has to consider the fact that the global warming was for the most part driven by the urban heat island effect (UHI), which was caused by man over the last 100 years. Measurement stations, which earlier were mostly located outside of built-up areas, are located today in the middle of built-up areas. The thermometer themselves don’t know whether the warmth originates from the climate or from built-up infrastructure, and so they record the error along with the measurement. Out in the open countryside, or out to sea, these temperature increases do not occur.
If one cleans up the temperature records to account for the UHI effect, then the alleged temperature increase becomes much less obvious.
Also see: “Wärmeinseleffekt täuscht Klimaerwärmung vor“ (UHI masquerades as climate warming).

Fig. 2: In the last 100 years, temperatures in Germany have remained more or less the same. There have been warm years and cold years – even decades. We had an increase just before the millenium ended. After 2000 we had a decline.

Part 2, 1900 to 2000
After the year 2000, is the above curve headed for reality? According to the IPCC the C02 concentration increased 15 ppm over the last 10 years. And the temperatures? Contrary to the tricked IPCC curve, they’ve fallen. The curves of the IPCC should have gone downwards. Therefore all 4 shown scenarios are false. In Germany the temperature drop since 2000  is 2°C. This was confirmed by the German Weather Service (DWD) in Offenbach (by E-mail dated 6 September 2010):
…globally 1998 is the warmest year and in Germany it is 2000. That’s no secret, and anyone can know this …“
The real temperature drop is not shown in the IPCC curve from Figure 1. Shown are only the false projections beginning in the year 2000. Neither politicians nor the media (and forget the Umweltbundesamt [German Federal Department of Environment]) have bothered to take the time to examine the data for the IPCC and at the DWD for the years 2000 to 2010, which show average temperatures of:
9.9/ 9.0/ 9.6 / 9.4 / 9.0 / 9.0 / 9.5 / 9.9 / 9.5 / 9.2 / 7.8.°C
This is how the easily duped, like the media and our politicians, become victims of a climate propaganda and then act to further propagate the fantasy of ongoing warming. 
From the entire course of the original DWD values, we now consider only the last 12 years.

Fig.3:  Original curve of the DWD: The section of the first 6 years up to 2004 is 9.4°C. The section of the following 6 years up to the year 2010 is 9.15°C. Strangely, this curve was on the official DWD website for only a few weeks.
Summary
The IPCC is playing around with tricked data. The temperature curve of the IPCC shown in Fig. 1 still keeps popping up in the media. Here the first part of the curve is not correct, and the computer forecast second part is completely false for the first 10 years. Nobody really knows what will happen in the next 10 years. And as far as the year 2050 is concerned, absolutely no one can know.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith another financial crisis flaring up, the green energy sector this time is taking a hit. This is being reported today in the German language Technology Review here.
Hat-tip: reader Jean
No wonder Al Gore blew a fuse a few days back. With this news and the Chicago Climate Exchange shutting down, the poor bloke is probably taking a real hit. Might want to have a skyscraper watch.
The article starts with the introduction:
Innovative companies of the finance-intense sector of renewable energy risk are getting their supply of cash cut off. Investors are opting for lower risk projects.”
Almost everywhere globally governments are scaling back programs that support renewable energies.”

And so it’s only normal that venture capital companies are now opting out. Investment strategies are changing. Technology Review writes:
Germany, Italy and Spain are reducing subsidies, in America the money from the 2009 stimulus package is slowly running out.”
According to Technology Review, people want quicker returns and less risk. Well who doesn’t? Technology Review writes:
During the last years many finance companies began, however, to invest in long-term projects with high capital requirements. That only worked mainly because they were able to expect subsidies from the state. Thus hundreds of millions flowed into start-ups in solar technology, which first had to build expensive plants to get the technology ripe for the market. The profits came later, if at all.”
Now the state subsidies are shrinking and new startups will have little chance of competing against the already established companies – too risky. The bubble has nowhere to go but to implode. So watch the politicians soon scramble and start blaming “speculators” and “greedy finance companies” for the mess they themselves created, and then start calling for more financial regulation. Technology Review sums it up:
David Victor, expert for solar and wind energy support at the University of California in San Diego fears the worst: ‘Innovation in the energy sector could slip into a major crisis’.”

"Anthony Albanese has delivered his strongest criticism of the prime minister yet, declaring Scott Morrison has a habit of being “loose with the truth” and blaming the media for reporting facts when he was uncomfortable with legitimate criticisms and questions. Albanese, who has banned his caucus from using the word “liar” when referring to Morrison or government MPs, said Morrison’s latest deflection of Australia’s climate record was part of a “pattern” he had developed when asked uncomfortable questions.  Morrison used his time on the world stage at the United Nations general assembly to declare Australia was being unfairly maligned for its climate record, blaming the media for “misrepresenting” his government’s actions. Emissions in Australia have continued to rise since the Coalition took power in 2014 and abolished the carbon price installed by the Gillard government. In one of his first signals since becoming opposition leader that he was prepared to muscle up against Morrison, Albanese said the prime minister’s rhetoric did not match the facts. “What we’ve seen from the prime minister is downplaying the seriousness of climate change,” he said. “What we’ve also seen is him dismissing the concerns which young people have about climate change. “What we’ve also seen is him blaming the media for reporting the facts. And there’s a pattern developing here, whereby Scott Morrison is loose with the truth. “We saw that when he dismissed the fact that he has said at least 17 times about Sam Dastyari – characterised him as Shanghai Sam – and he said that that never happened. “We’ve seen that with regard to his dismissal of legitimate questions about whether he tried to organise for Mr [Brian] Houston to get an invite to the state dinner which was rejected by the United States administration, due to concerns that arose from the inquiry into child abuse that occurred here in Australia. “He can’t just dismiss questions from the media. “We have a prime minister who is … now trying to say that any questioning of the government’s record on climate change and the need to reduce emissions is a product of the media, rather than accepting responsibility as the prime minister of Australia.” Albanese’s stronger stance comes amid frustrations from within his caucus that Labor is not doing enough to “take the fight” up to Morrison, as the party finds its groove under a new leader after the federal election loss. A review of Labor’s policy platform is under way as part of a review into the party’s performance during the May poll, which includes Labor’s much mooted 45% emissions reduction target by 2030. While opposition MPs remain skittish about committing to any continuation of the policy platform Labor took to the last election, fierce debate has raged within the party about remaining focused on climate change. Albanese upped the attack on the Morrison government record on Thursday, but did not expand on Labor’s plans. “The government is not doing enough to tackle climate change,” he said. “They dismiss people who are concerned about climate change, including young people. They dismiss the facts on what is happening with regard to our renewables. “They dismiss the concerns that the business community have, when they say they’re crying out for a framework which would give them the certainty to invest into the future.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe excellent SOLARKRITIK.de here  brings our attention to a very recent clip of Hans Schellnhuber in an interview with ZDF German Public television (July 3, 2011). Note how master-planner Schellnhuber just cannot control his itch to rewrite international law.

Again climate lies from Professor Schellnhuber
He now claims that the 2°C limit of global warming, which is the invention of Schellnhuber’s own junk science at the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Crackpots (PIK), is “Völkerrechtlich anerkannt“, i.e. in English: “recognized by international law”. Here’s what the man Schellnhuber said:
The emissions of the global greenhouse gas, CO2, must again start to sink globally at the latest by 2020, otherwise we will have no chance of reaching the 2-degree C limit recognized by international law – the Earth’s warming must be limited to 2°C.
At the 19 sec. mark, the video repeats “das Völkerrechtlich anerkannt 2°C”  a number of times just so listeners can be sure they heard it right.
That the 2°C is recognized by international law is a flat out lie, a fantasy of Schellnhuber’s growing desperation. It is not international law. The 2°C limit is, however, one of the cornerstones of his masterplan to transform society.

"The activist Greta Thunberg has urged Justin Trudeau and other world leaders to do more for the environment as she led half a million protesters in Montreal as part of a global wave of “climate strikes.” The 16-year-old Swede met privately with the Canadian prime minister but later told a news conference with local indigenous leaders that he was “not doing enough” to curb greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. “My message to all the politicians around the world is the same. Just listen and act on the current best available science,” she said. Thunberg generated headlines around the world earlier this week with her viral so-called “How Dare You?” speech at the UN climate summit, accusing world leaders of betraying her generation. The teenager has inspired millions of youths, drawn to her cause by her passion and a mature, committed rhetorical style that belies her young age. She has also drawn mockery from some, including Donald Trump, who tweeted sarcastically that “she seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”. Without naming the US president, Thunberg said she didn’t “understand why grown-ups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead”. “We’ve become too loud for people to handle so people want to silence us … We should also take that as a compliment.” Trudeau and other Canadian party leaders took a breather from a tight election campaign to join Thunberg at the Montreal rally – along with around 500,000 protesters, according to organizers. Walking with his wife and children, Trudeau mingled with a boisterous crowd that brandished placards reading “Respect Mother Earth” and “Make America Greta Again” – a riff on a campaign slogan popularized by Trump, a noted climate change skeptic. One man was tackled by security when he appeared to lunge at the prime minister, while 13-year-old Annabelle Vellend broke out in tears when she spotted Thunberg, telling AFP: “I really believe in Greta’s movement.” “She is doing amazing things and it’s great that she’s able to press politicians to act on climate change, during an election,” she said. In his first term, Trudeau cast himself as a champion in the fight against global warming, but his green image was tarnished by his nationalization of an oil pipeline to salvage the construction project after years of delay. The prime minister said after meeting Thunberg and pledging to fund the planting of 2bn trees: “I agree with her entirely. We need to do more.” Earlier this week, the Liberal leader vowed that Canada would reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, joining 66 other countries that have already signed on to the pledge. Last Friday, more than 4 million youths – and adults – rallied in “climate strikes” around the world. Turnout at events a week on was smaller, but still vocal. In Italy, hundreds of thousands of young people took to the streets while an estimated 40,000 protested outside New Zealand’s parliament. In Canada, events also attracted huge crowds in the capital, Ottawa; in Toronto; and in several other cities. In the heart of the giant Montreal march, Alexanne Lessard stood out in her tree costume. “I’m here for our future, to show our government that we the majority want to do something and that they can take big steps that will an impact,” she said. Daphnee Choquette said she came out for her baby girl, whom she carried with her. “It’s too late for us [older people], but not for them. We need to bring about change now,” she said. • This article was amended on 30 September 2019 to remove a reference to the Montreal climate marchers being predominantly children."

"Your article (Just 1% of passengers take one-fifth of all flights from England, 25 September) included a discussion on the option of applying a frequent flyer levy to help reduce emissions from aviation. It should have mentioned that precisely this proposal was adopted by the Liberal Democrats at our recent conference. As we said in our policy paper, Tackling the Climate Emergency, we would “reform air passenger duty for international flights to target the most frequent flyers. The duty level would be set at zero for the first flight and increase progressively for each subsequent flight in a given year … Everyone currently flying would still be able to afford to fly for occasional holidays, or for family reasons, but wealthy frequent flyers would pay more.” Any serious plan for reaching net-zero emissions has to tackle emissions from aviation. The omission of any mention of flying (and other sources) from Labour’s plans for reaching net zero by 2030 raises major question marks over their feasibility.Duncan BrackVice-chair, Liberal Democrats’ federal policy committee • Your report makes much of the growing contribution of the aviation industry to the climate crisis. What a shame, then, that so many Guardian Holidays – including river cruises, railway journeys and holidays in Scotland and the Isle of Man – involve at least one flight.

"Prince Harry has said the science on the climate crisis is undeniable as, led by Greta Thunberg, the “world’s children are striking” to force action. The Duke of Sussex is in Botswana helping to create a new forest habitat after decades of deforestation because of locals gathering firewood and through elephant activity.  Speaking on the banks of the Chobe River, he referred to the speech by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, at the UN general assembly in which he warned that the world had seen unprecedented temperatures. “This week, led by Greta, the world’s children are striking. There’s an emergency. It’s a race against time and one which we are losing. Everyone know it. There’s no excuse for not knowing that,” he said. “And the most troubling part of that is I don’t believe there is anybody in this world who can deny science, undeniable science and facts. “Science and facts that have been around for the last 30, maybe 40 years, and it’s only getting stronger and stronger. “I don’t understand how anyone in this world, whoever we are – you, us, children, leaders, whoever it is – no one can deny science, otherwise we live in a very, very troubling world.” Prince Harry, whose use of private jets has led to criticism and accusations of environmental hypocrisy, was working with a conservation organisation helping locals to create a nature and cultural park for the community. He shared the strain with a group of men to get a 10 metre (32ft) baobab tree into the ground, then joined young schoolchildren planting mahogany saplings. He was accompanied by Dr Mike Chase, conservationist and founder of Elephants Without Borders, which will manage the new reserve with the aim of creating a thriving riverbank forest. Harry also met youth leaders from his Sentebale charity, which supports young people affected by HIV, at a health centre in Kasane. On a highly personal note, Harry spoke of how Botswana had offered him a place to escape following the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. “Fifteen years I’ve been coming here, it’s a sense of escapism, a real sense of purpose … I have some of my closest friends here over the years. “I came here in 1997 or 1998 straight after my mum died, so it was a nice place to get away from it all. “I feel deeply connected to this place and to Africa,” he said."
"George Monbiot (Rewilding will make Britain a rainforest nation again, Journal, 25 September) makes a timely call to reforest large areas of Britain. However, he is rather dismissive of tree-planting schemes which, based on our experience in Devon, do not have to be as he describes. Instead he wants to allow natural regeneration. Leaving aside the fact that it is slower than planting trees (and for the climate’s sake we need some speed here), there are also problems with promoting regeneration. As shown by the excellent work of Jed Kaplan and others, deforestation in northern Europe, including Britain, started as long as 3,000 years ago. By the time of the Norman Conquest, different areas of southern Britain had between 0% and 40% of the original cover. Many of the deforested areas in Britain today are not under agriculture or grazing, nor kept bare for shooting. Undoubtedly woodland or forest would be the climax vegetation in these areas, but they are still not wooded. One of the main reasons is wild grazing animals that are part of the current ecosystem. If we really want to reforest by “natural” means then we will need to deal with this in some way.John BryantTopsham, Devon  • I share George Monbiot’s misgivings about tree-planting and plastic, but I wish he would treat the 200 generations of humans who have left evidence of their life and work in our uplands with some respect. They mostly had a gentle and symbiotic relationship with nature, being part of it themselves. Their tangible relics are our cultural heritage, of equal importance to us as sentient thinking beings as the so-called natural heritage. Burning and grazing are essential to keep such heritage visible and accessible for the inspiration of present and future generations. Julian Glover’s Landscapes Review is remarkable for its almost total lack of discussion about cultural heritage. Until this is given equal weight with “natural capital”, serious errors will continue to be made regarding management of national parks and other uplands.Tom GreevesChairman, The Dartmoor Society, 1998-2019 • While in general I have a lot of admiration for George Monbiot, and his recommendations regarding regeneration of native woodland and rewilding, I do not think people, especially young people, should be discouraged from planting trees. I belong to the Woodland Trust, which both encourages new tree-planting, and helps preserve old and threatened woods and forests throughout Britain. I have taken part in several such activities, and have never helped plant trees in straight rows. While plastic tree guards are used, they protects the young trees from predatory rabbits and deer, and are removed when the trees are big enough to withstand such attacks. These mass tree-planting events encourage children (and adults) to get out into their threatened countryside, and relevant areas near towns, and to take action to help mitigate against climate change. The trees that they and we plant now will be mature when the rest of us oldies are dead. I don’t want my grandchildren to look back and say “they knew what to do but they didn’t do it”. Join the Woodland Trust’s Big Climate Fightback on 30 November and plant some trees for the future of the planet.Rose HarvieDumbarton, West Dunbartonshire • George Monbiot shouldn’t scoff at individuals’ “tokenistic” efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. Without them we would all still be walking around clutching plastic carrier bags and single-use drinks bottles. I can only imagine the opprobrium that would be heaped upon us by him then.Julia DraperBath • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Paul Homewood shows how PBS cooks the books to give the appearance that the USA is having a hot year when in fact it’s just another run of the mill year.
================================================================

Record Breaking High Temperatures – What’s Really Behind It?
By Paul Homewood
America’s Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is keeping track each day of the number of high temperature records being set in the USA. As at 30th August they reckon the year-to-date total was up to 4779. The clear message is that “temperatures must be getting hotter”. But is this so? Are matters as simple as they appear? We need perhaps to start by looking at the methodology employed.
PBS are using data collected by the NCDC from official stations only (not volunteer stations). They go on to say: “In order to make it into our count, a recorded temperature must either tie or exceed a previously recorded temperature on that date in a previous year”. In other words they are not just recording all time highs or even highs for a particular month, just highs for that particular day. So, for instance, a heat wave that lasts 2 days could set 2 records even if the second day was not as hot.
PBS also state – “NCDC records go back for many stations as far as the mid-19th century”. To the extent that this is true, very few record low temperatures would be set given the fact that the 19th century was a particularly cold era. However, as we shall see later, this is such a misleading statement that it borders on being dishonest.
USA 2011 35th warmest – nothing unusual
Before we look more closely at PBS’s numbers we should have a quick look at the overall temperature record for the USA in 2011. From January to July, 2011 ranks only 35th warmest in the last 100 years according to NCDC data.
However this year has perhaps been slightly unusual, with the Northwest being relatively cool and the South and East being warmer than unusual, so averages do not tell the whole story.
Out of the total of 4779 record highs so far, 718 occurred in July, a figure slightly above the average monthly figure of 597. I have broken down this July number and find that 42 record highs are in Kansas. Again this seems to be a representative sample. According to the NCDC map, Kansas July temperatures were “much above normal” but not as hot as Texas and Oklahoma, see here.
Double counting in Kansas
The mean July temperature for Kansas was 84.8°F this year. This ranks 5th warmest in the last 100 years with 1934 the hottest at 86.7. 1936, 1954 and 1980 also had hotter Julys. In other words, although this July has been very hot in Kansas, it is certainly a long way from being the hottest, see here.
What do the 42 record temperatures for Kansas tell us when we look at them more closely? There are 20 official weather stations in Kansas of which 19 appear to be at airports. Record temperatures, however, have only been set at 8 of these. All of these 8 stations are airport based. Two of these are in Topeka and so are arguably double counted! These are listed below:
Location – Year first operational
Dodge City Regional AP – 1942
Emporia Municipal AP – 1950
Garden City Regional AP – 1939
Hill City Municipal AP – 1948
Olathe Johnson Co AP – 1978
Topeka Billard Municipal AP – 1948
Topeka Forbes Field AP – 1942
Wichita Mid Continent AP – 1953
http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwDI~GetCity~USA
Many “record setting” stations do not even go back to the 1930s
We can see immediately that the claim that “many stations go back to the 19th century” certainly does not apply to Kansas. More importantly none of these date back to the mid 1930s when July temperatures were much higher than now. (Topeka Billard is listed as starting in 1932. However the actual records start in 1948), see here.

Although none of these stations go back prior to 1939, there are earlier records available at other locations that are very close to some of these stations. These records show that in most cases higher temperatures were recorded either in 1934 or 1936. These alternate stations are typically less than 4 miles from the current station and the metadata show similar conditions such as altitude.
Out of the 23 “record highs” set at these 5 stations in 2011, 16 were lower than previous highs set before the station became operational. Only 30% were genuine highs or 1.4 per station. (It is possible of course that some of these records were also exceeded in years prior to 1934).
When we analyse the July temperature for these stations further. It is clear from this analysis, regardless of the parameters used, that July in both 1934 and 1936 were significantly hotter than July 2011.
Siting effects
There is one further matter to look at. What effect have airport siting or other UHI effects had on the long term temperature trend at these sites? Taking Topeka as an example, I have identified 4 other weather stations nearby which are not based at airports and are in smaller towns. They are all certified USHCN COOP stations and have continuous records dating back to 1936. Their metadata and geography are summarised below.

TOPEKA
No station changes since 1932.
Station situated 410 ft from runway
Topeka has a population of 127,000 but the airport is 4 miles out of town.
HORTON
The station is based at a water plant and has been in the same location since 1983.
Population of 2000.
Horton is 42 miles from Topeka.
PAWNEE CITY
The current station is within a mile of its site in 1936 with no significant change in altitude.
Population of 1000.
77 miles from Topeka. (Pawnee City is actually in Nebraska, but is closer to Topeka than most other comparable Kansas sites).
LAWRENCE
The current station is 2 miles from the 1936 site. Both sites are within the town.
It is also now at an altitude 145ft higher than in 1936 which will have a small effect on temperature differences.
Population is 66,000.
Lawrence is 40 miles from Topeka.
LEAVENWORTH
The current station is within 1 mile of the 1936 site and both were situated in the centre of town. As with Lawrence there has been a slight altitude increase of 80 ft.
Population is 38,000.
41 miles from Topeka.
Temperature comparisons between 1936 and 2011 show:
 
In other words, Topeka has become significantly warmer relative to the “rural” sites at Horton and Pawnee City. Both maximum and mean temperatures show a divergence of between 3°F and 4°F. Interestingly the medium sized towns appear to be consistent with Topeka in terms of maximum temperatures (particularly when the slightly higher altitudes are factored in), which suggests that the UHI effect in these towns is similar to the airport effect at Topeka. (As the airport is 4 miles outside town the UHI effect of Topeka’s larger size is probably not significant). There does not appear to be any logical reason, though why mean temperatures at Leavenworth and Lawrenceare relatively cooler.
So what can we conclude?
1) Over the US as a whole, 2011 has so far been barely warmer than average. In no way can it be remotely described as “hot” as implied by PBS.
2) As forKansas, July, although much warmer than average, is only the 5th warmest in recent years and 1.9F cooler than 1934.
3) The only stations in Kansas where records were set in July are all airport based and date back no earlier than 1942. Alternative stations confirm most of these “records” are lower than previously set in 1934 and 1936.
4) Where records are available back to 1934, they show that temperatures in both 1934 and 1936 were considerably higher for the month as a whole than 2011. This is true for average maximum, average mean and high maximum.
5) Comparison with rural stations suggest that airport siting and possibly UHI have had an upward effect on temperatures since 1936 of as much as 4F.
Paul Homewood
Note and References
1) The following alternate stations were used to establish temperatures in 1934 :-
a) Emporia1S – 4 miles N of airport.
b) HillCity1NE – 2 miles SW of airport.
c) Olathe3E – 4 miles NE of airport.
d) Topeka2 – 4 miles W of airport.
2) All individual station data has been obtained from the Individual Station Original Forms available from NCDC. http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/mpp/freedata.html#FREE
3) The comparison between rural and airport stations is unaffected by any TOBS considerations.  Temperatures at all stations used for this exercise were logged around sunset in the 1930’s and all 2011 ones at 7.00am. Therefore any TOBS adjustment will be essentially the same at rural and airport.

Germany has put the shutdown of all its nuclear reactors on the fast track since the Fukushima accident. Finally, Germany’s Renewable Energy Revolution to rescue the planet from nuclear power and climate-killing CO2 emissions appears set begin in earnest, at least that’s what the climate rescue heroes would like to believe.
Unfortunately for the renewable energy cheerleaders, and the enemies of fossil fuels, things are in reality developing quite differently globally and even in Germany. For example, China is putting one brand new coal power plant online every week, and will do so for the next 40 years. Now, suddenly, Germany looks poised to crank up its coal power capacity too. Edgar L. Gärtner at eigentumlich frei has a commentary called: Energy Revolution” – The New Age of Coal“. The climate fantasy rescuers aren’t going to like it.
Since Germany has taken 8 of its nuclear reactors out of operation since April, 2011, its energy supply now stands vulnerable. To keep the lights from going out, which is a real prospect should a very cold winter day befall Germany, old coal plants are now being brought back to operationability in order to serve as “cold reserve capacity”. Gärtner writes:
This confirms what independent specialists have been predicting since the ‘energy revolution’ was announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel: Instead of the rise of the promised “Age of Renewable Energies“, the nuclear phaseout will lead to a Renaissance of coal and (to a small extent) natural gas.”
Indeed, even ultra-green Germany is going back to coal. And Gärtner adds:
There are lots of signs indicating the age of coal as a resource for electrical power generation is actually just getting started.”

//-->




And anyone who doesn’t believe this is probably listening to too much German public media news, or is in chronic denial. Gärtner explains:
According to the most recent Statistical Review of World Energy of oil company BP, one of the most reliable sources of energy market data, coal consumption has increased by almost 50% over the last 10 years alone.”
And during those same 10 years, global temperatures have plateaued, or even fallen slightly, depending which data-set you’re looking at. Gärtner continues (emphasis added):
Such a rash increase has never been seen before. China and India alone account for 90 percent of this increase. Coal’s share of global energy generation has almost reached 30% and is now as now at 1970 levels. At 48.2% almost half of the world’s coal consumption is by China. Plans by China’s leadership provides for a coal power expansion of 600 gigawatts by the year 2035. Also in western countries coal consumption increased in the year 2010 by 5.2%, the most since 1979.
So why is coal burning gaining so fast? The answer is economics and science.
Global coal reserves are huge, enough to last an estimated 1000 years according to some estimates. Moreover the fuel is easy and cheap to extract, transport and use. And because there are now 7 billion people on the planet to sustain, its low price means that it is a real life-saver, one that can be relied on and does not depend on the weather. Thus only the most ignorant, or most tyrannical, of politicians would sit on mountains of coal and allow citizens to freeze to death in the wintertime.
Now that climate science is uncovering that CO2 is indeed a minor climate driver, the use of coal should be allowed unabated. Indeed science is showing more and more that coal is by no means a climate killer, but a human life-saver.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPortuguese blog Ecotretas here reveals how the IPCC completely botched its forecasts for East African rainfall in claiming the Horn of Africa should expect more precipitation. With severe drought now ravaging the region, the IPCC forecasts and models are beginning to look like a complete farce.
Deadly drought and famine hit East Africa (Chart source: USAID)
Lately we have all been hearing about the serious drought that has been causing misery in impoverished East African countries – especially Somalia with tens of thousands of deaths, and some 750 000 expected to die in the next four months, Ecotretas points out that “one would imagine that the IPCC would have predicted it” with their multi-million dollar super computer models and “leading scientists”. Well, it turns out they indeed made forecasts back in 2007, but today just the opposite is occurring, i.e. instead of getting more rainfall, as was forecast by the IPCC, rainfall has all but disappeared.
Ecotretas looked up what the IPCC projected for Eastern Africa in its 4th Assessment Report of 2007. For example in Chapter 11 of the Executive Summary:
There is likely to be an increase in annual mean rainfall in East Africa.”
On page 869, in Chapter 11.2.3.2 (emphasis added):
The increase in rainfall in East Africa, extending into the Horn of Africa, is also robust across the ensemble of models, with 18 of 21 models projecting an increase in the core of this region, east of the Great Lakes.”

So much for the ensemble of models. Surely one can only conclude that the claims made by the IPCC’ models concerning global temperatures for the next 100 or 200 years simply can no longer be taken seriously. Read more at ECOTRETAS here.
 
A host of other institutes parroted the IPCC bogus forecasts
It was not only IPCC scientists who were completely wrong with East African rainfall projections, but also a number of other institutes and organisations got it all wrong – probably because they only parroted the junk scenarios put out by scientists like Mike Hulme.
Ecotretas presents a collection of more rainfall for the African Horn here, which includes Christian Aid in the UK in 2009, International Livestock Research Institute  in 2010, The World Bank in 2010, the Institute for Environmental Security in January 2011, and the Grantham Institute for Climate Change in 2009, which claimed:
In eastern Africa, including the Horn of Africa, and parts of central Africa average rainfall is likely to increase.”
When are people going to stop listening to these charlatans?

European winters seem to have gone through an alternating warm-cool –warm- cool cycle since the 1940s and now appear headed for a cooler cycle like the 1962-1987 period.

A LOOK AT THE MORE RECENT WINTER TEMPERATURES 1998-2011
European winter temperatures have been cooling more recently since 1998, and especially 2009-2011.

European annual temperatures warmed from 1998-2007 but have started to cool over the last 3 years in a row since 2008.

SUMMER TEMPERATURES 1998-2010
On the surface, European summers seem to be getting warmer since 1998. However the higher warming summers of 2003, 2006, and 2010 were all preceded by or affected by an El Nino, just before or as the El Nino partly happened during these summers. So the extra warming may be due to a natural El Nino cycle. If one discounts these  El Nino years, the summer temperatures are quite flat and show no real base warming  due to global warming. For more detail information on El Nino years see the NOAA site http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov.

HISTORIC MEAN WINTER TEMPERATURES FOR BERLIN, GERMANY – IMPACT OF THE NORTH  ATLANTIC  OSCILLATION
For those Europeans who still believe that their climate is primarily affected by human generated carbon dioxide, the graph below illustrates that the NAO level seems to be a much more significant cold winter factor affecting temperatures in Berlin, Germany. The temperature data is from GISS Station Temperature Data and NAO data is from CGD’s Climate analysis Section of Jim Hurrell http://www.cgd.ucar.edu. According to the NOAA:
The NAO consists of a north-south dipole of anomalies, with one center located over Greenland and the other center of opposite sign spanning the central latitudes of the North Atlantic between 35°N and 40°N. The positive phase of the NAO reflects below-normal heights and pressure across the high latitudes of the North Atlantic and above-normal heights and pressure over the central North Atlantic, the eastern United States and western Europe. The negative phase reflects an opposite pattern of height and pressure anomalies over these regions.”

FINAL COMMENTS
There is nothing in the above graphs and figures that would warrant the drastic reductions being planned for carbon dioxide emissions and the extremely expensive green energy options being planned by Europe in light of the most difficult economic environment that exists in Europe and the globe. Surely there are much more pressing problems that confront the world and Europe than solving an apparently non-existing problem that is only speculated to exist 100 years from now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing various stories about sea level rise. Some alarmists even claim that it’s accelerating and coastal locations could be drowning in water by the end of the century, if not sooner. So I decided to make quick check of the data myself.
I took a sampling of 21 randomly selected locations scattered all over the globe and checked their respective sea level trends (not satellite data) to see what is happening. The following map shows the locations:

As you can see, the points are scattered all over the globe. The idea is to take a random representative sampling – much like a quality engineer who takes a random sampling of raw material from a bulk tanker truck arriving at a factory.
What follows is the corresponding list of the locations with the sea level trends measured by the NOAA.
Location  –  rate in mm per 100 years  –  observed most recent rate trend
1. Ketchikan, Alaska  (-19 mm/100 yr) – steady drop
2. San Francisco, CA. (+201 mm/100) – slowing down
3. Honolulu, Hawaii (+150 mm/100) – slowing down
4. Kwajalein, Marshall Is. (+143 mm/100) – speeding up
5. Piladelphia, PA (+280 mm/100) – steady rise
6. St. Petersburg, FL (+236 mm/100) – slowing down
7. La Libertad, Ecuador (-122 mm/100) – steady drop
8. Cristobal, Panama  (+141 mm/100) – slowing down (last 10 years)
9. Cananeia, Brazil (+420 mm/100) – speeding up
10. Argentine Is, Antarctica  (+172 mm/100) – slowing down
11. Newlyn, UK (+171 mm/100) – steady rise
12. Tenerife Spain (+153 mm/100) – steady drop
13. Walvis Bay, Namibia (+33 mm/100) – steady drop
14. Simons Bay, S Africa (+159 mm/100) – speeding up
15. Karachi, Pakistan (+48 mm/100) – steady drop
16. Cochin India (+137 mm/100) – steady rise
17. Legaspi, Philippines (+522 mm/100) – slowing down
18. Sydney Australia (+59 mm/100) – slowing down
19. Fremantle, Australia (+148 mm/100) – slowing down
20. Wellington, New Zealand (+241 mm/100) – slowing down
21. Hosojima, Japan (-53 mm/100) – steady drop
For example San Francisco sea level is rising at a rate 201 mm per 100 years and the latest trend shows that sea level rise is slowing down.

Here are the results
– Steady drop: 6
– The rise is slowing down: 9
– Speeding up: 3
– Rising steadily: 3
Do you see any red flags? The average of the 21 NOAA measured trends is 147 mm/100 years (6 inches). This is a far cry below the IPCC projected 22 inches for the next 100 years.
Most of the sampled locations are dropping or the sea level rise is slowing down. Only at 6 locations is the rise steady or speeding up. The Marshall Islands show a speeding up, but Pago Pago, American Samoa shows a decline.
Clearly this random sampling of locations shows no signs of any accelerating disaster. To the contrary, it indicates that sea level rise is most likely slowing down.
This is a preliminary check only, and of course much more data would need to be crunched to make a final conclusion. But from the preliminary check, we can safely say that anyone who claims that SLR is accelerating is probably just a charlatan who is trying to get more funding.
Concerning satellite data, someone really ought to check the calibration of the satellites.

The scam is falling apart, bit by bit like a cake out in the rain. Hat-tip: http://climatedepot.com/. No wonder some “climate science” characters are resorting to desperate acts. I wonder how the media feels about all this. They used to view themselves as so high and mighty, and now nobody is listening to them.
According to the UPI here, emphasis added:
Three-quarters of Americans say natural disasters are on the increase, but fewer than ever believe the climate is heating up, a new poll finds.
Only 44 percent say they ‘believe the theory‘ that carbon dioxide emissions are warming the Earth, down from 51 percent in 2009 and 71 percent in 2007, but most movement has been into the “not sure” column.”
That means the number of people who believe the theory has dropped a whopping 27% in just 4 years. After all that indoctrination and disinformation, this is their result. And to think that us skeptics are only getting warmed up!
The hoax is over folks. Stop acting like it aint.

In a piece titled Under Deniers, science publicist Dirk Maxeiner writes about how dissent over any politically touchy topic in Germany is increasingly being suppressed lately: by applying the label “Leugner” (denier).
Especially when one considers what Germany went through during its history, I find it appalling that a person’s right to speak up and to exercise dissent here would be suppressed in that particular manner. Sadly, that is exactly what is happening now whenever someone expresses a “different opinion” on any politically sensitive topic, especially climate change.
So just how are climate dissenters being regarded here in Germany? Among some: like criminals. Maxeiner describes how:
Whoever even quietly doubts this or that aspect of catastrophic global warming finds himself in no time at all in the company of those on the dock of the Nuremberg trials, or of Bishop Williamson and Ahmadinedschad. It is as if the denial of a crime in the past could be compared to the doubt over a feared future catastrophe.”
Well, this is pretty much what’s happening in Germany. How often does we hear the term “climate change denier” in the “debate”?
In Germany it was just on the anniversary of Kristallnacht last November when a group of leading German Green Parliamentarians (Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Jürgen Trittin etc.) sent a brief query to Chancellor Angela Merkel demanding that she explain how someone in her party could have the gall of meeting with “climate change denier” Fred Singer.
The query contained the term “denier” at least 7 times, once in the title, 3 times in the introduction (once even personally calling Fred Singer, who is Jewish, a “climate change denier”), once in point no. 6, once in point no. 10 and once in point no. 11 (see here). It is all documented.
But to Germany’s credit, for whatever it’s worth, this brand of science bullying was not it’s own invention, but more so appears to be of American origin. The German Greens seem to be content to use it for all it’s worth. Maxeiner tells us how the real groundwork was prepared:

To do this, it was first necessary to equate modern industrial societies with the Holocaust. For the climate protection apologist Al Gore ‘the evidence of an ecological Kristallnacht is as clear as the shattering of glass in Berlin.’ For well-known American climate scientist James Hansen one has to ask the question when one views the calving of glaciers: ‘Could the the sound of breaking ice masses serve as a Kristallnacht to wake us up?’ Regarding coal trains, he found it appropriate to comment: If we don’t succeed in stopping the construction of new coal power plants, then these are death trains that are no less gruesome than the trains that rolled into the crematoriums.’ For the last remark, he at least apologized.”
And let’s not forget Dave Roberts (of Grist) and his notorious comment:
When we’ve finally gotten serious about global warming, when the impacts are really hitting us and we’re in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage, we should have war crimes trials for these bastards — some sort of climate Nuremberg.”
In the end, all this rhetoric has served to label climate science dissenters as criminals on par to Holocaust deniers. In Germany the term “denier” has lately become the fashionable weapon of the politically correct in attacking opposition, and so it is no surprise that it is being widely used here for a number of other issues, like the recent shooting spree in Norway and criticism of Islam. Maxeiner writes:
Claudia Roth of the Green Party speaks of ‘denying the reality of Islam’ when addressing critical views of Islam. Magazine Der Spiegel, always one to use the latest word-trends and to not miss a single beat, concocted the magic term: ‘Islam-denier”.
And today anyone who expresses criticism of the euro now risks being labelled a “euro-denier”.
So speak at your own peril. To dissent is to “deny”, which is now being associated with crimes of the worst kind. One has to remember that in Germany there is little debate on climate change. The dissenters are an extremely small minority and have very few resources. The risks of speaking here up are very real.
As for me – the more they try to shut us up with this kind of bullying, the more I’m going to bring up their crude examples.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve all heard about Hans Schellnhuber’s masterplan for the Great Transformation of society, from one powered by “climate killing” fossil fuel energies to one powered by gentle, earth-healing renewable energies.
Well, it turns out that the Great Transformation would likely end up being the Great Transfer-mation – of private wealth!
The online Die Rheinpfalz here  reports that if Germany succeeded in shifting to renewable energy, it would cost each German household €800.00 per month, or almost €10,000 ($13,000) per year, this according to calculations by physicist Gerd Ganteför of the University of Konstanz.
What benefit would all that money possibly lead to? Firstly, lots of government interference in private lives. Secondly, maybe a few undetectable hundredths of a degree Celsius of less warming. Indeed no endeavour in human history would cost so much and yet deliver so little to society as a whole. Thirdly, it would make (and has made) a few people outrageously rich.
Online Die Rheinphalz writes:
Covering the entire German energy demand of 2500 billion kwh per year – that includes heating, transportation and a large part of industry – with green technology would be impossible says the expert of the University of Konstanz. That would entail additional costs of 800 euros per household per month, and that is unaffordable,’ says Ganteför.”
But that’s not the way a group of green zealots see it. They actually believe we can’t afford not to take the unaffordable path of green energy, otherwise the earth will burn up. And a lot of interest groups and industries are just salivating over the prospects of such a massive transfer of wealth. Indeed many slimy European politicians from all parties have vested interests in green energy.
Ganteför points out that these extreme costs would not be bearable, and so they would lead to massive reductions in the use of electricity by private and business consumers, and so lead to a…:
…considerable change of lifestyle for every individual. Individual transportation and business production would have to be massively scaled back.”
But this is precisely what these green zealots want (IMHO). They want humankind to move back into the mud, to be completely humiliated – and to get very rich while inflicting the pain.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMay 2011 - SLR = 3.1 mm/yr
Portuguese skeptic website Ecotretas sent me the following story about rising sea levels awhile back. Seems the more sea level rise slows down, the more the alarmists claim it is accelerating (Sorry about the poor visual quality of graphics).
More hiding the decline
by Ecotretas
The University of Colorado has done it again! Despite the fact that sea level has been going down for the last year, they are saying that sea level rise rate is going up! You can see it with your own eyes in the graphics below.
In the first graph above, was generated last May and shows sea level going up 3.1 mm/year (sorry about the fuzzy quality). I debunked that at the time, because the University of Colorado introduced an artificial correction of 0.3 mm/year.
The second graph that follows was produced in July, just 2 months later, and they have applied more adjustments corrections. Note that all the newly introduced points are below the trend-line, so it should be diminishing… But no! It went up from 3.1 mm/year to 3.2 mm/year!
July 2011 SLR= 3.2 mm/yr
They give a reason for the correction: Although the latest Jason-2 GMSL estimates (cycles 95-102) are well below the trend line, most likely due to the recent La Nina (we plan to add a sea level/ENSO comparison page shortly), the rate increased slightly from 3.1 to 3.2 mm/yr due to the improvements to the TOPEX SSB model and replacement of the classical IB correction with the improved DAC correction, as noted above.
So, once again it’s about the models, and not the real data! To figure out this nasty science, I’ve graphed the difference between the two first graphs.
Plot of the difference
Clearly, all data points are pushed up. Big differences appear until 2002, which get below 10 mm between 2002 and 2005, and get even bigger after 2005.
The black line, which is a linear regression trend for all the data points, clearly shows that the correction introduces a rising trend!
The sea level rate measured by satellite should now be somewhere near 2.8 mm/year, and that is still clearly above what is being measured by tide gauge stations. One more example of hiding the decline!

That means start kissing German green jobs good bye. Yet another Soviet-style propped up industry begins to bite the dust.
According to co2-handel.de here, rising raw material prices on the purchasing side, falling prices on the sales side, falling market demand, and reduced subsidies are spelling big trouble for the once booming German solar industry.
Solarworld, based in Bonn, did better than most other German solar companies. For the first 6 months of 2011 it recorded a profit of €22.4 million, but that was down significantly from €34.8 million for the same period last year. Half-year sales plummeted 12% to €535 million.
Hemorrhaging red ink – production moving to Asia
Konstanz-based Sunways AG’s 2nd quarter sales collapsed from €64.6 million to €38.7 million during the first half of this year, posting a loss of €2.5 million euros.

Things were even worse for Conergy. According to CO2-handel.de, the Hamburg-based company lost €41 million in the first 6 months of this year compared to a profit of €5 million for the same period last year.
Bavaria-based Phoenix Solar extended its losing streak, posting a loss of €21.1 million compared to a loss of  €18.7 million for the same period last year. Sales plummeted 61% to €140.8 million.
Q-Cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen plans to shut down a large portion of its solar cell production at facilities in Bitterfeld-Wolfen and shift it to Malaysia in a bid to stem the hemorrhaging red ink. CO2 handel.de writes about Q-Cells:
Production capacity in Germany is to be scaled back by 50%.”
Asian manufacturers are now flooding markets with cheap modules. Solarworld director Frank Asbeck expects 8 gigawatts of over-capacity from Asia.
The flood of red ink is occuring despite government subsidies, which however have been scaled back this year. Face it without the still generous subsidies, the figures would be much worse. And despite the low-priced cells coming from Asia, it’s still a lousy way to produce energy – especially in gray and rainy Germany.

"Stella McCartney would be on trend this season whatever she put on her catwalk. Two decades after the designer launched her brand, the climate crisis is forcing the fashion industry to accept the principles of sustainability and respect for the environment that are central to her beliefs, and McCartney finds herself promoted from fashion’s fringes to a leadership role. “It’s been an incredible fashion week for me, seeing how the climate crisis has become so explosive in this industry. Suddenly everyone is talking about it,” she said backstage at Paris fashion week. This season, instead of a note explaining the inspiration behind the collection, she gave each guest a timeline detailing innovations in sustainable fashion over the past 19 years. “I hope the timeline shows that some progress is being made. Things need to change immediately, but we also need to stay positive and hopeful. If you scare people so much that they are absolutely terrified, you can’t engage them. They need to feel they can make a difference.” The night before the show, McCartney hosted a roundtable discussion on sustainability at the Palais Garnier show venue. Members of Extinction Rebellion and a founder of Bolt Threads, a Californian biotechnology company producing lab-grown silk and other fabric, took part in a discussion alongside environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertran, and animal rights activist and actor Maisie Williams. Her years of attempting to enthuse the industry about the environment before it became fashionable have made McCartney a dab hand at sexing up sustainability. The catwalk show was accompanied by grainy video footage of zebras and hippos having sex, to a sultry soundtrack of Donna Summer singing Love to Love You Baby. The Stella vibe being very much on trend, it made good business sense for this collection to focus on the looks for which the brand is best known. So there was soft-power tailoring, a staple since McCartney’s days as a trainee on Savile Row, in shades of peach, toffee and soft, unbleached white. There were 1970s-bohemian denim skirts, and silk blouses with scalloped edges. Amber Valetta, who had taken part in the previous evening’s sustainability discussion, wore a moss-green silk trench, while the wildflower prints on silk dresses came from photos McCartney took on bike rides through the English countryside. With recycled polyester, organic cotton, regenerated cashmere and handbags made of sustainable raffia or second-life plastics, it marked the brand’s most sustainable collection to date. “But I hope that when you watch the show you don’t even notice that, actually,” the designer said backstage. “I hope that it’s just desirable and beautiful and luxurious.” The brand has partnered with resale company TheRealReal in a deal which incentivises McCartney’s designer shoppers to participate in the circular economy by reselling their purchases. “We spend a lot of time on fabric technology, but the circular economy is another huge part of the story,” said McCartney. “The youth of today, really they should be wearing vintage and secondhand clothes, and looking at renting clothes - and they are absolutely doing that. Fabric innovation, combined with this youth culture - it’s exciting.” But despite her championing of the circular economy, McCartney is expanding the brand. Backstage after the show, alongside her father, Sir Paul, and fellow fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, she was joined by her new business partners, the Arnault family who control LVMH. In July, one year after having bought back full control of her brand from her initial backers, Kering, McCartney announced that she was partnering with LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury house. She remains majority shareholder, but the deep pockets of LMVH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, bring the opportunity for accelerated growth. As part of the agreement, McCartney holds the role of special adviser on sustainability to Bernard Arnault. Natalia Vodianova, longtime favourite model of McCartney and wife of LVMH scion Antoine Arnault, did not appear on the catwalk this season but sat front row in a new-season Koba coat. Made from recycled polyester blended with a corn byproduct, Koba is a breakthrough in faux fur, a process that previously relied on environmentally damaging petroleum-based products."
"I was delighted to read Daniel Boffey’s article on hitchhiking (Hitchhiking revival given the thumbs up to cut emissions, 28 September). I do hope this may catch on in the UK. I have been thinking for some time that we need a campaign to bring back hitchhiking. Many years ago (before the death of Castro) I had a holiday in Cuba. There was a severe fuel shortage, due to the US blockade. There, we were told, it was an offence not to pick up hitchhikers. Travellers could buy a token which they gave to the driver who redeemed it to help to pay for the petrol. Could such a system, or the Brussels one, catch on here? We could make a start if we all began hitchhiking, and revealed why. Perhaps we could carry a sign with our desired destination and “cutting emissions” clearly on it?Mary BrownStroud, Gloucestershire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterTough day for the German press yesterday, reporting the story about the Kaufmann et al 2011 paper, which looks at what’s behind the 10 years of no global warming. Read more here at WUWT . The day before that, signs of warming were everywhere, the media said. Then a day later they all say there hasn’t been warming in 10 years. Go figure!
Here’s a look at what some various newspapers and weeklies have written:
Der Spiegel writes:
China’s sulphur emissions put the brakes on climate change
Climate paradox: The atmosphere contains more and more carbon dioxide, but the temperatures did not go up to 2008. Scientists explain it with the phenomena of burning dirty coal in China. Foremost the sulphur contained in the coal compensates for the greenhouse effect.”
But Der Spiegel then warns of the consequences of China cleaning its emissions!
This is no reason to cancel the alarm for the future. The earth could be facing a phase of especially rash warming: when solar activity picks up again and emerging countries like China reduce their emissions of air pollutants like sulphur.”
Die Welt writes:
Why global warming has not occurred up to now
Climate scientists repeatedly warn of global warming – but: So far it hasn’t shown up.
Scientists warn everywhere of global warming. But today there is no trace of it.”
Die Presse writes:
Is warming taking a break?

A renown scientist says the stop in temperature increase can indeed be explained. The enormous increase of the emitted CO2 since 1998 has come for the most part from coal power plants in China. Starting in 1998, there was no global warming for 10 years, from 2005 to 2008 it was even 0.2°C cooler.”
Die Zeit writes:
China’s coal gives global warming a break
Despite the immense CO2 emissions, the greenhouse effect took a break from 1998 to 2008. Sulphur emissions, La Niña and a tired sun are responsible.”
The Financial Times Deutschland writes:
Solar cycles and coal power plants cooling the earth
China as the climate rescuer? Indeed the increasing coal consumption – in addition to other effects – has contributed to making global warming weaker than feared earlier. But the future temperature increase could be that much stronger.”
The Handelsblatt writes:
Environmental pollution puts the brakes on warming
Despite the increasing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, the earth has hardly warmed over the last 10 years. Scientists say various factors are responsible, among them dirty coal and the solar cycle.”
Right! Now coal causes cooling. And the sun has an impact, too. I wonder if these scientists are ever going to make up their minds.
Most of the leftist papers simply ignored the story, and so their faithful readers will continue being completely stupid and oblivious.

"Scott Morrison has made his first visit to the United States as prime minister. It was a trip that included a close encounter with the unpredictability of the Trump White House, a foreign policy pivot, and a backlash about a lack of climate policy action. Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, travelled, with the prime minister. Here is what she witnessed:  We’ve been positioned at the White House since 5am, watching the sun creep over the American capital. Security is as laborious as you’d expect. Dogs sniff bags, then the secret service guys have a good look, passports are collected, checked and returned, White House passes and pins are distributed, and then at last we clear the metal detectors. Eventually we make it to the press briefing room, the small blue one, famous through several presidential administrations but now abandoned by Donald Trump. The modest proportions don’t fit his presidency. Now it’s just a transit zone. We are greeted by a blond woman in a broad-brimmed hat. June, a self-described southern belle, is receiving visitors in the briefing room, although it’s not clear why. She identifies herself as a fellow scribe working for Christian radio and television in Nashville. When she’s not reporting on the Trump White House, she’s rallying Christians for the president. This seems something of a line cross for a reporter with White House press accreditation – but we’ve been on the premises for about 10 minutes and it’s clear that we’re not in Kansas any more. On the other side of the building, visitors are streaming across the South Lawn to grab prime positions to witness The Donald receiving The Scott at the official welcome. Flags, American and Australian, are held aloft on a glorious summery day. Eventually we are permitted to wander down to the lawn as well. The Donald’s grass is lush and slightly dewy, making me regret my choice of footwear. The daylight is now dazzling but the bucolic scene is disturbed by Austin rebuking Steve in the media pen. The confrontation happens just before the splendidly peppy pipe band strides across the lawn for the ceremonial welcome. I’ve never met Austin before this moment but he looks about 30, buttoned down and watchful as a raptor – a White House wrangler who looks as though he hasn’t sat down, eaten anything apart from a protein bar, or slept more than four hours straight a night since early infancy. Steve has transgressed and Austin convenes a short, sharp show trial in front of me. I’ve nabbed a prime position on the fence in the media pen right in front of the entrance, and I don’t intend to move unless the secret service guy standing beside me gets feisty. “You left the media area to make a call,” Austin says, voice appropriately low so as not to disdain the Wonderful Occasion swelling around us. Steve is older than his accuser and possesses the rumpled look of a longtime print or news wire reporter. I’ve never seen Steve before either, but he’s clearly part of the White House press pool and looks like a man disinclined to small talk. My guess, from my quick scan of the body language, the suppressed inner sigh, is that Steve has seen a number of Austins in his reporting lifetime, perhaps a small production line of them, and is not much gripped by this power play. Steve says nothing. Austin persists. In a minute we are going to go full Veep. “The secret service told me you left the media area to make a call – is this correct?” Steve, at the end of his tolerance for J’Accuse now, delivers his mic drop. “Yah,” he says. “One of the secret service guys held back the rope so I could get out to make the call. I needed to take the call.” I suspect Austin doesn’t really know where to take this from here. The aide returns to the front of the fence, shoulders back, eyes front. It’s showtime. Trump strides out of the White House with Melania. From my vantage point they look like a pair of Easter Island statues. This is my first encounter with the current leader of the free world and my curiosity is intense. How will Trump look uncut? Will he look how he does on television, with that weird affect – the pursed lips, narrowed eyes and nose and chin set to an upward inflection, indicative of defiance and displeasure? Or is this a posture he adopts only after he pulls on the presidential onesie every day and heads for Fox News, purring “ready for my close-up Mr DeMille”? I discover this is how Trump looks all the time, or at least all the time he is in open space. He’s striding to the podium with exactly that look, with Melania, who is a dignified presence yet strangely devoid of life force. Perhaps she laughs and sings and dances in her track pants like no one is watching in her private domain but, in public, Mrs Trump looks like a perfectly proportioned doll in a doll’s house. Over the next little while, Trump will lavish praise on Melania for her crack presidential spouse skills. The first lady, Trump reports over and over during the course of Friday, “worked so hard” on the table settings for the state dinner, pondering every detail. The flowers, the centrepieces, so wonderful, so beautiful. The best table decorations anyone has ever seen. It’s hard for me to imagine the reality of the first lady’s life, what it must be like to agonise over centrepieces for state dinners amid the sound and fury of her husband’s bitterly contested presidency. Given her reserved public presence, it feels like an impertinence to wonder. There’s no time for whimsy in any case, because the Morrisons are now on the premises, ready for their induction into the Trumpiverse. In comparison with the Trumps, Scott and Jenny Morrison, from the Sutherland shire, Australia – more latterly of Kirribilli House – look like a well-to-do couple from the suburbs. They are earthed in this big moment, respectful of the tradition they are now associated with, the tradition of Washington’s special friends being drawn to the nation’s bosom. Presumably they are buzzing with anticipation and anxiety, given that the unofficial White House weather forecast for Friday is clear skies, a light breeze and a high probability of catastrophic cyclone once their delegation reaches the Oval Office. Looking normal in this environment takes some doing, but the Morrisons manage. The troops march, and are duly inspected; the visitors clutch their flags, which flutter gaily in the breeze. The anthems are played. The two couples appear content with each other and the scripted remarks they share with each other and the crowd. Just before the conclusion of the formalities, Austin is back working the fence line to move us, lickety split, to the holding pen outside the Oval Office. Fortunately, the war with Steve seems to have subsided. I wash up near Steve and the other White House wire reporters. One of the group explains to me that Steve is the man if they want to get a question to the president. Trump will answer Steve. It’s unclear why that’s the case, and I don’t ask. She also gives us tremendously helpful advice: Trump will be on for a rave when we get in there. We are surprised by this. Our assumption was we’d be in and out in a matter of minutes. Our river guide shakes her head. Trump, she says, is in an expansive frame of mind. Best we prepare some questions. She also predicts that Trump will struggle to understand our accents. If he doesn’t understand, the president will say: “Say it.” This means ask the question again, she says. I assume this is some sort of weird in-joke until I hear Trump do just that. “Say it,” Trump says, narrowing his eyes and curling his lip. It’s utterly peculiar, but it’s an earworm. Once you hear it, it’s hard to get the locution out of your brain. Say it. The door of the Oval Office swings open and we are thrust into pure madness. The media scrum feeds off the static electricity in the room. It heaves like a wave. Our questions crash on the shore. Thud, thud, thud. Mr President. The Americans in the pool want to know about Joe Biden and the Ukraine controversy – a story that will spiral towards impeachment during the week of our visit. No American journalist gives a crap about Australia, and Morrison, and the second state visit to Washington of this febrile presidency. Fun fact: Emmanuel Macron, back when he imagined he had a talent for Trump whispering, was the first to be afforded the honour. But who cares? Conventions are devalued in the coarseness of politics in 2019. No one pretends to care. Everyone just has to emerge with what they need. Once we realise this is going to be nuts – a small blazing blitzkrieg at the seat of American power with no rules of engagement – Australian reporters also start hurling questions across a range of topics. Trump looks delighted by the disorder. It’s where he thrives. Morrison shifts in his seat. The president lays into the media. We are hopeless, finished, friendless. But Mr President, what about the call? Did you speak to Ukraine’s new president? It was a beautiful call. Next question. Say it. The Morrisons sit tight as the stiff westerly blows. The prime minister isn’t visibly alarmed but he’s hyper alert. Jenny Morrison composes her face into a placid mask – until Trump suddenly raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and Iran. I catch her eye at that moment and she startles, ever so slightly. Her eyes, to me, say “help me”. I catch Morrison’s eye a couple of times and the corners of his mouth crinkle. I am a spectator at this circus but the prime minister isn’t permitted the luxury of distancing. Morrison is a peer of the president, a leader of a respectable middle power who has chosen, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd puts it with just the right squeeze of lemon during our visit, “to play ball with the Mad King” – to give friendless Donald a friend. The prime minister, unlike us, enjoys the benefit of knowing what Trump really thinks on a range of fronts; he has that baseline to keep him tethered through the rhetorical turbulence. But back in the nosebleed seats we lack those insights. During our 33 minutes in the Oval Office, Australian journalists are on a rollercoaster, hanging upside down, while the president indulges a dialogue with himself about whether to launch a military strike against Iran, or whether restraint is the better course. He lands eventually at restraint but the disorientation is so profound it takes me a while to process that’s where we’ve landed. Eventually Trump stops feeling all the feelings and we are herded out. I ask one of my fellow travelling reporters whether the president just raised the prospect of nuclear attack, because I fear the sleep deprivation might be messing with my cognition. He’s as knocked around as I am. Yes, he thinks so, but he needs to listen to the recording. TV reporters are wondering out loud how on earth they are going to distil what just happened into a package. How do you do this in a minute and a half? At the height of my disorientation, I spot Paul Murray from Sky’s Fox News lite after-dark crew at the back of the room. As we are guided out, Morrison beckons Murray forward and introduces him to the president. This introduction yields an exclusive interview with Trump which includes the simpering question: “What do you want to say to your many Australian supporters who wish you nothing but the best in November 2020?” I suppose it could have been what was his favourite colour. Paul Murray gets his exclusive with ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ but talk about not asking the hard questions. pic.twitter.com/5QnxMW5cHh The madness persists. The day ends with wranglers trying to facilitate some access to the state dinner, which is al fresco, in the Rose Garden. As we are herded through the South Lawn accompanied by the lilt of violins serenading guests and the murmur of clinking glassware and small talk, a secret service guy in night goggles, with foliage in his helmet, suddenly materialises from the bushes and sprints across in front of us. Shortly after this our White House wrangler declares this walk off the record, which generates considerable confusion among the scribes. How can a walk to a pool position be off the record? Which bit is off the record? This walk never happened? How do we explain our capacity to bear witness to events at the state dinner? Did we parachute in? We resolve not to overthink this and press on, and eventually get close enough to see the guests drifting around the Rose Garden: the Australian billionaire box maker Anthony Pratt is hard to miss with his shock of orange hair; the younger Murdochs are there, Lachlan and Sarah, I reckon I’ve spotted the mining magnates Twiggy Forrest and the generally reclusive Gina Rinehart, who appears to be floating. I rub my eyes, fearing a fancy. Perhaps Rinehart is not floating, more likely I’m swaying, peering through a large shrub, sleep deprived and smacking the mosquitos that threaten my ankles, questioning my life choices. I see Rinehart again the next day, floating (she is definitely wafting like a cloud, because I know I’m no longer swaying) into a soiree at the Australian ambassador Joe Hockey’s residence, in a white dress with sequins and what appear to be pom poms trailing at the back. Morrison’s old chief of staff and new department head, Phil Gaetjens, by contrast, is wandering around in a Wallabies rugby jersey with cut-off sleeves. While the grandees mingle, Rinehart sets up court with her entourage in a shaded corner of the garden on what looks like a sedan chair, but is actually just a garden settee. The visual cue is Ms Rinehart is receiving guests, as long as they are not journalists. The media mogul Kerry Stokes is also said to be mingling but I don’t clap eyes on him. In Hockey’s garden I strike up a conversation with an expatriate pub owner who is now the mayor of Annapolis and is campaigning to tighten gun control. Gavin Buckley, formerly from Western Australia, is an avuncular Democrat at a Republican knees-up, a fish out of water who can’t quite believe his luck. Buckley tells me he hugged Hockey for the great honour bestowed upon him. The whole scene is F Scott Fitzgerald meets the pre-woke capitalism of the 1980s, and the humidity is sending us all bonkers. Servers hand out party pies and sausages with disturbing names like cheese and Vegemite, and bald men in linen sports jackets compete for shade. One of our travelling media pack then proceeds to conduct a mock interview of a new magnolia tree which has just been planted to celebrate the Morrison state visit. With the Magnolia, this is Brett Mason, SBS News. It’s a joke, hijinks to help us stay alert when we are hitting that hour of the day when jetlag threatens to take your legs out. But we’ve crossed the sense barrier and we haven’t even hit the Trump rally. What could possibly go wrong? It’s a voyage with billionaires, this American excursion with Morrison. I confess that this is new territory for me. The cashed-up and politically connected drifted past us during the pomp and circumstance in Washington, and now we are closing in on Anthony Pratt as we speed to Wapakoneta, first airborne and then jammed in Morrison’s motorcade with police cars racing past, sirens blaring, to stop traffic on the freeway. Morrison, who will be thriving on all this hard work and energised by the thought that he might be called upon to pull things back from the brink, is upbeat during a quick amble down the back of the plane. He wonders what we have made of the Oval Office. “Two words,” I shoot back. “How good?” The gaggle of Morrison staff tumbling in and out of black vans in the motorcades, and standing glassy eyed at midnight in hotel foyers, clutching their phones and wondering what day it is, look in reasonable shape despite the fact that most of them won’t have slept much. Team Morrison and senior bureaucrats drift in and out of our orbit, leaving us mostly in the hands of a crack team of departmental minders. These officials, particularly the logistics people, are always the unsung heroes of these trips. The wranglers on this trip are outstanding. The pace is punishing – at times it feels like early in the Kevin Rudd era. The transitions are down to the second and there are no screw-ups, at least none that are visible to us. One of Morrison’s press secretaries, Nick Creevey, has joined us for the sprint to Wapakoneta on the commandeered Dayton school bus. We’re all practising the pronunciation of Wapakoneta. Wah-pa, Christ, how do you spell this bloody place again? Katina Curtis, the meticulously prepared Australian Associated Press reporter, is patient with the spelling drills. Hey Katina. How do you spell … There are few female journalists on this trip, and overseas voyages, in my experience, tend to take on an Aussie barbecue dimension. This is a generalisation but, as generalisations go, not an unfair one. Male correspondents largely herd together, socialise together, crack jokes together, reinforce one another’s insights, and women run on a parallel track. It’s a strange dynamic at times; stranger because the blokes who engage in the behaviour would be entirely unconscious that’s what’s happening. It’s just custom, or muscle memory. Hashtag road trip. Hashtag dudes. Dayton to Wapakoneta is flat and rural. The billboards we pass are a combination of fast food temptations and Jesus Christ, saving the born and unborn. I’m both fascinated to learn what we are driving into and mildly apprehensive, given that Trump rallies can be hostile to the media covering them, and hackles in the base must be raised by the latest mainstream media pursuit over Trump and Ukraine. The president loves a persecution narrative with him at the centre of it – it fuels the righteous rage of his supporters. Everyone can be aggrieved together. Nobody in the PM’s entourage expresses any apprehension at all about Ohio, not even a hint of it. But my instinct suggests they are also worried about the unknown. There are risks in the look of this thing. Should Morrison really be at a Trump rally (even though the Ohio event is more complicated than a 2020 campaign whistle stop with Morrison attached). Apart from the possibility of any bizarre, indefensible off-piste business, there is also the risk of Trump banging on and on and on. It is entirely possible scheduled remarks at the opening of a box factory could stretch into a Castroesque monologue that kills our logistics stone dead. Morrison’s crew had expected the Oval Office encounter to last for a few minutes and instead it stretched, putting them behind for the remainder of the day. I filed a column describing our arrival into Wapakoneta and the rapturous welcome the locals gave Trump, but there were some other memorable moments behind the scenes. When Trump and his entourage finally blow in to town in a blaze of police sirens and secret service agents, we are reunited with the same White House press pool we met on Friday outside the Oval, grinding through another event. I clock Steve in the distance, kicking on. Trump engages Pratt the minute he’s in the factory. The two billionaires exchange lavish compliments as they amble towards the gaggle of reporters. Presumably the box maker is explaining recycling to Trump as they go. Rubbish in, box out, cash in. The president then tracks towards where the journalists are corralled behind the fence, straining to get an iPhone snap for Twitter. He’s looking for Steve, the Trump whisperer, because he’s got exciting information to share. “So that’s 100% recycled paper into a really, fine finished product,” the president enthuses on the fence line. “It’s really amazing, Steve. They start off with …” Trump pauses delicately … “can I use the word ‘garbage’?” Pratt is entirely comfortable with the word. Pratt Industries, Ohio, is proudly euphemism-free. Trump picks up the story: “They start off with waste, garbage, and they end up building it into a – making it into really great cardboard and paper.” “A hundred per cent of the plant”. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve never seen Steve before these couple of brief encounters, he is a complete stranger to me, and what follows is pure speculation, but I’m going to hazard a guess that he knows what recycling is. I reckon Steve does know about it. Trump is another story. Possibly this impromptu recycling-for-dummies tutorial is just the president being performatively didactic, or perhaps he is inoculating himself from cable TV hysterics who might associate reuse with One World Government. Or perhaps this is the first time in his life he’s encountered recycling. Trump continues to roll this newfangled Pratt magic around in his mind, and engage journalists enthusiastically along the fence line. “That’s really some equipment. The finest equipment in the world. And more and more people are going this way. “Normally, you take down trees and you make the paper. In this case, Anthony does 90, 95% out of waste, out of garbage, and they make incredible final product through a very – through really a very – a really costly but efficient process.” He could be describing the interface between tycoons and politicians but let’s not be caustic or labour the metaphor. We need to continue with our story. Emboldened by this level of engagement from the president, one of the Australian journalists calls out: “Do you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt, Mr President?”. Trump is confused. Say it. (Implied, not stated: louder visiting freak, take two.) Say it. “Do you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt to invest in America like he has?” Trump narrows his eyes. “Yeah, well, we have some good ones. But this man is number one in Australia, they say.” Number one of course, being the highest Trump accolade. That and apex predator. Pratt returns the favour before we leave America. He tells the Australian newspaper Trump is going to win in the 2020 election. Lest this just appear guesswork, or another shovel load of obsequiousness, history shows that Pratt has a sharp eye. In the last presidential contest the billionaire box maker bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton. Asked whether he’d make the same bet again, Pratt reports that he’s raised the stakes. There is now $2bn on the table – investments in new paper operations in the US. “I told the president we want to continue to invest and fulfil our pledge,” Pratt tells the paper. “It was very gracious of him to come to our Ohio plant opening. I was fortunate to spend some time with him. He was as gracious as ever.” Gracious indeed. As another wealthy entrepreneur, Malcolm Turnbull, was once fond of saying. What. A. Time. To. Be. Alive. By the time we roll out of Chicago – a whistle stop characterised by a serious foreign policy pivot from Morrison, and an unfortunate photo opportunity in front of a McDonald’s smart board that built a visual bridge to Engadine for people familiar with the infamous internet meme (let’s just leave it at that) – and on to New York, the drumbeat is cacophonous, literally and figuratively. It is leader’s week at the UN general assembly, and the area around the headquarters is locked down. The streets teem with protesters and delegates, and groups of Africans gather on Forty-fourth Street to drum and sing. The UNgeneral assembly circus drives New Yorkers bonkers, the streets are gridlocked and the eateries overflow, but the vibrancy of it is quite wonderful: the convivial murmur of languages on the east side of Midtown, the colour and style of the clothing, the downing of late-night whiskey amid animated conversation. Trump declares theatrically, with Nancy Pelosi closing in, during his address to the UN national assembly, that this is the time for patriots, not globalists. It’s a soundbite crafted for Breitbart or Fox News, potent with his rusted-ons, but a hollow slogan in the world of facts and evidence. Did I miss the bit of history where globalisation became optional? For what it’s worth, New York categorically ignores him. On the streets, in the stores, in the financial district, globalisation prevails. It’s not even a contest. Beyond the literal, the figurative drumbeat is for Trump. Impeachment is closing in on the president. Some commentators say he looked subdued at the UN, which would be a rare lapse in self-confidence. The mood at the start of the week in Washington was come and get me suckers. But I’m out of the presidential orbit now so I have no first-hand observation to report. Morrison, comprehensively overshadowed by movements in the tectonic plates of the major powers, ploughs on diligently with his UN program and seems unperturbed by the misfortune of his two mates, Boris Johnson and Trump, hitting some serious turbulence. If the prime minister had any regrets about taking hospitality from Trump and aligning Australia’s diplomatic language precisely with the president on some thorny geopolitical issues, he certainly didn’t show it. A certain defensiveness did creep in on climate change, though. Morrison wasn’t cranky but there were persistent pesky questions from the travelling media about Australia’s lack of policy ambition, and about his decision not to attend the UN climate summit on Monday. Even Trump called by. Why didn’t Morrison? There was the sound of prime ministerial teeth being gritted. Interestingly, Morrison’s speech to the UN general assembly, which was billed initially as being an address about practical environmentalism, not climate change, drifted back into climate. There was a significant chunk defending his government’s policies, and some umbrage at the media for feeding false narratives – not fake news, mind you, but stoking prejudicial sentiment. In New York we meet our final billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes. The final piece of my triptych, the next gen mover and shaker, moves in different circles to Pratt and Rinehart. MCB didn’t make the cut for the state dinner at the White House, evidently, but he made a bit of a splash at the UN. The Atlassian founder went to the climate summit to commit his company to a target of net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Cannon-Brookes nudged Morrison on Twitter: “Please give us a future we can believe in tomorrow. Inspire us. Lead us. Don’t bullshit us. I’m happy to help, as are millions of Aussies.” I meet Cannon-Brookes at the Flower Shop, a hipster bar on the Lower East Side. His minders invited us down for a beverage. Most of my colleagues are punctual but I’m late, because the traffic is terrible, and the bearded tech entrepreneur lobs late as well. There is an overwhelming smell of weed that eddies through the bar as we settle in, which I stress is not connected to anyone in our group or Atlassian’s. I don’t know who is responsible for this licentiousness and don’t intend to investigate, frankly – but it’s surreal, meeting a thirty-something billionaire in a bar as the bookend of this bonkers week, and having the bar reek of marijuana – that I find it hard to stop laughing at the unlikeliness of it all. It caps off the Through the Looking Glass sensation of the US odyssey. The evening is convivial and, unsurprisingly, there is much impassioned talk about climate change and energy policy and a fair sprinkling of acronyms – a bunch of Aussies jousting good naturedly about the future of the planet in a bar in Manhattan. I leave Cannon-Brookes downstairs shooting pool with a few stayers, settling in to welcome the dawn, and head uptown, clearing my head by walking up Forty-fifth Street as the dumpster trucks and the street sweepers move into high gear for the pre-dawn cleanse. I engage a cop at a checkpoint just to make sure I haven’t veered wildly off course in a desperate bid for oxygen. “The Roosevelt is just up here,” I inquire, “right?” The cop smiles and sips his coffee. “I’m from Brooklyn, m’am.” Support our independent journalism with a one-off or recurring contribution"

"A Swedish newspaper has announced it will stop taking advertising that promotes fossil fuel-based goods and services with immediate effect. The editor of the daily Dagens ETC said the decision was “crucial for our credibility”. He urged other media outlets to consider doing the same.  The ETC, which launched in 2014, is a daily paper and online newspaper. Its editor-in-chief, Andreas Gustavsson, said the decision was taken by the owner, the board, the marketing department and the 25 editors and reporters on its staff.  He said the decision would hit the paper’s finances. “But I am also convinced that this will prove to be a wise decision in the long term,” said Gustavsson. “I am very aware that the media industry is extremely tough and it is difficult to survive financially. However, the climate crisis affects every single one of us.” He added: “How far can journalism go when it is bankrolled by forces that have everything to gain from blocking large-scale action to address our climate crisis?” Dagens ETC, based in Stockholm, has about 10,000 daily subscribers and more than 60,000 unique readers a week, according to Gustavsson. Its funding comes from a mixture of reader subscriptions, advertising and the government support offered to papers across Sweden.  Gustavsson said the paper’s revenue from advertising amounted to more than 1,000,000 Swedish kronor (£85,000), of which 15-20% had previously been from advertisements they will now decline. The decision comes after the biggest mass climate protest in history took place around the world last Friday, with further demonstrations expected this Friday. The UN climate summit in New York met in an effort to inject urgency into governments’ pledge to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement. In May the activist group Extinction Rebellion wrote an open letter to advertisers and agencies urging them to use their powers to tackle the climate emergency. Some agencies responded this summer by setting up the Creatives for Climate movement, pledging to avoid working on fossil fuel briefs."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe climate change train left the station long ago. Someone needs to tell Romney and Christie because they look awfully silly standing all alone there on the platform, waiting for the train to come. It left long ago with hardly anyone getting on it – just some Europeans and a few panhandlers.
The leftist German daily TAZ reports (bemoans) here that the Kyoto Protocol is dead, this according to former UN Climate General Secretary Yvo de Boer in an interview.
On getting a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, TAZ quotes de Boer (emphasis added):
The spirit of the Kyoto Protocol has disappeared. Its body is being artificially kept alive and perhaps some of the organs may get transplanted. But we have to admit that the Kyoto Protocol is dead.”
This, de Boer says, can be traced back to a lack of political will.

Politicians obviously have come to realize that implementing Kyoto-brand policy is far more risky than alleged climate change itself. The hoax has been exposed, the science discredited, and the tide of public opinion has shifted since Climategate rocked the climate science community in late 2009, causing the Copenhagen Conference and the global warming hypothesis as a whole to crumble to pieces. Resuscitating the climate patient failed – it’s dead on arrival.
Kyoto countries today represent only 20% of the world’s CO2 emissions
Indeed de Boer says the remaining Kyoto countries represent only 20% of the global CO2 emissions, down from 55% back in 1997. The air is out.
Yvo de Boer does not even believe a road map to a new Kyoto is possible.
We had a road map in Rio in 1992, in Kyoto, in Copenhagen, in Cancun. How many more road maps are necessary?”
De Boer favours incentives for saving energy rather than forcing countries to meet targets. But that would only mean more government meddling in markets. Best way out would be to accept the science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman solar skeptic website SOLARKRITIK.DE here provides the background on the rundown, weed-covered solar facility in former communist (and now “green”) East Germany, which I presented in my last post here.

Solar panel field near Markranstaedt, Germany. Photo taken by Prof. Knut Löschke on June 26, 2011. Source: http://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/
It’s much worse than we thought. The story behind the above photo and the project itself appears here at the online Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper. The facility is sprawled over an area of 20 acres. The Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper wrote just before the facility went into operation:
‘The park is finally realized,’ beams mayor Carina Radon (CDU) nowadays, and praised the 7.5 million Euro investment. 36,300 modules will be installed in the weeks ahead. It will generate an annual amount of 2.7 million kilowatt-hours. The facility will produce a peak amount of 2722 kilowatts.
Wow! With that kind of performance, you’d think the facility would be well-maintained so that it could continue to generate cash – and so save the planet. Letting such investments go to hell is usually the last thing one does with a money making machine like that. The Leipziger Volkszeitung article writes:
The solar park saves the environment an emission of 34,500 tons of CO2 and one expects it will be in operation 20 years.”
20 years? As the date of the article shows, the park was set up in December, 2009 – much less than two years ago. Now it is already overgrown with weeds and on the verge of being useless. Your subsidies at work, folks. The green economy – Germany’s job engine!

This photo also shows that the solar park in no way delivers electricity maintenance-free, as the green lobby likes to claim.
The author of the photo provided the following information along with the photo:
‘A rather large, obviously run down facility, which as one sees is overgrown everywhere. I took this photo on June 25, 2011 shortly before 6 pm as I happened to be driving by (and concerning our ‘renewable’ energy world, it certainly opened my eyes). Exect location: Markranstädt, intersection of Schkeuditzer Str. / Nordstraße.’
It goes to show you that nature cannot be controlled by man. They can’t even get weeds under control, yet they would have us believe they can regulate the climate? In my view, the above facility borders on criminal neglect.
Meanwhile Europe is planning a $600 billion monster solar facility in the SAHARA called Desertec. At least there it won’t have to worry too much about weeds. But what about dust storms, wind and other elements?
A clue of what can happen is provided by Solarkritik.de, which shows us a solar plant on top of an elementary school at Haltern-Flaesheim, Germany taken on 25 April 2011.

The panels on the above pictured elementary school are coated with a heavy layer of pollen and dust. I guess there’s a lesson here for school kids.
And here is another beauty of a solar facility in northern Germany. This is what they really look like after 20 years, photo from Solarkritik.de. Take a look at its condition. Everywhere cells are missing. Now it is out there decaying and its dangerous elements are likely leaking and poisoning the ground by now. Photovoltaic-park from 1989.

Readers are invited to write their own essays, submit them, and I’ll gladly post them. They should be kept down to 500 words or less. Also you can help by leaving tips and links to interesting stories in the reader comments.
This clandestine project I’m collaborating on is climate-related, and I’m sure the warmists are really going to love it. More later on that as things unfold.

"Tens of thousands of children and adults in New Zealand have stopped work and school on Friday to take part in the country’s third climate strike, billed as the biggest yet and the first display of “intergenerational” action. More than 40 towns around the country were holding marches with 260 businesses involved, including most of the country’s tertiary institutions. New Zealand’s strike was being held a week later than hundreds of thousands took to the streets in other parts of the world, including Australia, Britain and the US, because some high school students had exams last Friday. A open-letter signed by 11,000 New Zealanders was delivered to parliament on Friday morning calling on the government to declare a climate emergency – following the lead of numerous councils around the country. “Our representatives need to show us meaningful and immediate action that safeguards our futures on this planet,” School Strike 4 Climate national coordinator Raven Maeder said. “Nothing else will matter if we cannot look after the Earth for current and future generations. This is our home.” North Island organiser Sophie Handford, 18, told RNZ she hoped 50,000 people would march. “There’s way too much at stake to let it pass by. We’ll be at the doors of parliament many more times until we see the action that is necessary.” The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has taken a leading role on the global stage in the fight against the climate crisis, calling it her generation’s “nuclear-free moment”. Look at this massive wave of people in Dunedin, New Zealand! #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/8hFMAvRTGf In the keynote address of the Climate Change Summit in New York, Ardern took a characteristically optimistic tone, saying pessimism led to apathy. “You may well argue that, based on our current trajectory, now is not the time for optimism,” Ardern said. “But if we only talk about the loss of glacier mass or sea level rises we run the risk of a society that believes all is lost and that it is simply too late … it is not”. Under Ardern’s leadership New Zealand has set a goal of making the country zero carbon by 2050. Christchurch, NZ. #FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike https://t.co/k6252xPI2y In New York on Wednesday night she announced climate trade initiative that would remove tariffs on green technology and cut fossil fuel subsidies. It was announced along with leaders from Fiji, Iceland, Norway and Costa Rica at the United Nations, with formal talks expected to begin next year, with the hope of eventually achieving treaty status. “There’s an urgent and critical need for increased global action if we are to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels,” said Ardern. She added: “The case for using trade rules to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies is particularly compelling.” However, Ardern was criticised this week for failing to raise the topic of climate change in her first bilateral meeting with Donald Trump. New Zealand lags behind many other OECD countries in basic climate-friendly action such as recycling and dependence on petrol and diesel vehicles."

In the news Poland is holding firm against all the EU-climate rescue nonsense. According to the German site http://klima-der-gerechtigkeit.de/ (Climate of Justice!), climate protection is going to be increasingly problematic with Poland, who are now suing the EU Commission because of the EU’s conditions that will mean charging emitters for rights to emit greenhouse gases. After 2013, companies will have to pay for certificates. 95% of Poland’s electricity is generated using coal, and the country plans to build an additional 13 coal-fired power plants in the future, READ HERE, which writes:
Its heavy dependence on coal for electricity production is highlighted by a plan to build 13 new coal-fired power plants, for which the country obtained free “carbon permits” from the European Commission the day before it assumed the Presidency. ClientEarth, an environmental NGO, is reportedly attempting to bring the matter to court, arguing that such free allocations under the EU-ETS are not legal.”
Let’s hope Poland sticks to its guns and doesn’t cave in to the green suicide energy-pact that is being rammed through in Europe.

"Scott Morrison has defended Barnaby Joyce’s performance as his drought envoy, saying he was not asked to “write a book”, but provide “candid feedback” and any criticism was from people caught up in “semantics”. Morrison, who hopped off the plane from the United States following his official visit and on to another one to visit a drought-stricken Queensland community to announce a further $100m in drought funding, said Joyce had done his job and the issue had been “over-analysed”.  “Well Barnaby, when I appointed him to this role, provided constant reports I mean, I didn’t ask him to write a book, I asked him to give us some advice on what he was hearing from farmers and that is what he did, and he did that through quite a bit of correspondence with me, and regular meetings with me and he presented all of that to cabinet,” he said, while batting away flies in Dalby. “And that was his job. It wasn’t supposed to be an author and a publisher, it was candid feedback from drought-affected communities around the country, and he did his job and he did it well and I thank him and so I think people are getting a bit caught up in the semantics of a final report. “There were many reports, I can assure you of that, as there was from the national co-ordinator general, and we are working our way through that for a response to his suggestions as well. So I think people have over analysed that issue.” According to his own travel records, Joyce spent less than three weeks on the ground in drought-affected communities outside his own electorate while engaged as the prime minister’s special envoy on drought, including charging tax payers $2,600 for a charter flight to open a machinery field day, 300km from Melbourne. After David Littleproud confirmed he could not provide the parliament with Joyce’s report, as requested by Labor, as “he did not prepare a final report, and as such, no document exists,” the opposition went on the attack, declaring Joyce’s role to be a farce. Joyce angrily defended his work, and said he had sent regular text messages to the prime minister reporting what he had found. That seemed to surprise Morrison, who responded to a journalist’s question asking about the text messages with “well, you said text message, not me, I said he wrote to us, he presented reports . ..” before pivoting when told it was Joyce who had referred to text messages. “Well he did,” Morrison said, barely skipping a beat. “And Barnaby is a master of all forms of communication. He spoke to me on the phone, he spoke to me in my office, he presented to cabinet, he wrote me letters about this issue, which is what I asked him to do, so it was a pretty comprehensive set of advice that we received, and I was happy to receive it and it has informed much of what we have done.” Morrison would not say when any information on what Joyce reported would be provided, saying it was part of the normal processes of any other cabinet document. He said the parts of the additional drought package announced on Friday were crafted following Joyce’s advice, including the extension of the drought communities program, and additional funding for rural financial councillors and addressing weeds and pests, adding “I would say he was pretty optimal”. The additional drought funding was timed for Morrison’s arrival back in the country, with the prime minister having made reference to his Queensland trip in his final press conference in the US, in response to a question about what he had learnt about America during his visit. The PM was asked today what the most surprising part of his time in the US was and he answered by saying he is going to visit drought affected farmers In Australia ASAP. pic.twitter.com/l41DSt8YTZ Just over half of the $100m package will go to the Farm Household Allowance, which has been subjected to incremental administrative changes since Littleproud took hold of the portfolio governing it. The latest changes aim to continue to simplify the process, which enables assistance to be paid to eligible farmers, at the Newstart rate. Another $33m of the latest package will extend the drought community support initiative, which sees charities, including St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army, provide emergency financial support of up to $3,000 to eligible farmers. Charities are often used during natural disasters to administer funds, to ensure the money is provided as quickly as possible. The number of local government areas able to access federal government assistance for infrastructure, including for water, as well as provide mental health support for residents, was also increased. Anthony Albanese said while the latest support from the government would be welcomed by communities it was “too little, too late”, from Morrison. “He cut $3.9bn from the Building Australia Fund, and now he’s announcing that $100m of that $3.9bn is to be brought forward,” Albanese said. “We said at the time that [drought] legislation was being debated … that the $100m per year should not start in a year’s time. It’s not like the drought has just happened, it has been here for years, under this government’s watch and this is too little too late. But we welcome any assistance for our farming community. They’re doing it tough and it’s about time the government recognise that and act.” The National Farmers’ Foundation did welcome the government’s announcement, but said communities needed a “new approach”, repeating its calls for a national drought policy. “We need a comprehensive and enduring national approach to drought that focuses on preparedness and resilience measures. We need an approach that mandates the assessment of the effectiveness of drought measures and allows for improvements when measures fall short,” NFF head Tony Mahar said.“It’s absolutely crucial that we have a coordinated approach that ensures all voices are heard and that the responsibility of managing drought is shared across government, industry and community.” "

Today is World Liberty Day
Updated: 17 June, 5 p.m. CET
The above website I’ve linked to was set up in Germany as a project by liberty-enthusiastic individuals, led by Christoph Widenhorn of the German FREIHEITSWERK. Many people are not aware of this, and so I hope this spreads around a bit more. It is also supported by the Berlin-Manhattan Institute.

 These individuals are working to establish a Day of Liberty in Germany, and the world. The website is a 100% pro-bono project with no budget – all those involved are strictly volunteers. Sign up as a supporter!
I’m pleased and honoured to have helped out a bit in setting up the above-linked website. Take a few minutes to look at the different pages of the website.
Let your friends, family and other websites know about it. Here are just a few famous quotes on liberty and freedom:

The secret of happiness is freedom.
The secret of freedom is courage.  
– Pericles
For to be free is not merely
to cast off one’s chains,
but to live in a way that respects and
enhances the freedom of others.
– Nelson Mandela
Freedom is never more than one
generation away from extinction.
We didn’t pass it to our children
in the bloodstream.
It must be fought for, protected,
and handed on for them to do the same.
– Ronald Reagan
Liberty,
when it begins to take root,
is a plant of rapid growth.
– George Washington
As AGW-science skeptics know very well, freedom all over the world is always under attack. There are always people out there who think they ought to decide everything for us and run our lives. We see this, for example, in climate science as governments attempt to misuse it for the purpose of implementing intrusive bureaucracy, state-control and more taxation.
Take a few minutes to look at the website I’ve linked to above and help liberty take root.

"Young environmental activists in Italy are planning to miss school as thousands join climate crisis protests in major cities on Friday. Some 475,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number are expected to join the latest demonstrations in cities including Rome, Milan, Turin, Florence, Naples, Bologna and Bari. But only if they are allowed to skip school. Earlier this week the education minister, Lorenzo Fioramonti, urged schools to consider as “justified” the absence of children taking part in the mobilisation against the climate emergency. He said on Facebook the climate strike was “essential” for students’ future, which was “threatened by environmental devastation and an unsustainable economic growth model”. However, many schools are only obliging after receiving a letter requesting permission from parents and if the child has maintained good attendance throughout the year. David Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia, is planning to miss school regardless. Despite the high expected turnout, he worries that environmental issues are not yet a major concern for children and adults alike. “I would urge adults to join the movement too,” he said. “Unfortunately, it is not recognised as an official strike by labour unions. One day off work won’t change your career but it will change your future.” It comes as world leaders wrap up the UN climate action summit in New York. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, urged his counterparts against “indifference” as news emerged that a massive portion of a Mont Blanc glacier was in danger of collapse. “It must shake us all and force us to mobilise,” he said. Conte promised to make environmental action a priority in a speech before the new left-leaning government, a coalition of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Democratic party, was voted into power earlier this month. Although M5S had long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, the subject appeared to take a backseat during the party’s 14-month coalition with the far-right League. Sergio Costa, an M5S politician who kept his role as environment minister in the new alliance, has been more proactive, saying in New York this week that “courageous and revolutionary” policies were needed. The ministry is drafting a range of measures, including giving shoppers a 20% discount on supermarket goods that are sold loose in an attempt to cut back on plastic waste. Some 2.2m tonnes of plastic wrapping is discarded in Italy each year and in 2016 less than half of that was recycled, according to WWF figures. Pollution is also a major issue, especially in Italy’s northern cities. And while Italy’s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. “We hope the new government recognises the climate emergency and declares it so at the summit,” said Wicker. “We want them to divest in fossil fuels and invest in green energy resources, while improving public transport and make it more affordable.” The biggest climate strike in history took place last Friday, with several million people across an estimated 185 countries taking part. More than 2,400 separate strikes are expected globally on Friday, according to the group Fridays For Future. As well as Italy, especially large turnouts are expected in India, New Zealand, Sweden and the US."

================================
From: Ivar Giaever [mailto:giaever@XXXX.com]
Sent: Tuesday, September 13, 2011 3:42 PM
To:kirby@aps.org
Cc: Robert H. Austin; ‘William Happer’; ‘Larry Gould’; ‘S. Fred Singer’; Roger Cohen
Subject: I resign from APS
Dear Ms. Kirby
Thank you for your letter inquiring about my membership. I did not renew it because I can not live with the statement below:
Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the Earth’s climate. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide as well as methane, nitrous oxide and other gases. They are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and a range of industrial and agricultural processes. The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring.
If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth?s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.
In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible? The claim (how can you measure the average temperature of the whole earth for a whole year?) is that the temperature has changed from ~288.0 to ~288.8 degree Kelvin in about 150 years, which (if true) means to me is that the temperature has been amazingly stable, and both human health and happiness have definitely improved in this ?warming? period.
Best regards,
Ivar Giaever

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago I wrote about how German solar cell manufacturers are drowning in a sea of red ink, read here and here.
The latest to bite the economic bullet are a biofuel plant in Freiberg, and Germany’s E10 ethanol blended fuel.
Merkel’s Solyndra – Choren Industries GmbH goes insolvent
The online leftist TAZ reports here that Choren Industries GmbH located in Freiberg, Saxony is now insolvent. The plant was designed as a pilot for future plants in producing “sun-diesel” from wood waste and biomass. It was designed to produce 18 million litres of the “climate-friendly” fuel, the TAZ reports. It employs 300 workers.
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the plant along with a substantial entourage, before cameras, in April 2008. Unfortunately, the plant was never able to make a profit. The TAZ writes:
Indeed neither the manufacturing costs nor the technology appear to be controllable. Shell opted out already in 2009. Then VW and Daimler followed in July, and so insolvency was unavoidable. Approximately €100 million have been invested so far, €30 million of which were subsidies.”
It turns out that the entire project is not financially feasible and naive calculations had been made. Such a plant requires huge quantities of wood and biomass to operate. All the handling, power, equipment and effort needed to process the raw material ended up consuming much of the energy that was produced. The result: an economic fiasco. Your government masterminds at work.
Still, Germany does not allow itself to be easily deterred by a few green follies and failures. Indeed it is now building a 60 million euro pilot plant in Karlsruhe, insisting that more development is needed. But not everyone is convinced. The TAZ writes:
Biologist Stefan Klotz of the Environmental Research Centre in Leipzig is doubtful when it comes to the production of biofuel. The sun energy stored in biomass via photosynthesis is used with an efficiency of less than 1%. To grow extra plants and then to burn them is a ‘dead-end’.”

Germany’s E10 fuel debacle
Now add the E10 debacle. Awhile back Germany mandated that petroleum companies must blend in 10% bio-ethanol with regular fuel and to offer this so-called E10 fuel to consumers at petrol stations – all part of reducing CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, the government forgot to ask consumers if they had any interest in buying the low-grade stuff to begin with. As the online DIE WELT reports here, few people are interested in filling up with E10 fuel because of concerns the fuel could damage sensitive engine parts and lead to premature wear and expensive repair costs. DIE WELT writes:
The ADAC made headlines with a long-term test of an Opel Signum, which was rated as not being able to handle the E10 fuel. The conclusion: ‘E10 can be damaging’. After 27,000 kilometers of driving, according to ADAC Motorwelt magazine, the driver noticed an intense gasoline smell. The wall of the fuel pump was completely corroded.”
So adamant was the government about petrol stations selling the “environmentally friendly” fuel that it threatened to levy massive fines on companies who did not fulfil sales quotas. DIE WELT writes:
In the industry it’s already clear that the biofuel quota of 6.25% will never be reached.”
For Holger Krawinkel, energy expert of the Federal Association of Consumers:  it is already clear:
E10 is factually dead.“
And these people want to rescue Greece?
The more that Angela Merkel and the Greens try to take over and manage Germany’s energy industry, the more of a laughing stock they are becoming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore about More. Below is a short interview with Austrian rapper Kilez More.
More, 22, recently released a rap song/video called Climate Change (Climate Lies, Climate Swindle…), which features the IPCC, CRU and the hockey stick. Now how does a young rap artist know so much about such a complex issue, let alone write a skeptic rap song about it for the youth?
The song indeed is mobilizing the youth, not in masses, but it is a budding challenge. For that Kilez is becoming a sort of enfant terrible, persona non grata in Europe – who dares speak truth to power. I’ve since translated the German text to English, and Kilez has added the English subtitles to his Youtube video:

Of course it doesn’t rhyme in English – but it gives you the gist of what he’s rapping about.

Interview
The following is an interview with Kilez, about what motivated him to “take on the establishment”. He is an environmentalist fighting for cleaner air and water, eradication of poverty, animal abuse, etc. Some of his positions may be off the wall for some of us, but most of us will agree with his position that authority needs to be questioned, and that we ought not be complacent – especially young people on the subject of climate change.
————————————————————————————-
INTERVIEW
NTZ: Most young people your age aren’t interested in climate change. What sparked your interest?
KM: Like with many issues, I approached it by questioning the “official stories”. I do my best to research and make sure I get both sides of the story. When I did this with “climate change” I realized it’s mostly a hoax.
NTZ: When did you have your first doubts?
KM: It was years ago I think when I read a few lines about it in a book – and this increased my attention. It was written that the “Club of Rome” decided a long time ago already, before anyone ever heard about it, that “climate” would be the thing for the future. So I started to search for answers on my own and this quickly got me really to what I think is now the truth. We had scares before in Germany and Austria – like with acid rain and forests dying. Here the scientists and mass media said all forests would die by the end of the century. Now it’s 2011 and everybody knows they were completely false.
NTZ: What led you to write a rap song about climate change?
KM: The topic is everywhere around and it’s crazy what’s going on, so I decided to do something, because no alternative story gets shown. Also in the school-books the children are learning this stuff. I think music is a good way to reach young people – so they maybe start to question the world around them and not to take everything implicitly. Up to now, I’ve read books about the climate-topic, and I pursued the “climategate” story. It all guided me to make a song about it.
NTZ: How does the public in Austria and Germany view climate change? Are people questioning it?
KM: I dont know how the situation is in your country, but in Germany and Austria different opinions don’t exist – it’s really weird how everyone thinks the same – everywhere it is accepted as a fact without any doubt.
That’s why people look at you as if your an idiot (or whatever) when you question it – but yes, critical thinking is increasing here. I recognize it myself, through my music and the resonance I get from listeners.
The music also leads me to very interesting people, journalists, politicians, and so on, and they all try to do their best to get people to think critically.
Kilez More
NTZ: When you perform, what is it you want your listeners to do? Why should they believe you?
KM: I always say with my songs I don’t want the listeners to believe everything I say – no,
that’s the wrong way. That would be the same wrong way as believing everything the newspapers or TV-shows are saying. The message is to think on your own, to search the truth by yourself and to speak out loud against unfairness and lies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA scan of the larger German online dailies such as DIE WELT, Bild, Der Spiegel, FAZ, etc.  here in Germany shows absolutely no interest or any coverage of Al Gore’s 24 Hours of Reality.Maybe the old continent is losing interest in a movement that once appeared to be scientific, but has long since been reduced to childish name-calling and data manipulation.
The AFP here put out a news blurb, but little else is out there. It could be that editors will print something later, if space allows. But in general the silence is deafening.
Gore’s long losing streak
Objectively speaking, Al Gore is on serious a losing streak. His book sales have hit rock bottom, the Chicago Climate Exchange is dead, so is the Kyoto protocol successor, skepticism is growing, and his new Climate Reality Project is getting few visitors after a brief jump right after it opened. Indeed the global warming issue is out – totally passé.
A big problem is how Gore combatively frames the issue. For him it’s either you accept the science of climate catastrophe, or you are a despicable denier. Gore simply doesn’t grasp that most people are somewhere in between.
Even the warmist/alarmist sites in Germany are not even bothering to report on Gore’s senseless rantathon. One gets the feeling that he is appearing more and more washed up with every passing month. And with every emotional outburst, he is being regarded more and more as an embarrassment to the movement rather than a bonus.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith summer officially about to begin, a number of weather services are making seasonal forecasts for Germany and Central Europe. Read here.
The English-language The Local writes:
Donnerwetter.de meteorologist Karsten Brandt said odds were ‘high that the weather will turn out sunny with a tendency to be dry.’
Wetter.net meteorologist Dominik Jung also predicted a warm, albeit changeable summer.
‘Short heatwaves of a few days will be followed quickly by cooling in the form of fierce storms with heavy rains,’ Jung said, adding that tornadoes were possible.”
Surprisingly the DWD German Weather Service, like the Met Office, refuses to make a seasonal forecast, though their forecasts have been better than those of the Met Office (that requires getting it right only once). Interestingly the DWD doesn’t have much faith in forecasts that go beyond 10 days – even with all them fancy super computers that can crank out global warming forecasts 100 years out. The Local writes:
But the official German Weather Service’s (DWD) Helmut Malewski said in a statement that predicting more that 10 days ahead is like ‘reading tea leaves’.”
Clearly Germany is now in a period of unsettled weather, one that looks set to stay for a few more days, but not until June 27 – which is so-called Siebenschläfer Day, which is like St. Swithins Day in the UK. The saying goes: If on St Swithins day comes the rain, for forty days it will remain.
Unsettled weather in Germany on June 27 would mean the chances are about 66% that the summer will be unsettled too – that’s what the statistics show. But right now the forecast for next week (June 27) looks sunny.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s most likely what the warmists will be thinking after reading this post :).
Here in Germany the Greens and activists are constantly bemoaning the strong undercurrents of climate skepticism one finds in that “backward country” USA, and claim it’s all fanned by “hack” scientists, like Fred Singer, who are funded by Big Oil, or Koch Industries.
Well guess what? Climate skepticism is spreading way way beyond North America. Not long ago, Portuguese site Ecotretas put together an impressive list of skeptic blogsites and websites that are “in other languages” with “a few in English from non-native English speaking countries”.
ECOTRETAS LIST OF SKEPTIC SITES

Don't despair! Skepticism - the essential element that makes science work - is alive and well in climatology, and spreading! Big blue dots represent the number of skeptic blogsites (not to scale, for illustration only). 
Most of us have long been familiar with sites like Climate Depot, Watts Up With That, Real Science, Climate Audit, etc., but now we see there are many others out there all over the endangered planet.
I counted over 100 on the Ecotretas list.
Skepticism is spreading around the globe faster than Hansen’s phony red warm spots. How many of these foreign sites do you suppose are funded by Big Oil, Big Coal or Koch Industries? Yeah – we wish!
I can’t speak for others, but I can tell you I have not received a single cent of funding from anyone so far. I’m operating solely as a concerned citizen. I’m sure many on the list find themselves in similar situations.
The Ecotretas site is really worth bookmarking as many of these sites offer different perspectives on the issues. But there is one thing that is common to all: They suspect the science underpinning catastrophic man made global warming is a multi-billion dollar heap of rubbish…a scam that is disgracefully defrauding the public.
We’re on to you.

"Australian politics has never felt as far out of step with the rest of the democratic world. While other major democracies openly confront existential crises, politicians in Australia carry on apparently without a care in the world. Nothing symbolised this gulf more clearly than Scott Morrison in New York last week. As international leaders gathered to debate the acute threat of climate change – and to be eloquently berated by Greta Thunberg – the prime minister decided to give the UN’s climate summit a miss and went to inspect a newly automated McDonald’s instead. But it is not just the sitting government that appears to be sitting out the crises engulfing the rest of the world. Ever since their shock defeat in May, the ALP has been effectively silent. Whereas most incoming political leaders are now eager to display their authenticity with bold speeches on their core values and motivating ideals, Anthony Albanese has chosen a different path. He is waiting for the results of Labor’s internal review into the party’s electoral failings before he decides which fundamental identity to disclose. Some here find this stability reassuring. Few want to cope with the daily chaos of American impeachment, British Brexit or French gilets jaunes. But scratch beneath the surface and the challenges that animate those movements elsewhere are alive in Australia too. An intensifying divide between rich and poor, the threat of climate catastrophe, the erosion of stable stories of national identity, racial and ethnic hatreds – each of these issues shape the 21st century in every part of the world. They are our realities, whether we live in Athens or Adelaide, Seattle or Sydney. Australia cannot then continue with the politics of denial forever. We will have to face our own momentous moments of political decision, just as the rest of the democratic world is doing right now. And the longer Australia puts that moment off, the more intense our difficulties will be. It does not take too much excavation to see that. Social division and distrust in established political institutions – parliament, parties, politicians – as the potential agents of change, are deepening by the day. And each make the task of responding to the challenges of our times harder not easier. So what is to be done? We can be certain the politicians will not change course by themselves. That is expecting too much, even of the good ones. Democratic politicians almost always have to respond to agendas set by others. The short-termism engendered by three-year election cycles makes that all but inevitable. Nor will it come from those who have done well out of the economic order of the last four decades and have most to lose from policy change, like many of the multinational corporations. The job of confronting the future, therefore, must fall to the rest of us. It is for everyday citizens – from all backgrounds, all walks of life – to set the new agenda. Like many people, I used to think that was impossible. I thought there was no way the established powers in modern democracies would cede their agenda-setting role to anyone else. But not any more. Because the lessons of the last decade are that breathtaking political change is possible and that it is more often driven from outside the system than from within. Sometimes this is presented as a phenomenon only of the far right. Nigel Farage’s United Kingdom Independence party (Ukip) came from nowhere to revolutionise British politics, probably for generations. Donald Trump’s toxic mix of celebrity television and white nationalism has done the same for the United States. But in fact, as research by my Sydney Policy Lab colleagues Amanda Tattersall and Kurt Iveson shows, progressive forces have been gathering internationally too, especially in cities. In Spain, new citizen-led movements have taken over the governance of Barcelona; in South Africa’s Cape Town, everyday citizens have proposed radical new solutions for affordable housing; in London, charities and young migrant campaigners have worked hand in hand with the mayor, Sadiq Khan, to transform the debate on race and immigration; and, of course, in Hong Kong, citizens have challenged one of the mightiest political powers of all. All of us eager for change have much to learn by listening to those who lead them, examining their ideas and organising tactics. When we do, we see they are almost always broad coalitions. Their success depends not on the efforts of one small group but on collaborations between sections of society, many of whom have not worked together before. We see too that these are rarely just protest movements, vital and inspiring though protests can be, as the climate strike has shown. Instead, these are groups that present real, concrete practical solutions and who often get to work on delivering those solutions straight away. Most importantly of all, though, these are movements of people who realise that wherever we choose to put our energies, we simply do not have time to wait. They know that if established politicians will not act – and the evidence is they will not – then the rest of society must lead. These international movements, in other words, are united most of all in appreciating what Martin Luther King called the fierce urgency of now. It is time we in Australia show that we understand that too. • Marc Stears is director of the Sydney Policy Lab at the University of Sydney"

How many billions have been spent on research, institutes, think tanks, government, NGOs, etc., for the purpose of educating and regulating the public to curb CO2 emissions?
How many pages have been written and words spoken preaching that CO2 has to be reduced rapidly, or else the Earth will burn in hell?
How many light bulbs have been changed?
No continent on the planet has pontificated so incessantly to the rest of the world about the evils of CO2 emissions like Europe has.  The ultra-green continent even demands emissions be cut by 30% by 2020, and 80% by 2050.
So wouldn’t you think that Europe would be cutting its emissions every year?
In reality, Europe is like the chronic alcoholic who goes around telling everyone that he’s gone dry, only to stagger through the door hours later every evening.
The religious tree-hugger site klimaretter reports on the EU’s latest CO2 binge. EU emissions rose 2.4% in 2010. Ironically, the cause of the rise is reported to be a healthier economy, and a cold winter!

So let’s give Obama credit where credit is due. With his focus now returning to jobs and economy, he is slowing getting on the right path. Still, right now, his formula for job creation looks like it comes from a playbook written in the 1930s.

"Lucie Morris-Marr, the first journalist to reveal that Victoria police were investigating George Pell over allegations of child abuse, has detailed in her new book what she endured at the Herald Sun after breaking the story on the tabloid’s front page. In Fallen: the inside story of the secret trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell, Morris-Marr says elation over her scoop quickly turned sour, and she ended up suffering from severe stress after attacks from Pell and her colleague Andrew Bolt.  “My suspicion that News Corp was doing a U-turn seemed to be confirmed by Monday morning when Andrew Bolt described my scoop as a ‘witch hunt’ and a ‘smear’,” she wrote. So touched and honoured to see so many incredible and special people at the launch of my book tonight. Thank you to the remarkable @ChrissieFoster7 for launching the book and @paul4frankston for caring so much about the issue of clergy abuse. #fallen @AllenAndUnwin #pell pic.twitter.com/NGtzYj1U4J When Victoria police referred the story to the state’s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, Morris-Marr asked the editor, Damon Johnston, to provide security in case her home was raided, which he agreed to. But her confidence was shaken when she turned up for a meeting with editors to discuss the Ibac probe only to come face to face with Bolt. He “drifted into the room asking ‘is this where the Ibac meeting is?’,” Morris-Marr wrote. “I was so angry I put my hand out towards him and said ‘no’.” Morris-Marr says Bolt turned up for the meeting because a joke that he should attend was “taken seriously by the editor’s secretary” and he was invited. Johnston later ejected Bolt from the meeting, she wrote. A complaint to News Corp HR that Bolt had breached the News Corp editorial code of conduct was not upheld. Morris-Marr alleges that News Corp deliberately chose not to renew her contract after the dispute between her and Bolt: “I was out and Bolt was in.” Bolt has always denied he had anything to do with her departure from the paper. Morris-Marr went on to report on the Pell trial for CNN and the New Daily and, when her book was published last week, it went to the number one spot in the true crime bestsellers on Amazon. Australian media identities lined up to attack the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg this week for her scathing speech at the UN. From just one mention in the Australian media in September 2018, Thunberg’s prominence has grown to 2,848 mentions this month, according to Streem media monitoring. The more the 16-year-old has been mentioned, the more annoyed some commentators have become. There were the middle-aged white men who threw insults at the climate activist: the Nine footy personality Sam Newman, the broadcaster Alan Jones, the columnist Andrew Bolt, the Australian’s resident climate contrarians Chris Kenny and Graham Lloyd, and the Sky commentator Mark Latham. Then there were the middle-aged white women: the Tele’s Miranda Devine and the Sydney Morning Herald’s Amanda Vanstone. All very predictable. But it was the Nine broadcaster Karl Stefanovic whose intervention was a little surprising. “[Thunberg is] being managed and her stance is being used by activists,” Stefanovic told listeners while filling in as a shock jock on his friend Alan Jones’ radio station 2GB. “She was very fired up, wasn’t she? I thought, ‘What are my kids doing on school holidays next week? Not doing that.’” To be honest, I’m amazed that the UN hasn’t asked Karl to address them yet... https://t.co/fwS1OEhFpN Referring to the former Labor prime minister’s remark that Thunberg “represents the anger of that generation”, Stefanovic said: “Kevin Rudd, give it a rest. There’s anger out there – but there’s anger at this kind of activism as well.” “I’ll tell you what, I’m an incensed middle-aged white guy this afternoon.” Hang in there! Help is available. https://t.co/aenieXxVut For someone who is supposed to be rebuilding his reputation and credibility after the adverse publicity he received over a marriage break-up, Stefanovic is going about it the wrong way. The Australian set the tone for anti-Thunberg sentiment with a front page that screamed: “Deciphering Greta’s gobful.” Inside, the associate editor Chris Kenny described the climate warrior as “a hysterical teenager” while the environment editor, Graham Lloyd, said her speech was “heavy on rhetoric and threats but short on detail and facts”. Lloyd, who spends a great deal of time querying climate science, then analysed with his own take on the truth. In the Herald Sun Bolt said the “hysteria” of Thunberg – and women in general – was out of control. “There was Greta Thunberg, the child messiah of global warming, howling at the United Nations this week,” Bolt wrote. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words … People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.” “We see the same catastrophism here.” Then there was the ex-footballer Newman, who showed his true colours by tagging his post #ClimateChangeHoax. This annoying little brat addressed the UN on the so-called climate crisis. WHO lets this shit have a platform? Mendacious, inbred sycophants, that who. #ClimateChangeHoax pic.twitter.com/W1fvYdtFSW Devine, now enjoying the benefits of working for Rupert Murdoch with a stint in New York at the New York Post, called for someone to be “arrested for child abuse”. “It is grotesque that a child, already emotionally vulnerable due to her condition, has been so indoctrinated by adults,” Devine wrote. To round off the Tele’s coverage its blogger Tim Blair said Thunberg was a “teen climate queen” who had delivered a crazy, absurd and melodramatic speech. Vanstone, in the SMH, said: “The Thunberg circus has become a complete farce.” Jones has had a lot to say about Thunberg and the climate change protest, most of which is best forgotten. But he was given acres of space to defend himself in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age on Friday, papers that are owned by Macquarie Media’s parent company, Nine Entertainment. Nine owns 54.5% of Macquarie and is moving to total ownership. In a friendly interview Jones demonstrated how caring he was to listeners – he bought $1,000 worth of chocolates from a failing chocolatier – and how he was not a misogynist: he was “unfailingly courteous to women”. “Now, I don’t run around bullying or shouting at people,” Jones told the paper. “Yeah, on air, every so often I’ll get a bit excited but I’m doing a million words a day. I just want people to be sensible and reasonable and balanced.” Speaking of climate change, our readers were a little confused with a post on Facebook, writing their postcodes on the comments on Facebook instead of clicking the link. Fortunately, Guardian Australia’s data editor, Nick Evershed, was on hand to help them out. Folks, I cannot 😂 pic.twitter.com/it4T2FGpuy The West Australian published an interview with a young Perth-based hacker who revealed how he had managed to hack entertainment giants including Disney, Intel and Microsoft and get away with it. Dylan Wheeler spoke at length about how he had pulled it all off at the tender age of 14. This journalist has not spoken to me... he listened to a podcast by @DarknetDiaries @JackRhysider and wrote an article? Journalism on point, also lmao that hair style hasn't been rocked in many many years. pic.twitter.com/LrfgTgZAff “I don’t think we had too much of a sense of risk. If we get caught it will be a slap on the wrist, right? “There was nothing we didn’t have or we couldn’t pivot to and that is where it became a big issue. “It got so big, it blew up so fast – we literally had everyone in the gaming industry.” But, according to the podcast newsletter Podnews, the reporter, Tim Clarke, didn’t speak to Wheeler for his full-page profile. “All 23 quotes with the ‘hacker’ in question were in a story from Darknet Diaries which was not credited in the piece,” Podnews reported. Soon Wheeler himself had confirmed he’d never spoken to Clarke. The paper’s readers’ editor, Alison Wakeham, told Weekly Beast an error had occurred in the production process. “Tim Clarke’s original copy had made it clear that he was quoting from a podcast, but the mistake was introduced when the page was being produced,” Wakeham said. “On being made aware of what had happened, we corrected the online copy, also adding a link to the podcast, and the digital version of the newspaper.” Sometimes reporting on fake news results in the spread of erroneous information even further. Some media reports on the hoax photo claims to show rubbish left behind by Australian climate strikers were so obscure they buried the fact it is a hoax and perpetuated the myth. “The Australian Youth Coal Coalition called out Sydney’s climate change protesters, sharing this photo – but they got one detail very wrong,” Seven News wrote on Facebook with the photograph of the rubbish strewn across a park. “Photo of plastic waste ‘left behind by Sydney climate protesters’ goes viral.” Only the single quotation marks around the words ‘left behind by Sydney climate protesters’ gave the reader a clue that the photo is a hoax. In another Facebook post Seven News Australia wrote: “Look at the mess today’s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park. So much plastic. So much landfill. So sad.” Then there was the news.com.au story which did not make it clear until the 15th paragraph that the photograph was a hoax. “A climate change photo that has been shared more than 34,000 times has outraged Facebook users,” news.com.au said. “Tens of thousands of Australians marched against climate change on Friday — now one image has gone viral, for all the wrong reasons.” On Monday morning the Sydney radio host Alan Jones also repeated the hoax claim. “Why did climate protesters leave Sydney’s famous Hyde Park littered with tonnes of waste and plastic bottles?” Jones asked, reading out an ill-informed letter from a listener and failing to correct the record."

================================================
Heartland Institute’s 6th International Climate Conference Concludes
While climate tourists were meeting for the zillionth time to talk about rescuing the Kyoto Protocol and spreading a party-atmosphere at the taxpayers’ expense in Berlin, elite climate scientists met in Washington for the 6th time (privately financed), and agreed: The global climate is as normal as it has ever been – only the politics in a few countries (foremost Germany) is getting more and more out of whack.
 In Berlin concerned German Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen was doing his best to encourage the stalled and disappointed UN climate rescuers, and demanded they not relent in their attempts to avert the imaginary climate catastrophe. After all climate change is “a crisis for humanity”. For Röttgen and his Climadonna Merkel it’s nothing less. In contrast, everything at the 6th International Climate Conference in Washington was factual and based on science, and not fear and emotions. What follows are some impressions by EIKE’s President, Dr. Holger Thuss”
“About 250 participants and media representatives made their way to Washington to the 6th International Conference on Climate Change of the Heartland Institute (ICCC-6), a think-tank in Chicago. Organizers set out to challenge the so-called consensus on man-made global warming. The most important result of the conference which ended on the first of July was that such a consensus does not exist. 
The most important presentations were made by Dr. Patrick  J. Michaels (George Mason University / Cato Institute), Prof. Dr. S. Fred Singer (Emeritus of the University of Virginia) and Prof. Bob Carter (Queensland University, Australia). In his presentation Michaels concentrated on the historical background of the climate debate, where the organisational prerequisites were created already back in the 1940s. A big problem, says Michaels, is especially the existing combination of science funding with political-strategic planning by politicians. 
Prof. Singer introduced the updated progress report of the 2009/10 NIPCC Climate Report of the independent scientists. Prof. Bob Carter reported on the detailed study of the New Zealand temperature data, which also showed a strange upward jump in temperatures very similar to the famous hockey stick manipulations (Climategate), where experts were able to find major flaws. Also here raw data “disappeared”.
Special emphasis has to be placed on the contributions by Marc Morano (ClimateDepot.org and CFACT) and Anthony Watts (Wattsupwiththat.com), who run 2 of the most important skeptic websites globally. While Morano delivered a large quantity of new information on the status of climate policy, Watts provided the unmistakable many and wide range of error sources when recording and measuring of important weather data. Moreover Morano, Watts and other speakers emphasized that the politicization of the climate climate debate has continued to increase since the last conference. In all western countries it is being attempted to drive climate-change education into the minds of young children at schools by incorporating a binding curriculum – but only with minimal success. In contrast, there are questionable scientific facts which are being also legally challenged in countries like the USA and Australia. Also information on the status of this was provided.
The most problematic country in the west concerning the subject of climate change remains – this became clear during the conference – Germany. Especially during the breaks observers from Germany were again and again asked worried questions about the German “Sonderweg“, i.e. different path.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE 8/20: For whatever reason, Frank Abel has completely taken down his post. Most likely it did not amuse some particular persons.
==================================We all know that seasonal forecasts looking 90 days or so into the future are not easy to make and have considerable uncertainty. But that hasn’t kept some bold meteorologists from going out and issuing 3-month seasonal forecasts that even include the week-by-week weather development for the period, and claiming up to 80% probability they will be right. I’m not aware of any technology that would allow that.
And who can forget the forecasts of “barbecue summers”?
Increasingly a number of serious meteorologists are now getting annoyed by these crackpot crystal ball forecasts, which are eagerly spread by the media and never turn out to be correct.
One vocal critic is German meteorologist Frank Abel here, who is a weatherman at MeteoGroup Deutschland GmbH in Berlin, part of the biggest private European weather company.
Abel took two prominent summer-2011 forecasts made by 2 popular German meteorologists back in March and May respectively, and tells us today how they panned out. Abel:
In summary what they did get right was (like with a horoscope) purely by chance.”
He then quotes the Institute for Weather and Climate Communication (IWK) in Hamburg concerning the forecasts made by the 2 meteorologists.
Frank Böttcher of the IWK told me what he thought: ‘What does that tell us? Their projections are worse than if they had been picked randomly.”
Indeed Abel and dozens of other meteorologists had gotten so fed up with the dubious seasonal forecasts that they banded together back in April and drew up the so-called Hamburg Declaration on Longterm Prognoses, which has since been signed by well over 100 meteorologists. Here it is in English (my translation):
================================================
Hamburg Declaration On Longterm Weather Prognoses
by the Meteorologists of the 6th Extreme Weather Congress

We, the signers of the Hamburg Declaration, do hereby declare:
Long-term prognoses for approaching seasons are among the major targets of meteorology. Generating these prognoses are still at the very early stages of development. For producing such prognoses, research institutes are using super computers, without which, from today’s scientific perspective, it would be impossible to calculate the long-term developments. The results provide information on the monthly-basis anticipated deviations from the mean value and the probability of their occurrence. Such forecasts are currently possible only for very large extended regions.
Using today’s state of the art science, only the following type of forecast for June would be possible: ‘With a probability of 65%, it will be 0.3° to 0.5°C cooler than normal in southern Germany.’ Considerably more accurate forecasts for weeks and days for specific local areas, in the view of the undersigned, are not meteorologically and scientifically tenable and thus serve to damage the reputation of serious meteorologists. Thus the undersigned hereby request that making and publicizing of such prognoses, which give the public the incorrect appearance that it is possible to make accurate forecasts with our current level of knowledge, be avoided.
Signature
================================================
Well how about that – 65% probability a forecast for a period only 2 or 3 months into the future will be correct? Now what should that tell us about forecasts made for 5, 10, 20, 50 or even 100 YEARS down the road? Precisely – also just “horoscopes”, and them actually happening would be “purely by chance.”
Declaration On Climatic Forecasts
I now propose a Declaration on Climatic Forecasts. Serious meteorologists admit that seasonal forecasts are tricky and fraught with huge uncertainties. So isn’t it only appropriate that climatologists stop fooling the public and admit that their decadal and 100-year forecasts are also highly uncertain?
And please spare us the bullcrap that weather forecasts and climate prognoses are completely different. If anything, for obvious reasons, climatic prognoses are even far more difficult and thus uncertain.
One only has to consider that there is absolutely no agreement today among scientists on the strengths of forcings from the vast array of factors that act on our climate.
Science begins with honesty.

This will certainly be one of the major points of focus at this year’s conference.

That’s why distinguished speakers such as Prof. Dr. Jan Veizer, Prof. Dr. Nir Shaviv and Prof. Dr. Henrik Svensmark are slated to tell us more about it and the reaction from the scientific community.
I attended last year’s conference and I can tell you it was worth every minute, and I intend to go this year as well. A number of other bloggers were there too. Andrew Montford will also be a speaker.

Dr. Horst Malburg at the Gegenwind [Counter Wind] Conference at the German North Sea island of Sylt. A translation of the entire interview follows the video below:

Mueller: We are here on the island of Sylt at the conference “Gegenwind” and I have with me Professor Dr. Malberg from Berlin. Professor Malberg, what do you say about wind power with regards to the climate discussion?
Prof. Malberg: Wind power plants cannot be justified by the climate issue. I examined in detail what drives the climate and I looked at all the available data, from Europe, from USA, from Japan –  all data were evaluated, and naturally the global data. It clearly shows that the climate is dominated by the sun, and then on top of that by the oceans, and then a little bit by the CO2 effect. I would estimate it has a magnitude of 10%, for Co2, and not more. More than 80% of the climate change is driven by the sun. That means relative to natural climate change, the influence by CO2 is very small, and so it does not justify any action for climate protection, where wind parks are built in order to save CO2. Sure you can do it, but it won’t have any impact on our climate, at least no real impact.
Mueller (1:33): Germany is a leader in installing wind-parks, and so are the German efforts sensible?
Prof. Malberg: It’s naturally a political decision, that’s clear. But it is also an economic decision because we know it is very expensive. And when we have to transmit the power from wind parks at the coast and into the country all the way to south Germany. Then it is going to be a very expensive transmission. Here at the conference we have seen that it is much cheaper to transport coal or oil than it is to transport electricity. And I believe one day there’s going to be an ugly awakening when we realize how expensive electricity has become.
Mueller (2:25): One reason we should expand wind energy, as you mentioned, is climate change. How true is it that yes, there always has been climate change, but the increase over the last years is especially frightening?
Prof. Malberg: That is in no way based on anything. That is really a huge myth. During the last 13 years, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen more than at any time since the last Ice Age, especially since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But since the last 10 to 12 years, we have not had any more global warming. The temperature has reached a plateau and has even shown a slight declining trend. That means that while CO2 has increased strongly, the temperature has not reacted at all.
Mueller (3:24): And what do you say to politicians and media who tell us every day to be active for the climate?
Prof. Malberg: My conclusion is one that is completely different: I say it is a basic human right to have clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil and an ecological system that is intact. That means the highest priority is environmental protection. But humans do not have “a right to a stable climate”. That just does not exist. It never has existed. What is natural about the climate system is that it is not constant, it always changes.  When people speak so often about species dying, then one has to address environmental protection, and not assign everything to climate protection, and to blame it all on a phantom. The temperature increase we have had over the last 150 years of about 0.7°C has occurred multiple times since the last Ice Age, and nature repeatedly withstood it. Today there would be no polar bears if nature was unable to cope in balancing out the natural temperature fluctuations.
Mueller (4:50): What can you take home [from this conference] here in Sylt?
Prof. Malberg: We’ve had an interesting spectrum here. We discussed the climate behaviour. We’ve discussed the clearly measured non-acceleration of sea level. Of course there is a natural sea level rise, but it has not accelerated. We’ve discussed legal topics here at this conference. And finally we have learned from an energy expert that if we go ahead with wind and solar energy, then we have to understand that these two forms of energy depend on the weather. The wind doesn’t always blow, and very often the sun doesn’t shine here. And building solar plants in the desert would mean huge losses of energy because of the long transmission distances. That means we looked at a very broad spectrum of issues that absolutely belong in the public debate.
Mueller (6:00): Professor Mahlberg, thank you for the discussion.

"What do tampons and climate change have in common? It’s not just their environmental toll (seriously: take a look at what’s in some disposable menstruation products and then tell me the Diva Cup seems weird) – both issues attracted the largest number of signatures to an Australian parliament e-petition.  Until the petition calling for parliament to declare a climate emergency came along with its 160,000 (and counting) signatures, the March 2018 petition calling for an end to the “tampon tax” held the e-petition honour, with 104,185 signatures. The tampon tax was axed just a few months later, with the states and territories agreeing to forgo the $30m or so lost in GST revenue, and a government still keen to snub out potential election issues. The petition, one of many in the years since the GST was applied to women’s sanitary products, served as a flashpoint in a debate that had raged for almost two decades. But while the campaign was ultimately successful, it wasn’t the petition itself which led to the change, but the political will to pick it up. For the curious: the official record for the largest ever petition presented to the House is 1,210,471 signatures on a paper petition on pharmacy funding, presented to the House in 2014. pic.twitter.com/dMDuZBAF1a As with most things in life, when it comes to parliamentary petitions, timing is everything. In a word, no. Unlike the UK, there is no signature threshold that would force the Australian House of Representatives to debate a petition. A private member, which is any MP who is not a minister, can go through the normal processes to apply to the selection committee to try and move a motion to discuss the petition during the private members’ business section of a sitting, but the selection committee has to agree to it. If that doesn’t work, or a motion to discuss the petition fails, which given the government has the numbers in the House, happens every time the government doesn’t initiate something, then a MP could discuss it during a 90-second statement (short speeches made to the House about whatever the scheduled MP wants to talk about, just before question time) or, one of the political parties could make it a “matter of public importance”. Nope, but there are attempts to have the voice of the people recognised in this way. Late last year an inquiry into parliamentary petitions delivered this report, which recommended MPs be given 10 minutes on Mondays when parliament sits to present petitions. It also recommended that any petition with 20,000 signatures be considered for debate in the federation chamber, which is where spillover debates and speeches are made, so the House can keep on with its agenda. It may not be the main chamber, but it would still be recorded in Hansard, the official parliamentary record. That’s pretty similar to how the UK handles its signature threshold. But any changes – if any are made at all – won’t be coming in time for this petition; the government is yet to respond to any of the recommendations within the 2018 report. For a petition to be counted as a petition on the parliamentary website, it just needs to meet the requirements for lodging and have at least one signature. Which is not exactly the most onerous conditions. So there are a lot of petitions being hosted on the website. A lot. If your pet peeve isn’t on there, it wouldn’t be hard to rectify that. But it also means that without an external campaign letting people know it is there, it is easy for petitions to get lost. If you do want to know more about the petitions being hosted on the parliamentary site, head here. The friendly team at the Twitter account @aboutthehouse are also very helpful. Having your voice heard is never a waste of time, so if you feel strongly enough about an issue to log on to a parliamentary website and put your name to it, go nuts. The petition doesn’t close until 16 October, which is in the middle of the next sitting week and it has already attracted enough attention that you can guarantee it will be raised. Particularly in light of Scott Morrison’s comments to the UN last week. Both the Greens and Labor will make note of this petition and attempt to have the parliament recognise it, in some way. But even that won’t result in the parliament declaring a climate emergency. It’s a numbers game, and Labor and the Greens, even with all of the crossbench, simply don’t have them. But don’t lose hope – after all, you are reading an explainer on it, which means that it has already made enough of an impact to get people talking about parliamentary e-petitions, something normal people don’t really spend time thinking about. And the tampon tax was axed. Sure, it took almost 20 years, but when the ocean is lapping at Cronulla Stadium, even the most stubborn of men will begin caring about that."

Hans Schellnhuber and WGBU want to revolutionize society in 2 decades. Source: http://nachhaltigkeit2009.commerzbank.de

Awhile back Hans Schellnhuber, director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), released his master plan for the Great Transformation of global society – from one fuelled by carbon to a Utopian one powered by fuzzy-warm renewable energy.
This he claims would rescue the planet from imminent climate catastrophe. To help guide world leaders through the transformation, Schellnhuber and group of wisemen authored a guide called: World In Transition – A Social Contract For Sustainability.
Economist Carl Christian von Weizsäcker wrote a commentary in Germany’s flagship online political daily Franfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Schellnhuber’s 420-page master plan. The WBGU’s plan calls for the transformation to be done in 10 – 20 years, where “not only must the production and consumption habits fundamentally change, but also the incentive systems, institutions, normative maxims and scientific disciplines (foremost the economic science disciplines).”
Sounds pretty damn radical.
Weizsäcker sees the whole thing as naive and worrisome, and reminds us that the Neolithic Revolution took thousands of years to complete and that the Industrial Revolution took 150 years, and is actually still in progress in many poorer countries. So how can anyone expect a revolution of the scale Schellnhuber proposes to be accomplished in 20 years? By having a total lack of knowledge of how societies work is the answer.
Of course this Great Transformation would be led by a powerful guiding global state, Schellnhuber proposes. Weizsäcker goes on to compare the WBGU’s proposed endeavour to Vladimir Lenin’s “proletarian Russian Revolution of 1917, under leadership of the Bolshevist wing of the communist party”, which also promised to “lead humanity to a new age, into a global-wide economic and societal system that would end the exploitation of men by men and create a world that could not be better”.
Weizsäcker adds:
We know what history teaches us with respect to this announcement of a Fundamental Revolution. After the citizens said good bye to the most brutal of methods of the guiding Stalin-State, the empire ended up in a hopeless dead-end stagnation which finally ended, and had to end, in the total collapse of a historical lesson”.

I’d say Schellnhuber and the WBGU are well beyond naive.  What Schellnhuber proposes is nothing less than a reckless and adventurous social engineering experiment, tantamount to a half-baked plan that calls for taking apart a jumbo jet full of passengers and putting it back together again as a glider – all in midflight.
Schellnhuber and his WBGU of course would like to have the audience believe that this Revolution would be carried out “democratically, freely and successfully.” Deomcracy itself would have to undergo a transformation. Just how democratic would the WBGU’s proposed new society be? Weizsäcker translates the WBGU’s text as follows:
More democracy yes, but only if it serves to achieve our aims.”
and comments:
We are actually not speaking about democracy when the wisemen (modern: the scientists) of the country prescribe the result up front and inform the people: ‘you may decide – but only as long as you decide correctly. Otherwise we will have to take away your co-determination on behalf of the collective good.”
Now allow me to translate: That’s tyranny, and not democracy. Weizsäcker sums it up:
Karl Popper and Friedrich August von Hayek would turn in their graves if they heard this highly offical recipe as a new form of democracy.”
Of course not everyone is wary of the WBGU’s proposed societal coup d’etat. There are many leaders out there who, all doped up with green ideology, think these adventurous, poorly thought out schemes are going to save humanity. Like German President Christian Wulff.
Sigh – those who forget history are condemned to repeat it.

"As presidents, prime ministers and corporate executives gathered at the UN climate action summit on Monday, for the first time, an indigenous representative joined the event in a formal capacity. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people spoke on behalf of the International Indigenous People’s Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC), a caucus of indigenous rights advocates who, for years, has been working towards more robust participation and inclusion at the UN level in response to the climate crisis – even more so after the importance of traditional knowledge was mentioned in the 2015 Paris accord.  On Monday, Katan shared the stage with the Bangladeshi prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the philanthropist Bill Gates in discussing best approaches for adapting to a planet that is heating. “There’s no time left,” said Katan. “We must make a pact for life and for our future.” In his two-minute address, Katan outlined three climate action commitments of the IIPFCC as requested by the UN secretary general. Of these steps, the indigenous rights leader who also serves as vice-president of Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (Coica), emphasized most the need for indigenous inclusion. “We are more than 400 million indigenous peoples in the world and we protect 80% of the world’s biodiversity,” Katan said. The address was seen by some as representation that doesn’t go far enough, but in the larger scope of the indigenous rights struggle, it was also seen as a small but significant step towards being seen and heard. Formal indigenous representation has chronically been absent at UN climate talks even though indigenous peoples have been voicing concerns about a warming planet for decades. “The Inuit have been bringing forth warnings about global warming to the international community since the first Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,” said Kuupik Kleist, former prime minister of Greenland, in a statement. But Monday’s summit represented the most visible commitment made by the UN in promoting indigenous inclusion in high-level climate conversations and advanced progress from the historic working group formed at COP24 held in Poland last year. At that gathering, the IIPFCC secured their right for the first time to participate in vital decision-making in how traditional knowledge will be exchanged in adapting to the climate crisis as outlined in paragraph 135 of the Paris agreement. Andrea Carmen, executive director of the International Indian Treaty Council, credits these strides to an increasing number of climate scientists who are turning to traditional knowledge systems as a way to deeper understand the natural world. “Most of the states listening to the scientists are truly scared and are turning to indigenous peoples and saying: ‘Come and sit at the table and tell us what you’re thinking,’” said Carmen. But with UN recognition of these indigenous “ways of knowing”, as Carmen describes them, advocates insist that such acknowledgment must also come with assurances; that certain rights, most distinctly spelled out in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, are firmly upheld. One provision calls on countries to take effective steps to ensure indigenous knowledge systems are safeguarded so that they can continue to be practiced by the very tribal communities of which they belong. “Our traditional knowledge and the ways that we use it and how we think about it, needs to be respected,” said Carmen, adding that traditional knowledge doesn’t begin and end with the environment but rather the whole relationship indigenous peoples have with the land – economically, socially and culturally. For all the promising gains, though, it was Kayapó tribal leader and 2020 candidate for the Nobel peace prize, Raoni Metuktire of the Brazilian Amazon who perhaps demonstrated best the need for more indigenous inclusion at the UN level. Raoni was denied access to Monday’s climate summit despite explaining to organizers that his own ancestral homelands were still going up in flames – fires blamed on the multinational development logging plans of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. “Let Raoni in! Protect the Amazon!” shouted his supporters as he stood in the main lobby outside of the UN general assembly. Amazon Watch, one of the leading not-for-profit organizations promoting the protection of the ecosystem, said Raoni was not properly credentialed to attend the summit although he was allowed access to the main UN campus. But Leila Salazar-López, Amazon Watch’s executive director, said given the dire concerns over the rainforest, concessions for his inclusion should have been made. “The Amazon is on fire,” said Salazar-López. “And it’s a result of rolling back environmental laws and the rights of indigenous peoples because of Bolsonaro. “There’s a need to tell world leaders.” “They need us,” said Carmen. “We represent a source that can not only save lives and future generations but maybe also contribute to the shared survival of humanity.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIs our climate becoming more extreme?
By Paul Homewood
Hurricane Katrina (Photo credit: NOAA)
There has been much discussion recently about “Climate Disruption” or “Global Weirding”. John Holdren has talked about “increases in floods, wildfires, droughts, heat waves and hurricanes” while Rajendra Pachauri says: “Based on observation, we know that there will be more floods, more drought, more heat waves and more extreme precipitation events. These things are happening”.
Al Gore of course is quick to blame any extreme weather event on climate change. Even reputable climate scientists such as Katharine Hayhoe talk about Global Weirding. “Heavy rains, deep snowfalls, monster floods and killing droughts are signs of a new normal of extreme U.S. weather events fueled by climate change,” scientists and government planners said.
Katharine Hayhoe climate scientist of Texas Tech University told reporters:
It’s a new normal and I really do think that global weirding is the best way to describe what we’re seeing.”
But are we really seeing more extreme weather nowadays?
Our memory of events from years ago tends to blur into the mists of time. Furthermore the global nature of today’s news media often brings to our attention stories which we would not have even known about if they had happened decades ago. I have therefore put together the following record of extreme weather events from 1971, which I hope will provide a certain amount of perspective when looking at what is happening today. Why 1971? Quite simply it is 40 years ago, a nice round number, and of course, before the gradual rise in global temperatures began a few years later.
DROUGHTS
 In the US there were several notable droughts in 1971:
 * Florida – The worst drought on record resulted in 400,000 acres of the Everglades burned by fires. (1)
 * Texas – Worst drought since the 1950’s. (2)
 * Maryland – The 1958-71 drought produced the largest recorded annual departures from average stream discharge. (3)
 * California – The summer of 1971 was “extra hot and long. Rainfall did not completely wet the (tree) root zones the winter of 1971-72 (sic)”. The same report in 1978 stated “the rate of development (of dieback of tree limbs) has been accentuated in recent years”. (4)
 * Hawaii – The drought on Maui was described as the worst in 22 years. (5)
 * North Carolina – The Air Force Bombing Range Fire destroyed 29300 acres of forest. (6)
 * Minnesota – The Little Sioux Fire destroyed 14000 acres following “a period of abnormally dry weather”. (7)
 * In total there were 108398 wildfires in the US in 1971 affecting 4.2 million acres. ( Figures for 2010 were 71971 fires and 3.4 million acres). (7a)

In the rest of the world there were many more:
 * Australia – In Victoria  what was described as a severe drought began that would last to 1973. (8)
 * Ethiopia – 1971 saw the start of a 2-year drought that would claim 300,000 lives. (9)
 * Kenya – 150,000 people were affected in what was described in 2006 as even worse than the 2005 drought, itself one of the worst on record. (10)
 * Sahel – Mali, Chad, Nigeria and Burkina were in the middle of a drought that lasted from 1967-88 and which was described in Nigeria as the worst since 1913. (11)
 * Okinawa – Experienced the worst drought in history. (12)
 * China – Much of Northern China was in the grip of what in Beijing was on record as the worst drought ever (before or since). (13)
 * Afghanistan – This was the worst in the country’s history. (14)
 * Iraq – This severe drought led to the mercury poisoning tragedy. Iran was also affected. No drought there has been as bad since. (15)
 * India – The 1971-72 drought affected many states and ranked as the 5th worst since records began in 1876. (16)
 * Argentina – The 1971 drought was worse than anything since. (17)
FLOODS
 * North Vietnam – The Red River flood was an absolutely terrible disaster leaving 100,000 dead. It was listed by NOAA as one of the century’s top weather events and described as a 250 year event. (18)
 * India – Orissa was hit by a cyclone which left 10,800 dead. (19). Also, in Central India the Bundelkhand district was hit by floods (which were followed in 1972 by droughts). (20)
  * Malaysia – 32 people were killed and 180,000 affected in the Kuala Lumpur floods in the worst floods since 1926. (21)
 * Australia – In January the Canberra flood claimed 7 lives followed a month later by floods in Victoria which were called a 100 year event. In Queensland every month from January to May saw major floods and significant flooding returned in December. (22) (23) (24)
 * New Zealand – The New Plymouth area was hit by their worst ever flood after 11.4 inches of rain fell in 24 hours.(25)
 * Brazil – 130 dead in Rio de Janeiro floods. (26)
 * Quebec – Heavy rainfall caused a massive landslide at the village of Saint-Jean-Vianney, leaving 31 dead. (27)
 * Spain – 19 died in floods in Barcelona after 308mm of rain in 24 hours. (28)
 * USA – Alaska suffered a major flood, only exceeded by the 1986 flood in the last 50 years. (29)
 * USA – In February significant flooding occurred in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin.(30)
 * USA – In March Southeastern States were affected with Georgia recording record levels in some areas. (30)
 * USA – May and June brought significant flooding to Utah, Idaho, Nebraska and Wyoming. The discharge from the Bear River in Utah was considered a 75 year event. (30)
 * USA – Significant flooding hit Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia in June and July. (30)
 * USA – In August Baltimore was struck by one of the most damaging thunderstorms in 50 years and 14 died from the resulting floods. (30)
 * USA – Widespread flooding followed Tropical Storm Doria up the coast from North Carolina to Maine in August. Some streams in New Jersey and Pennsylvania registered record floods. (30)
 * USA –  Extended flooding occurred in September and October affecting Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. (30)
 * USA – More significant flooding hits Oklahoma and Arkansas in December. (30)
HURRICANES, TORNADOES, ETC. 
 * The Atlantic hurricane season was a “fairly active” one with several notable storms.(31)
 * The strongest was Edith, a Category 5, which killed dozens in Nicaragua before turning north and hitting Louisiana. (31)
 * Ginger is on record as the longest lasting Atlantic hurricane ever, or at least until the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane was retroactively discovered to be longer. (31)
 * An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other North Atlantic tropical cyclone. (31)
 * Canada was unusually on the receiving end of the tail ends of 2 hurricanes, Beth and Doria which both caused huge amounts of damage from flooding. Both were listed by Natural Resources Canada among the 18 major hurricanes of the 20thC. (32)
 * In the Pacific the hurricane season was above average with 18 named storms, 6 of which made landfall. This latter number is still the record for a season. (33)
 * The typhoon season was also a busy one with 24 typhoons of which 6 were super typhoons. This compares to 7 typhoons including 2 super typhoons in 2010. The season had an extremely active start with a record number of storms before August. (34)
 * Typhoon Rose left 130 dead in Hong Kong plus many more at sea. It was described by the Hong Kong Observatory as “one of the most intense and violent” to have affected Hong Kong. (34)
 * Cyclone Althea hit Queensland as a Category 4 cyclone in December. Damage was extensive but would have been worse if it had not arrived at low tide. (35)
 * The tornado season in the USA was also above average with 58 F3+ tornadoes ( compared to 39 in 2010). (36)
 * The worst tornado outbreak occurred in the Mississippi Valley during 2 days in February. 19 tornadoes were spawned claiming 123 lives across 3 states. (37)
OTHER EVENTS

 * The highest ever UK January temperature was recorded in Gwynedd at 65F. (38)
 * In Canada the snowfall record for one season was set on Mount Copeland in British Columbia in the winter of 1971/72. (39)
 * In the same winter Mount Baker in Washington broke the US record when 1122 inches fell. (40)
 * Montreal’s “snowstorm of the century” left 17 dead with 70 mph winds producing second storey drifts. (41)
 * Texas and Oklahoma were hit by a giant blizzard which set the state record snow depth in Oklahoma of 36 inches. The National Weather Service in Amarillo lists this blizzard as one of the top 20 weather events in the Panhandle. (42) (43)
 * Columbia suffered its worst winter in years resulting in economic losses of $150 million. To make matters worse heavy rains caused the two biggest rivers, the Magdalena and Cuca, to flood vast regions in the Central and Western parts of the country. (44)
 * Most of the USA was colder than normal. 1971 nationally was the 36th coldest in the 20th century. (45)
Which year saw the more extreme weather, 1971 or 2010? Who can say. How can anyone compare the severity of, say, a hurricane with that of a drought? Or a flood with blizzard? Katharine Hayhoe complains that our weather is becoming unpredictable but surely it has ever been so. Perhaps we should really start worrying when we stop getting extreme weather events.

"The UK will need investment worth billions of pounds every year to remove enough greenhouse gases from the air to meet its 2050 climate targets, according to a report commissioned by the government. The report, by analysts at Vivid Economics, estimated that the UK would need as much as £20bn a year to remove up to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air.  This will be necessary in the coming decades to make up for industries such as aviation, agriculture and heavy industry as the UK works to build a net-zero carbon economy. “Even if emissions are reduced aggressively across the economy, the UK is expected to continue to emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases annually,” the report said. “The rate of rollout will need to be rapid, particularly in the 2030s and 2040s, and will require significant policy support.” The report has urged ministers to consider supporting investment in greenhouse gas removal. This could mean offering new subsidies and grants for carbon capture technologies and projects, or demanding that companies that supply fossil fuels and agriculture products offset a percentage of their carbon emissions by investing in greenhouse gas removal. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “This report presents a variety of different options for consideration, and we will look closely at its findings. “We recognise the importance and urgency of taking action right across the economy to deliver on our world-leading net-zero target, including by developing our approach to greenhouse gas removal technology.” On average, the report estimates that the UK may need between £1bn and £2bn a year in 2030 to remove greenhouse gas emissions from the air, rising to between £6bn and £20bn by 2050. The most expensive projects would involve technology that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air. This could remove about 25m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year at a cost between £160 and £470 a tonne. The cheapest options include restoring natural habits, which could absorb 5m tonnes of carbon from the air every year at a cost of between £8 and £78 a tonne. The report even suggests supporting “enhanced weathering”, a relatively new approach to carbon removal in which fields are spread with ground-up silicate rocks, such as basalt, to increase the soil’s natural rate of carbon absorption. This could remove 15m tonnes of carbon from the air every year, but the cost of this process is uncertain at between £39 and £390 a tonne. The analysts expect large-scale greenhouse gas removal to rely on projects that use bioenergy alongside carbon capture technology, known as BECCS, as well as projects that capture carbon directly from the air, or DACCS. BECCS technology is being used on a small-scale at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire, where some of the coal-burning power units have been converted to run on biomass. Biomass is considered by the UK and EU governments to be carbon-neutral because the pellets are made from sustainably farmed trees which absorb carbon emissions while they grow. Drax is using carbon capture technology at the power station to trap one tonne of carbon emissions a day from burning the pellets. However, the project has attracted criticism from campaigners who question whether biomass, which Drax imports from the US, should be considered a renewable energy source. Almost 800 scientists wrote to the EU government last year to call for biomass to be stripped of its carbon-neutral status."

Two short reports today…
1) Solar jobs in Germany overstated
The idea was to shift from dirty fossil and dangerous nuclear fuel power generation over to clean, climate-friendly renewable energy, and thus create thousands of new green jobs that would usher in the German Green Revolution and so make Germany a model for the rest of the world on how to responsibly use energy.
Unfortunately, it may be becoming a model of what not to do.
A recent report throws more ice water on the green dream – at least in the solar industry. The report says that the number of solar jobs in Germany is much less than what is claimed by the industry. Instead of 133,000 solar jobs, the number is only 80,000.
According to CO2 Handel.de:
According to the Berlin Polytechnic University for Technology and Economy(HTW) there are currently about 80,000 jobs in the German photovoltaic industry, this reported by Welt am Sonntag.”


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The 133,000 jobs claimed by the solar industry trade associations have not been reached by a long shot. According to the Berlin Polytechnic University, approximately 75% of the jobs are not even in the so-called hightech areas of manufacturing, but rather in distribution and installation.
A few days ago NoTricksZone here reported how solar companies in Germany are bleeding to death, and shifting production to Asia. Solar panels are increasingly being manufactured in China and Malaysia where costs are much cheaper.
Not only are the lost jobs in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries not being replaced, but electricity rates have begun to soar as well, adding another hit to the economy.
2) Green statists on Rick Perry 
It’s now dawning on Europe’s greenies that Obama’s challenger in 2012 is going to be a solid skeptic (It obviously has not dawned on them that even Obama thinks little of the issue, probably because he knows the green revolution is a scam and would slam especially the poor). Statist green German website Klima der Gerechtigkeit (Climate of Justice) looks at emerging front-runner Rick Perry’s and his positions on climate change.
Perry is currently the favorite to be the Rupublican nominee. In the primaries his anti-climate positions likely will not be a disadvantage. That could change if the Republicans nominate him to go up against Obama. Climate change has had a noticeable impact on Texas over the last 20 years; it has become hotter and dryer. So far Perry has moved forward with his platitudes. But his home state is moaning under one of the worst droughts in its history – farmers face harvest losses of US$ 10 billion. Its governor allows his campaign to be financed by the oil and gas lobby and demands an end to all state regulations.
It’s going to be a fun campaign. Seriously.”
It very well may be. Texas is one of the fastest growing states, creating 40% of all new jobs in the entire country. It’s population is booming too. Concerning climate change, 69% of all Americans believe scientists have lied about climate change. Let’s see if Obama is stupid enough to side up with the 31%.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWindmills are subject to cyclic loading, which means even small cracks in the load-bearing structure can grow and eventually lead to catastrophic failure. One catastrophic failure occurred yesterday near the Central German town of Kirtorf, read here (in German). Hat-tip Dirk H.
Many photos here
The tower broke 25 meters up. Investigators are now examining the rubble to deterime the exact cause of the failure. Looking at the detailed photos at the above link, it looks as if the failure occurred where two tower segments are bolted together. Maybe cheap, counterfeit bolts were used. Luckily no one was injured or killed.
The mishap occurred at about 11:30 in the morning at a windpark with 7 turbines. The blades, turbine and upper part of the tower crashed onto a path on the ground, reaching as far as 50 meters away. The debris even struck and destroyed a nearby transformer station. Meanwhile officials have called for a shutdown of 17 other turbines in the area and that they be subjected to a thorough technical inpsection before being allowed to go online.
Other news reports say the turbine was erected 11 years ago and that the maximum windspeed recorded yesterday was 57 km(hr – stormy, but usually a wind speed that windmills have no problems coping with.
Reader Andreas Luft at the first link mentioned above wrote:
I also work on wind turbines. This type here must be a D-Wind system. But I’m familiar with onkly the D6 and D8. This could be a D4.
There are many problems with the towers also in Austria. They too also rust, and there is much corrsion damage at the welds of the steel plates. But I’ve never seen such a material fatigue before.
But the photos don’t show any signs of rust.

"Sometimes you don’t realise how conditioned you are until you meet someone who isn’t. Sure, I may be blunt in my work, but I still say sorry when someone barges into me in the street. I smile when others are being difficult. After all, I am of a certain age, and was brought up, consciously or not, to be a people-pleaser. In the 80s, I stood hesitantly outside an assertiveness training class – feminists used to do lots of stuff like that – unsure whether to knock or not, as I was five minutes late. As I have got older, I please myself far more and everyone else far less. And I often look to younger women for guidance.  The extraordinary reactions of certain men to Greta Thunberg, which have nothing to do with her urgent and necessary message on the climate emergency, tells you exactly what happens when a young woman simply refuses to be sexualised. It makes them deeply uncomfortable. Thunberg’s manner may be associated with her Asperger’s, but her defiance unsettles them. Old, male intellectuals in France have been farting on because she is not “sexy” enough. Yes, really. The 84-year-old philosopher Bernard Pivot, the president of the Académie Goncourt, a French literary society, talked of the sexy Swedish girls of his youth. Greta does not match up, apparently. Michel Onfray, 60, another philosopher, said she has the age and body of a cyborg. Pascal Bruckner, 70, said her face was “scary” and that she flaunts her autism. Trump, as we know, has mocked her. She is a 16-year-old, and these are grown men. And they are terrified. Wonderful. Who knew you could shake the patriarchy simply by refusing to smile for it, dress for it or demur to it? A refusal to acquiesce to the male gaze has these dinosaurs squirming. Greta, you teach us about more than one kind of climate. Thank you. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

"Hundreds of thousands of people around the world are taking place in the latest wave of climate strikes to demand urgent action on the escalating ecological emergency. Last week, millions walked out of schools and workplaces, uniting across timezones, cultures and generations in the biggest climate protests in history before a special UN conference in New York. Organisers said they were expecting another huge turnout on Friday, with demonstrations planned from Canada to the Netherlands, Sweden to Morocco, Italy to India. In New Zealand, record numbers of protesters were reported to have taken to the streets on Friday. Greta Thunberg, the teenager who inspired the school strike movement with her solo protest outside the Swedish parliament last year, said 3.5% of the country were taking part. An open-letter signed by 11,000 New Zealanders was delivered to parliament on Friday morning calling on the government to declare a climate emergency – following the lead of numerous councils around the country. “Our representatives need to show us meaningful and immediate action that safeguards our futures on this planet,” Raven Maeder, the School Strike 4 Climate national coordinator, said. “Nothing else will matter if we cannot look after the Earth for current and future generations. This is our home.” As part of the Earth Strike events, there are also expected to be big demonstrations in Latin America from Mexico City’s vast Zócalo square to the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires.Activists say Plaza Italia in Santiago, Chile, will be flooded with demonstrators from 6pm, while protests will be staged in cities in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay around the rim of the Amazon rainforest.On Bogotá’s high Andean plain, the environmental movement has faced a severe crackdown. In July, protesters across the country pleaded for an end to the violence that has resulted in numerous activists being killed, with peace and development thinktank Indepaz putting the figure at 734 deaths in the first seven months of 2019.“We want to keep fracking out of our country and demand an immediate change towards decarbonisation,” said the activist Susana Muhamad, who was planning to march past the offices of the country’s largest petroleum company, Ecopetrol, at midday. More than 30 events have been planned in Argentina, where crowds will be marching across the capital from the Plaza de Mayo to the seat of the national congress.Among them will be Stephanie Cabovianco, a 30-year-old activist from Buenos Aires. “There are no outright leaders coordinating our movement in Latin America – and that’s a good thing,” she explains. “This is a fight led by young people, and its structure should be as horizontal as possible.” New Zealand leading the way into Friday nr 2 in #WeekForFuture Early reports speak of 170’000 people on #ClimateStrike in NZ. Or 3,5% of the population... Good luck everyone striking around the world. Change is coming!!#FridaysForFuture https://t.co/u5JIWkNDen The strikes are a sign of the growing awareness and anger of the severity and scale of the climate crisis among people around the world. Earlier this week, Thunberg excoriated world leaders at the UN for their “betrayal” of young people after the New York summit failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating. The climate activist told governments: “You are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.”"

The good news is that autumn may turn out to be warm and pleasant for Central Europe. The bad news is that there’s a good chance the winter will be cold.

Brandt writes:
The current long-term prognoses provide a preliminary look into the 2011-2012 winter. For those of you who were hoping for a mild winter after the last snowy and cold winters, which brought traffic chaos and shortages of road salt, you’ll probably end up disappointed: At the moment the indications show that there is going to be a powerful cold phase in the Winter of 2011/2012. At least one, and probably even 2 months are going to be icy.”
Cold winters “due to global warming”

Now for you AGW skeptics out there, don’t you dare go out saying that a cold Central European winter is a sign of cooling. To the contrary according to new models out of Potsdam, cold winters are a sure sign of global warming and man-made climate change, just as this is the case with hot weather. Yes the cold fits right in with the global warming picture – the models say so.
According to Vladimir Petoukhov last year of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany:
Our results imply that several recent severe winters do not conflict the global warming picture but rather supplement it, being in qualitative agreement with the simulated large‐scale atmospheric circulation realignment.”
Here he is not just talking about Central Europe, but the northern hemisphere in general.
Our simulations with the ECHAM5 general circulation model demonstrate that lower‐troposphere heating over the B‐K seas in the Eastern Arctic caused by the sea ice reduction may result in strong anticyclonic anomaly over the Polar Ocean and anomalous easterly advection over northern continents. This causes a continental‐scale winter cooling reaching −1.5°C, with more than 3 times increased probability of cold winter extremes over large areas including Europe.”
This is all getting quite confused. Global warming causes colder winters. Warmer ocean waters cause more cyclones, But if the warmer ocean waters are in the Arctic then they are actually “anti-cyclonic”…which means less storms. If all that doesn’t make sense, well that’s because nonsense, confusion and psychosis are also traced back to AGW. A recent study said so.
One thing is certain: Natural climate change is causing lots of silly science.

When it’s the 2nd coldest year of this century, sea levels are dropping and you’re a warmist desperate for headlines, what do you do? You resort to using outlier and obscure data sources – like the warmist University of Bremen – and claim Arctic ice is “dramatically shrinking” and has reached “a record low” (since satellite measurement began 30 years ago).
Too bad all other datasets show the opposite is true. Using the other well-known sources, the NOAA IMS, NSIDC, JAXA, NORSEX, DMI, or AMSR-E, 2011 was not even close to 2007.
By most accounts, 2011 fell about 300,000 sq km short of 2007. That’s more than 8000 Manhattans. You can see all the up-to-date charts at Anthony Watts excellent sea ice page here.
Dr. Steve Goddard prepared an excellent comparison chart of 2007 and 2011. As you can see it’s not even close when viewed objectively.

How the U. of Bremen measures ice to me is truly mysterious. Are they into science or media manipulation? Serious and objective observers of course will be extra careful with future statements coming from Bremen.
Will 2011 take a turn downwards in the days ahead?

Right now temperatures north of 80°N latitude are below normal (see chart below) and falling rapidly, as they typically do this time of the year. Refreezing is now taking place at a vigorous rate. In fact, by most accounts, the 2011 melting season ended near a record early point (Sept 9 – IARC-JAXA). A warming world would show ice melts into late September, and not ending in early September.

Arctic freezing and melting is but only one single indicator from many in discerning global temperature behaviour. Ice-free North Poles were recorded back in the 1950s. And over the last months Steve Goddard’s site has presented numerous accounts of “rapidly melting Arctic ice” – from the early 20th century! Clearly there is nothing unusual about today’s global climate and “ice-free Arctics”.
The relatively low ice extents today in the Arctic are all part of the ongoing global cyclic changes. They are nothing new. Indeed many scientists expect the Arctic to recover. And when it does, it could very well be that melting will shift to the Antarctic.
And if it doesn’t, then expect places like the University of Bremen to see to it that it does.
