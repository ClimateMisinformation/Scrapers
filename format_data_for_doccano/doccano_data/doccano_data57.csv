"The weather is extremely worrying. It has never been so warm for so long at this time of year before and it is just possible that the effects will be catastrophic. We are talking, of course, about the Arctic, where over vast areas of frozen sea the temperatures are higher than they are in Britain today. A blast of winter in Britain and across much of northern Europe is unpleasant but perfectly survivable and affects few people outside the region, but a period of unseasonal warming in the Arctic could be the harbinger of something that changes the whole world for the worse. Both could be connected so that the cold winds that belong in the Arctic have broken out southwards to chill us while warm winds melt the ice cap. We don’t know, but that’s no reason for complacency. Precisely because climate change on the scale now under way is outside all previous experience of which we have records, it’s impossible to know which unprecedented fluctuations are those that mark the transition to a new and more dangerous state. That determination can only be made long afterwards, when it is too late to change anything. It does not mean there is nothing to worry about; only that we can’t be certain what ought to worry us. This one probably should. The weather in the Arctic has always shifted dramatically over short periods, but the drama has never been this intense since records began. At one spot in Greenland the temperature rose 36C above the annual average, and for two days in February the north pole has been warmer than Zurich in Switzerland.  The system of global climate is extremely complicated and full of feedback loops that are not properly understood, but the worry is that the freak warming of the Arctic marks the emergence of a new feedback loop where increasing temperature leads to still more destabilising rises. The polar vortex, a great girdle of winds that keeps the cold air of the Arctic separate from the warmer air of temperate regions, seems to be weakening. Warm air goes north; cold air comes south. In the long run, everything grows warmer. At the moment, this seems to be mainly affecting the Arctic sea ice, which is shrinking at an astonishing rate but does not of itself contribute to rising sea levels. The fear must be that the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which rest on buried land, will melt and drown many of the world’s most populated coastlines. Sea levels will rise for the rest of this century even if the ambitious targets of the Paris accords are met. These commit the world to cutting the net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. Even if that happens, the latest research suggests that sea levels will continue to rise for another two centuries, and may do so by a completely catastrophic amount. The change in behaviour must come quickly: every five years’ delay in action may add another 20cm to the projected sea level rise. All these changes may seem small and distant. It is human nature to worry more about 2cm of snow falling in our back yard today than all the oceans of the world rising by 10 times as much over the next century. But the one is a parochial inconvenience and the other a global catastrophe. The snow this week may be a warning of something very much more destructive and we should act as if it were, even if we can’t be certain that it is. The consequences of misplaced optimism would be far worse than those of a pessimism that was not borne out by events. Our descendants won’t thank us if they never see any snow in a shrunken Britain where the coastline runs past Cambridge."
"Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement has created serious problems for global efforts to tackle climate change, Ban Ki-moon has said. The former UN secretary general said Trump’s move was politically damaging to international action to limit carbon emissions and had created difficulties in delivering financial aid from richer to poorer countries to help the latter cope with a warming world.  “United States is a big problem now. I think the United States’ decision to withdraw from this Paris agreement really creates a serious problem,” Ban said in an interview with the Guardian. “They [the Trump administration] have given serious damage to the political side. All the countries are very serious and concerned about this [the US declaring its withdrawal from the climate deal].” Although Trump indicated in a recent interview that the US may not leave the global accord, Ban said the remarks were not clear. He said the apparent shift in position may have been the result of lobbying from European leaders such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Ban said he hoped Trump would take better advice. “What President Trump has been saying is politically shortsighted and scientifically based on wrong advice; I don’t know who advised him,” he said. While Europe has been seen as a champion of global climate talks and international efforts to rein in temperature rises, Ban said he was worried this role could be put at risk by political strife. “I am concerned because of the divisions that are now happening within the EU, not to mention this Brexit, and political difficulties and issues such as refugees,” he said.  He said he hoped Macron and Angela Merkel would take on a leadership role and he had pressed the French president on the issue during an hour-long meeting in December. Ban said Britain had a duty to keep up action on climate change despite Brexit. “They [the UK government] still have a political and moral responsibility on this issue,” he said. The US saying it would withdraw from the Paris agreement had imperilled the $100bn-a-year of climate aid the world’s richest countries have pledged to the poorest by 2020, Ban said. “Without the US, we have a lot of difficulties, particularly mobilising financing,” he said, adding that he was particularly concerned about the one-third of funding the US would normally provide to committees administering billions of dollars in climate money. “Who will make up all this losses which will not be paid by the US? That’s a serious problem now,” he said. He said the private sector may have to play a greater role than previously envisaged, and he was working with the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan and the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres to address the challenge. Despite these setbacks to climate action, Ban said he was encouraged that China was still fully committed to reducing emissions. “President Xi Jinping clearly mentioned that China is fully onboard, understanding that the climate is changing,” Ban said of a meeting with the Chinese leader in November. Another promising sign was the We Are Still In campaign, a group of US cities, states and businesses that have pledged to stick to the Paris targets regardless of Trump. “This is a groundswell of people,” Ban said. He said he would dedicate his life beyond the UN to continuing climate change advocacy. Despite the US’s backtracking, Ban said he remained confident the world could meet the target of limiting temperature increases to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and the aspiration to keep them under 1.5C. “I am quite optimistic we will make it happen,” he said. Ban was recently appointed president of the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute, which he hopes to expand beyond its 28 member countries."
"There was almost something biblical about the scene of devastation that lay before Richard Kock as he stood in the wilderness of the Kazakhstan steppe. Dotted across the grassy plain, as far as the eye could see, were the corpses of thousands upon thousands of saiga antelopes. All appeared to have fallen where they were feeding. Some were mothers that had travelled to this remote wilderness for the annual calving season, while others were their offspring, just a few days old. Each had died in just a few hours from blood poisoning. In the 30C heat of a May day, the air around each of the rotting hulks was thick with flies.  The same grisly story has been replayed throughout Kazakhstan. In this springtime massacre, an estimated 200,000 critically endangered saiga – around 60% of the world’s population – died. “All the carcasses in this one of many killing zones were spread evenly over 20 sq km,” says Kock, professor of wildlife health and emerging diseases at the Royal Veterinary College in London. “The pattern was strange. They were either grazing normally with their newborn calves or dying where they stood, as if a switch had been turned on. I’ve never seen anything like that.” The saiga – whose migrations form one of the great wildlife spectacles – were victims of a mass mortality event (MME), a single, catastrophic incident that wipes out vast numbers of a species in a short period of time. MMEs are among the most extreme events of nature. They affect starfish, bats, coral reefs and sardines. They can push species to the brink of extinction, or throw a spanner into the complex web of life in an ecosystem. And according to some scientists, MMEs are on the rise and likely to become more common because of climate change. The MME that has pushed the saiga closer to extinction struck in 2015. Kock was part of an international team studying the animals as they gathered for the calving season. For most of the year, saiga are on the move, able to avoid predatory wolves and human poachers by sprinting at more than 40mph, making them one of the fastest ungulates, or hoofed animals. But once a year they put their migration on pause to calve in vast groups when the grass is at its lushest, before it is scorched by the sun. In 2015, the main gathering in the Betpak-Dala region of central Kazakhstan, an area roughly the size of the British Isles, numbered 250,000. Nearby, other groups were thousands strong. Saiga are remarkable animals. Their bulbous noses, which hang over their mouths, give these antelopes an almost comical appearance. The nose is flexible and can be inflated, helping them to breathe warm air in the freezing winters and filter air in the arid summers as they sprint with their heads down in a cloud of dust. The species has been hit by mass die-offs before. In 1981, around 70,000 died suddenly in a few days, while in 1988 another 200,000 died. The creatures are also victims of poachers. “In 2014, we believed there were about 250,000 adults and they produced a good number of calves – perhaps a couple of hundred thousand. It looked a viable population and we’d expected a population of a million soon. There was even talk of them coming off the critically endangered list,” Kock says. But as the scientists watched a year later, the mothers fell sick and began to drop dead. “It wasn’t as if the disease started at one end and spread – there was no time for transmission of the pathogen from animal to animal. It was too quick,” he says. “Within two or three days, everything was dying. By the end of the week, every single one was dead.” The scientists on the ground pinpointed blood poisoning as the cause, but were puzzled as to why whole herds were dying so quickly. After 32 postmortems, they concluded the culprit was the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, which they believe normally lives harmlessly in the tonsils of some, if not all, of the antelopes. In a research paper published in January in Science Advances, Kock and colleagues contrasted the 2015 MME with the two from the 1980s. They concluded that a rise in temperature to 37C and an increase in humidity above 80% in the previous few days had stimulated the bacteria to pass into the bloodstream where it caused haemorrhagic septicaemia, or blood poisoning. The weather link raises the spectre of climate change. Just as it is rarely wise to link a single extreme weather event – whether it’s the Australian heatwave, last summer’s Hurricane Harvey or this winter’s North American cold snap – to climate change, it is equally difficult to blame an MME on global warming. But what can be said with confidence is that the sorts of extreme weather events linked to MMEs – such as the temperature and humidity rise that nearly wiped out the saiga – will become more frequent. Australians know all about extreme weather. While much of Europe and North America has endured a bitter start to the year, the Australian summer has been a scorcher. In January, temperatures in Sydney topped 47C, the city’s highest since 1939. The toll on wildlife has been devastating. As the mercury rose, corpses of critically endangered flying foxes – or fruit bats – began to pile up under the trees in New South Wales. Horrified wildlife campaigners at one colony in Campbelltown, south of Sydney, discovered 400 dead bats. Some were still hanging from trees. Many were babies, abandoned by their parents in their own desperate search for shade. Flying foxes are well adapted to normal Australian summers. But above 40C, they are unable to regulate their body temperature and can die from overheating. This year’s deaths were grim enough, but they were dwarfed by the MME of 2014, when at least 45,000 flying foxes were killed on one hot day in south-east Queensland. Some colonies had more dead bodies than living bats. Their corpses were piled thick on the ground as the three species there – the black, little red and grey-headed – were hit. Events like the disaster that struck the flying foxes and saiga appear to be growing in number. The most thorough study of its kind published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 uncovered 727 accounts of MMEs involving 2,407 animal populations since 1940. It found that not only are reports of MMEs on the increase – by about one event a year – but the number of animals killed in each event is on the rise for birds, fish and marine invertebrates. Adam Siepielski, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Arkansas and a co-author of the paper, became fascinated by the phenomena after hearing a radio report of millions of sardines and anchovies dying. “These reports of MMEs are probably underestimates in terms of occurrence and sheer magnitude,” he says. “There is additionally a challenge in trying to understand whether this increased occurrence is a real event, or whether there are more people observing these things and [they are] more likely to report them. We call this the epidemic of awareness.” The study found that disease was the biggest factor in MMEs, playing a role in a quarter of them. Around 19% were directly linked to human behaviour such as pollution. Factors linked directly to climate – including extremes of hot and cold, oxygen stress and starvation – collectively contributed to about a quarter. Untangling the causes – and working out the role of climate change in MMEs is difficult. “In many cases, there are multiple stressors – such as, in the case of the saiga, a low-lying bacterial infection, slightly higher humidity and higher temperatures,” says Siepielski. “There are some mass mortality events linked directly to extreme heatwaves or cold snaps. In other cases there could be indirect changes, where shifts in temperature cause diseases to be more common and which lead to an MME.” That kind of temperature-related outbreak is now thought to lie behind one of the biggest die-offs ever observed in the natural world, in which hundreds of millions of starfish off the west coast of America began to “melt” into white gloop. More than 20 species of starfish along the coast from Mexico to Alaska were hit by the sea star wasting disease, a condition caused by a parvovirus – the group of viruses that cause gastrointestinal problems in animals. The virus left the starfish vulnerable to bacterial infection. Within one or two weeks of infection, white cuts appeared on their bodies and the creatures became listless. Some ripped off their infected arms and tried to walk away. But for most the disease was deadly. Like the bacteria that triggered the MME in saiga, the virus appears to have been present in starfish for decades – if not longer. Samples stored in museums since the 1940s tested positive. An MME can push a species closer to extinction. But it can also have knock-on effects elsewhere in the fragile food web. In tidal pools on the west coast, where once there was a healthy mix of species, mussels – food for starfish – are starting to dominate. Off California, another source of starfish food, sea urchins, are also on the rise – causing a fall in the availability of kelp, the sea urchins’ main food source. That decline could hit species that depend on it for shelter, food and protection. A paper published last year in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society concluded that the die-off was probably linked to warmer seas. The team, led by Morgan Eisenlord at Cornell University, looked at the links between ocean temperatures and disease in the most common species on the west coast, the ochre sea star, as well as testing the effects of warmer water in the lab. Warmer than usual water didn’t just put the starfish under stress, it also made infectious agents more prevalent, they concluded. Kock is confident that climate change will lead to more MMEs – pushing vulnerable species closer to extinction and altering the food web. He believes that conservationists should be on the lookout for other mortality events in species such as reindeer and elk. “The tragedy is, we will probably see more events like the event that affected the saiga,” he says. “Evolution takes millions of years and if we have a shift in environmental conditions, everything that’s evolved in that particular environment is under different pressures. Microbes adapt and can respond to changes quickly, but mammals take hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years to adapt. That’s the real worry.”"
"Sixteen Australian industrial sites have breached government-imposed greenhouse gas emissions limits and had to buy millions of dollars in carbon credits. The breaches came despite big emitters being granted generous carbon limits, in many cases above their highest previous pollution levels.  They were revealed in the first batch of emissions data released under the Coalition’s “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Direct Action climate policy introduced by carbon pricing opponent Tony Abbott. Labor and industry body the Carbon Market Institute both said the use of Australian carbon credit units – mostly created through land-use based greenhouse gas reduction projects – was evidence the country had a carbon market despite the government claiming otherwise. The opposition climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said businesses were now trading credits at prices the Coalition had claimed would wreck the economy under Labor. He said it showed the hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of the government’s approach to climate change. “The Turnbull government should stop trying to mislead the Australian people and their own backbench,” he said. “[It should] admit that carbon pricing and trading is not only needed to take effective action on climate change, but their ineffective climate change policy also includes carbon trading.” The Labor-Greens carbon price for all big emitters was $24.15 a tonne when the scheme was repealed and replaced by Direct Action under then prime minister Abbott in 2014. The price had been expected to fall to less than $10 a tonne the following year when international carbon trading began. Comparatively few credits – about 448,000 – were bought last year under the safeguard mechanism, mostly for $14-$15 a tonne, suggesting a total cost to business of more than $6m. The majority of the 154 emitters covered by the safeguard mechanism emitted less than their limit, known as a baseline, allowed last financial year. The biggest purchases of credits were by miners Anglo Coal (133,104 tonnes worth at the Capcoal mine in Queensland), Glencore (81,851 tonnes at the Tahmoor coalmine in NSW) and Rio Tinto (68,305 at the Alcan Gove bauxite mine in Arnhem Land). The environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly address whether Australia had a carbon market. He said the safeguard mechanism was developed through consultation with a broad cross-section of industry, and provided flexible options for businesses to comply. He said Labor had introduced a carbon tax that hit households and businesses, and was now promising a deep cut in emissions by 2030 without backing it up with a plan or costings. “In contrast, the government’s approach is to address climate change with policies that ensure we have an affordable and reliable energy system and competitive industries,” Frydenberg said. Butler said the ALP supported the further development of carbon markets.  The safeguard mechanism was promised to ensure cuts paid for using the main part of Direct Action – the $2.55bn emission reduction fund – were not undone by emissions increasing in other parts of the economy. Government agency the Clean Energy Regulator sets an emissions limit for each large industrial site based on its highest level of emissions over the previous five years. But companies can apply to have the limit recalculated. Consultants RepuTex last month found 57 industrial sites had been allowed increased baselines beyond previous emissions levels, prompting claims the safeguard mechanism was pointless. The new data shows eight of these operations breached their increased baseline. The government is now considering making the safeguard mechanism less tied to historic emissions. A climate policy review released in December suggested emission limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said most companies were compliant under the safeguard mechanism only because the system was broken – baselines were either too high to begin with or businesses had been granted higher baselines to avoid breaches. “When you’ve got a pollution reduction policy that doesn’t reduce pollution, it’s time to start over,” he said. Environment department data shows national emissions have risen each year since 2014. Under their current trajectory, the department projects emissions would be about 2% higher in 2030 than in 2005. The government’s target is a 26% to 28% cut over that time frame; Labor has proposed a 45% cut. The Carbon Market Institute chief executive, Peter Castellas, said the safeguard mechanism data showed Australia clearly had a functioning carbon market that had been able to meet the demand of businesses that required credits. It is understood most credits purchased were from surplus emissions cuts by companies that had won contracts under the emissions reduction. The carbon price spiked to as high as $18 a tonne – well beyond the average $11.90 under the emissions reduction fund – due to limited supply. Castellas said industry had not been expected to breach the safeguard mechanism. Its operation augured well for a time when the demand for carbon credits increased. “Safeguard mechanism baselines will inevitably have to decline if we are to meet below business as usual emissions required under Australia’s Paris agreement commitments,” he said."
"Scientists have outlined plans to build a series of mammoth engineering projects in Greenland and Antarctica to help slow down the disintegration of the planet’s main glaciers. The controversial proposals include underwater walls, artificial islands and huge pumping stations that would channel cold water into the bases of glaciers to stop them from melting and sliding into the sea. The researchers say the work – costing tens of billions of dollars a time – is urgently needed to prevent polar glaciers melting and raising sea levels. That would lead to major inundations of low-lying, densely populated areas, such as parts of Bangladesh, Japan and the Netherlands.  Flooding in these areas is likely to cost tens of trillions of dollars a year if global warming continues at its present rate, and vast sea-wall defences will need to be built to limit the devastation. Such costs make glacier engineering in polar regions a competitive alternative, according to the team, which is led by John Moore, professor of climate change at the University of Lapland. “We think that geoengineering of glaciers could delay much of Greenland and Antarctica’s grounded ice from reaching the sea for centuries, buying time to address global warming,” the scientists write in the current issue of Nature. “Geoengineering of glaciers has received little attention in journals. Most people assume that it is unfeasible and environmentally undesirable. We disagree.” Ideas put forward by the group specifically target the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctic because these will contribute more to sea rise this century than any other source, they say. Their proposals include: • Building a 100-metre high wall on the seabed across a 5km wide fjord at the end of the Jakobshavn glacier in western Greenland. This would reduce influxes of warming sea water which are eroding the glacier’s base; • Constructing artificial islands in front of glaciers in Antarctica in order to buttress them and limit their collapse as their ice melts due to global warming; • Circulating cooled brine underneath glaciers such as the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica – in order to prevent their bases from melting and sliding towards the sea. In each case, the team – which includes scientists in Finland and the US – acknowledges that costs would be in the billions. Construction is also likely to cause considerable disruption. For example, building a dam across the Jakobshavn fjord could affect ecology, fisheries and tourism, and large numbers of workers would have to be shipped in to complete the project. Similarly, building artificial islands in front of glaciers would mean importing about six cubic kilometres of material, a task that would be immensely difficult in stormy Antarctic waters. And drilling through ice that is kilometres thick to pump down cooled water would also stretch the capabilities of engineers. However, the team insists that such projects should be carefully assessed now as the likely costs appear to be compatible with those of other large energy and civil engineering works being planned across the globe. The issue is simple, they state: should we spend vast sums to wall off all the world’s coasts, or can we address the problem at its source? “Potential risks, especially to local ecosystems, need careful analysis,” they conclude. “In our view, however, the greatest risk is doing nothing.”"
"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 were again the highest on record when unreliable data from sectors including land clearing and forestry are excluded, according to consultants NDEVR Environmental. Even including land clearing, overall emissions show a continued rising trend, which began in about 2011, putting Australia’s commitment under the Paris agreement further out of reach. The rising greenhouse gas pollution comes despite continued decline in emissions from the electricity sector, following increased renewable energy generation and the closure of Australia’s dirtiest coal power station, Hazelwood. NDEVR replicates the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports, but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR reports’ figures have been within 1% of the official figures when they are eventually released. The latest NDEVR figures include the last three months of 2017, allowing a comparison of calendar-year figures since records began in 2002, revealing 2017 had the highest emissions on record, when those from land-use change are excluded. Even including the unreliable land-use figures, overall emissions continued their overall upward trend, taking Australia further from the commitments it made in Paris to help keep global warming under 2C. It is even making its current target (a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels by 2030), which experts agree is not yet strong enough to comply with the Paris agreement, seem increasingly out of reach. In 2017, Australia’s total emissions from all sectors excluding land-use change came to 556.11m tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases, according to NDEVR’s projections. That surpassed the last record, set in just 2016, by 7.21m tonnes. Overall emissions including land-use change – which involves activities such as land clearing and forestry – were the highest since 2011, indicating a clear upward trend since that time, reversing years of declining emissions starting in 2007. Emissions from the electricity sector in the last three months of 2017 were the lowest they’ve been in the data set, going back to 2001. And in the full year, they were the second lowest, pipped only by 2013. But that reduction was overwhelmed by increases in other sectors. Emissions from transport were at a record high in the last three months of 2017, continuing a steady rise since the records began in 2001. Fugitive emissions, which include emissions from the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels, were also projected to be the highest on record. Stationary energy, which includes energy produced for industrial processes such as the growing LNG industry, was also projected to be at the equal highest on record, matching the previous quarter from July to September 2017."
"The Balearic islands’ government has launched a pioneering plan to phase out greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, potentially setting itself on a collision course with the Spanish government. Under the green manifesto, new diesel cars will be taken off the car market in Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera from 2025 – the same year that all street and road lighting will be replaced by LEDs.  Solar panels will be installed on all buildings with roof spans of more than 1,000 square metres – car parks, hospitals, supermarkets and sports stadiums – coal plants will be phased out and, by 2035, all car hire fleets on the islands will be electrified. Francina Armengol, the president of the Balearics’ socialist-green government, said their territorial limits made them “an ideal space to promote electromobility and to expand renewable energy so that it eventually becomes our only source of power.”  “We are very aware that plenty of the measures in the law we are announcing today demand efforts from the public and private sectors,” she said. “It has to be this way if the law is to be more than a mere statement of intent.” Joan Groizard, the islands’ director-general for climate change said the move put them on a path to confrontation with Madrid, and his government was studying the legal implications “very carefully”.  “There is a live debate about what regions can and can’t do, and we are working very practically on the legal side of this,” he told the Guardian. “We can’t ratify the Paris agreement on our own but we can take a decision to adhere to it. Climate change is already having a big impact on our islands and hopefully our actions can have a knock-on effect elsewhere.” Water bills on the archipelago have surged recently due to more frequent droughts and storms, while warming waters have brought seasonal jellyfish plagues and degraded marine ecosystems. Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has promised to bring forward a delayed national climate plan this year, as climate change concerns have grown.  But environmentalists have been alarmed by governmental attempts to seek a royal decree preventing the shutdown of coal plants in the country’s north. A ministry spokesperson said that public consultations for a draft climate law were still under way and that Spain maintained an ambitious renewables policy, despite biting cuts to subsidies. “In the Balearics, the difference [is that] the cost of energy production is subsidised and included in the electricity bill of all the Spanish citizens,” the official said. “Therefore, the energy policy [requires] consensus between the different Spanish administrations.” The question of whether Madrid or Spain’s regions exercise responsibility for energy policy will ultimately determine the fate of the Balearics climate plan. Last month, Spain’s constitutional court froze a similarly ambitious climate change act passed by the restive parliament in Catalonia. The Balearics government says that if its climate plan is blocked, it will refuse to upgrade its Alcúdia coal plant in Majorca in time to meet a 2020 deadline for new EU emissions limits. Most of the Balearics’ energy comes from this complex – whose planning permission approvals are controlled by the islanders’ government, according to Groizard.  “If we sit on our hands and do nothing then on 1 January 2020, the plant will not be able to work, because it will be in breach of the EU legislation,” he said. “We are hoping it won’t go that far. But we do have pockets of sovereignty – or power – that we’re planning to use if we need to.” Groizard argues that rather than spend €100m in compliance costs for a polluting plant, the money should be invested in clean energies. The Balearics’ plan would close one half of the coal plant by 2020 and the other half by 2030, after consultations with plant workers. Juan López de Uralde, a Green MP in Madrid said the plan had the potential to stir a wider rebellion. “If the government continues with its paralysis [on climate change], a united front could happen,” he said, citing Andalucia – currently drafting its own climate plan – Castilla La Manca, Valencia and Catalonia as potential allies. Marta Subirà, Catalonia’s environment minister, said climate shocks from rising sea levels and damage to two local deltas – along with heatwaves and forest fires – provided “a reason for this kind of [united] front”. The governments of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have already combined to prevent offshore drilling along their shared coast, and the Balearics had taken Catalonia’s climate law as “a role model”, Subirà said. “It is an alert to the Spanish government to tell them that this is the moment to act,” she told the Guardian. “They can’t hide anymore and we are ready to do it.”"

"The number of cities reporting they are predominantly powered by clean energy has more than doubled since 2015, as momentum builds for cities around the world to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Data published on Tuesday by the not-for-profit environmental impact researcher CDP found that 101 of the more than 570 cities on its books sourced at least 70% of their electricity from renewable sources in 2017, compared to 42 in 2015.  Nicolette Bartlett, CDP’s director of climate change, attributed the increase to both more cities reporting to CDP as well as a global shift towards renewable energy. The data was a “comprehensive picture of what cities are doing with regards to renewable energy,” she told Guardian Cities. That large urban centres as disparate as Auckland, Nairobi, Oslo and Brasília were successfully moving away from fossil fuels was held up as evidence of a changing tide by Kyra Appleby, CDP’s director of cities. “Reassuringly, our data shows much commitment and ambition,” she said in a statement. “Cities not only want to shift to renewably energy, but, most importantly – they can.” Much of the drive for climate action at city level in the past year has been spurred on by the global covenant of more than 7,400 mayors that formed in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. Burlington, Vermont, was the only US city reporting to CDP that sourced all of its power from renewable sources after having fully transitioned in 2015. Research from the Sierra Club states there are five such cities in the US in total. Burlington is now exploring how to become zero-carbon. Mayor Miro Weinberger said to CDP that its shift to a diverse mix of biomass, hydro, wind and solar power had boosted the local economy, and encouraged other cities to follow suit. Across the US 58 towns and cities, including Atlanta and San Diego, have set a target of 100% renewable energy. In Britain, 14 more cities and towns had signed up to the UK100 local government network’s target of 100% clean energy by 2050, bringing the total to 84. Among the recent local authority recruits were Liverpool City Region, Barking and Dagenham, Bristol, Bury, Peterborough, Redcar and Cleveland. But the CDP data showed 43 cities worldwide were already entirely powered by clean energy, with the vast majority (30) in Latin America, where more cities reported to CDP and hydropower is more widespread. In the six months to July, Latin American cities reported having instigated $183m of renewable energy projects – less than Europe ($1.7bn) or Africa ($236m). Europe topped the list for projects open for investment, but laid claim to just 20% of the 101 cities to be predominantly powered by clean energy.

"The science of climate change was on trial on Wednesday when leading experts testified about the threats of global warming in a US court while a fossil fuel industry lawyer fighting a high-profile lawsuit sought to deflect blame for rising sea levels. The hearing was part of a courtroom showdown between liberal California cities and powerful oil corporations, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and BP. San Francisco and Oakland have sued the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, arguing that they are responsible for damages related to global warming.  While climate change-related cases have entered courtrooms throughout the US, the judge in the California case, William Alsup, took the unusual step of convening a formal “tutorial” on the subject “so that the poor judge can learn some science”, allowing renowned experts and some of the biggest oil companies to answer key questions.  “From Chevron’s perspective, there’s no debate about climate science,” said Theodore Boutrous Jr, the attorney for the US oil giant, which chose not to have scientists or experts testify on its behalf. While he repeatedly referred to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclusion that it is “extremely likely” humans have been the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century, he also worked to paint the problem as an international one for which individual corporations are not liable.  “Climate change is a global issue that requires global engagement and global action,” he said, later saying “production and extraction” are not responsible for increases in emissions, but rather “economic and population growth” are, adding: “It’s the way people are living their lives.”  The attorney spoke for hours in a packed San Francisco courtroom of attorneys, journalists and activists who lined up early in the dark of morning to get a seat, with dozens forced into a crowded overflow room and many live-tweeting fact-checks and commentary.  The communities in California, known as a leader in climate activism, have argued that greenhouse gas emissions from the companies’ activities over time will cause billions of dollars’ worth of damage, have locked in significant rises in sea level, and are endangering lives. The defendants are accused of long knowing the environmental impact of their emissions and working to deny and conceal this knowledge.  The Chevron attorney also presented a graph showing that China is burning more coal than the US, saying: “It really goes to the global nature of this.” Environmentalists, however, pointed out that the assessment ignored cumulative emissions and that the US is the biggest carbon polluter in history. Don Wuebbles, who helped lead the 2013 IPCC assessment of climate science and 2014 US National Climate Assessment, testified for the cities and noted that Chevron was relying on outdated reports: “The science does not stop at 2012 … There’s a lot we have learned over the last five years.” He talked about severe weather incidents becoming more intense and noted that 2014 was “the warmest year on record”, adding: “2015 was warmer. 2016 was warmer yet.” Seventeen of the last 18 years were the warmest on record, he said.  Chevron did not present any science from climate deniers, but climate change contrarians with ties to Donald Trump’s administration have also gotten involved in the litigation, offering to contribute a presentation.  William Happer, a Princeton University physicist, rumored last year to be a frontrunner for Trump’s science adviser, co-authored a recent motion in the case that said: “It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.” He has previously described climate scientists as “a glassy-eyed cult”.  Alsup, known as an unorthodox judge, who memorably learned to code for a Silicon Valley intellectual property lawsuit, said he had read headlines comparing his hearing to the famous Scopes “monkey trial” on evolution in the US and urged reporters in the room not to blow the event out of proportion.  “If you get bored, you can just leave,” said Alsup, who said he wore his “science tie” with a solar system in honor of the hearing. Although there was no meaningful cross-examination, the five-hour hearing offered a window into how the oil corporations can attempt to simultaneously acknowledge human-caused climate change while trying to fight off this type of litigation. Courts across the globe have increasingly become the new frontline for climate action, and the San Francisco case could also build a factual foundation that could be cited in future suits.  At one point, Boutrous clarified that he was not speaking for the other companies, and Alsup at the end of the hearing ordered the other defendants to file motions saying whether they agreed with the Chevron attorney: “You can’t get away with sitting here in silence.” "
" Did you know that what’s on your plate plays a larger role in contributing to climate change than the car you drive? When most wealthy people think about their carbon footprint, or their contributions to climate change, they’ll think about where their electricity and heat come from or what they drive. They’ll think about fossil fuels and miles per gallon, about LED lights and mass transit – but not so much about combine harvesters or processed meals or food waste. Few consider the impacts of the food they eat, despite the fact that globally, food systems account for roughly one quarter of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. That’s more than the entire transportation sector, more than all industrial practices, and roughly the same as the production of electricity and heat.  Meanwhile, the most immediate threat of climate change for most of the global population will be at the dinner table, as our ability to grow critical staple crops is being affected by the warming we’ve already experienced. Between 1980 and 2008, for instance, wheat yields dropped 5.5 % and maize yields fell 3.8% due to rising temperatures. Climate change threatens the food security of millions of poor people around the world. Young people are increasingly keen to protect the environment by shifting to animal-product-free diets. They seek plant proteins which taste like meat, while insects are also growing popular as an alternative. What these inverse challenges – that food and agriculture are both enormous contributors to climate change, and massively impacted by it – really tell us is that our food systems, as currently structured, are facing major challenges. There is a much larger problem that implores us to look beyond farm and agricultural practices. We need to open our eyes to solutions that address the full scope of the challenge to create more sustainable and equitable food systems. That way, we can provide healthy food for all people while we protect our planet’s resources at the same time. So what are food systems? Everything from seed and soil to the supermarket to the plate to the landfill. Food systems include the growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. While farming alone accounts for 10-12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, when we look at entire food systems the contributions to climate change more than double. A recent report published by the Meridian Institute lays out the many factors throughout food systems that spell trouble for the climate, and also explains why a broad systems-wide perspective is necessary for implementing effective changes. Consider deforestation and soil. A narrow view of agriculture alone would neglect the fact that a full 80% of the forests that are clear cut or destroyed are done so to create farmland. Forests are massive carbon sinks. So is soil, locking away two to three times as much carbon as there is present in the atmosphere. But farmers can help restore ecosystem functions and build resilient communities by producing crops and livestock in productive ways that sequester carbon and protect forests. Or consider food waste. Not just the scraps that you throw away, but throughout the entire food system. A staggering 30-40% of the food produced in the world is never eaten. Some never gets harvested, some spoils before it reaches consumers, and a lot is tossed away by retailers, restaurants, and at home. For the sake of comparing emissions, if food waste were its own country it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, after only China and the United States.  This says nothing of the gross injustice of wasting so much food while so many in the world go hungry. In the developing world, improving infrastructure along the food chain – including cold storage – would prevent much good food being lost. In the developed world, retailers can prevent large amounts of waste by finding outlets for slightly blemished goods and consumers can limit waste by buying food in amounts they actually want and need. There are countless more examples of challenges and solutions all throughout the food system — from production of fertiliser to distribution systems to the production of dried and purified foods that make up processed meals to the diets and lifestyles of the public. Everyone has a role to play; these challenges cannot be solved in a vacuum. The complex, dynamic, and widely diverse forms of the world’s many food systems yield some wildly divergent outcomes in terms of nutrition, health, and environmental and climate impacts. It is critical that we start to better examine what works in some systems and what must be improved in others, in order to produce more equitable, just, and sustainable outcomes around the world. Just as there’s no universal crop that grows everywhere, there’s no “one size fits all” model food system to implement across the world. A broader systems-wide perspective is necessary if there is any hope for truly transformative change. It’s time to look beyond farming and agriculture and to see the whole picture, to create systems that cause less harm to the climate and are more resilient to the impacts we’re already suffering from global warming.  Food is a fundamental human need and to eat is a basic human right. Our food systems must deliver that need, fairly and equitably, without worsening the impacts of climate change."
"With snow on the ground, many people will have been huddling around a wood fire, but researchers are questioning if wood burning is really climate neutral. Burning wood is not CO2 free; it releases carbon, stored over the previous decades, in one quick burst. For an equal amount of heat or electricity, it releases more CO2 than burning gas, oil and even coal, so straight away we have more CO2 in the air from burning wood. This should be reabsorbed as trees regrow. For logs from mature Canadian woodland, it could take more than 100 years before the atmospheric CO2 is less than the alternative scenario of burning a fossil fuel and leaving the trees in the forest.   This matters to prevent climate tipping points such as an ice-free Arctic or shifting monsoon patterns before the wider decarbonisation can take place following the trajectories of the Paris and Kyoto agreements. Critics of this view say that the trees would never have been left to grow, but would instead have been chopped down for wood or paper. It seems that wood burning is not climate neutral in the short term and requires an increase in forested area to be climate neutral in the longer term."
"Cyclone Hola continued its path south-eastwards across the South Pacific this week, brushing along the northern-most fringes of New Zealand’s North Island. The cyclone, which intensified to category 4, brought with it heavy rain and strong winds in excess of 70mph to communities along the Bay of Plenty and Gisborne as well as to the country’s capital, Auckland. It was the third big storm to strike the country this year.  Across the Atlantic, in the northern and eastern parts of the US, a second “nor’easter” as coined by American meteorologists, brought further strong winds and heavy snowfall along the east coast, affecting the states of New York, Pennsylvania and Maine last Thursday.  A third winter storm is expected to strike during the coming days bringing strong winds and a mix of heavy rain and snowfall. The anomalous warmth in the Arctic, which in part was responsible for the swath of exceptional cold that swept through Europe over the past few weeks, has done little to maintain the extent of the sea ice in the region, which should now be approaching its typical maximum limit.  As it stands, and within the satellite record, the sea ice extent recording seems to have put this winter within the top three for having the lowest ice extent. And there has been a reduction in the ice cover over the last three consecutive winters.  "
"A huge expansion of irrigated crops in the Mildura region of the lower Murray is threatening to overtake the water available in the river, and has set the scene for a disaster if drought conditions return. A 16-day heatwave that hit the region this summer exposed the vulnerability of the Sunraysia and western New South Wales regions. During that time, the Murray-Darling basin’s water managers scrambled to meet demand, as the region experienced a run of days over 35C between 16 and 29 January. But it is the long-term scenario that has environmentalists and water authorities worried. Growth in permanent plantings, mainly water-intensive almond trees, has dramatically increased in the region.  In the 20 years from 1997 to 2015 the area under irrigation in the Sunraysia district increased by 41% or 45,000 hectares, according to the Sunrise project that uses aerial photos to map land use. There was some reversal during the millennium drought, but the pace of expansion has intensified in the past two years. An additional 4500ha of permanent plantings (mainly almonds) was planted last winter and another 15,500ha is due to go in over the next five years along the lower Murray. “The whole region is booming agriculturally,” Andrew Kremor, Lower Murray Water’s manager of customer and stakeholder relations, said. “Almonds are booming, table grapes are booming, even wine grapes.”  Kremor said Lower Murray Water had managed to meet demand during January’s hot spell by planning ahead, raising the level of water in storages and reminding users of conservation measures such as watering at night. But the Victorian Farmers Federation’s water council chairman, Richard Anderson, said the region had been “just days off facing major water restrictions”. He said: “If the hot weather had continued, we would have been in real trouble.” Anderson said the problem was likely to get worse because many of the almond trees had yet to reach maturity, which would increase the demand for water. Much of the irrigation expansion is also taking place on the basis of temporary water rights that are purchased each season, raising fears of what will happen if there is another drought. There is no real sense of what water is truly available. The ability to trade water throughout the Murray-Darling basin system has created a kind of gold rush. Under the Murray-Darling basin plan, it is possible to buy water rights outright or for a season from water holders and use them elsewhere in the river system. Restrictions are only triggered when river levels fall below certain thresholds. As well as issues around availability of water, there are also delivery constraints. The Bambah choke limits the flow of water from the upper Murray to the Sunraysia region.  Longtime resident of Mildura and celebrity chef Stefano de Pieri is worried. “Citrus is going very well, because of China. Also table grapes. People are investing a lot of money in almonds. At the moment they are doing well, but how long is a piece of string? Where do they get the confidence from?” “I am baffled because there is no real sense of what water is truly available and what is not,” he said. “Buying, selling, renting. No one can really guarantee me that this water is available.” In the millenium drought between 2005 and 2009, farmers in Mildura went through the heartbreak of having to leave citrus orchards and vineyards to wither. A number of family farms went under. De Pieri fears it will happen again. The Murray Darling Basin Authority, which has oversight of the basin plan acknowledges that the risk of not having enough water to meet demand in the lower Murray has gone up substantially. “From governments’ point of view – and that’s commonwealth and state governments – we are aware of the increasing development and are doing quite a bit of work on understanding what that will mean for future water demand,” said the MDBA’s executive director of river management, Andrew Reynolds. “We got through that peak period this year – we managed pretty well – but we are conscious that if development continues, the risk profile increases as well.” He said the MDBA’s role was to make sure investors were aware of the increasing risks and to provide information so they could make informed decisions. He said the MDBA was doing research on when nut plantations require their peak amount of water and how this would interact with demand from other crops. Reynolds said if another drought occurred the price of water rights was likely to rise sharply but this would likely prompt seasonal crop producers such as cotton and rice growers to sell their entitlements rather than plant. In Mildura, between 2005 and 2009 during the millennium drought, large areas under irrigation were left to die after farmers who had been reliant on purchasing temporary water found themselves facing impossible prices. At the moment Mildura feels like a boom town, riding on the water equivalent of a gold rush.   When the Guardian visited last week the coffee shops were full and the main street busy. Evidence of expansion of irrigation was everywhere, with new plantings taking root, literally. The local press was trumpeting the record prices being paid for irrigated properties.  Last week CK Life Sciences International, a company owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing paid $45m for citrus and grape producer Naniloc Colignan Farms. In 2016 the company snapped up Seven Fields at Redcliffs in 2016 for $90m. “The last 20 years has seen huge corporatisation and huge usage of big tracts of land to grow things. The game has changed. Whether the plan itself was the driver of this expansion, or the expansion itself is globally driven, it’s not clear,” De Pieri said. He says the risk will be to the remaining small family farmers who will face skyrocketing water prices in a dry season. “We are operating in a vacuum, it’s grab what you can, when you can,” says De Pieri."
"“The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time.” The mournful remark supposedly made by foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey at dusk on 3 August 1914 referred to Britain’s imminent entry into the first world war. But the sentiment captures something of our own moment, in the midst of an intensifying campaign against nature. According to the World Wildlife Fund’s 2016 Living Planet Report, over the last four decades the international animal population was reduced by nearly 60%. More than a billion fewer birds inhabit North America today compared to 40 years ago. In Britain, certain iconic species (grey partridges, tree sparrows, etc) have fallen by 90%. In Germany, flying insects have declined by 76% over the past 27 years. Almost half of Borneo’s orangutans died or were removed between 1999 and 2015. Elephant numbers have dropped by 62% in a decade, with on average one adult killed by poachers every 15 minutes. We inherited a planet of beauty and wonders – and we’re saying goodbye to all that. The cultural historian Paul Fussell once identified the catastrophe of the first world war with the distinctive sensibility of modernity, noting how 20th century history had “domesticate[d] the fantastic and normalize[d] the unspeakable.” Consider, then, the work of climate change. In February, for instance, scientists recorded temperatures 35 degrees above the historical average in Siberia, a phenomenon that apparently corresponded with the unprecedented cold snap across Europe. As concentrated CO2 intensifies extreme events, a new and diabolical weather will, we’re told, become the norm for a generation already accustomising itself to such everyday atrocities as about eight million tons of plastics are washed into the ocean each year. It may seem impossible to imagine, that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself, but that is what we’re now in the process of doing.” This passage from the New Yorker’s Elizabeth Kolbert concluded a piece on global warming, which was published way back in 2005. Over the 13 years since, the warnings from scientists have grown both more specific and desperate – and yet the march to destruction has only redoubled its pace. The extraordinary – almost absurd – contrast between what we should be doing and what’s actually taking place fosters low-level climate denialism. Coral experts might publicise, again and again and again, the dire state of the Great Barrier Reef but the ongoing political inaction inevitably blunts their message. It can’t be so bad, we think: if a natural wonder were truly under threat, our politicians wouldn’t simply stand aside and watch. The first world war killed 20 million people and maimed 21 million others. It shattered the economy of Europe, displaced entire populations, and set in train events that culminated, scarcely two decades later, with another, even more apocalyptic slaughter And it, too, was a disaster foretold, a widely-anticipated cataclysm that proceeded more-on-less schedule despite regular warnings about what was to come. As early as 1898, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia initiated a conference to discuss international arbitration and limit the arms race taking place in Europe. At its opening session at The Hague, he noted that the competition between nations, in which each country was building up its forces to defend against its neighbours, had “transform[ed] the armed peace into a crushing burden that weighs on all nations and, if prolonged, will lead to the very cataclysm that it seeks to avert.” Over the next years, the rivalries intensified, leading to further militarisation and a complex series of (often secret) treaties, as, between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the major powers increased by 50%. In 1912, the international socialist movement had staged an emergency meeting in Basel in Switzerland in which representatives from almost every nation spoke out for peace. “The great European peoples are constantly on the point of being driven against one another,” the congress resolved, “although these attempts are against humanity and reason cannot be justified by even the slightest pretext of being in the interest of the people.” Yet in early 1914, Winston Churchill noted that “the world is arming as it has never armed before”. The eventual declaration of war in August that year was still a shock – but only in the sense that those attending a patient expiring from a long illness might be startled by the death rattle. The appeals to humanity and reason did not move states jostling for trade and commercial advantages. For the people of Europe, the arms race was disastrous; for specific governments, it made perfect sense, for those who did not compete risked falling behind. The same might be said today. From a global perspective, the necessity to abandon fossil fuels cannot be denied. But for individual economies, change risks undermining comparative advantages. If we don’t sell coal, says Malcolm Turnbull, our competitors will – which was, of course precisely the logic of the British fleet expansion in 1908. The devastation of the first world war eventually engendered a wave of revolt from a populace appalled at the carnage their politicians had wrought. Climate change has not yet spurred an equivalent of the mutinies in France or the revolution in Petrograd or the uprising in Berlin. Yet Labor’s appalling equivocation over the Adani mine – a piece of environmental vandalism for which there can be no justification – illustrates the urgency with which we need a new and different type of politics. The stakes could not be higher. Lamps are going out all over the natural world … and no one will ever see them lit again. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"The voice of Australia’s coal lobby is under renewed threat as the country’s second biggest miner, Rio Tinto, faces a shareholder revolt over its membership of lobby groups including the Minerals Council of Australia and the role it plays in Australia’s climate and energy debate. Global investors worth $84bn have joined together to file a shareholder motion calling on Rio Tinto to rethink its membership of the MCA, NSW Minerals Council (NSWMC) and the Queensland Resources Council (QRC). It demands Rio Tinto reveal all membership fees paid since 2012, review the consistency of the MCA’s lobbying positions with those held by Rio Tinto, and disclose what it would take for Rio to quit its membership of the MCA.  The action was coordinated by the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which is fresh from successfully forcing the country’s biggest miner, BHP, to agree to similar demands. If the campaign successfully forces both companies to leave the MCA, it would remove about a third of the MCA’s revenue from membership fees. As such, even the threat of leaving could force the MCA to shift its lobbying positions. When ACCR coordinated a similar motion filed at BHP’s annual general meeting, despite it not winning a vote, BHP agreed to conduct a review of industry associations. That review announced plans to leave the World Coal Association, and declared BHP would quit the MCA if it did not change the way it lobbied for coal. The resolution filed today was submitted by the Australian Local Government Super, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Seventh Swedish National Pension Fund (AP7). Together they have $84bn worth of assets under management, and collectively are thought to hold more than $100m worth of Rio Tinto shares. The resolution is unlikely to gain a majority of votes at the two AGMs held in the UK and Australia (Rio is listed in London and Sydney), but even a significant minority of votes would send a strong signal and could secure a win for ACCR, as it did with BHP. Despite BHP already agreeing to many of the demands before the AGM voted on the resolution, and the board recommending shareholders vote against it, about 10% of shareholders voted in favour. Brynn O’Brien, the executive director of ACCR, said that was significant, and anything above 5% was taken very seriously by a board. O’Brien expected more shareholders to support the Rio Tinto motion because it was backed by large institutional investments, unlike the BHP motion, and hoped the board would recommend that shareholders support the motion. “We think this is really in the company’s interest, so the board should support it and recommend that shareolders vote for it,” she said. Such a move would not be unprecedented for Rio Tinto. In 2016, the company was faced with a shareholder motion calling for greater transparency on how it deals with climate risk, and the board supported it, recommending shareholders vote in favour. Bill Hartnett, head of sustainability at Local Government Super, one of the co-filers of the motion, said high energy prices in Australia were a result of the prolonged climate and energy debate here, and that was harming the value of their investment in Rio Tinto. “We estimate that these high electricity prices are adding tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to Rio Tinto’s overall costs,” he said. “The shareholder value in supporting industry groups with contrary energy and climate positions is not clear to LGS, particularly as Rio has exited the thermal coal business in Australia.” Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, said Rio’s support of the Paris climate agreement demanded that it not support lobbying that is counter to the agreement’s aims. “For Rio Tinto to be part of the solution to climate change requires consistency in all the company’s activities and from the organisations it supports to lobby on its behalf,” Matthews said. The wording of the resolution is similar to that filed with BHP, and laments climate and energy policy, when it exists in Australia, being “short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies”. It also outlines the way the MCA and other pro-coal lobby groups supported by Rio Tinto have campaigned for the destruction of Australia’s carbon tax and mining tax, and pushed for government funding for coal power stations. O’Brien said the shareholder motion is part of a growing and unstoppable movement from investors around the world. “The drumbeat of opposition to coal lobbyists like the Minerals Council of Australia is only growing louder. The interest by European funds in this resolution reflects the fact that Australia’s inaction on climate and energy has impacts beyond our borders,” she said. Dylan Tanner is executive director of InfluenceMap, a UK-based NGO that tracks how corporations influence climate policy around the world. He said his group has seen a rise in interest from investors to improve the role companies in their portfolios play in climate and energy debates. “We have detected a genuine uptick in concern recently and I personally feel 2018 will be the year shareholders get tough on companies who maintain links to egregious lobbyists holding back critical policy progress on a key existential threat to our common future,” he said. The shareholder revolt has come on the same day as the corporate regulator began legal proceedings in the federal court against Rio, its former chief executive Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer Guy Elliott.  The proceedings relate to statements in Rio Tinto’s annual report for 2011, which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges were misleading or deceptive. In December 2010, Rio announced a takeover offer for Riversdale Mining Limited which was completed in August 2011 at a total cost of over US$4bn. Following the acquisition, Rio delisted Riversdale and renamed it Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique. Asic alleges that Rio Tinto engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by misrepresenting the reserves and resources of Riversdale in its 2011 annual report. On 17 January 2013, Rio Tinto announced it expected to recognise a non-cash impairment charge of approximately US$14bn (post-tax) in its 2012 full-year results, including roughly US$3bn relating to Riversdale. It was also announced that Albanese, an American, had stepped down from his role as CEO. "
"Phoenix gets hot. But not usually as hot as last June, when the mercury at the airport one day soared above 48C. That exceeded the maximum operating temperature for several aircraft ready for take-off. They didn’t fly. More than 50 flights were cancelled or rerouted. Thanks to climate change, soon 48C may not seem so unusual. Welcome to the precarious future of aviation in a changing climate. As the world warms and weather becomes more extreme, aircraft designers, airport planners and pilots must all respond, both in the air and on the ground. With about 100,000 flights worldwide carrying eight million passengers every day, this is a big deal.  Why is heat a problem for planes? In a word: lift. Lift is the upward force created by diverting air around wings as an aircraft moves down the runway. It is harder to achieve when the air is scorching hot, because hot air is thinner than cold air. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) warned in 2016 that as a result, higher temperatures “could have severe consequences for aircraft take-off performance.” Aircraft will need to jettison passengers, cargo or fuel to get the same lift on a hot day, raising costs and requiring more flights. “Weight restrictions are likely to have the most effect on long-haul flights, which often take off near the airplane’s maximum weight,” says Ethan Coffel, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University. “Possible adaptations include rescheduling flights to cooler times of the day or lengthening runways.” Daytime heat is why long-distance flights out of the Middle East already regularly take off in the cool of the night. But the same will soon apply in the US and southern Europe. That will create problems in places where night and early-morning flights are restricted to help people on the ground sleep. Future lighter and more fuel-efficient planes will help, says Coffel. But it means the anticipated economic and environmental gains from such advances may be largely offset by coping with warmer air. Once in the air, flying will feel different too, especially in and around the jet stream, for instance when crossing the Atlantic. “At cruising altitudes, the north-south temperature difference that drives the jet stream is increasing,” says Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK. Flying east is becoming quicker in the stronger winds that result, but flying west will be slower. Airline schedulers will need to take the altered flight times into consideration in the future – and flyers may need to be prepared for more frustrating airport announcements of delayed incoming flights. Flights will also be bumpier, says Williams. “Stronger winds will increase the amount of shear in the jet stream,” he says. Shear creates turbulence – particularly what is called “clear-air turbulence,” which occurs away from storm clouds and is hard for pilots to spot and fly round. “The increase in clean-air turbulence has the potential to be quite disruptive,” says Williams. In other words, get used to keeping your seatbelts fastened. Climate change will also increase the number and intensity of thunderstorms, and push them upward into cruising altitudes. That will make flying trickier and could dramatically increase the risk of one of the most worrying upper-air phenomena for pilots: high-altitude icing. High-altitude ice is a feature of thunderstorms, and it is dangerous. The infiltration of tiny particles of ice into turbofan engines has been blamed for more than 100 engine failures in recent years. In the most notorious high-altitude icing accident, an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009 crashed, killing all aboard, when it stalled after the autopilot disconnected when ice crystals disabled its speed sensors. Officials of the European Aviation Safety Agency have blamed climate change – along with the failure of aircraft designers to reassess the risks – for the growing frequency of engine failures and other faults due to high-altitude icing. Worryingly, modern energy-efficient lean-burn engines may be more susceptible, Herbert Puempel, an aviation expert at the World Meteorological Organization, warned in the group’s journal. Some of the most expensive climate-change problems for the aviation industry will be on the ground. That’s because many runways are in places they really shouldn’t be. Take Iqaluit airport in northern Canada. The permafrost on which it was built is melting. The runway and taxiway have had to be resurfaced as a result. And the melting is deepening. There will be other such cases. But a more frequent problem is likely to be flooding. Many airports are built on flat, low-lying land, by the ocean or in drained swamps. Such places can be hard to drain and vulnerable to rising sea levels and more intense storms. When Superstorm Sandy hit New York City in 2012, a storm surge 12ft high inundated the runways of LaGuardia, closing the airport for three days. A tropical storm hitting so far north is widely regarded as an effect of climate change. So expect more such extreme weather. LaGuardia certainly is. Two-and-a-half years after Sandy struck, New York governor Andrew Cuomo put aside $28m to install new flood barriers and drains at the airport. Sandy was a wake-up call. A federal climate assessment subsequently found 13 major US airports at similar risk, from Honolulu to Miami. Included in the list are San Francisco and Oakland airports, both built on low-lying reclaimed land along the shore of San Francisco Bay. Civilian airport authorities have been slow to address the issue, but the US military is more proactive. A Pentagon analysis of climate-related risk to military infrastructure, published in January this year, gave pride of place to threats to airfields from sea level rise, storms and high temperatures. Internationally, there is also rising concern. The scientific consensus is that sea level rise probably won’t be more than one metre this century. But airport authorities believe that they must adapt to much higher waters during storm surges such as that experienced at LaGuardia. Singapore’s Changi airport, one of the world’s busiest, is raising its new passenger terminal 5.5m above sea level as a precaution against future storm tides. Hong Kong is constructing a wall, eight miles (13km) long, around a new runway. By those standards, dozens of the world’s great airports should be thinking about runway protection. Bangkok, Schiphol in the Netherlands, Sydney, both airports in Shanghai, London City airport and Kansai near Osaka all fall short. Maybe more radical solutions are required. Back in the 1990s, Japan built a 1km floating airstrip in Tokyo Bay as a “scale model” for a full-size floating airport that could rise with the tides. Whether the threat is too much heat for take-off, too much ice to stay in the air or too much water to land, most airports and airlines are approaching climate change as a problem they will address as it arises. But the stark truth, says Coffel, is that the future is now."
"A majority of Australians would support phasing out coal power by 2030, including half the people in a sample identifying as Coalition voters, according to a survey by a progressive thinktank. The research funded by the Australia Institute says 60% of a sample of 1,417 Australians surveyed by online market research firm Research Now supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to phase out coal power by 2030.  The Powering Past Coal Alliance – spearheaded by the UK and Canada – was unveiled at the COP23 climate talks in Bonn. The agreement is not legally binding, and the membership does not include Australia or other major coal exporters and users. The survey suggests there is a core level of support across Australia’s partisan divide for signing on, with 50% of Coalition voters supportive as well as 67% of ALP voters. The significant dissenters were One Nation voters, with only 36% supportive. A majority of Australians also supported increasing ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with 58% support, including 47% of Coalition voters in the sample. “The strong majority support for phasing out coal power shows how far the community is ahead of the government on climate change,” said the Australia Institute’s deputy director, Ebony Bennett. She said the Turnbull government’s approach on climate and energy policy meant Australia was at risk of missing out on jobs and investment associated with a global boom in renewable energy, and was out of step with public sentiment. The research follows a declaration on Wednesday at the National Press Club by the resources minister Matt Canavan that he was not interested in contemplating a discussion about a just transition for workers displaced by any phase out of coal consistent with Australia’s international climate obligations. Canavan said workers suffered when industries shut down or were phased out so euphemisms like “just transitions” were best avoided. “I don’t like the term transition, let’s be frank, if you want to shutdown the coal industry, say it – that’s what will happen.” The resources minister said expanding the coal industry was “not inconsistent with the obligations we’ve got to reduce carbon emissions”. He said countries were increasing investment in high-efficiency coal plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris accord. Canavan did not mention that some countries, such as Japan, are increasing investment in high-efficiency coal because of a phase-out of nuclear power. Canavan also declared in response to a question about balancing his portfolio responsibilities to boost the resources sector with his responsibilities to the Queenslanders who elected him that he had been elected to parliament “on a platform that is unashamedly pro-coal”. While Canavan was elected because he was given a winnable position on the LNP’s Queensland Senate ticket, the resources minister said: “I got elected on the basis I will support the resources sector.”"
"In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant, which means that if it poses a threat to public health or welfare, the EPA must regulate it under the Clean Air Act. In 2009, the EPA completed its review of the climate science literature and correctly concluded in its Endangerment Finding that carbon pollution poses such a threat via climate change. That document is the foundation for all government climate policies, including the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan. Climate deniers have thus long had their sights set on revoking the Endangerment Finding. That’s a tall order, since the scientific literature is crystal clear on this question. House Republicans first tried to simply rewrite the Clean Air Act to state the greenhouse gases aren’t pollutants, but they failed to get nearly enough support to pass that legislation. Next they proposed setting up a ‘Red Team’ of climate deniers to debate the mainstream climate science ‘Blue Team.’ But Trump’s chief of staff John Kelly worried that having this prominent debate on the record would be a distraction and potentially expose the administration to litigation, so he killed the idea.   However, E&E News reports that Pruitt has a safer Plan B: take public comments on petitions asking EPA to revisit the Endangerment Finding. This would appease the deniers by allowing them to officially make their case, but the EPA wouldn’t be under any obligation to take action. It’s a fight Pruitt knows he would lose in court, because the science is not on the deniers’ side, so he would prefer to simply weaken the Clean Power Plan, eliminate as many other federal climate policies as possible, and delay all US climate action until the clock runs out on the Trump administration. There have been two petitions filed against the Endangerment Finding. The first was submitted by a group of climate contrarians who failed to understand basic climate science. I discussed the fundamental mistakes in their arguments last year. The second petition was submitted by two fossil fuel-funded think tanks: the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Science and Environmental Policy Project. It tried to refute the Endangerment Finding’s three lines of evidence supporting human-caused global warming:  1) Scientists’ basic physical understanding of factors that impact the climate system like the increasing greenhouse effect and natural influences. 2) Scientific evidence that global warming over the last several decades is ‘unusual.’ 3) The use of climate models to simulate the patterns resulting from natural and human-caused climate change. To refute the first point, the petition claimed that there’s been “the absence of any strong warming trend.” To support this argument, the deniers considered only atmospheric temperature estimates from satellite data, which have much larger uncertainty than data collected by thousands of thermometers at Earth’s surface. Even the satellite data best estimates is that the lower atmosphere has warmed 0.15–0.3°C over the past 20 years, depending on which data set we use. But atmospheric temperatures are just a small part of the global warming story. Surface temperatures have warmed about 0.35°C during that time. 2014, 2015, and 2016 each broke the record, and 2017 was the hottest year on record at Earth’s surface without an El Niño event. Moreover, the oceans have continued to break heat records and natural thermometers like melting ice and earlier seasons have also continued to show signs of rapid global warming. And the petition didn’t even dispute the Endangerment Finding’s point that climate scientists understand the factors like the greenhouse effect that impact global temperatures. So their effort to refute this point failed on every possible level. Instead of successfully refuting the Endangerment Finding’s basis, they basically just denied the very existence of global warming once again. To refute the Endangerment Finding’s second point that recent global warming is unusual, the petition argued that global temperatures have been both hotter and colder in the past, so we’re “within the bounds of natural variability.” This fails to address the point that global temperatures are now warming 20 to 50 times faster than during Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. The petition then again went off-topic, arguing that recent warming is due to solar activity (which has had a cooling effect over the past 60 years) and natural cycles (which don’t cause long-term temperature trends). And to refute the Endangerment Finding’s third point, the petition argued that climate models are inaccurate. To make this argument, the deniers relied on an error-riddled chart produced by John Christy, which was refuted by a peer-reviewed study last year (which the petition neglects to mention). And again, the chart only considered atmospheric temperature estimates from satellite data; the petition ignored the remarkable accuracy of climate models in simulating global surface temperatures and other climate change patterns. The evidence supporting human-caused global warming is overwhelming, which is why there’s a 97% expert consensus on the subject. To argue the contrary, or at least that global warming is overblown, deniers are forced to resort to cherry picking data. And even their cherry-picked data confirms global warming. Deniers have already lost this debate in the peer-reviewed literature. John Kelly is right to fear the distraction and potential liability of associating the Trump administration with these terrible arguments. Kelly is a military man, and the military doesn’t have the luxury of denying the threats posed by climate change.  But if they can appease the deniers by allowing them to make these bogus arguments in comments that the EPA can largely ignore, Pruitt and Kelly will view it as a win-win outcome. As long as the Endangerment Finding stands so that the next administration can use it to implement climate policies, it’s a win for all of us."

"Ministers have been urged to bring forward their 2040 ban on new diesel and petrol car sales by a decade, a move which an environmental thinktank said would almost halve oil imports and largely close the gap in the UK’s climate targets. The Green Alliance said a more ambitious deadline of 2030 is also needed to avoid the UK squandering its leadership on electric cars. While the number of electric cars being sold in the UK has rocketed in the past four years, Germany overtook the UK last year in its rise in the registrations of new plug-in hybrids and 100% battery-powered cars. A 2030 ban on combustion engine models would boost sales of electrified cars in the UK and even raise the prospect of the country becoming an net vehicle exporter, the Green Alliance said. While the UK lags behind Germany on conventional car manufacturing, a fifth of the electric cars sold in Europe in 2016 were made at Nissan’s Sunderland plant in north-east England. BMW has pledged to make its electric Mini at its plant in Oxford, but UK-headquartered Jaguar Land Rover chose to build its first flagship electric car, the i-Pace, in Austria. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “The government’s recent industrial strategy cites clean growth as one of the biggest economic opportunities for the UK, but if we keep building and buying dirty cars we’ll miss the growth opportunity of the century.” The transport sector overtook energy in 2016 as the UK’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, as power generation has switched away from coal and towards renewables. Carbon emissions from the average new car also rose last year for the first time in nearly two decades, as drivers opted for bigger models. The Green Alliance found that an earlier phase-out for new diesels and petrol cars would affect the looming gap in the UK’s legally binding 2030 climate target. A 2030 deadline would cut the gap by 85%, or 98 million tonnes CO2e. Sticking with a 2040 date would also lead to fossil-fuelled cars causing air pollution until the second half of the century, the thinktank said, given the average UK car is scrapped after 14 years. Four committees of MPs last week warned that air pollution is a “national health emergency” and called on the government to take tougher action. Earlier action would also ease the UK’s reliance on oil imports at a time when oil and gas production from the North Sea is declining. Imports would be cut by nearly 50% by 2035, saving up to an estimated £6.63bn each year, the thinktank said. While ministers last summer followed France by pledging to halt new petrol and diesel car sales by 2040, other countries are looking to ban them years earlier. Scotland is aiming for 2032, India wants to only sell electric models by 2030 and Norway, the world leader on the take-up of battery-powered cars, has set a 2025 deadline. The Green Alliance said the government could take several other measures to sustain the UK’s leadership on electric cars, including public procurement. A grant of up to £4,500 to buyers of electric cars should also be extended, the group said, and government could further help by setting manufacturers sales targets for electric cars, starting at 15% of all cars sold in 2022 and rising to 45% by 2025. The car industry body, the SMMT, said outright bans on petrol and diesels risked harming the new car market, and the sector could be undermined if not given enough time to adjust."
"When Billy Graham stands before the judgment seat of God, he may finally realize how badly he failed his country, and perhaps his God. On civil rights and the environmental crisis, the most important issues of his lifetime, he championed the wrong policies. Graham was on the wrong side of history. The world’s most famous evangelist let his apocalyptic anticipation of the coming kingdom of God blind him to the realities of living in this world. For Graham, the Bible had a clear message for Christians living in what he believed were humans’ last days on earth. Individuals alone can achieve salvation; governments cannot. Conversions change behaviors; federal policies do not.  These convictions shaped the evangelist’s views on civil rights. In the late 1950s, Graham integrated his revivals and seemed to support the burgeoning civil rights movement. This is the Graham most Americans remember. But as the movement grew, expanded and became increasingly confrontational, the evangelist’s position changed. Once leaders like Martin Luther King Jr began practicing civil disobedience and asking for the federal government to guarantee African Americans’ rights, Graham’s support evaporated. Within days of the publication of King’s famous 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Graham told reporters that the Baptist minister should “put the brakes on a little bit”. He criticized civil rights activists for focusing on changing laws rather than hearts. In 1971, Graham published The Jesus Generation, a book on the coming apocalypse. Looking for signs of Jesus’s second coming had become an obsession of Graham’s, as it was for millions of other evangelicals in the mid-20th century. In the book, Graham praised the wisdom of young people who rejected the federal government as a tool for rectifying injustices. Graham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era, but he squandered it “These young people don’t put much stock in the old slogans of the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier and the Great Society,” he said. “They believe that utopia will arrive only when Jesus returns. Thus these young people are on sound Biblical ground.” For six decades, Graham taught Americans that the federal government could not be an instrument of God to bring about justice, not on race matters and not on other significant issues. Although he believed in racial equality, his theology blinded him to what we now know was the best means for achieving that equality. More recently, the evangelist denied the threat of global warming and rejected federal efforts to stymie it. In a 1992 book focused on the signs that the world was nearing its end, the preacher suggested that if humankind were going to survive, businesses needed to reduce pollution and stop contributing to global warming. In a revised 2010 version of the book, Graham eliminated the phrase “global warming” from the text altogether. Global warming no longer existed in the mind of Graham as a real threat. He went on to assure readers that the earth would not “be saved through legislation”. The federal government, he indicated, had no business passing laws to protect the earth for future generations. Graham’s positions on civil rights and the environment are not those of a rightwing crank, or of a paranoid anti-intellectual. Graham takes his Bible and his theology seriously. The political positions he has embraced derive from a careful and serious study of the scriptures. Graham came of age during Franklin Roosevelt’s vast expansion of government power. But rather than join with social gospel advocates like Roosevelt’s aide Harry Hopkins in promoting the creation of a welfare state to serve the needy, the future evangelist was more influenced by apocalypse-obsessed, fundamentalist rabble rousers who rejected New Deal liberalism. Graham, like most fundamentalists of his generation, determined that the New Deal state represented godless competition for the churches rather than a potential ally. This is a message that appeared again and again in Graham’s many books on Jesus’s second coming. Only the return of Jesus would right social wrongs, he concluded. The expansion of state power, in contrast, was a necessary precursor to the rise of the antichrist. The evangelist felt sure that as we approached the end of time, the world’s governments were going to take away Christians’ rights and liberties. The New Deal, with its intrusive regulations, was the first step; Obamacare, with its contraception mandates, the most recent. Yet Graham insisted that the inevitability of the second coming was no justification for indifference. “We must not feel that we are to sit back and do nothing to fight evil just because some day the four horsemen will come with full and final force upon the earth,” Graham wrote. Instead, he prodded evangelicals to elect people to office who shared his anti-statist worldview. They did. White evangelicals have played an outsized role in recent political campaigns, supporting every Republican presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.  Graham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era. He could have pushed them to take social reform seriously as a God-given mandate to save the world from environmental destruction. He could have tackled racism, America’s original sin, by championing the federal government’s aggressive civil rights policies. But he squandered it. He could not overcome the speculative end-times schemes of his cohort of evangelicals, with their anti-government hostilities. Graham had good intentions, as his work desegregating his crusades demonstrated. But when his influence really would have counted, when he could have effected real change, real social transformation, he was too locked into last-days fearmongering to recognize the potential of the state to do good. We are all paying the price. A different kind of last days may soon be upon us. Racial tensions are rising, the earth is warming, and evangelicals are doing little to help. That may be Graham’s most significant, and saddest, legacy."
"The government has rejected plans for an opencast coal mine in Northumberland on the grounds that it would exacerbate climate change. Eighteen months after Sajid Javid first took responsibility for a planning decision for a new coal mine at Highthorn, the communities secretary said he had concluded the project should not go ahead.  Environmental lawyers ClientEarth said the decision was the first time the UK government had rejected a planning application citing climate change as the reason. Coal is the dirtiest fuel on the planet and emissions from its use as a source of heat and energy make it historically the single largest threat to our climate. But it is also the largest source of electricity in the world, providing 41% of our electricity needs. Clean coal relies on a series of technologies known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). In 2015, the International Energy Agency calculated that CCS could help reduce global carbon emissions by 13%, delivering a huge chunk of reductions needed by 2050 to keep below a 2C rise. CCS technology aims to capture carbon dioxide generated at coal plants and store it underground in rock formations and aquifers. But so far no major coal power plant has managed to make CCS work on a grand scale. Costs have proved prohibitive - especially as low natural gas prices have made coal uncompetitive.  Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This is a significant victory for local residents and the climate, it means an important step forward has been taken in ending the era of fossil fuels.” Explaining Javid’s decision, officials said: “He concludes that overall the scheme would have an adverse effect on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change of very substantial significance, which he gives very considerable weight in the planning balance.” The communities secretary said the impact on global warming, together with harm to the local landscape, outweighed the economic benefits of the mine. Banks Mining, which submitted its planning application in 2015 and had argued the project would bring substantial investment to the local area, hit out at what it branded a “perverse decision”. Gavin Styles, the company’s managing director, said: “It has been made for purely political reasons and is totally contrary to the principles of local decision-making that previously appeared so important to Mr Javid.” The company said it had not yet decided whether to appeal. The use of coal for electricity generation has plummeted in the face of carbon taxes and competition from gas, but the Highthorn site is not the UK’s only proposed new coal mine. West Cumbria Mining wants to build a £200m mine at Woodhouse in Cumbria, south of Kendal, which would be the UK’s first deep coal mine in several decades. The company plans to extract metallurgical coal for steel-making rather than power generation. Cumbria county council has so far postponed meetings on the project, and late May is understood to be the earliest it will decide whether to approve or reject the mine. Two coal power stations this year have already announced closure plans, after which the UK will have just six coal plants."
"   California is a hotbed of climate change activism, so it perhaps wasn’t a surprise to see the cities of San Francisco and Oakland sue the world’s largest oil companies last year for allegedly knowing about the dire consequences of global warming while seeking to downplay or deny it. More striking is the approach of the judge in the case, the unorthodox William Alsup. The judge, who previously learned coding techniques for a Silicon Valley lawsuit, has set out a list of questions for a climate change “tutorial” on the floor of the courtroom on Wednesday. We’ve sought to help out the judge by answering his queries. The onset and decline of ice ages on Earth over the past few million years have been primarily influenced by slight changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun, which alters the amount of sunlight bombarding the polar regions.  The last ice age started melting away around 19,000 years ago, which raised the global sea level by around 120 metres. The “little ice age” wasn’t a true ice age – rather a period of relative cooling in the northern hemisphere up until the 19th century, probably to do with volcanic eruptions and reduced solar activity. Since then, there has been a sharp decline in glaciers and sea ice driven by human-caused warming, rather than any other factor.  It’s rather complex, but basically the molecules of gases such as carbon dioxide are able to bend and slow down solar radiation bouncing off the Earth and returning to space. Nitrogen and oxygen aren’t able to do this and so do not have the same greenhouse impact upon the planet.  Infrared radiation from the sun hits the Earth and reflects back off the surface. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere intervene by trapping this heat and preventing it from escaping.  As the world’s factories, vehicles and farms pump out tens of billions of tons of greenhouse gases every year, this has caused the Earth to warm by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century.  A bit, but not enough to really matter.  All that human activity does give off heat, although it’s dwarfed by the heating caused by greenhouse gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates this direct heat is around one hundredth the size of greenhouse gas-driven heat. The equation is slightly different in some large cities, however, due to the urban heat island phenomenon.  Alsup’s grade school was right – humans (and other animals) breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. But this expulsion of CO2 is in balance with the world around us. Say you eat a potato. In the months before you ate it, the potato grew by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Your meal provides you with some energy and you then breathe back out the CO2. So the process is essentially carbon neutral. Extra carbon is being released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, which have been buried in rocks for hundreds of millions of years. Plants and oceans are sucking up a huge amount of this extra CO2, but not all of it. The result is a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean.  The burning of huge amounts of coal, oil and gas to power our homes, vehicles and factories.  Losing an area of world’s forests equivalent to the size of New Zealand each year through cutting and fire isn’t helping either. The US Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, is also puzzled by this one, but the scientific community has been clear – the primary cause of recent warming has been the emission of carbon dioxide, along with other gases such as methane.  Human activity is the “dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century” according to the US government’s latest climate assessment, with industrialization likely responsible for 0.6C to 0.8C in warming since the early 1950s. "
"California’s exposure to climate change has been laid bare with warnings that San Francisco faces a far worse threat from rising seas than previously thought, while the agricultural heart of the state will increasingly struggle to support crops such as peaches, walnuts and apricots as temperatures climb. The findings, from two new scientific studies, come as California’s neighboring west coast states Oregon and Washington have both faltered in their legislative attempts to address climate change and deliver a rebuke to Donald Trump’s dismissal of the issue. The problems faced by the progressive coastal bastions have been sobering on two fronts: not only is the western flank of the US experiencing the escalating consequences of climate change, but widespread Democratic dominance at state level has failed to enact ambitious policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “The states are struggling to fill the gap for the federal government on climate change,” said Nives Dolsak, of the school of marine and environmental affairs at the University of Washington. “In Washington, we are holding a very good policy hostage because it’s not perfect. Inclusion and equity concerns means we are losing momentum and public support on climate change.” The quibbling comes as climate change tightens its grip on the west coast. San Francisco can lay claim to being one of the greenest cities in the US, through its embrace of clean energy, mandated recycling and banning of single-use plastic bags, yet it faces a steep challenge to avoid the ravages of sea level rise. Researchers using satellite-based radar and GPS have discovered large areas of land beside the San Francisco bay is sinking, exacerbating the threat from sea level rise and storms. Places such as San Francisco airport, Foster City and Treasure Island are subsiding by as much as 10mm a year, doubling the area previously considered at risk of flooding by the end of the century, according to the Science Advances-published study.  In all, around 48 to 166 sq miles of the bay’s shoreline is set to be prone to flooding, even under a moderate rate of sea level rise. This scenario would worsen if melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica trigger a far faster rate of ocean expansion.   “There are about 7 million people living on the bay who could be vulnerable” said Patrick Barnard, a geologist at the US Geological Survey who wasn’t involved in the research. “A huge number of people along the west coast are in low-lying areas, in Los Angeles and San Francisco all the way up to Seattle. All the options will have to be on the table, from replenishing coastal marshes to sea walls to managed retreat.” California is facing a buffeting from increased flooding – around $763bn if its assets are exposed to inundation – at the same time as parts of its agriculture base declines due to rising temperatures.  Recent University of California research found that the yield of some crops could drop by 40% by 2050, with the situation becoming so severe by the end of the century that peaches, walnuts and apricots may be unviable in the central valley. Almonds, avocados, cherries and strawberries also face sharp crop declines. Faced with such threats, the governors of California, Washington and Oregon have spearheaded criticism of Trump for taking a hammer to national climate policies and withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accords. But progress hasn’t been much easier closer to home. While California has a statewide emissions reduction scheme, it has clashed with the Trump administration over the state’s stringent vehicle fuel standards. And California’s neighbors to the north are struggling to demonstrate that states can compensate for the lack of federal action on climate change, even those where Democrats have a firm grip on power.  Last week, an effort to introduce the first straight tax on carbon dioxide emissions failed in Washington state, with governor Jay Inslee admitting it couldn’t pass the Democrat-controlled senate. “On the arc of history, we’re not quite far along enough on the arc,” said Inslee, a Democrat and vocal proponent of action on climate change. “That day will come, but it wasn’t quite here yet.”  The tax, which would’ve started at $20 per ton CO2 emitted, faced criticism it would increase the cost of energy or, conversely, that it wouldn’t generate sufficient money for clean energy programs. Meanwhile, in Oregon, another state dominated by elected Democrats, lawmakers failed to agree on a cap on greenhouse gases and will instead revisit the issue in 2019. The stuttering progress of climate change policies sits awkwardly with international assurances from the broad coalition opposed to Trump that the US has not given up on tackling dangerous global warming. “Rather than getting bogged down in how money from a carbon tax would be spent, we need to make climate change a bipartisan issue again,” said Aseem Prakash, the director of the center for environmental politics at the University of Washington.  “Environment groups need to reach out to Republicans for workable policy, not policy that’s perfect in every single way.” "
"In a California court case this week, Judge William Alsup asked the two sides to provide him a climate science tutorial. The plaintiffs are the coastal cities of San Francisco and Oakland. They’re suing five major oil companies (Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP) to pay for the cities’ costs to cope with the sea level rise caused by global warming. Chevron’s lawyer presented the science for the defense, and most notably, began by explicitly accepting the expert consensus on human-caused global warming, saying:  From Chevron’s perspective, there is no debate about the science of climate change Chevron’s first slide quotes #IPCC: “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” Says there is no debate on this consensus. #climatetutorial #climateliability Deniers filed briefs in support of the defense, but they contradicted Chevron’s tutorial. For example, one brief filed by a group led by Christopher Monckton and Willie Soon began by stating, “The “consensus” about global warming is 0.3%, not 97%” (this is obviously incorrect). Another brief filed by William Happer, Steve Koonin, and Richard Lindzen argued that “It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences.” Chevron and the IPCC disagree. While it’s normal for climate deniers to deny the 97% expert consensus that humans are driving global warming, those submitting briefs on behalf of Big Oil were clearly not on the same page as its lawyer. Perhaps the oil companies should have sent the deniers a memo to stay out of this case. Clearly these groups are accustomed to denying climate science on the oil industry’s behalf. The judge mandated that those submitting briefs detail their funding sources, and they listed a litany of oil companies and fossil fuel-funded think tanks. Among those listed by Monckton and Soon’s group were ExxonMobil, the Heartland Institute, and the Charles G. Koch Foundation. Among those listed by Happer, Koonin, and Lindzen were the Heritage Foundation, Peabody Coal, the Cato Institute, and the Texas Public Policy Foundation. It’s a perfect example of the oil industry’s two-faced behavior. For decades their own scientists quietly published peer-reviewed research concluding that humans are causing global warming. That was the face we saw from Chevron’s lawyer. But at the same time, oil companies were funding contrarian scientists and think tanks to spread denial and doubt about that same science. That was the face revealed in the denier briefs. Although they accept the expert climate consensus, the oil companies obviously don’t want to be held liable for the costs of the climate damages their products cause. In addition to emphasizing and exaggerating climate science uncertainties, Chevron’s lawyer noted that the IPCC states that climate change is caused “largely by economic and population growth,” not fossil fuel extraction. In other words, the oil industry’s strategy is to argue that individual climate impacts are difficult to pin down, and in any case, the blame lies not with the producers, but with the consumers of their products. It’s eerily similar to an argument made by tobacco industry lawyers: Those who decide to start smoking or continue smoking should assume responsibility for a choice they make -- because no one can say they don’t know about the dangers associated with smoking In short, the industry lawyers argue that the consequences are the fault of smokers and energy consumers, not the companies producing the dangerous products. That argument didn’t work for the tobacco industry in the past, because they knew of the health risks associated with consuming their products, yet engaged in campaign to manufacture doubt to convince people to keep smoking. Ultimately, a federal judge found the tobacco industry guilty of fraud to further a conspiracy to deceive the American public about the dangers of their products. It’s a more difficult case to make against the oil industry because their scientists published climate research in peer-reviewed journals available to the public, and their campaign to manufacture doubt about human-caused climate change was waged through intermediaries. They funded think tanks to do their dirty work, as we saw in the denier briefs. Tobacco industry executives continued publicly denying their own scientists’ findings to the very end, even under oath.  The oil industry has modified the tobacco playbook by accepting the scientific consensus. And Chevron’s lawyer argued that as a complex global problem, any climate remedies should be addressed through government policy rather than via the legal system. Since it effectively owns the Republican Party, Big Oil can afford to accept the science to avoid legal ramifications, without fearing any such legislative consequences unless the Democratic Party takes full control of the US government, which won’t happen until 2021 at the earliest.  It’s a brilliant strategy, and until Democrats take power and pass a carbon tax or other similar climate legislation (or enough Republican lawmakers stop denying the science and start finding bipartisan policy solutions), it might just work.  But even if they lose this lawsuit, at least the cities of San Francisco and Oakland forced the oil companies’ hand. In a high-profile case, they accepted the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. These companies have employed scientists researching climate change for four decades, and as the world’s biggest and most profitable producers of carbon-polluting products, have the strongest motivation to deny climate science. If even Big Oil accepts the reality of human-caused climate change when pressed in court, it’s difficult for anyone else to deny it from here forward."
"The Australian Energy Market Commission says the national electricity grid is becoming more unstable, with 11 incidents in 2016-17, up from seven the year before and four the year before that. The instability is attributed to changes in the power generation mix, with thermal, synchronous generators leaving the system in favour of more renewable capacity, which can leave the grid at the mercy of the weather.  The new assessment from the AEMC released on Tuesday comes as the Turnbull government’s prospects of securing agreement for its national energy guarantee have improved courtesy of Jay Weatherill’s departure as the South Australian premier after Saturday’s state election. Weatherill led the resistance at the state level to the Turnbull proposal, which is supposed to address some of the problems in Australia’s electricity network by imposing new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The Energy Security Board is currently leading consultations with a range of stakeholders about the design of the policy, which will be considered next by federal and state energy ministers on 20 April. While the Turnbull government has proposed the national energy guarantee as a mechanism to end the decade-long climate wars, the proposal remains contentious with stakeholders, including environment groups and analysts who argue it won’t deliver the scale of emissions reductions to ensure Australia conforms with our commitments under the Paris agreement. New modelling from market analysts Reputex released on Monday also suggests the Turnbull government’s emissions reduction target for the electricity sector will be met thanks to state renewable energy targets – effectively rendering the federal proposal redundant in climate terms. The AEMC has meanwhile released new reports taking stock of the reliability of the electricity system. It says system security issues have arisen as a consequence of less synchronous generation in the system and changes in the way generating units are being operated. It says there has been a reduction in primary frequency control and associated degradation of the frequency distribution – which has implications across the grid. The report notes that “over the last few years there has been a decreasing level of system inertia due to the withdrawal of synchronous thermal generation and increased penetration of non-synchronous generation” – a development that can “result in the failure of load or generation”. The report says there were 11 incidents in 2016-17, including the statewide power blackout in South Australia.  It says the frequency operating standard was met for the mainland over the course of the year but the frequency operating standard was not met for Tasmania for seven months of the 2016/17 financial year."
"Hell hath no fury like a sheep farmer told that his favourite stew is killing the planet. There is a backlash in Wales after a World Wide Fund for Nature report placed lamb cawl top of a list of British dishes ranked by carbon footprint. A single bowl of the traditional meat and veg affair produces 5.9 kilos of CO2 emissions, equivalent to 71 plastic bottles, 65 days of an LED lightbulb being switched on, 258 kettle boils, 31 miles in a car, or 722 smartphone charges – and way more than the other dishes the study looked at (fish and chips, chicken tikka masala and a ploughman’s).  The big problem in the cawl is, sure enough, the lamb, which the report says accounts for more than three-quarters of the dish’s impact, largely due to farting sheep (hello methane). The National Farmers’ Union Cymru said it was “astonished” at the findings, claiming the report makes unfair comparisons. While that row simmers, what are the dishes we can eat safe in the knowledge of their baby-sized carbon footprints? The WWF study offers some general guidance, including a call for eating less meat. Lamb and beef are the worst offenders, thanks to their methane emissions and high demands on land. So more plants, and alternative sources of proteins such as peas, beans and nuts. “It’s basically about eating less processed food, less meat, and more local food,” says Tony Juniper, head of campaigns at WWF. “We’re not trying to preach but to lay out the facts and explain our choices.” There is no definitive ranking of the dishes with the lightest footprint, but Bon Appetit, an American chain of sustainable cafes, worked with the Ecotrust charity to suggest dishes based on assessments of the impacts of their ingredients over their life cycles (including the energy used in production and transportation, as well as fertiliser use). The results, available at the Eat Low Carbon website, are as wholesome as you might imagine. Top of the list: a three bean soup, with CO2 emissions of just 54 grams per portion. Then comes lentil soup, homemade crisps and – a rare meat appearance – grilled wild salmon (locally sourced, naturally). Falafel, steamed veg and hummus also feature. Lamb cawl, however, does not."

"An LNG tanker designed for icy conditions has become the first commercial ship to travel the Arctic’s northern sea route in winter. It marks a milestone in the opening up of Russia’s northern coastline, as thawing polar ice makes industrial development and maritime trade increasingly viable. The Teekay vessel Eduard Toll set out from South Korea in December for Sabetta terminal in northern Russia, cutting through ice 1.8m thick. Last month, it completed the route, delivering a load of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Montoir, France. Its voyage was captured by the crew in a timelapse video. Bermuda-based firm Teekay is investing in six ships to serve the Yamal LNG project in northern Russia. A similarly designed vessel owned by Sovcomflot made the same passage last August. This small and growing Arctic-ready fleet can operate independently of icebreaker escorts, which are also in high demand. Arctic sea ice is steadily thinning and receding, with seasonal fluctuation, as global temperatures rise due to human activity. In January 2018, ice extent hit another record low for the month, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. While polar conditions remain tough, the trend creates market opportunities. The northern sea route is shorter than alternatives through the Suez Canal for many trade links between Europe and Asia."
"The history of fashion can give a fascinating glimpse of how climate has changed. Medieval times were notably mild and illustrations in manuscripts show people wearing light and loose clothes, without capes, fur or hats. That changed in the Little Ice Age, roughly spanning the 1300s to 1800s, which included some bitterly cold times.  Fashions responded, especially in the 1500s, when heavy textiles in clothes were used more widely. In Hans Holbein’s famous painting The French Ambassadors of 1533, the two courtiers wear thick dark velvets, fur-lined overcoats and fashionable caps. And some of the oldest surviving gloves, hats, capes and coats in museums come from those times. By Charles II’s reign in the second half of the 1600s, ladies’ gowns used layers of heavy fabric and gentlemen wore long coats, large breeches and wigs. And the muff handwarmer became popular, as Samuel Pepys noted on a bitterly cold day in November 1662: “This day I first did wear a muffe, being my wife’s last year’s muffe, this serves me very well.”  Other fashion accessories reflect the wet British climate – the Burberry, the Barbour, the wellington boot, and of course the umbrella, a foreign invention originally designed for keeping cool."
"In order to combat climate change, we need to rapidly move from fossil fuel energy to clean, renewable energy. The two energy sources I am most interested in are wind and solar power; however, there are other sources that have great potential. Some people doubt how much wind and solar can supply to a country’s electricity grid. This is a particularly challenging question to answer in part because both solar power and wind power fluctuate in both space and time. We all know solar panels work well during the day, when the sun shines – they don’t work so well at night. And wind turbines only send electrons when the wind is blowing.   Fortunately, these two sources of energy fluctuate in ways that complement each other. For instance, solar power generation is highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Wind power is greatest in the spring and fall. Wind turbines work at night when solar panels are dormant. So, can these complementing variations help balance out the power that the two technologies can provide?  This question was addressed in a very recent paper published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science. The author list included Dr. Ken Caldeira, who is extremely well known for his years of work in environmental science and energy. The authors analyzed 36 years of hourly weather data (1980–2015) in the US. They calculated the available wind and solar power over this time period and also included the electrical demand in the US and its variation throughout the year. With this information, the researchers considered two scenarios. In scenario 1, they imagined wind and solar installations that would be sufficient to supply 100% of the US electrical needs. In the second scenario, the installations would be over-designed; capable of providing 150% of the total U.S. electrical need. But the authors recognize that just because a solar panel or a wind turbine can provide all our energy, it doesn’t mean that will happen in reality. It goes back to the prior discussion that sometimes the wind just doesn’t blow, and sometimes the sun isn’t shining. With these two scenarios, the authors then considered different mixes of power, from all solar to all wind. They also included the effect of aggregation area, that is, what sized regions are used to generate power. Is your power coming from wind and solar in your neighborhood, your city, your state or your region? The authors found that with 100% power capacity and no mechanism to store energy, a wind-heavy portfolio is best (about 75% wind, 25% solar) and using large aggregate regions is optimal. It is possible to supply about 75-80% of US electrical needs. If the system were designed with excess capacity (the 150% case), the US could meet about 90% of its needs with wind and solar power. The authors recognized that sometimes these systems generate too much power to be used. Under this situation, you could store the energy for later use. Imagine a solar panel generating excess energy during the day and able to store that power for night use. Power can be stored in several ways, for example in batteries or by pumping water into elevated tanks and then letting the water fall at night and turn a turbine.  The authors modified their study to allow up to 12 hours of US energy storage. They then found that the 100% capacity system fared even better (about 90% of the country’s energy) and the optimal balance was now more solar (approximately 70% solar and 30% wind). For the over-capacity system, the authors found that virtually all the country’s power needs could be met with wind, solar, and storage. This study considered only wind and solar. If other sources, such as hydroelectricity, biofuels, or even nuclear power were added, it would be relatively straightforward to reach 100% clean energy. Furthermore, people are learning to use energy more wisely, either by using more efficient products or purchasing electricity during off-peak hours. These behavioral changes can also help us reach a 100% clean energy target. The point is, the use of clean energy to power an entire country (or a group of countries) is achievable. It’s no longer viable to say “we can’t.”"

"I read Damian Carrington’s interview with Paul Ehrlich and found Paul’s analysis to ring frighteningly true (Scientist stands by warning that collapse of civilisation is coming, 23 March). His book The Population Bomb predicted starvation in the 1970s, something that was avoided by the “green revolution” in intensive agriculture. The green revolution was the point at which farmers turned away from natural techniques (eg mixed farms and crop rotation) and instead started using chemical fertilisers and pesticides along with hybrid plants whose seeds could often not be harvested for re-use. This led to higher yields at first, but then to exhausted and polluted soil and increasing debt to suppliers. The role of the green revolution was to “delay the calamity”. But at a great cost to nature. So what was humankind’s reaction to these developments? Instead of stopping to take stock, we became addicted to the consumerist traits of “cheap and abundant” with no thought for the real cost and inherent risk.  The world is now moving into further “revolutions” involving GM crops, the establishment of mega-farms and digitalisation. For me these are newer, more aggressive techniques for “overdrawing our account” with the natural world. And everyone knows that a surefire way to ultimate calamity is to try to pay a debt by taking on more debt. Hats off to Paul Ehrlich but shame on the human race.Alan MitchamCologne, Germany • It is depressing to see the Guardian recycling Paul Ehrlich’s discredited views. The key fact of contemporary population trends is that the birth rate in the developing world is now lower than it was in rich countries a few decades ago. There are no good estimates of the population-carrying capacity of our planet, but it is almost certainly well above the likely peak of population that will be reached in the second half of this century. Reducing the vast global inequalities in energy consumption will do far more for the environment than the ultimately racist idea that the poor have too many children.Prof John MacInnesCentre for Population Change, University of Edinburgh • Paul Ehrlich’s prediction of half a century ago – of the end of civilisation in a decade or two – may be the most obvious aspect of his theory, but it is not the most fundamental. Far more important is his failure to recognise that what he calls the “perpetual growth of human enterprise” is linked not to human activities as such, but to the economic system of capitalism whose raison d’etre is profit making. Every time goods or services are sold, profit is made which is then reinvested to start another cycle of profit making. This process takes place regardless of whether the profit is directly reinvested to make more commodities, or indirectly by passing it on to others to invest by purchasing their goods or services or by depositing it into a bank which lends it to others to invest. It follows that economic growth and its complementary growth in consumption, what he calls overconsumption, are byproducts of profit making and if they are to be unnecessary, then we have to do away with profit making altogether.Fawzi IbrahimAuthor, Capitalism Versus Planet Earth • Paul Ehrlich’s views on population are understandable although such concerns go back millennia. The elephant in the room is that human numbers will only fall if deaths exceed births; we can all complain about other people’s kids but contemplating our own obituary is less popular. A further concern is squeezing the same population into less space. Climate change is now being fuelled by emissions from melting ice sheets and their knock-on effects; these could easily outweigh reductions from human emissions. Huge numbers of climate refugees may need rehousing in decades to come, to say nothing of food, clothing and the jobs required to afford decent lifestyles. Given the current attitudes to migrants, how keen will richer countries be to take people or to fund moving them to less populous but still habitable areas?Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Shropshire  • The issue of overstretched cities is an important one (The 100 million city: is 21st century urbanisation out of control? on 1, 19 March). But it is vital not to take “extreme scenarios” as fact or as a call to drastically limit urban growth. Cities do not simply continue to grow along the lines predicted by past trends, but are affected by economic, development and ecological pressures. Urban growth can also help manage total population growth. The evidence shows that as people move into cities they have fewer children because of economic and social pressures. The implication that African cities are exploding can have damaging consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people. It can result in governments clearing or cracking down on shanty towns and slums as an excuse to curb population growth. If Africa’s governments see urban growth as an opportunity to provide decent housing and livelihoods for their current populations, rather than panicking about what these may be in the years to come, then an urban future can be created that benefits all and ensures that no one will be left behind as cities grow.

"The sort of severe winter weather that has rattled parts of the US and UK is becoming more common as the Arctic warms, with scientists finding a strong link between high temperatures near the pole and unusually heavy snowfall and frigid weather further south. A sharp increase in temperatures across the Arctic since the early 1990s has coincided with an uptick in abnormally cold snaps in winter, particularly in the eastern US, according to new research that analyzed temperature data from 1950 onwards.  Extreme cold winter weather is up to four times more likely when temperatures in the Arctic are unusually high, the study found. Researchers compared daily temperatures from across the Arctic region with something called the accumulated winter season severity index, which grades winter weather based on temperature, snow fall and snow depth, across 12 US cities. “There’s a remarkably strong correlation between a warm Arctic and cold winter weather further south,” said Judah Cohen, a climatologist at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. “It’s a complex story – global warming is contributing to milder temperatures but is also having unforeseen consequences such as this.” The Arctic has just experienced its toastiest winter on record, with parts of the region 20C (68F) warmer than the long-term average, a situation scientists have variously described as “crazy,” “weird,” and “simply shocking”. The far north latitudes are warming around twice as quickly as the global average, diminishing glaciers and sea ice and imperiling creatures such as polar bears. Two large winter storms recently swept the US east coast in less than a week, unloading up to three inches of snow per hour in places, resulting in several deaths, thousands of cancelled flights, closed schools and snarled traffic. The cold front even reached Florida, contributing to a recent surge in manatee deaths. So far this year, 166 of the marine mammals have been found dead off the state’s coast, with stress from the cold the leading cause of mortality. “Manatees may join polar bears as one of the first iconic victims of extinction in the wild from climate change,” said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. The US storms follow freezing winds from Siberia – dubbed the ‘beast from the east’ – that battered parts of Europe, with the British army deployed to help liberate hundreds of stranded drivers on UK motorways. “This winter is a great example of what we can expect from climate change,” said Cohen. “In the US we had the ‘bomb cyclone’ in January, followed by July-like warm weather in February that I’d never seen before. And now we’ve had a parade of powerful winter storms and the beast from the east. It’s mind boggling.” The research didn’t look at the reasons behind the trend of see-sawing temperatures between the Arctic and areas to the south but Cohen said it was consistent with the theory that the polar vortex – which shot to public consciousness during a 2014 cold spell – is being disrupted as the earth heats up. The polar vortex is a low pressure system that swirls around the polar region. Sometimes it can stray further south, bringing cold Arctic air with it. There is continuing conjecture over the impact climate change is having but some scientists believe warming temperatures could be weakening the polar vortex’s flow, allowing it to meander towards the equator. This nuanced picture of the consequences of climate change has been derided by Donald Trump, with the president using Twitter to mockingly reference cold weather during almost every winter in recent years. In December, Trump tweeted that “perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming” amid plunging temperatures. Scientists say this stance overlooks the complicated changes underway in the environment as the world warms due to human activity, by an average of around 1C over the past century. This temperature rise hasn’t been uniform across the globe and has fueled an array of conditions, from increased flood risk in some areas to drought conditions and heatwaves in others. Richard Alley, a leading glacier and climate expert at Penn State who was not involved in Cohen’s research, said the study is “fascinating” and “important” but added the discrepancy between Arctic temperatures and winter weather elsewhere could have other drivers, such as a warm Gulf of Mexico feeding extra energy into storms along the US east coast.  “The broadest picture is that we are indeed warming the world’s climate, primarily from carbon dioxide release from fossil-fuel burning, and this will impact us and other living things,” said Alley.  The Arctic’s role is seen quite differently by some other scientists, however, who point out that occasional outbursts of cold weather haven’t altered the trend that winters in the US northeast have been getting warmer, particularly since the 1970s. “There have always been cold outbreaks. The cold air has to go somewhere,” said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “The issue is whether the air stays put or gets loose. Some years it is contained, other years it breaks out. The question is where and what is the cause. This study reaffirms the relationship but not its cause. The Arctic likely plays a modest role in terms of feedbacks but it is unlikely it is a cause.”"

"More than 1m trees have been pledged for Trump Forest, a bid by environmentalists to offset the US president’s curtailing of Obama-era clean energy initiatives by planting 10bn trees around the globe.  “US president Donald Trump doesn’t believe in the science of human-caused climate change,” reads the website for the project, launched before Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord.  “So we’re planting a forest to soak up the extra greenhouse gases Trump plans to put into our atmosphere. We’re planting a global forest to offset Trump’s monumental stupidity.” The project was launched last March and in less than a year over a million trees have been pledged from people around the world, but particularly in the US and Europe.  The donated trees are to go towards offsetting the 650m tonnes of CO2 that will be released into the atmosphere by 2025 if the president’s plans to backtrack on US climate commitments go ahead, organisers say.  The figure of 650m tonnes – equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 33 million Americans – is calculated from Trump’s decision to roll back the US 2015 Paris agreement pledge to lower emissions by at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. It would take 10bn trees – covering a landmass roughly the size of the state of Kentucky – to offset the full amount. “We’re really pleased at how quickly it happened,” co-founder Adrien Taylor told Newshub.  “We’re just pleased to see we’re not the only people in the world who care about climate change, because sometimes it can feel like that.” The project’s co-founder, British climate scientist Dr Dan Price, said: “In 30 years from now, when people look back on the Trump presidency as an attack on the planet and on rational thought, it would be pretty cool if the history books say his actions were negligible because the global community offset the administration’s additional emissions. “It’s clearly a big challenge, but only recently the world record was broken when India put 66m trees in the ground in a day. If we all chip in, it is a completely realistic goal.”"

"The attack submarine HMS Trenchant has joined US submarines in the Arctic for ICEX 2018, military exercises involving practice with dummy torpedo attacks and navigation and surfacing through the ice cover. The sea ice provides almost perfect concealment for submarines but brings problems too.  While the upper surface of the ice is smooth the underside is ridged with keels extending downwards for many metres and creating a dangerous collision hazard.  This uneven ice surface also scatters sonar, sometimes producing phantom images and confusing navigation. From a submarine, the ceaseless creaking and groaning of the shifting pack ice above takes some getting used to; worse, the high-pitched sounds can interfere with sonar reception. The military submarines use sonar to measure the thickness of the ice, helping to validate scientific models of how the cover has changed over the years. Records from similar expeditions, gathered to help identify spots where the ice is thin enough for submarines to surface, have proved a valuable resource for scientists. The Arctic may be spectacular and fascinating but it is a dangerous place for submarine operations. During the mission ICEX 2007 two sailors died in an explosion on board the Royal Navy nuclear submarine HMS Tireless. The Trenchant’s crew laid a wreath for them last week.            "
"In its first year in office, the Trump administration introduced a solitary new environmental rule aimed at protecting the public from pollution. It was aimed not at sooty power plants or emissions-intensive trucks, but dentists. Every year, dentists fill Americans’ tooth cavities with an amalgam that includes mercury. About 5 tons of mercury, a dangerous toxin that can taint the brain and the nervous system, are washed away from dental offices down drains each year. In Trump’s first day in the White House, the administration told the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw an Obama-era plan that would require dentists to prevent this mercury from getting into waterways. But in June, the rule was unexpectedly enacted. This apparent change of heart followed legal action filed by green groups, part of a cascade of courtroom standoffs that are starting to slow and even reverse the Trump administration’s blitzkrieg of environmental regulations. “The Trump administration has been sloppy and careless, they’ve shown significant disrespect for rule of law and courts have called them on it,” said Richard Revesz, a professor at the New York University school of law.  “I expect we will see a number of further losses for the administration on similar grounds. If they keep showing the same disregard for the law, their attempt to repeal all these environmental regulations will go badly for them.” The reversal of Obama’s environmental legacy has been spearheaded by Scott Pruitt, who heads the EPA, the agency he repeatedly sued as Oklahoma attorney general. Pruitt, who accused Obama of “bending the rule of law” and federal overreach, has overseen the methodical delay or scrapping of dozens of rules curbing pollution from power plants, pesticides and vehicles. Ironically for Pruitt, who has touted a “back to basics” approach rooted safely within the confines of the law, this rapidly executed agenda has run into a thicket of legal problems, causing the administration to admit defeat in several cases. In July, a federal court ruled that the EPA couldn’t suspend rules designed to curb methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. This was followed by a hasty retreat in August when the EPA agreed to not delay new standards to reduce smog-causing air pollutants, the day after 15 states and environment groups sued.  Then, in December, a federal court told the EPA it couldn’t delay a new standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust. Other arms of the federal government have also been stymied from implementing Trump’s deregulatory agenda. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, stung by a lawsuit, listed the rusty patched bumblebee as endangered in March after initially delaying the decision. And on Thursday, a federal court told the department of energy it must implement four energy efficiency regulations it was looking to scuttle. Many of these legal problems have stemmed from the sheer pace of the rollbacks – required public comment periods have been set aside in some cases, any rationale for repeal or delay has been missing in others. Opponents of the administration also believe there is a determination to expunge every vestige of Obama’s environmental legacy, regardless of merit. “They are trying to score political points or attempting to grant favours to corporations who don’t want to follow the rules,” said Aaron Colangelo, the litigation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It all shows that this administration won’t protect the environment unless they are sued. They have been reckless and not followed the basic requirements of the law.” The EPA now faces a fresh wave of opposition as it looks to craft replacements for major Obama rules such as the clean power plan, which sought to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants, and the waters of the US rule, which greatly expanded clean water protections. If the proposed replacements are, as expected, far less onerous on industry than current iterations, environmentalists and around a dozen states, headed by New York and California, will be poised to further jam up the process in the courts. “Over and over again, the Trump administration has put the profits of multinational polluters over the health and well-being of everyday Americans,” said Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general.  Schneiderman has been prolific in opposing Trump’s environmental revisions, filing more than 50 lawsuits during the administration’s first year to, among other things, protect the clean power plan, enforce stricter vehicle pollution standards and ensure that chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide linked to neurological harm to children, is banned. “We’ve already beaten back several of this administration’s toxic policies, from energy efficiency rollbacks to smog,” Schneiderman said. “Our fight to protect public health and our environment will continue in court.”"
"For optimists, it was tempting to view three years of flatlining global carbon emissions, from 2014-16, as the new normal. We now know celebrations should be put on hold. Figures for 2017 published last week show global emissions from energy have jumped back up again, to a historic high. The data from the International Energy Agency shows we still have much to do when it comes to stopping global warming. Three years ago experts cautioned that 2015’s near standstill in emissions might be only a temporary pause before resuming the upward march as India and China developed. Those warnings were prophetic.  Global energy demand last year grew by 2.1%, more than double the rate in 2016, driven largely by Asia. The problem for the climate is that more than 70% of the growth came from fossil fuels. Gas was the fastest-growing fossil fuel. But even coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel, reversed two years of declines and was up by 1%, as coal burning in China, India and South Korea grew. To compound matters, progress on energy efficiency slowed dramatically in the face of lower energy prices and weakening government policy. On the plus side, renewables were the fastest-growing source of new energy and had another unprecedented year. China added as much solar power in a single year as the total installed capacity across France and Germany. The US scored the steepest drop in emissions, despite Donald Trump’s first year as president, as new renewable generation bloomed. Indeed, with renewables records being broken seemingly every week – last weekend the UK set a new high for wind power – it is easy to think the fight has been won. But the IEA’s work is a sobering reminder that stratospheric growth in renewables is not enough. Renewables put a brake on emissions but they don’t stop coal, oil and gas from being dug out of the ground. The most sobering figure in the agency’s research is 81%: the amount of global energy that comes from fossil fuels. It’s been about the same for the past three decades. So, if the energy sector is still nowhere near compatible with the demands of climate science, and the goals set by nearly 200 governments in Paris three years ago, what do we do? Despair is not an option, and there are reasons for hope. One is Beijing’s self-interest in tackling air quality, which means coal plant closures and bans, and the promotion of electric cars. India, the coal industry’s last great hope, has witnessed a faster than expected rise in solar power, squeezing out coal projects. Germany’s new government finally has plans to tackle the country’s outmoded reliance on coal. Globally, coal capacity will begin shrinking in 2022 at the current rate of retirements, according to a new report. Arguably the brightest and most promising trend is that renewables are on the brink of being economically viable without government subsidies. In the UK alone, an estimated £20bn worth of wind and solar farms could be built without subsidies between now and 2030. This year the UN is undertaking a stocktake of countries’ climate plans and it should keep the IEA numbers at the forefront of its thinking. But getting to the top of the carbon emission mountain and down again will not be achieved solely with more favourable economics and stronger government support. Leaders must take the much more politically difficult decision to penalise fossil fuels. The means are many: economy-wide carbon taxes are an obvious one that many energy firms claim to support. Bans on extraction of fossil fuels are a more extreme example. We must vote for those politicians who are bold enough to do this. We must renew pressure on them to say no to dirty energy, as well as yes to clean energy. Only then do we have a hope of permanently reducing emissions. Next boss Lord Wolfson has described 2017 as “the most challenging year we have faced for 25 years”. It was quite a statement from Wolfson, the FTSE’s second longest-serving chief executive (after WPP’s Martin Sorrell), who has a reputation for being restrained and serious-minded. But the problems facing the high street are mounting. Last week there was a raft of bad news – New Look is closing 60 stores, axing 980 staff and cutting rent payments to landlords. Carpetright is likely to close 100 stores and also wants rent cuts. Mothercare is in talks with its banks to restructure its finances. There was a grim profits warning from Moss Bros while Conviviality – the firm behind Bargain Booze – said it needed to find £125m or was likely to go bust. All this a few weeks after Maplin and Toys R Us collapsed into administration. Debenhams and House of Fraser also have difficulties. Each, of course, has its own problems: mountainous debts, unpaid tax bills, or merely buying the wrong stock. But there are also major behavioural and structural issues – like the shift away from shopping towards leisure spending. Barclaycard data shows spending on women’s clothing was down 3% last year, while spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment was up more than 10%. Then there is the massive shift to buying online – and its impact on the bottom line. Next lost £141m of full-price high street sales last year, which resulted in lost profits of £85m. At the same time online sales rose £167m – but that generated only £32m of extra profit. So every pound lost on the high street costs the firm 60p of profit, while a pound gained online generates only 19p. That is serious margin erosion, which many store chains and retail landlords have yet to fully acknowledge and prepare for. As is often the case with Donald Trump, he might think his stand against Chinese “economic aggression” will add to his reputation as a wildcard US president breaking with convention to get results. But as has been the case before in his presidency, he ought to be more careful. Trump’s latest move of economic gunboat diplomacy – to impose punitive tariffs on up to $60bn (£42bn) of annual imports from China on certain goods – could be his biggest gamble yet. Although the plan is to protect American manufacturers from being undercut by Chinese producers, most economists reckon it could push up prices for US consumers and lead to a damaging trade war. Should China retaliate by imposing tariffs on US imports of soya beans or aircraft parts, as has been suggested, that would also unpick any benefit Trump may derive from imposing tariffs on China. Farmers and ranchers in the south, some of his biggest supporters, would be hardest hit. In effect, the president is starting a giant game of economic whack-a-mole: he may find a way to fix one problem only for another, potentially greater, to emerge. Trump has legitimate cause for concern when it comes to Chinese trade practices. China’s protectionist policies and state support for industry make it hard for other countries to compete on the world stage. The US had a record $375bn trade deficit with China last year, which made up two-thirds of a global $566bn US trade gap with the rest of the world. Chinese use of western intellectual property also undercuts US firms. But Trump’s unilateralism risks alienating European allies from whom he might have found support for taking multilateral action against China. Throwing the EU a temporary reprieve from higher steel tariffs will not be enough to secure solid support from Brussels. Past experience suggests trade wars can have damaging consequences, while even moderate barriers erected by several nations at once could disrupt the complex global supply chains built up in recent decades. The world should hope Trump’s latest steps follow another well-worn path of his presidency so far: tough talk followed by measures falling short of the rhetoric."
"For most of my life, I didn’t pay attention to birds. Only in my 40s did I become a person whose heart lifts whenever he hears a grosbeak singing or a towhee calling, and who hurries out to see a golden plover that’s been reported in the neighbourhood, just because it’s a beautiful bird, with truly golden plumage, and has flown all the way from Alaska. When someone asks me why birds are so important to me, all I can do is sigh and shake my head, as if I’ve been asked to explain why I love my brothers. And yet the question is a fair one: why do birds matter? My answer might begin with the vast scale of the avian domain. If you could see every bird in the world, you’d see the whole world. Things with feathers can be found in every corner of every ocean and in land habitats so bleak that they’re habitats for nothing else. Grey gulls raise their chicks in Chile’s Atacama desert, one of the driest places on Earth.  Emperor penguins incubate their eggs in Antarctica in winter. Goshawks nest in the Berlin cemetery where Marlene Dietrich is buried, sparrows in Manhattan traffic lights, swifts in sea caves, vultures on Himalayan cliffs, chaffinches in Chernobyl. The only forms of life more widely distributed than birds are microscopic. To survive in so many different habitats, the world’s 10,000 or so bird species have evolved into a spectacular diversity of forms. They range in size from the ostrich, which can reach 2.7 metres (9ft) in height and is widespread in Africa, to the aptly named bee hummingbird, found only in Cuba. Their bills can be massive (pelicans, toucans), tiny (weebills) or as long as the rest of their body (sword-billed hummingbirds). Some birds – the painted bunting in Texas, Gould’s sunbird in South Asia, the rainbow lorikeet in Australia – are gaudier than any flower. Others come in one of the nearly infinite shades of brown that tax the vocabulary of avian taxonomists: rufous, fulvous, ferruginous, bran-coloured, foxy. Birds are no less diverse behaviourally. Some are highly social, others anti. African queleas and flamingos gather in flocks of millions, and parakeets build whole parakeet cities out of sticks. Dippers walk alone and underwater, on the beds of mountain streams, and a wandering albatross may glide on its three-metre wingspan 500 miles away from any other albatrosses. I’ve met friendly birds, like the New Zealand fantail that once followed me down a trail, and I’ve met mean ones, like the caracara in Chile that swooped down and tried to knock my head off when I stared at it too long. Roadrunners kill rattlesnakes for food by teaming up on them, one bird distracting the snake while another sneaks up behind it. Bee-eaters eat bees. Leaftossers toss leaves. Thick-billed murres can dive underwater to a depth of 213 metres (700ft), peregrine falcons downward through the air at 240 miles an hour. A wren-like rushbird can spend its entire life beside one half-acre pond, while a cerulean warbler may migrate to Peru and then find its way back to the tree in New Jersey where it nested the year before. Birds aren’t furry and cuddly, but in many respects they’re more similar to us than other mammals are. They build intricate homes and raise families in them. They take long winter vacations in warm places. Cockatoos are shrewd thinkers, solving puzzles that would challenge a chimpanzee, and crows like to play. (On days so windy that more practical birds stay grounded, I’ve seen crows launching themselves off hillsides and doing aerial somersaults, just for the fun of it, and I keep returning to the YouTube video of a crow in Russia sledding down a snowy roof on a plastic lid, flying back up with the lid in its beak, and sledding down again.) And then there are the songs with which birds, like us, fill the world. Nightingales trill in the suburbs of Europe, thrushes in downtown Quito, hwameis in Chengdu. Chickadees have a complex language for communicating – not only to each other but to every bird in their neighbourhood – about how safe or unsafe they feel from predators. Some lyrebirds in eastern Australia sing a tune their ancestors may have learned from a settler’s flute nearly a century ago. If you shoot too many pictures of a lyrebird, it will add the sound of your camera to its repertoire. But birds also do the thing we all wish we could do but can’t, except in dreams: they fly. Eagles effortlessly ride thermals; hummingbirds pause in mid-air; quail burst into flight heart-stoppingly. Taken all together, the flight paths of birds bind the planet together like 100bn filaments, tree to tree and continent to continent. There was never a time when the world seemed large to them. After breeding, a European swift will stay aloft for nearly a year, flying to sub-Saharan Africa and back, eating and moulting and sleeping on the wing, without landing once. Young albatrosses spend as many as 10 years roving the open ocean before they first return to land to breed. A bar-tailed godwit has been tracked flying nonstop from Alaska to New Zealand, 7,264 miles in nine days, while a ruby-throated hummingbird may burn up a third of its tiny body weight to cross the Gulf of Mexico. The red knot, a small shorebird species, makes annual round trips between Tierra del Fuego and the Canadian Arctic; one long-lived individual, named B95 for the tag on its leg, has flown more miles than separate the Earth and the moon. There is, however, one critical ability that human beings have and birds do not: mastery of their environment. Birds can’t protect wetlands, can’t manage a fishery, can’t air-condition their nests. They have only the instincts and the physical abilities that evolution has bequeathed to them. These have served them well for a very long time, 150m years longer than human beings have been around. But now human beings are changing the planet – its surface, its climate, its oceans – too quickly for birds to adapt to by evolving. Crows and gulls may thrive at our garbage dumps, blackbirds and cowbirds at our farms’ feedlots, robins and bulbuls in our city parks. But the future of most bird species depends on our commitment to preserving them. Are they valuable enough for us to make the effort? Value, in the late Anthropocene, has come almost exclusively to mean economic value, utility to human beings. And certainly many wild birds are usefully edible. Some of them in turn eat noxious insects and rodents. Many others perform vital roles – pollinating plants, spreading seeds, serving as food for mammalian predators – in ecosystems whose continuing wildness has touristic or carbon-sequestering value. You may also hear it argued that bird populations function, like the proverbial coal-mine canary, as important indicators of ecological health. But do we really need the absence of birds to tell us when a marsh is severely polluted, a forest slashed and burned, or a fishery destroyed? The sad fact is that wild birds, in themselves, will never pull their weight in the human economy. They want to eat our blueberries. What bird populations do usefully indicate is the health of our ethical values. One reason that birds matter – ought to matter – is that they are our last, best connection to a natural world that is otherwise receding. They’re the most vivid and widespread representatives of the Earth as it was before people arrived on it. They share descent with the largest animals ever to walk on land: the house finch outside your window is a tiny and beautifully adapted living dinosaur. A duck on your local pond looks and sounds very much like a duck 20m years ago, in the Miocene epoch, when birds ruled the planet. In an ever more artificial world, where featherless drones fill the air and Angry Birds can be simulated on our phones, we may see no reasonable need to cherish and support the former rulers of the natural realm. But is economic calculation our highest standard? After Shakespeare’s King Lear steps down from the throne, he pleads with his elder two daughters to grant him some vestige of his former majesty. When the daughters reply that they don’t see the need for it, the old king bursts out: “O, reason not the need!” To consign birds to oblivion is to forget what we’re the children of. A person who says, “It’s too bad about the birds, but human beings come first” is making one of two implicit claims. The person may mean that human beings are no better than any other animal – that our fundamentally selfish selves, which are motivated by selfish genes, will always do whatever it takes to replicate our genes and maximise our pleasure, the non-human world be damned. This is the view of cynical realists, to whom a concern for other species is merely an annoying form of sentimentality. It’s a view that can’t be disproved, and it’s available to anyone who doesn’t mind admitting that he or she is hopelessly selfish. But “human beings come first” may also have the opposite meaning: that our species is uniquely worthy of monopolising the world’s resources because we are not like other animals, because we have consciousness and free will, the capacity to remember our pasts and shape our futures. This opposing view can be found among both religious believers and secular humanists, and it too is neither provably true nor provably false. But it does raise the question: if we’re incomparably more worthy than other animals, shouldn’t our ability to discern right from wrong, and to knowingly sacrifice some small fraction of our convenience for a larger good, make us more susceptible to the claims of nature, rather than less? Doesn’t a unique ability carry with it a unique responsibility? A few years ago in a forest in north-east India, I heard and then began to feel, in my chest, a deep rhythmic whooshing. It sounded meteorological, but it was the wingbeats of a pair of great hornbills flying in to land in a fruiting tree. They had massive yellow bills and hefty white thighs; they looked like a cross between a toucan and a giant panda. As they clambered around in the tree, placidly eating fruit, I found myself crying out with joy. It was the sheer gorgeous fact of the great hornbill, which couldn’t have cared less about me. The radical otherness of birds is integral to their beauty and their value. They are always among us but never of us. Their indifference to us ought to serve as a chastening reminder that we’re not the measure of all things. The stories we tell about the past and imagine for the future are mental constructions that birds can do without. Birds live squarely in the present. And at present, although our cats and our windows and our pesticides kill billions of them every year, and although some species have been lost for ever, their world is still very much alive. In every corner of the globe, in nests as small as walnuts or as large as haystacks, chicks are pecking through their shells and into the light."
"The International Energy Agency warned this week that, under current energy policies, Australia is unlikely to meet its 2030 climate commitments. While the agency had lots to say about the plunging costs of renewables and the need for strong market signals to encourage the retirement of old and inefficient coal generation, Josh Frydenberg, the federal environment and energy minister, seized on the agency’s support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) – despite the technology’s long history of big promises and meagre results.  Last April, Frydenberg visited the newly opened Petra Nova CCS project in Texas. In a video posted to social media the minister, decked out in the obligatory hi-vis vest and hard hat, yells above the noise that the $1bn project is “helping to reduce the carbon footprint by some 40%”. It’d be wonderful if it were true. An estimated 6.2% of the Petra Nova power station’s emissions are captured, compressed and then piped 130km to help extract stubborn oil out of a depleted oil field. In the process, an estimated 30% of the carbon dioxide leaks back into the atmosphere, not to mention the emissions that will ultimately be released when the extracted oil is consumed. Last month, the Minerals Council of Australia was spruiking the “21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation or under construction around the world including in Canada and Texas”. Sounds impressive, if you still trust the MCA’s spin. You shouldn’t – 19 of the 21 projects have nothing to do with coal; there are exactly two “large scale” coal CCS projects globally. And, no, they’re not large. The Canadian project, Boundary Dam, has averaged only 0.591 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over each of its first three years. The $1.5bn project would need to be scaled up 31 times to capture the emissions of New South Wales’s Bayswater power station – an inconceivable investment. Petra Nova and Boundary Dam were built as demonstration projects, funded in an era when optimism for CCS was high and renewables costs were two-to-three times dearer than now. The owners of both projects have declined to invest further in the technology, having learnt the hard way that CCS doubles a coal power station’s capital and operating costs and is an outrageously expensive way to cut carbon pollution. They’re not alone – data from the Australian headquartered Global CCS Institute shows there’s not a single large-scale CCS project under construction anywhere. Over recent weeks we’ve seen the Minerals Council of Australia, the federal government and the International Energy Agency each make an effort to put CCS back on the agenda. The MCA’s motivation is the easiest to understand. CCS provides a fig leaf useful for the “clean coal” campaign the MCA has been running, much to the chagrin of its largest funder BHP, in a desperate attempt to arrest coal’s flagging social license. The only way CCS on coal will ever be built at scale is with a carbon price so high it’d kill the rest of the coal sector. Despite a tweet from the MCA on Thursday that it supported a “market based approach to low-emissions technology”, the MCA has form – it would use its dying breath to undermine any real or de facto carbon price. The MCA’s support for CCS rings hollow. The rest of the coal industry doesn’t believe in CCS either. In 2006 the sector proudly announced Coal21, a commitment to invest $1bn over a decade on low emissions technologies. Ten years on, the industry has come through with less than a third of the promised funding. The only new spending in recent years from a fund designed to “support the pre-commercial demonstration of low emissions coal technologies” has been a series of pro-coal propaganda, including the “Coal – It’s an amazing thing” TV ads. The federal government’s support is partly just an echo of the MCA’s talking points – a depressingly common pattern. Beyond that, the Coalition clearly believes that their pro-coal, anti-renewables position is a valuable point of political difference. Despite the talk, the government is not gung-ho on CCS. Tony Abbott’s 2014 budget ripped $460m out of the CCS Flagships program, and the once ambitious project launched by Kevin Rudd has been on starvation rations since. As for the IEA, their actual comments in support of CCS were pretty weak – executive director Fatih Birol did little more than endorse Frydenberg’s stalled plan from last May to lift the ban on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) providing loans to CCS projects. But while the coal-boosters sully the brand, it should be remembered that CCS is not “bad” per se. CCS is a basket of technologies, some of which are likely to be important in the future as we work to decarbonise a range of industries with stubborn emissions, such as steelmaking and cement production. It’s inconceivable that a CCS plus coal project could pass the CEFC’s rigorous investment criteria. As such it probably doesn’t matter whether or not the CCS prohibition is removed from the CEFC legislation. It’s just politics. A total of 13 power stations have closed in Australia over the past five years, keeping tens of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other pollutants out of our atmosphere. As AGL demonstrated this week, the economics are such that hard-nosed power companies are choosing renewables over coal every time. One way to reduce coal’s impact is to capture, compress and bury its emissions – but it’s much simpler, cheaper and safer to simply leave the coal in the ground."
" Some of the UK’s best-loved dishes – including fish and chips and chicken tikka masala – could be under threat as a result of climate change, environmentalists warn in a new report on Tuesday.  Warmer seas could see populations of cod – long the staple in fish and chips – replaced by lesser-known substitutes, leading to an “anchovies and chips” fish supper as soon as 2050, the environmental charity WWF said.  Research commissioned for Earth Hour, the world’s largest event to protect the planet, found that these and other favourites including the cheese ploughman’s platter and lamb cawl (Welsh lamb stew) may taste different and cost more in the future. Crucially, climate change could threaten the supply of the key ingredients in these dishes, leading to substitutes. Britons could find themselves dining out on algae-fed chicken tikka masala, if chickens need to be fed on alternatives to soy if production is hit by higher temperatures and changes to rainfall. Other key ingredients of a tikka masala, such as rice, tomatoes and onions could all suffer price hikes and shortages as a result of fluctuating weather.  To mark Earth Hour, which starts at 8.30pm on Saturday 24 March, WWF is urging people to make promises to change their life in one small way to help the environment, such as refusing plastic cutlery, carrying a refillable cup or cutting back on meat.  “The threat to these classic dishes just shows that climate change could impact every aspect of our lives in future if we don’t act now,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF. “That’s why we want people to eat more sustainably. That doesn’t necessarily mean going vegan or vegetarian – it means each of us cutting back on the amount of fish, meat and dairy. If each of us takes a small action, together we can combat climate change and future-proof our best-loved dishes.” Backing the scheme is One Planet Plate – a campaign by the Sustainable Restaurant Association to put sustainability on the menu and a chance for chefs worldwide to demonstrate to diners how they are sourcing and cooking sustainably. Diners can use a dynamic map to find restaurants – from Eurostar to Wahaca – serving a One Planet Plate.   "

"In 2016, US TV network news coverage of climate change plummeted. News coverage was focused on the presidential election, but the corporate broadcast networks didn’t air a single segment informing viewers how a win by Trump or Hillary Clinton could affect climate change or climate policy. That followed a slight drop in news coverage of climate change in 2015, despite that year being full of critical events like the Paris climate accords, Clean Power Plan, and record-breaking heat. The good news is that the annual analysis done by Media Matters for America found that in 2017, network news coverage of climate change soared.   The bad news is that most of it was focused on Trump’s historically stupid withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Media Matters found that in 2017, 79% percent of the time that corporate broadcast networks spent covering climate change featured actions or statements by the Trump administration. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement was featured in 52% of climate news segments. The administration also brought climate denial into the news cycle. Of the network news climate segments last year, 19% mentioned that Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” and 37% of those didn’t rebut the claim.  Many statements by the administration have focused on manufacturing doubt about human-caused global warming. For example, in a June 4 segment on CBS’ Face the Nation, when asked about Trump’s “hoax” comments, his U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley dodged the question by saying: The president believes the climate is changing, and he does know that pollutants are a part of that equation. Other members of the administration like Scott Pruitt have similarly cast doubt on the fact that humans are the dominant cause of current climate change.  This happened in a year filled with expensive climate-fueled disasters including hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, and floods. The corporate broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX – aired just four total segments that discussed these events in the context of climate change. By contrast, PBS aired 8 news segments discussing the link between climate change and the extreme weather events of 2017. Like the previous year, PBS had far more overall climate change coverage than the corporate news networks. PBS NewsHour interviewed or quoted more scientists in its climate coverage than all the other networks combined – 29 scientists, compared to a total of 27 scientists for the others (14 on CBS, 10 on NBC, 3 on ABC, and none on FOX). PBS NewsHour also featured the highest number of climate change segments (69), followed by CBS Evening News (44), NBC Nightly News (27), and ABC’s World News Tonight (23). It’s thus perhaps unsurprising that Trump’s proposed budget would eliminate federal funding for PBS. CBS was the best corporate news network in its climate change reporting, with CBS Evening News providing more coverage (90 minutes) than NBC Nightly News and ABC World News Tonight combined. About two-thirds of CBS’ climate coverage was focused on the Trump administration’s actions. That left just 30 minutes of CBS’ 2017 climate coverage devoted to topics like extreme weather events, and even less on NBC (20 minutes), ABC (7 minutes), and FOX (1 minute). Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement certainly merited widespread news coverage, and received it with 62 total segments on the corporate networks plus an additional 23 on PBS. The administration’s attacks on the Clean Power plan (9 corporate network segments plus 7 on PBS) and other environmental regulations (10 corporate network segments plus 16 on PBS) arguably deserved a similar level of attention.  While the surge in news coverage of climate change is encouraging, the networks shouldn’t rely so heavily on the Trump administration’s damaging actions in reporting on the subject. Certainly, non-Trump related events linked to climate change like the record hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, and floods should be the subject of far more news segments."
"Melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise, new satellite data shows. At the current rate, the world’s oceans will be on average at least 60cm (2ft) higher by the end of the century, according to research published in Monday’s Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.  Based on 25 years of satellite data, however, the research shows that the pace has quickened. It confirms scientists’ computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the UN, which releases regular climate change reports. “It’s a big deal” because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said the lead author, Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado. Other scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion. “Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades,” said Katy Serafin, a coastal flooding expert at Oregon State University. Sea level rise is causing by warming waters and the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Of the 7.5cm rise in the past 25 years, about 55% is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice. The process is accelerating, however, and more than three-quarters of the acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows. There are two factors that affect sea level rise: year-to-year fluctuations caused by natural events and larger long-term trends linked to man-made climate change. Nerem’s team removed the natural effects of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption that temporarily chilled the planet, and the climate phenomena El Niño and La Niña, and found the accelerating trend. Sea level rise rather than temperature is a better gauge of climate change in action, according to Anny Cazenave, the director of Earth science at the International Space Science Institute in France, who edited the study. Cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research. Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century, when they rose increasingly quickly because of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels, said Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute in Germany. Two feet of sea level rise by the end of the century “would have big effects on places like Miami and New Orleans, but I don’t still view that as catastrophic” because those cities can survive – at great expense, Nerem said. When a storm such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012 strikes, however, sea level rise on top of storm surge can lead to record damages, researchers said."
"Facing the reality of human-caused warming, we now look for ways to reduce the problem so that future generations will not inherit a disaster. So, what can we do now to help the future?  The easiest answer is to use energy more wisely and quit wasting our precious resources. Second, we can increase our use of clean energy, particularly wind and solar power. These are great starts but we will still need some liquid fuels and for those, we can make decisions about the best fuels for the environment. There has been extensive conversation recently about biofuels and how they may help solve the climate problem.   The term “biofuels” has many meanings, but basically they are grown fuels (like corn ethanol) that we can use instead of fossil fuels (like petroleum). While biofuels can be any fuel produced from plant material, historically they have been produced from food crops such as corn and soy. But, new technologies are enabling biofuel production from non-edible gases, wood, and other plant waste material. The beauty of biofuels is that they suck carbon dioxide out of the air as they grow. When we burn them in our automobiles, we release carbon dioxide, but it is the same carbon that the plants absorbed while growing. Just on that basis, biofuels appear to be zero net emitters.  But this view is too simplistic. It takes energy to grow biofuels; it takes fertilizer, tractors, transportation, and energy to convert the plants to liquid fuels. Planting and growing these crops can also change how much carbon is stored in the soil. And using existing food crops or arable land for biofuel production might lead to deforestation if farms are expanded elsewhere to make up for lost food production.  So, if you want to accurately assess the impact of biofuels, you need to look at what’s called a “life cycle analysis,” which basically means the effort it takes to grow the crops, harvest them, convert them to fuel, transport them to distribution sites, and combust them.  I have done some research in this area. Back in 2009, I did a study with my former student Fushcia-Ann Hoover, and we compared different feedstocks for ethanol. You can have corn, soybeans, sugarcane, switchgrass, poplar trees, and others. What is the best crop? Which is easiest to grow? Which is best for the environment? What we found, way back in 2009, is that if non-commercial crops were grown, you could actually end up with fuel that was significantly cleaner than petroleum. The trick was finding clean crops that don’t need a lot of fertilizer, water, and other inputs. Corn ethanol for instance is not the best choice. You need so much water, fertilizer, and other costs, that it almost doesn’t make it worthwhile. But other crops such as switchgrass, grown on marginal lands, have real a potential. Marginal lands are farmlands that are not optimal for growing crops. Our conclusion in 2009 was straightforward. Don’t use good cropland for biofuels. Rather, use marginal croplands, with minimal water and fertilizer, to create plants that can be converted to biofuels.  But our conclusion wasn’t the end of the story. There are other details that researchers should consider. For instance, how far from the croplands to the refinery? How much energy is needed to transport the fuels? All these issues matter and they were the focus of a recent research paper just published in Nature Energy. This study used an actual biofuel refinery located in Kansas for the basis of the study. And the authors counted all the emissions that occur during the lifecycle analysis of these biofuels. They realized that marginal croplands give lower yields, so there are competing issues of productivity and greenhouse gas reduction. Then there’s the complicating factor of economics. The price of biofuels and the price of greenhouse gases matter. If society is willing to pay a small pollution charge like a carbon tax, it supports the producers of clean energy. But if society doesn’t put a premium on clean energy, it’s harder for clean industry companies to thrive. In the new study, the authors discovered something fascinating. The found that the choices a farmer may make regarding what land to use for biofuels and how much fertilizer to use depend strongly on the price of clean fuels and the cost of greenhouse gases. Simply put, it we put a reasonable price on carbon pollution, farmers will be able to grow switchgrass, poplars, and other species, reduce greenhouse gases, and make money.  But, if there is no cost to carbon pollution, farmers will be motivated to spend more money on fertilizer and that, in the end, will lead to more emissions. While all the scenarios resulted in large emissions reductions compared to gasoline, the reductions were especially large for the scenarios that included a carbon price.  So, there is a delicate balance. The balance is made more clear when we realize that farming location matters. If biofuels are grown close to refineries, less pollution is created in transporting the fuels to the refinery. However, this limits cropland choices to those nearer to refineries.  With this balance of competing factors, the authors find room for improvement; currently we are not optimizing the performance in terms of both economic and environmental factors. In order to do this right, we have to balance all these mentioned issues. We can’t just focus on transportation costs, fertilizer costs, and land quality costs; we have to consider these costs all together as a system. I spoke to the lead author of the paper, Dr. John Field, from Colorado State University and asked him about the significance of this work. Agriculture is being challenged by increasing food demand, and changes to regional climate. On top of this, most plans to combat climate change rely on the agricultural sector to increase carbon storage in soils, and to produce raw materials for the large-scale production of biofuels and power. Modeling studies like ours attempt to predict on a farm-by-farm basis where the best opportunities for biofuel crop production and soil carbon storage lie, how much they might cost, and how those two goals trade off.  Our results suggest that biofuels can have a wide range of environmental outcomes depending on exactly where and how those crops are grown, but climate benefits can be increased at relatively low cost. This is another great example of clean energy technologies that will help us solve the climate problem while continuing our use of fuels that drive the economy. It’s a win-win situation."
"Meadows of seagrass are one of our great but sorely neglected wild plant spectacles. This humble plant spreads out in lush green carpets that can stretch for miles around much of Britain’s coast. There they shelter young fish and shellfish, as well as protecting against erosion of the coast by storms and floods, by trapping sediment in their roots.And the seagrass meadows also play a big part in fighting climate change. They soak up carbon dioxide and hold tremendous stores of carbon on the sea floor, more than twice the carbon stored by a forest of similar area. And across the world, seagrasses are believed to lock away more than 10% of all the carbon buried each year in the oceans.  Seagrasses around the UK are in serious decline, though, and their immense reservoirs of carbon are being released. Development and dredging are to blame, as well as pollution from sewage and farming washing huge amounts of nutrients into the sea, which kills the seagrasses. Old sewage plants overflow with untreated sewage during heavy rainfalls, which is illegal but common. And excessive nutrients from livestock waste slurry runs off into rivers and ends up in the sea."
"Earth has so far gone through five mass extinction events – scientists are worried we’re on course to trigger a sixth – and the deadliest one happened 252 million years ago at the end of the Permian geologic period. In this event, coined “the Great Dying,” over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. It took about 10 million years for life on Earth to recover from this catastrophic event. Scientists have proposed a number of possible culprits responsible for this mass extinction, including an asteroid impact, mercury poisoning, a collapse of the ozone layer, and acid rain. Heavy volcanic activity in Siberia was suspected to play a key role in the end-Permian event.  Recently, geologist Dr Benjamin Burger identified a rock layer in Utah that he believed might have formed during the Permian and subsequent Triassic period that could shed light on the cause of the Great Dying. During the Permian, Earth’s continents were still combined as one Pangea, and modern day Utah was on the supercontinent’s west coast. Samples from the end-Permian have been collected from rock layers in Asia, near the volcanic eruptions, but Utah was on the other side of Pangaea. Burger’s samples could thus provide a unique perspective of what was happening on the other side of the world from the eruptions. Burger collected and analyzed samples from the rock layer, and documented the whole process in a fascinating video: Burger’s samples painted a grim picture of Earth’s environment at the end of the Permian period. A sharp drop in calcium carbonate levels indicated that the oceans had become acidic. A similar decline in organic content matched up with the immense loss of life in the oceans during this period. The presence of pyrite pointed to an anoxic ocean (without oxygen), meaning the oceans were effectively one massive dead zone.  Bacteria ate the oversupply of dead bodies, producing hydrogen sulfide gas, creating a toxic atmosphere. The hydrogen sulfide oxidized in the atmosphere to form sulfur dioxide, creating acid rain, which killed much of the plant life on Earth. Elevated barium levels in the samples had likely been carried up from the ocean depths by a massive release of methane.  Levels of various metals in the rock samples were critical in identifying the culprit of this mass extinction event. As in end-Permian samples collected from other locations around the world, Burger didn’t find the kinds of rare metals that are associated with asteroid impacts. There simply isn’t evidence that an asteroid struck at the right time to cause the Great Dying. However, Burger did find high levels of mercury and lead in his samples, coinciding with the end of the Permian period. Mercury has also been identified in end-Permian samples from other sites. Lead and mercury aren’t associated with volcanic ash, but they are a byproduct of burning coal. Burger also identified a shift from heavier carbon-13 to lighter carbon-12; the latter results from burning fossil fuels. The Permian was the end of the Carboniferous period, which means “coal-bearing.” Many large coal deposits were created in the Carboniferous, including in Asia. Previous research has shown that the Permian mass extinction event didn’t coincide with the start of the Siberian volcanic eruptions and lava flows, but rather 300,000 years later. That’s when the lava began to inject as sheets of magma underground, where Burger’s data suggests it ignited coal deposits. The coal ignition triggered the series of events that led to Earth’s worst mass extinction. Its sulfur emissions created the acid rain that killed forests. Its carbon emissions acidified the oceans and warmed the planet, killing most marine life. The dead bodies fed bacteria that produced toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which in turn killed off more species. The warming of the oceans produced a large methane release, which accelerated global warming faster yet. As Burger put it, Things went from bad to worse, and you can now begin to understand how life nearly died out. Global warming, acid oceans, anoxia, not to mention a toxic atmosphere. We are lucky to be alive at all! Scientists are observing many of the same signs of dangerously rapid climate change today. There’s more lighter carbon-12 in the atmosphere because the increase in atmospheric carbon levels is due entirely to humans burning fossil fuels. There are an increasing number of dead zones in the oceans. Burning coal was causing acid rain, although we largely solved that problem through Clean Air Acts, and in the US, a sulfur dioxide cap and trade system implemented by a Republican administration.  We’ve had less success in tackling carbon dioxide pollution, which continues to rise. As a result, the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic, and temperatures increasingly hot. Scientists today also worry about potentially large releases of methane from the ocean floor and Arctic. These are some of the similarities between the climate change that nearly wiped out life on Earth 252 million years ago and the climate change today. Both appear to have largely been caused by burning coal. A 2011 study found that over the past 500 years, species are now going extinct at least as fast as they did during the five previous mass extinction events. It’s enough to make you think; maybe coal isn’t so beautiful and clean after all."
"Spring has come early in the form of blooming flowers and butterflies, according to readers around the UK who responded to our callout.   While enjoying an early bit of colour in window boxes, gardens and local wild spaces, many expressed concern that a warming climate was to blame. Below are some of the pictures and stories we’ve been receiving through the project – you can see more and add yours here. Daffodils in Rachel’s garden in Cornwall have been flowering along verges since late December. “The image above was taken on 11 January 2018 in the village of St Tudy, North Cornwall. Snowdrops are everywhere; primroses too in sheltered spots near St Agnes on the north coast. The magnolia tree in our south facing garden has had buds growing since the end of last year.” “This photo was taken in utter disbelief back in November and is the tip of the iceberg,” writes Brian, who lives in Torquay. “I’m aware the south coast is warmer than much of the rest of the British Isles, but wild snowdrops in November? I’m in my 60s, and this is a first.” Reader John Harris, a photographer at Capel Manor Gardens, Middlesex, sent the above image of an early season red admiral. The species is more commonly seen from around March but is the UK’s most popular. In 2017, red admiral numbers were seen by the Big Butterfly Count to have thrived, so they might be looking forward to an even better 2018. “Almost everything is out now, from snowdrops to daffodils,” writes Sylvia Clare from the Isle of Wight. “My hellebores orientalis were especially weird this year, flowering from mid October through to a second fuller flush now – more than one of them too. In the picture above you can just make out the older fading blooms under the taller newer ones. I’ve seen them in December before, but never October.” These early crocuses surprised a reader in Stourbridge.  And Verna Evans was walking in York House Gardens on 8 February and saw this as a sign spring had come early. “Iris in January?” asks a reader in Dumfries and Galloway. “Could the blue moon have anything to do with it? So many questions!”  Liyana Azmi got in touch from Glasgow. “I was lucky enough to snap this photo on a rare sunny day at Glasgow University after a heavy snowfall the night before. I’m pretty sure those are daffodil sprouts and find it quite surprising to see them around the third week of January.”"
"The Arctic spring is arriving 16 days earlier than it did a decade ago, according to a new study which shows climate change is shifting the season earlier more dramatically the further north you go. The research, published on Friday in the journal Scientific Reports, comes amid growing concern about the warming of Greenland, Siberia, Alaska and other far northern regions, which have recently experienced unusually prolonged and frequent midwinter temperature spikes.   The authors from the University of California, Davis, based the study on temperature records and 743 previous phenological studies looking at timings of bird migrations, flowers blooming and amphibians calling. The results showed a curve, with spring events occurring earlier further north of the equator.  “Spring is arriving earlier, and the Arctic is experiencing greater advances of spring than lower latitudes,” said lead author Eric Post, a fellow of the John Muir Institute and polar ecologist at UC Davis. Over the past 10 years, this means the end of winter will come about a day earlier in Los Angeles, but two weeks earlier in the Arctic. The authors say the northward increase in the rate of springtime advance is roughly three times greater than indicated by previous studies. This underlines how pronounced climate change is in the Arctic, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average and ice fields are rapidly shrinking.  The warming trend has been unusually apparent in recent weeks. Although the sun has not reached the high Arctic since October, temperatures has been above freezing for 61 hours – more than three times the previous record – at Greenland’s northernmost weather monitoring station. Martin Stendel, lead scientist of the Polar Portal and a senior researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute, said temperatures in the central Arctic have been 4C warmer than average this winter. In February, several regions were 10C above historic norms. Despite fluctuations, he expects this trend to continue.  “Think of waves on the beach. Some are high, some are low. That’s the weather. But in the background the tide is coming in. That’s climate change. Even though the waves haven’t changed their properties, they come closer and closer to your feet,” he says. The consequences would include increased melting of the ice sheet, less sea ice, thawing permafrost both on land and under the sea, less snow and more rain even in winter. The weather has appeared out of joint seasonally and geographically. As much of northern Europe was hit by blizzards and chills, the Danish media joked that residents should visit the Arctic special forces base at Daneborg because it is warmer there. The Information newspaper interviewed a member of the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol at the base – one of the most northern permanent outposts of humanity – who said the high temperature had turned slow into slush and made sledding heavy. The handful of troops at the base are used to spending months in cold and darkness. “The first day the sun doesn’t come up you think ‘Wow’,” one member told Greenland Today in 2015. “The water and the rivers stop running because they freeze. The fjord freezes too, so there are no waves or swells that lap at the shore. The small birds fly south so there is no birdsong. Only the ravens overwinter. And then a thick layer of snow comes that muffles everything even more.” On some patrols, they encounter blizzards that last for days and temperatures as low at -51C. But there is increasingly frequent respite in the form of warm “foehn wind”. This abrupt warming and drying of moist winds as they pass over ice-masses or mountains is commonly seen in the Alps. Similar phenomenon are the Chinook or “snow eater” of the North American Rocky Mountains; the Zonda of the South American Andes; and the Helm wind of the English Pennines. February has seen such warmth arrive with unprecedented frequency.  One member of the Arctic Patrol described the effect as surreal. “Outside, the dogs lie on their backs boiling and we dance around in our underwear enjoying it, until the cold returns.”    "
"The world’s greatest forests could lose more than half of their plant species by the end of the century unless nations ramp up efforts to tackle climate change, according to a new report on the impacts of global warming on biodiversity hotspots. Mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds are also likely to disappear on a catastrophic scale in the Amazon and other naturally rich ecosysterms in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia if temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, concludes the study by WWF, the University of East Anglia and the James Cook University. The research in the journal Climate Change examined the impact of three different levels of warming – 2C (the upper target in the 2015 Paris agreement), 3.2C (the likely rise given existing national commitments) and 4.5C (the forecast outcome if emissions trends remain unchanged) on nearly 80,000 plant and animal species in 35 of the world’s most biodiverse regions. If governments fail to set more ambitious commitments than those currently on the table, the report projects devastating losses of more than 60% of plant species and almost 50% of animal species in the Amazon at a temperature rise of 3.2C.  If countries lift their efforts sufficiently to reach the 2C goal, the outlook is improved – but still grim – with more than 35% of species at risk of local extinction in the region. If no actions are taken, the picture is apocalyptic, with a likely loss of more than 70% of plant and reptile species and a more than 60% decline of mammal, reptile and bird species in the Amazon. The picture was similarly alarming in the two other worst affected areas – south-west Australia and the Miombo woodlands in Africa. But nowhere among the selected 35 hotspots escaped massive losses of wildlife, which would have a dire knock-on effect on human society and wellbeing. The authors considered how warmer weather and wilder rainfall patterns (more droughts and storms) could negatively affect savannas in Africa, jungles in Bangladesh, the Cerrado-Pantanal in Brazil, the Yangtze delta and coastlines in Europe, Madagascar and the Caribbean. It noted how this would create tensions over water between humans and animals, for example African elephants, which drink as much as 250 litres (50 gallons) a day. Sea-level rises would also be devastating for many species, such as tigers in the Sundarbans, which would see 96% of breeding grounds submerged. The losses might even be higher because the disappearance of one species - such as a tree - can have a knock-on effect on other ecosystems. Fewer plants can also means less rain, according to other recent studies on the role played by the Amazon. More pressing risks – such as habitat loss from land clearance and pollution – were not accounted for. William Laurance, director of the Centre for Tropical Environmental and Sustainability Science, said: “For the Amazon and Guianas, the WWF report is scary as hell. The loss of half or more of the region’s stunning plant diversity would be a biological blow of almost unimaginable severity. “However, such computer models with all their assumptions and complexities are really ‘scientific cartoons’ giving us only a rough sketch of the future. But even if they’re only half right, these are very frightening cartoons indeed.” The study considered two main ways to reduce these losses: adaptation (helping species to migrate to new territories) and mitigation (cutting greenhouse gases more aggressively). The former produced modest improvements thanks to the creation of eco-corridors between protected areas, but this was little help to slow-moving or almost stationary groups, such as orchids, plants, amphibians and reptiles. WWF said there may be a need to translocate such species, which would otherwise be outrun by the pace of climate change. A partial solution may be relocation. Some animals, such as wolves, have been successfully reintroduced to their former ranges. A paper published today by the Royal identified 130 areas across the globe that might be suitable for carnivore reintroduction and concluded that rewilding will be essential for conservation in the future. Far better, the authors say, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep warming as close to 1.5C as possible. “The numbers are a bit of a wake-up call,” said Stephen Cornelius, chief adviser to WWF on climate issues. “If there is one message it is that mitigation makes a big difference. But even that is not enough for a lot of species ... What will be the new normal in coming decades is not something that wildlife has seen before.” Experts on Amazon wildlife said the findings were alarming, though they noted that such projections are a rough guide to the future.  Last month, a separate study predicted an ecological tipping point if 25% of the Amazon is deforested, which would cause droughts and environmental degradation over a wider area. The authors argue the 2014-15 drought in São Paulo is a precursor to what may come unless deforestation is halted and more trees are planted. While this is contentious and relates to the size of the forest rather than the number of species, it highlights the wider impacts of a diminished Amazon, which would apply to a different extent with the weakening of forests in other countries.  Many species are already at risk from other factors, such as habitat destruction, invasive rivals and disease. Climate change adds to those pressures, prompting fears that a sixth mass extinction is already underway."

"Major British towns and cities, including Glasgow, Wrexham, Aberdeen and Chester, could be much more severely affected by climate change than previously thought, according to new research. The study, by Newcastle University, analysed changes in flooding, droughts and heatwaves for every European city using all climate models. Looking at the impact by the year 2050-2100, the team produced results for three possible outcomes – low, medium and high-impact scenarios. But even the most optimistic case showed 85% of UK cities with a river, including London, would face increased flooding. In the high-impact scenario, some cities and towns in the UK and Ireland could see the amount of water per flood as much as double. The worst affected is Cork, which could see 115% more water per flooding, while Wrexham, Carlisle, Glasgow, and Chester could all see increases of more than 75%. The increase in severity in the predicted impact has come after the team, in a first of its kind, examined all three climate hazards together in the largest study of its kind ever undertaken. After around three years of analysing the information across hundreds of cities in Europe, they found every outcome was worse than previously thought. Wrexham, Carlisle, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Derry and Chester were the worst-hit UK towns and cities for river flooding, with Dublin, Cork and Waterford the worst in Ireland. All 571 cities studied saw a worsening in heatwaves and the high-impact scenario predicted southern Europe experiencing droughts 14 times worse than today. The lead author, Selma Guerreiro, said: “Although southern European regions are adapted to cope with droughts, this level of change could be beyond breaking point. “Furthermore, most cities have considerable changes in more than one hazard, which highlights the substantial challenge cities face in managing climate risks.” While southern European cities saw the biggest increase in the number of heatwave days, central European cities saw the greatest increase in temperature during heatwaves – ranging between 2C to 7C for the low scenario and 8C to 14C for the high scenario. A co-author, Prof Richard Dawson, said: “The research highlights the urgent need to design and adapt our cities to cope with these future conditions. “We are already seeing at first hand the implications of extreme weather events in our capital cities. “In Paris, the Seine rose more than four metres above its normal water level. And as Cape Town prepares for its taps to run dry, this analysis highlights that such climate events are feasible in European cities too.” Published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the research found the European capitals worst hit by flooding would be Dublin, Helsinki, Riga, Vilnius and Zagreb. Under the high-impact scenario, several European cities saw more than 80% increases on peak river flows. Stockholm and Rome could see the greatest increase in number of heatwave days, while Prague and Vienna could see the greatest increase in maximum temperatures during heatwaves. Lisbon and Madrid are in the top capital cities for increases in frequency and magnitude of droughts, while Athens, Nicosia, Valletta and Sofia might experience the worst increases in both drought and heatwaves. Next month the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is holding its first cities and climate change science conference, after recognising the important role cites must play in tackling climate change. Over 75% of the population of the EU currently lives in urban areas, and this percentage is expected to grow to 82% by 2050. And already the impact is being felt, as between 1998-2009 floods in Europe caused 1,126 deaths and at least €52bn in insured economic losses. Dawson, who sits on the scientific steering committee for the conference, said: “A key objective for this conference is to bring together and catalyse action from researchers, policymakers and industry to address the urgent issue of preparing our cities, their population, buildings and infrastructure for climate change.” The team used projections from all available models associated with the high emission scenario RCP8.5, which implies a 2.6C to 4.8C increase in global temperature. They found the British Isles have some of the worst overall flood projections, with the high scenario predicting half of UK cities could see at least a 50% increase on peak river flows."
"No customers were troubling the Jaguar showroom in Welwyn Garden City on Friday, at the start of what is usually its busiest month. Even one with a car on order had not turned up in the snow, said Mark Lavery, chief executive of Cambria Automobiles, looking at a £75,000 Jaguar coupe: “She doesn’t want to spoil an F-type with all that salt on the roads.” The unseasonal weather will only be a blip on sales: a bigger worry for the industry is the dark, persistent cloud over the future of diesel. The bottom is falling out of the market, to the point where one of Lavery’s managing directors couldn’t persuade his own mother to buy one: “His mum is 74, has driven a diesel for the last 15 years and has now changed it for a petrol one – a higher carbon-emitting, more polluting car.” Yet while diesel vehicles were pushed by the industry and government on the promise of cutting carbon dioxide emissions, the world is now more urgently addressing its dirty corollary: the NOx emissions which have fouled urban areas and contribute to 40,000-50,000 premature deaths a year in the UK alone from air pollution.  The drumbeat against diesel picked up pace this week as judges decided that German cities, in the heart of Europe’s biggest car market, have the right to ban diesels on their streets, and Rome’s mayor proposed an outright ban from 2024, a year before Paris expects the same.  In London, in April 2019 an ultra-low emission zone will double the congestion charge payable to drive in the city centre for any but the very newest, Euro 6, diesel cars, and campaigners are pushing for even tougher sanctions. Boroughs including Islington and Camden have introduced higher parking charges for diesel drivers.  Other UK cities are still considering how to implement so-called “toxin taxes” on drivers of older vehicles, although Manchester and Leeds have made clear that ordinary car drivers would not be charged.  Some manufacturers see the writing on the wall: this week, Fiat Chrysler announced plans to end production of diesel cars by 2022; Porsche has ditched two models and Toyota has indicated it will never launch a new diesel.  But British manufacturers are keen to resist: Jaguar Land Rover in particular is on the hook, with diesel representing around 90% of its cars sold in 2017. It invested heavily four years ago in a new, multi-billion pound Euro 6 engine plant in Wolverhampton, just as Ford was spending almost £400m on its diesel plant in Dagenham.  In 2017, UK car sales fell, marginally, for the first time in five years – but diesel numbers tumbled spectacularly, by 17.1%. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) pointed to relatively small tax reforms announced by the chancellor in the autumn as prompting a further exodus, with 30% fewer diesels sold last November and December than the same time in 2016. Even if measures are far short of any ban, David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: “In a sense the damage is already being done. Consumers have been spooked.”  Bailey predicts that diesel’s UK market share will drop from one in two cars sold in the first half of this decade to one in seven by 2025.  Growing evidence about the health damage from diesel pollution was thrust to the forefront by the Volkswagen scandal. While only the German manufacturer was found to be deliberately rigging emission tests, virtually every other carmakers’ model was found to be far dirtier outside the lab. As the industry lobbied to delay stringent, real-world emission tests, the interim period saw some models licensed as Euro 6-compliant that would breach limits set after September 2017.  Greenpeace has now unearthed data showing many Euro 6 models on sale emit far more NOx than industry rhetoric about their cleanest cars might lead people to believe. Bailey says: “That’s likely to add to confusion for consumers over whether they should buy diesel at all. On this, the industry seems to have collectively shot itself in the foot.” Resale values have fallen: according to comparison website motorway.co.uk, the average price of a used diesel car fell 5% between the first and final quarter of 2017, while petrol models grew 10% more expensive.  Lavery is unsurprised: “In and around the M25, there’s a massive switch to hybrid and petrol – less so outside. The conversation is, I want out of my diesel and into a petrol. The average consumer isn’t concerned about their emissions: they’re concerned they won’t be able to drive it where they want to without being penalised.”  He said that there are “pre-Euro 6 cars that, frankly, have the emissions of a small third world country”.  But he worries that people are being deterred from buying newer, cleaner diesels. “We shop online and a lot of things get delivered by the oldest, most polluting vans. Government has to come up with a scrappage scheme to get them off the roads – but the current policy just encourages the opposite.” The SMMT warned this week that the decline of diesel models would increase Britain’s carbon emissions as petrol engines are less fuel efficient – although the larger effect on rising CO2 was the sale of larger cars.  The campaigners who forced the government, through a supreme court challenge, to belatedly tackle Britain’s dangerously polluted air remain sceptical. Andrea Lee of ClientEarth said: “It is no use flying the flag for a ‘clean’ technology when we keep seeing more incriminating data that confirms that it isn’t.”"

"The increasing strength, intensity and duration of tropical cyclones has climate scientists asking whether a new classification needs to be created: a category-six storm.  The Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale currently runs in severity from one to five, with five describing near-total destruction.   But climate scientists meeting at a conference in the New Zealand city of Wellington have floated the idea of creating a category six to reflect the increasing severity of tropical cyclones in the wake of warming sea temperatures and climate change.  Climatologist Michael Mann, the director of the Earth system science center at Penn State University said the current scale could be viewed as increasingly outdated.  “Scientifically, [six] would be a better description of the strength of 200mph (320km/h) storms, and it would also better communicate the well-established finding now that climate change is making the strongest storms even stronger,” he said. He pointed out that category five was previously considered the highest category necessary because it led to essentially total destruction of human infrastructure. But that was no longer true owing to sturdier construction “Since the scale is now used as much in a scientific context as it is a damage assessment context, it makes sense to introduce a category six to describe the unprecedented strength 200mph storms we’ve seen over the past few years both globally [Patricia] and here in the southern hemisphere [Winston].” New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, said cyclone Winston in 2016 – the strongest cyclone on record in the southern hemisphere – was an example of a cyclone that could have been scaled up to a category six; if the category existed.  “The international cyclone rankings don’t go higher than category five, the only reason it wasn’t a category-six cyclone is because we don’t have a category six, but we might need one in the future,” Shaw told the conference. But Chris Brandolino, principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, said the ramifications of introducing another category to the scale could be complex, because meteorologists were trained in the old scale, and the public were educated about what the scale means, and how to prepare. “Categories are engaging to the public and its easy for us to understand and communicate the severity of a storm,” said Brandolino. “I always encourage us re-evaluating the science, we should always be asking ‘is what we are doing appropriate for the time?’ But I think if we are seriously to consider this it requires a holistic approach, looking at the whole scale, not just adding a category. Maybe the whole scale gets rejigged to reflect the times.” Mann said re-evaluating the scale or adding a category six would have implications for the preparedness of communities in the cyclone’s path, and on scientists’ ability to understand cyclone behaviour as it changes in an age of climate change.   "
"A team of international scientists is due to set off for the world’s biggest iceberg on Wednesday, fighting huge waves and the encroaching Antarctic winter, in a mission aiming to answer fundamental questions about the impact of climate change in the polar regions. The scientists, led by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), are trying to reach a newly revealed ecosystem that had been hidden for 120,000 years below the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic peninsula. In July last year, part of the Larsen C ice shelf calved away, forming a huge iceberg - A68 - which is four times bigger than London, and revealing life beneath for the first time. Now scientists say it is a race against time to explore these new ecosystems before they are transformed by exposure to the light. Marine biologist Dr Katrin Linse from the BAS is leading the mission which sets off on a voyage across the Southern Ocean from the Falklands Islands on Wednesday. They expect to reach the iceberg within a week.  “The calving of A68 provides us with a unique opportunity to study marine life as it responds to a dramatic environmental change,” she said. “It’s important we get there quickly before the undersea environment changes as sunlight enters the water and new species begin to colonise … It’s very exciting.” Prof David Vaughan, science director at BAS, said: “We need to be bold on this one. Larsen C is a long way south and there’s lots of sea ice in the area, but this is important science, so we will try our best to get the team where they need to be.” He said climate change had already affected the seas around Antarctica and is warming some coastal waters. “Future warming may make some habitats warm. Where these habitats support unique species that are adapted to love the cold and not the warm, those species are going to either move or die. How fast species can disperse, and how fast ecosystems can colonise new areas, is key to understanding where the Antarctic is likely to be resilient, and where it is vulnerable.” Last week the Guardian printed the first images of creatures found in a previously unexplored region of the Antarctic seabed, taken during a Greenpeace research expedition to the Antarctic which is part of a wider campaign to turn a huge section of the region into the world’s biggest ocean sanctuary. Speaking onboard the Greenpeaceship Arctic Sunrise, the group’s head of oceans, Will McCallum, said there was “still so much left to learn about ocean life here in the Antarctic”. “From hidden ecosystems revealed by calving icebergs, to our research missions to the seafloor which have found an abundance of rare and vulnerable species - this place is bursting with life and a vast Antarctic Ocean sanctuary would help us protect it in all its forms.”  There is growing concern about the possible impact of climate change in the Antarctic. Earlier this month, a report revealed that melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise. The research published by the National Academies of Sciences said, at the current rate, the world’s oceans will be on average at least 60cm (2ft) higher by the end of the century. However it found that the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of the acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows. Experts say the area around the Antarctic peninsula has seen widespread ice shelf decay and collapse in recent decades, leading to “glacier acceleration” and increased discharge of ice from the Antarctic continent into the sea. However scientists are wary of attributing the calving of the Larsen C iceberg directly to global warming.  Adrian Luckman, professor of glaciology at Swansea University and leader of a project studying the state of the ice shelf, said: “Whilst the Larsen C ice shelf has reduced in area since records began, suggesting that over the long-term the environment of the Antarctic peninsula is becoming less able to support ice shelves, we have no evidence to link this particular calving event to changing conditions. Iceberg calving is a natural part of the ice shelf cycle and, whilst large, the calving of A68 is not unprecedented.”"

"The Greens have proposed introducing mandatory fuel efficiency standards, ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and imposing a four-year 17% tax on luxury petrol and diesel cars as part of an electric vehicle policy announced on Tuesday. Under the proposal Australia would adopt a mandatory fuel efficiency standard of 105g of CO2 a kilometre by 2022, three years earlier than a proposal being considered by the federal government.  It would also cut tariffs and charges on new electric or zero-emissions vehicles, including the 5% import tariff, GST and stamp duty, in order to lower the purchase price to match new petrol or diesel cars, and offer three years free registration on new zero-emissions vehicles. The tax breaks, as well as a $151m national fund to build up to 3,000 electric car charging stations, would be funded by a 17% tax on fossil fuel emitting cars with a purchase price of more than $65,000. That tax would be imposed on top of the existing 33% luxury vehicle tax for cars in that price range and is expected to generate $500m a year over a limited four-year run. A University of New South Wales researcher, Gail Broadbent, who is studying electric vehicles at the university’s school of biological, earth, and environmental sciences, said the targets were achievable and would increase Australia’s sluggish adoption of electric vehicles, provided exemptions were included for remote Indigenous communities that were unlikely to have access to a charging station. Broadbent said introducing strict vehicle emissions targets was essential for increasing the uptake of hybrid, electric, fuel cell and other zero-emissions vehicles in Australia. “There is no incentive for vehicle manufacturers to bring them into the country so we just get fobbed off the old vehicles,” she told Guardian Australia. “Electric vehicles are cheaper to maintain so there’s no incentive for manufacturers to bring them here if the policy settings do not shift.” The proposal would also impose targets on large car manufacturers so that 2% of all car and light vehicle sales in Australia in 2020, increasing to 10% by 2050, were of zero-emissions vehicles. Electric cars make up just 0.1% of new car sales in Australia, compared with 20% in Norway and the Netherlands, which have both introduced targets to phase out fossil fuel emitting cars by 2025 and 2030 respectively.  Broadbent said research by UNSW showed concern about the lack of charging stations was the biggest barrier to Australians purchasing an electric car. According to the environment and energy minister Josh Frydenberg, Australia has 476 public car charging stations. The Turnbull government, through the ministerial forum on vehicle emissions, proposed introducing a mandatory 105g CO2 per km fuel efficiency standard by 2025, prompting strong backlash from the automotive industry and lobby groups.  A discussion paper excluded consideration of the fuel standards which would provide “the greatest health and environmental benefits”. Frydenberg has said the federal government supports the rollout of electric vehicles, including offering a discount to the luxury car tax for low-emissions vehicles. He says he expects the number of electric vehicles on Australian roads to increase almost 60-fold to 230,000 cars by 2025. The Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, called on Labor to support the policy, which was to be announced as part of the Batman byelection campaign.  “This plan is the quantum leap we need to reduce emissions, meet our paltry Paris targets and to stop people dying from air pollution,” Bandt said. Federal Labor’s emissions reduction policies are focused around a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, but the South Australian Labor government, which will go to the polls on the same day as Batman, has pledged to waive stamp duty and five years’ registration costs for new electric or zero-emissions cars if re-elected."
"Bank holdings in “extreme” fossil fuels skyrocketed globally to $115bn during Donald Trump’s first year as US president, with holdings in tar sands oil more than doubling, a new report has found. A sharp flight from fossil fuels investments after the Paris agreement was reversed last year with a return to energy sources dubbed “extreme” because of their contribution to global emissions. This included an 11% hike in funding for carbon-heavy tar sands, as well as Arctic and ultra-deepwater oil and coal.  US and Canadian banks led a race back into the unconventional energy sector following Trump’s promise to withdraw from Paris, with JPMorgan Chase increasing its coal funding by a factor of 21, and quadrupling its tar sands assets. Chase’s $5.6bn surge in tar sands holdings added to nearly $47bn of gains for the industry last year, according to the report by NGOs including BankTrack, the Sierra Club and Rainforest Action Network (RAN). RAN spokeswoman, Alison Kirsch, accused banks such as JPMorgan Chase of “moving backwards in lockstep with their wrongheaded political leaders”. “If we are to have any chance of halting catastrophic climate change, there must be an end of expansion and complete phase-out of these dangerous energy sources,” she said. “Banks need to be accountable and implement policies guarding against extreme fossil fuel funding.” JPMorgan Chase has asked the US securities and exchanges commission for support in its bid to block a shareholder resolution calling for a bank report on financial and climate risks associated with tar sands projects. Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion remain the biggest tar sands backers, with $38bn of holdings between them. Kelly Martin, a campaign director at Sierra Club, said: “Tar sands and other fossil fuel projects threaten our climate, public health, and communities, and until they stop supporting them financially, major banks … are complicit in this destruction.” The bulk of new “extreme” investments came in a doubling of loans and bonds to Canada’s government-backed tar sands industry, even though its success would be disastrous for climate mitigation efforts, according to the former Nasa chief James Hansen. Bank funding for tar sands production and pipelines more than doubled last year – compared to the 2015-16 period, when then-US president Barack Obama nixed the Keystone pipeline project, which Trump subsequently reapproved. Support for coal among the 36 banks surveyed was also up by 6% in 2017 after a 38% plunge in 2016. Large Chinese banks actually reduced these investments last year and in Europe, BNP Paribas and ING moved to limit their exposure to fossil fuel assets. However, 14 European banks collectively increased their coal financing by more than $2bn last year, with HSBC the worst performer by far. “Europe’s top banks have got to stop their coal-focused assault on the Paris agreement,” said Johan Frijns, the director of BankTrack. “It is now vital that they move to stamp out their financial support for companies developing new coal-fired power plants around the world.”"
"CO2 emissions from the average new car sold in the UK rose last year for the first time since 2000, according to an industry report, raising fears that the country will fail to meet its climate change targets as consumers buy bigger vehicles and turn against diesel.  Although motor manufacturers said new models coming on to the market were on average about 12% more fuel-efficient than their older versions, campaigners said a higher proportion of gas-guzzling vehicles leaving the forecourt had led to a 0.8% increase in the average amount of C02 generated per new car.   Falling consumer confidence has affected the lower end of the car market, with sales of the smallest, cheapest vehicle down by more than 10%.  The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said an “anti-diesel agenda” was contributing to the rise in CO2 emissions. Diesel registrations fell by 17% last year after the emissions scandals. Diesel engines have tended to have greater fuel efficiency than petrol engines, but have been responsible for a rapid rise in NOx emissions and severe air pollution in urban areas. The SMMT said the decline in diesel would make it harder for the UK to hit its CO2 reduction targets. Its report acknowledged that cheaper running costs may have encouraged committed diesel drivers to buy bigger models, noting: “Consumers appear to have often used the improved efficiency of the products to enable them to move into larger and higher value vehicles.” Greg Archer, of the cleaner transport campaign group Transport & Environment, said: “The principal reason CO2 emissions are rising is that carmakers are selling more gas-guzzling SUVs. Blaming the slump in diesel sales is a smokescreen that hide their failure to fit fuel efficiency technologies to the new cars they are selling.” The SMMT said sales of electric cars were disappointing and thatlong-term incentives would be needed to achieve cuts in CO2 emissions of almost 6% a year until 2021 under EU requirements. The industry said confusion over government policy was causing buyers to hold back, particularly tax changes that took effect last April and more announced in the autumn budget. Despite long-term hopes for electric and hybrid vehicles, 95% of the UK’s 2.5m new cars sold were still either petrol or diesel.  Average emissions for a new car rose to 121.0g of CO2 per kilometre, which was the same as 2015 levels. However, the levels were 33% lower than those in 2000. Estimates of CO2 emissions of the average new car are likely to be 20% higher from September 2018, when tests designed to better reflect normal driving comes into force.  Total CO2 emissions from all cars in use on UK roads are down just 7% since 2000, according to the SMMT report. This is despite the gradual replacement of vehicles with more efficient models. Emissions have risen over the last three years owing to increased traffic on UK roads.  Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: “The industry shares government’s vision of a low-carbon future and is investing to get us there – but we can’t do it overnight; nor can we do it alone. The anti-diesel agenda has set back progress on climate change, while electric vehicle demand remains disappointingly low amid consumer concerns around charging infrastructure availability and affordability.  “To accelerate fleet renewal, motorists must have the confidence to invest in the cleanest cars for their needs – however they are powered. A consistent approach to incentives and tax, and greater investment in charging infrastructure will be critical.” Sales of new cars declined by 5.7% last year after five years of growth, with plunging diesel sales after the government signalled tax changes on company cars and cities considered punitive measures to tackle air quality after the VW diesel test-rigging scandal. "
"The rise of electric cars in Europe is being hampered by a lack of models for consumers to choose from rather than a lack of public recharging points, according to energy companies and carmakers. Some motoring groups and insurers have warned over the past year that the number of chargers is putting the switch to electric transport at risk. But an analysis by the Platform for Electromobility – whose 31 members include Tesla, Renault-Nissan, Brussels-based campaign group T&E and industrial groups Siemens and Alstom – found there are already enough points in Europe. Across the EU, there are about six electric cars for each public charging point, almost twice as many as the 10 cars per point recommended by the European commission. Charging infrastructure is expected to keep pace with the number of electric cars on the road until at least 2020, based on a review of governments’ plans. One fast charger is expected for every 40km of highway by 2020, well ahead of the one per 65km that Brussels wants by 2025. Greg Archer, one of the authors of the analysis, said: “It is a myth that has been spread by the car industry to create the impression they would love to sell more electric cars but there just isn’t the charging points out there. It’s a smokescreen.” A sufficient number of public chargers is essential if the electric car market is to grow beyond the early adopters who have access to off-street parking and can charge at home, the group said. Provided governments deliver on their plans, it’s seen as unlikely that there will be a shortfall in public points. By comparison, carmakers have launched only a small number of fully electric models. There are just 20 battery electric vehicles on sale in Europe against 417 conventional petrol and diesel ones, according to T&E. Some of the electric models, such as the Opel Ampera-E – known as the Chevy Bolt in the US – are on limited supply and have months-long waiting times. “The car industry has deliberately suppressed the market for electric cars, which is shameful,” said Archer.  Next Green Car, an online guide that monitors the electric car market, expects about 13 new fully electric car models in the UK this year. These include the new Nissan Leaf, which is aimed at the mass market, and the high-end Jaguar i-Pace, the British carmaker’s first all-electric vehicle. A further 19 models are expected to go on sale in the UK during 2019. Experts told MPs on Tuesday that a lack of models was holding back growth in electric cars, but that was likely to change soon. “The key barriers we’re seeing is the range of vehicles on the market at the moment,” Andrew Benfield, the group director of transportation at the Energy Saving Trust, told the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee. Mark Squires, the head of the industry group that represents car dealers, said: “There isn’t a broad range of pure electric vehicles available.” But the choice issue is likely to be addressed in the next two years, MPs were told. “There are some very viable cars coming in the next 18 months,” said Georg Ell, director of western Europe at Tesla. He also confirmed the firm had taken UK orders for its electric semi-truck, which it unveiled last year. However, Squires said some drivers still believed there were not enough charging points. “There is a perception, it may not be the full reality, that easy charging access is going to be an issue and that is putting consumers off,” he said. In England, the average driver is four miles from a charging point, in Scotland it is three miles and in Wales it is 12 miles, the Energy Saving Trust has found.  The worst area is Devon, with an average of 45 miles, and the best is London, with a tenth of a mile in some boroughs. “What we’re seeing is something of a postcode lottery,” said Benfield. A growing number of energy companies are moving into car charging infrastructure, such as Npower’s German owner, Innogy, and Italy’s Enel, while the UK’s National Grid is in talks with carmakers to build a network of super rapid chargers at motorway service stations. The car industry rejected the charge it was not making enough electric models available. “Europe’s auto manufacturers undertake every effort to make e-mobility a success,” said a spokesperson for the European carmakers’ body, the ACEA. “Apart from manufacturing electric vehicles, we also need to consider factors that are beyond the auto industry’s responsibility, such as investments in the necessary recharging infrastructure.”"
"A marine heatwave in Western Australia in 2010 set off a massive “carbon bomb”, damaging the world’s largest seagrass meadow, releasing millions of tonnes of carbon that had been collected for thousands of years below the surface. Although Australia doesn’t currently count carbon released from damaged seagrass meadows in its official greenhouse gas emissions, if it did, the results mean those figures might need to be revised upwards by more than 20%.  Seagrass is a flowering grass-like plant that grows in shallow waters. It gathers carbon dissolved in the sea and buries it below the surface, often storing similar amounts of carbon in the top metre of sediment as is stored in tropical forests. But unlike forests that store carbon for about 60 years before releasing much of it, seagrass meadows often store the carbon for thousands of years until they are disturbed. That process is thought to offset up to 2% of humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies have shown that when the top layer of actively growing seagrass is disturbed – either by local impacts such as boat anchors or climatic impacts like heatwaves – the carbon that has been sequestered over thousands of years can be quickly released. Since the start of the 20th century, seagrass meadows worldwide have declined at an average rate of 0.9% per year, mostly due to direct human impacts such as coastal development and water quality degradation. Over the last century about 29% of global seagrass has been destroyed and it is estimated it is releasing carbon at a rate similar to the emissions of Australia and the UK combined. Oscar Serrano and colleagues from Edith Cowan University in Western Australia examined how much carbon was released when the world’s largest collection of seagrass meadows at Shark Bay were damaged by a marine heatwave in 2010 and 2011. Between 0.6% and 2.4% of the world’s seagrass coverage exists in that one location, where it has been growing for about 8,000 years. “Despite seagrasses having thrived over millennia in Shark Bay, unprecedented widespread losses occurred in the austral summer of 2010/2011,” the authors wrote in their paper published in Nature Climate Change. The stored carbon is released when the dead seagrass allows oxygen to penetrate the layers of dead seagrass, changing the bacteria that live in it. Estimates vary as to how much oxygen can penetrate the dead seagrass, and therefore how much carbon is released after a disturbance. The researchers found 22% of the seagrass in Shark Bay was lost after the heatwave, compared with a 2002 baseline. Depending on how much oxygen that allowed to penetrate the layers of dead seagrass, the researchers found that caused the release of between 2m and 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent, in just the three years following the heatwave. They found that if the seagrass loss was counted in Australia’s national emissions accounting in that period, it would have boosted Australia’s emissions from land-use change by between 4% and 21%. “It’s a carbon bomb,” said Gary Kendrick, a co-author on the paper from the University of Western Australia. “And it’s one that has gone off without documentation. “If we’re not counting this carbon, then we’re underestimating our footprint.” Since seagrass meadows can take decades to repair, the researchers said the damage from the heatwave could cause up to 21m tonnes of CO2 to be released over the following 40 years. Serrano said the damaged seagrass has a double-whammy impact on emissions. “So when you have an event such as the losses at Shark Bay, you not only lose the seagrass as a way of removing CO2, but the sequestered gas is released back into the atmosphere during seagrass matter decomposition,” said Serrano. The researchers said local impacts such as inappropriate tourism and fishing could be managed to protect the loss of seagrass, but protecting them against climate change may require more radical interventions. They suggested manually sowing seeds or transplanting seedlings as options that should be considered, since encouraging faster recovering would limit the amount of carbon lost after the disturbance. They also said more controversial options – such as transplanting more resilient species not native to the area – might also need to be considered."

"As humans emit heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, the planet warms, and over time consequences become more apparent. Some of the consequences we are familiar with – for instance, rising temperatures, melting ice, and rising sea levels. Scientists certainly want to know how much the Earth has changed, but we also want to know how fast the changes will be in the future to know what the next generations will experience. One of the classic projections into the future is for sea level rise. It is expected that by the year 2100, the ocean levels will rise a few feet by the end of the century. This matters a lot because globally, 150 million people live within three feet of current ocean levels. We have built our modern infrastructure based on current ocean levels. What happens to peoples’ homes and infrastructure when the waters rise?  But projecting ocean levels into the future is not simple; we need good data that extends back decades to understand how fast the climate is changing. The classic way to measure ocean levels is by using tide gauges. These are placed just offshore, around the globe to get a sense of how the ocean levels are changing. The problem with tide gauges is they only measure water levels at their location, and their locations are always near shore.  In order to get a better sense of how oceans are changing everywhere, a complementary technology called satellite altimetry is used. Basically, the satellites shoot a radar beam from space to the ocean surface and watch for the reflection of the beam back to space. From this beam, the satellite can calculate the height of the water. Satellites can emit beams continuously as the satellite passes over open oceans, and can gather data far from shorelines. In doing so, they provide the equivalent of a global network of nearly half a million tide gauges, providing sea surface height information every 10 days for over 25 years. Just recently, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a paper has been published that collects all the available satellite altimetry data and asks whether the sea level rise is accelerating. The authors of the paper are a well-respected team and include Dr. Steven Nerem from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and Dr. John Fasullo, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The authors collected data from four generations of satellites that have carried out this altimetry task. The most recent satellite is called Jason 3, launched in 2016. The satellites generate the data shown below. While in any given year ocean levels may rise a bit or fall a bit, the authors focused on the long-term trend (the white line). They found that the long-term trend is, indeed, accelerating. The rate of acceleration is approximately 0.084 mm per year per year. That may not sound like much, but were this rate of acceleration to continue (a conservative estimate), the authors project that by the end of the century oceans with rise approximately 65 cm (more than two feet).  In the study, the authors quantified what was causing the ocean waters to rise. Part of the rise is related to what’s called thermal expansion (warmer water is less dense so it expands). In the past, this was responsible for the majority of sea level rise. More recently, however, melting ice has contributed more and more to sea level rise. As land-based ice melts, the liquid water flows into the oceans and increases the mass of water in the oceans. The two largest ice sheets (also the two largest contributors to sea level rise) are found on Greenland and Antarctica. There are other sources of melting ice, such as mountain-top glaciers that also are contributing, but the lion’s share of melting contribution is from the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets. Is this acceleration very important? Well the authors answer that question. They calculate that the acceleration will cause more than half of the sea level rise that will occur by the year 2100. Right now, sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3 mm per year. If that rate remained constant until the year 2100 (no acceleration), oceans would be about 25 cm higher than they are today. But a continued acceleration would cause a rise of 65 cm. So, this seemingly small acceleration makes a huge impact.  The authors are careful to note that if anything, their results are conservative. They don’t account for potential catastrophic losses of major ice sheets. Just recently a study appeared that showed an acceleration in land-ice loss from Antarctica. Meanwhile, at the northern tip of our planet, temperatures are soaring. If these trends continue, we may be in store for a rude awakening with a rapid destabilization in a major ice sheet that would have dire implications for coastal communities around the world."
"Bravo, Mark Boyle – your world sounds very beguiling to an oldie like me (I left a troubled world behind. Now let me tell you how to fix it, 20 March). However, I’ve lost count of the number of times in my life that I have heard this siren song, but no one with any influence ever seems to listen or even wake up. But, as Mark says, we can try small remedies ourselves should we be lucky enough to have a garden. It reminds me of an old Canadian friend who was convinced he could protect his family from the coming apocalypse by buying a farm, until he realised he’d have to have a gun – and use it – to stop those less fortunate from taking what he had.

"Anthony Albanese says Labor should not single out existing projects, like the Adani coalmine, that have already gone through approval processes “and then retrospectively change existing laws, which would have ramifications across the board”. The Labor frontbencher has effectively ruled out Labor overhauling the Environmental Protection Biodiversity and Conversation Act as part of a strategy to boost legal options of killing the controversial Queensland coal project. While Labor has been considering a range of policy options, including the possible insertion of a climate trigger in the Act, Albanese told the ABC “certainly there has been no suggestion from Labor that that is something that we should do”. “We haven’t said at any stage that we would do that.” He added that the Adani project had already secured the required environmental approvals “not once, but twice. It was approved firstly and then they made a decision that what they would need to do is to re-examine it in light of the potential impacts on the Great Barrier Reef and again it was approved”. “It has received its state approvals – both of those rounds of approvals by the way under Coalition governments, not Labor governments.” And referencing the byelection in the Melbourne electorate of Batman, where the Greens are already escalating their ground campaign efforts against Labor on Adani – Albanese explicitly warned colleagues against making a short-term political decision that would have long-term policy implications. “What you can’t do is look at any one electorate and say this is why we are going to determine national policy on something like mining or energy or climate change action,” Albanese said. “What you have to do is to get the policy mechanisms right and that is what we have done.” The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been publicly telegraphing a hardening of Labor’s position on the Adani project since late January, but has yet to clarify what specific options the ALP might take. This week, Shorten has been visiting Queensland coastal electorates, and sending a positive message about the future of coal, while also highlighting his concerns about the Adani project. Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, delivered a much less equivocal message. On Monday he used his speech to the Sydney Institute to argue developing the Galilee Basin was not in Australia’s national interest because it would displace mining and jobs in existing coal regions, and would not help the world meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. Internal views within Labor are mixed, with some key players favouring killing the project on climate grounds, but others concerned that option will expose Labor to a damaging political backlash about sovereign risk. The mining union has urged Labor not to toughen its position on the project, because stopping Adani will trigger an internal debate inside the party about the future of coalmining, and will cost the ALP politically in Queensland. Albanese said he did not believe the Adani project would ultimately proceed, because it would not get government subsidies, which would help the mine attract private finance. “The conservation movement said to me repeatedly ... this project doesn’t stack up unless it gets some public subsidy through the rail line,” Albanese said. “Now we ensured that that would not occur and indeed the Queensland Labor government has also said that they won’t support that subsidy and hence we have a project that doesn’t have any finance here in Australia, unable to raise funds in the US, unable to raise funds in China – and therefore it is hard to see this project going ahead because of the economics of the project”. Adani has confirmed it has now abandoned its March deadline for securing financing for the first stage of the Carmichael mine."
"Electricity retailers could be allowed to defer a proportion of their emissions reductions obligations under the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee to give the energy sector time to adjust to the new regime. The deferral idea is floated in a new discussion paper about the guarantee prepared by the Energy Security Board to kick off consultations about how the Turnbull government’s proposal would work – assuming the Neg gets the backing of state governments.  The 58-page paper, released on Thursday afternoon, says retailers could be permitted to defer up to a mandated limit, perhaps 20% of their emissions in a given compliance year, to provide “flexibility” as the scheme takes effect. It also suggests retailers would be permitted to carry forward any “overachievement” on emissions reduction, and use that in the next compliance year, rather than the counter resetting each year. The Neg, proposed by the Turnbull government last year, would impose a reliability obligation and an emissions reduction on energy retailers and a small number of large electricity users. The new emissions reduction target proposed for the electricity sector is 26% on 2005 levels by 2030. The government unveiled the proposal last year, hailing it as an idea that could end the decade-long toxic climate wars, but state governments led by South Australia have resisted the proposal on the basis it is not sufficiently friendly to renewable energy. The release of Thursday’s discussion paper sets off a very tight timetable of technical consultations with stakeholders. The Energy Security Board wants feedback by March, and will brief energy ministers in April about the design of the scheme. The discussion paper underscores the fact the Neg will require a significant overhaul of the existing national electricity market arrangements, including a new bureaucracy to ensure compliance. The paper makes it clear the proposed emissions reduction target – considered by a number of experts as too low to see Australia meet its obligations under the Paris agreement – will be locked in for 10 years. While energy regulators have signalled that an incoming Labor government would have scope to quickly ratchet up the level of ambition in the emissions reduction target, the language in the paper on that option is cooler. The paper proposes that further adjustments to the target be made at five-yearly intervals to “ensure the market has, at any time, between five and 10 years of targets available to guide investment decisions”. The Turnbull government has floated that retailers will be able to use offsets, like international permits, to help them meet their emissions reduction obligations at least cost, but the new discussion paper suggests that use will be limited. It suggests if offsets are in the mix, then the government could “place a limit on the volume of offsets that could be used for compliance with the emissions requirement across the national electricity market”. The paper suggests the regulation could be a percentage limit, for example, 10% of the electricity emissions target, or an absolute limit, for example, 500,000 units of offsets per year. The discussion paper confirms that power used by industries designated as energy intensive and trade exposed “should be effectively exempt from the emissions requirement” and it suggests other industries will “need to make up the difference” to ensure the emissions reduction target for electricity is met. It says care will need to be taken in the design of the new scheme to ensure there is not further market concentration in the energy sector, which is already highly concentrated because generators and retailers are combined in vertically integrated businesses. The paper also confirms that penalties will apply if market participants don’t comply with their emissions reduction and reliability targets, although it emphasises that the first resort should be a culture of compliance, rather than a civil penalty. It suggests retailers who don’t meet their mandated requirement to supply sufficient reliable power to the market could have to meet the costs of the Australian Energy Market Operator supplying that power to the market through a reserve scheme."

"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has warned the development of the Galilee basin is not in Australia’s national interest, because it would displace mining and jobs in existing coal regions, and would not help the world meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement. Butler has used a speech to the Sydney Institute to argue the controversial Adani coal project is “utterly exceptional” because it is the only significant export-oriented greenfields mine opening up “on the face of the planet”.  He said developing the Carmichael mine would fly in the face of current market trends, where export volumes for thermal coal had been flat for several years, and would also be inconsistent with the International Energy Agency’s advice “on what the world needs to do … to keep global warming well below two degrees”. Butler said it was possible the Adani project “might notionally go ahead if the Turnbull government finds some way of throwing a heap of taxpayer money at it” but he argues the industry is clear Adani would have a zero sum effect, displacing “coal and jobs in existing coal regions, like the Hunter Valley”. “For the life of me, I can’t see how that prospect is in the national interest.” Butler’s Sydney Institute speech on Monday night addressed broad-ranging questions associated with managing climate change-related financial risk – including the impact of climate change on balance sheets, on the insurance industry and the potential for future litigation to “recover damages for losses incurred as a result of climate change from people who should have prevented those losses from occurring”. But his public intervention comes at a time when federal Labor is mulling specific policy options on the Adani project. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been signalling since late January that the ALP is inclined to toughen its stance on the Adani project. While parliamentarians in Canberra have been telegraphing a shift, last week the powerful mining union said that adopting a hardline stance on Adani would damage Labor’s political fortunes in Queensland and also trigger a divisive debate within the ALP about the future of coal. Shorten will spend the week in marginal Queensland coastal electorates, highlighting local infrastructure commitments and what he characterised on Monday as “real blue-collar jobs” and the next “pipeline of work”. Before Butler’s speech on Monday evening, Shorten told reporters in Townsville there was a role for mining in Australia, and “there is a role for coal in Australia, and he echoed CFMEU national president Tony Maher’s description of Adani last week as just “another project”. Labor’s positioning on Adani is under way as a critical byelection looms in Melbourne’s northern suburbs. The 17 March contest in Batman is a head-to-head between Labor and the Greens. The Greens have been running an anti-Adani campaign against Labor within the Batman boundaries for months, amplified by activist groups. Butler has been pushing for federal Labor to adopt a tougher line on the Adani project for the best part of 12 months. In an interview last June with Guardian Australia’s politics live podcast, he declared it would “not be a positive thing for Australia for the Adani mine to go ahead”. He dug in behind those arguments on Monday night. “In all of the many discussions I’ve had over recent years with different interests about the Galilee basin projects, a consensus view has been put that they are simply not financially viable – that the cost of developing the new mines cannot be recouped from a declining market with a thermal coal price projected to be in the doldrums for years.” Butler acknowledged that jobs was a major political issue in Queensland. “There’s clearly a great deal of frustration in Queensland about the constant delays and debate about the Adani project, and whether the promised jobs will ever really happen,” he said. “In a region that’s been hit hard by the end of the mining boom, job opportunities are crucially important.” Butler said Shorten was not willing “to wait on Adani’s continual delays with this project – delays that will likely come to nought anyway”. “He’s busy talking to the Queensland government and local communities about other job plans,” Butler said. “And he’s putting concrete announcements before the people of central and north Queensland as we speak – jobs that we guarantee will happen.” On the more broadranging topic of managing climate change risk, Butler used the speech to warn that “one-eyed reliance on scenarios that pretend that the world is not changing is simply unsustainable and, potentially, legally negligent”. “Investors are already voicing their expectations that companies do better in this area. But government and regulators clearly have a role to play in improving standards as well.”"
"Business leaders seem astonished that community trust in their activities is at an all-time low, trending toward the bottom of the barrel inhabited by politicians. To the corporate leader dedicated to the capitalist, market economy success story of the last 50 years, that attitude is no doubt incomprehensible and downright ungrateful.  But it is hardly surprising given continuing scandals and declining ethics across the corporate and banking worlds, driven by the pernicious impact of short-termism, rising inequality and undue political influence; in large part the outcome of the oxymoron of “pay-for-performance” remuneration. So how is trust regained? The need for stronger leadership, ethics, greater transparency, open communications and improved culture feature prominently in current responses.  But a far more fundamental requirement is ignored, namely that business must lead on really critical issues, particularly the point raised long ago by economist Kenneth Boulding: “Anyone who considers economic growth can continue indefinitely in a finite system is either a madman or an economist”. The constraints Boulding anticipated have now arrived, as burgeoning population and economic growth crash into global biophysical limits which cannot be circumvented. Those constraints, encompassing resource shortages, biodiversity loss and pollution in various guises, do not feature in the capitalist economic lexicon, as technology and the market are supposed to overcome all as we march toward the sunlit uplands of the neoliberal nirvana. In the real world, the entire growth model under which Australia and global economies operate, is no longer sustainable; it sowed the seeds of its own destruction some time ago and is rapidly driving itself into the ground as growth rates decline. This is the great “black elephant” of business and politics; a known, knowable fact that no one wants to acknowledge – the unmentionable in the recent Business and Governance Summits around the country, as our leaders strive to compound the problem with self-defeating subterfuges to maximise growth, not least corporate tax cuts and trade agreements. To the community, these constraints are increasingly obvious as the quality of life for the average person deteriorates in myriad ways. The rhetoric of much-vaunted corporate social responsibility no longer holds water when our supposed leaders are not prepared to address the issues that really count for our survival, let alone prosperity.  These range from basic considerations such as ensuring food and water availability, to the creation of genuinely sustainable global societies. However, the first priority must be human-induced climate change, manifest as the lack of an atmosphere into which we can continue dumping carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation, without causing catastrophic consequences.  Climate change is accelerating far faster than expected, to the point where it now represents an existential threat to humanity, that is a threat posing permanent large negative consequences which will be irreversible, an outcome being locked in today by our insistence on expanding the use of fossil fuels. This should be a major concern in Australia given that we are more exposed than most, but instead our leaders would have us embark on massive fossil fuel expansion. Already one of the world’s largest carbon polluters when exports are included, Australia is complicit in destroying the conditions which make human life possible. There is no greater crime against humanity. The economic and social impacts will be devastating unless that policy is rapidly reversed. The unprecedented hurricane season in the Atlantic, bushfires in the Californian winter, extreme heat in many parts of South Asia and rapid heating of the Arctic with associated instability in the northern hemisphere weather system, are only the most recent portents of what is to come. The worst outcomes can only be avoided now by emergency action, akin to restructuring economies on a war-footing. It finally seems to be dawning on corporate and investor leadership that climate change is a real and present danger which is not going away. Company directors are personally liable for failing to assess and act upon climate risk, but the greenwash continues. Major corporates parade their credentials in support of serious climate action, but none of their scenarios and policies are in line with the Paris objective of constraining global temperature increase “well below 2.0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.50C”. Fortunately, as understanding of the risks improves, regulatory pressure mounts. The recommendations triggered by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, via the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) are gradually being taken up, with companies voluntarily disclosing the impact which a 2C policy framework would have on their organisation, assuming such a framework was ever put in place (by governments?). Progress, but reactive and certainly not leadership. The question that must be answered is: “what are you doing proactively as a company to create a 2C world” – more realistically closer to 1.5C, as it is now patently clear that 2C is far too high? If business genuinely wishes to regain trust, it must proactively face up to the challenge posed by climate change and initiate emergency action. Beyond that, it must open up honest debate on a new economic model to replace conventional growth. It is the only way business will be sustainable in the 21st century with a real social licence to operate. In Churchill’s words: “Sometimes we have to do what is required”. • Ian Dunlop was formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chair of the Australian Coal Association and CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Director"
"A lot of people who cook food – and even more who write about it – have asked themselves at some point what the hell they’re doing. Particularly recently, as deeply entrenched institutional inequalities and biases are brought to light – not only in food but across numerous industries – a nagging question presents itself: am I doing something meaningful with my life? These panicky moments vary in severity. Some are passing irritations that strike as we stand at the sink peeling a bucket of carrots, or while staring blankly at white pixels on a screen trying to come up with yet another word for “delicious”. Other times, it feels existential. More than a few people have left successful restaurant careers to pursue something they find more consequential. But the narrative you hear more frequently is about the person who leaves their desk job to work with something more tangible – namely food.  This is more or less my experience. I worked for the better part of a decade editing books – oral histories documenting human rights crises, experimental fiction, literary nonfiction, that sort of thing. If you’d asked me at the time, I would have labelled such work as serious work, as opposed to my lifelong interest in food, which I would have described as frivolous. And I would have been correct on some level. While for most of human existence, food has been a survival necessity, it hasn’t been confined to that role for more than a millennium. In the economically advantaged parts of the world, the majority of us don’t eat most of our meals because we need to; we eat because we want to. But my experience of working in the food world has been different from what I expected. Seven years ago, I left my serious publishing job to make a food magazine called Lucky Peach. At one point during the magazine’s run, I doubled down on the food world and started a nonprofit organisation called ZeroFoodprint, which helps restaurants understand and reduce their climate impact. Whenever I ask myself what the hell I’m doing, I try to take the long view of these two endeavours. I won’t get too deep into the nitty-gritty of restaurants’ relationship to climate change, but the long and short of it is that growing, shipping, cooking and disposing of food is a major contributor to greenhouse gases. It’s not impossible to counteract the effect – in fact, it’s easier than people think – but it still takes time and thought and a little bit of money. But the payoff for doing so is largely intangible: you feel better about yourself and there’s some unsubstantiated logic that, if you do right by the world, people will notice and come to your restaurant. But even with such vague rewards, restaurants have been eager to do their part. Chefs and restaurateurs reach out to our organisation to ask how they can contribute. They open up to us about how much money they spend on ingredients and energy, where it comes from and how they use it. Then they listen to what they can do better. It’s a mind-boggling and uplifting thing to witness. We’ve helped multiple restaurants go completely carbon-neutral, and dozens more reduce their emissions. For instance, a few years ago, the restaurant Noma in Copenhagen learned through our study that they were getting their electricity from a coal-fired power plant. By sending an email to their power company and requesting their power source be switched to a sustainable one, they reduced their emissions by 30%. Their energy bill went up, but they didn’t flinch. There are limitations to what restaurants can change, of course. Of all the things we eat, commodity-raised beef is the single largest contributor to climate change, owing mostly to poor manure-disposal techniques. High-end restaurants can turn to more sustainable choices (grass-fed and “carbon-ranched” cattle are better alternatives) but as long as diners want $1 cheeseburgers, feedlot cows will continue to fart and poop our planet warmer. Plus, in the grand scheme of things, the restaurant industry makes up only a small part of the food system, which accounts for somewhere around a third of the world’s greenhouse gases. Even if we recruited a thousand restaurants to go carbon-neutral, it wouldn’t change the trajectory of the climate. But this is where the frivolous side of food is important. Food is not simply a commodity – it’s a cultural undertaking. In fact, it’s pop culture. People admire chefs and covet restaurants. If chefs as a group decide that sustainable food is better food, consumers will follow. Twenty-five years ago, organic produce meant very little to most people. Thanks largely to the work of chefs, organic is now a widely held value. And there’s the rub. Food’s not a worthwhile pursuit in spite of its frivolity, but rather because of it. Whenever my chosen profession has me questioning my purpose, I think about the countless meals I’ve had in the pursuit of good food and good stories – many of them with people who look differently, speak differently and believe and uphold opposing values to my own. It’s too optimistic to say food can bridge these divides, but I think it can be shared ground. We can choose to believe we have nothing in common with people on the other side of the aisle or the world, but the way we eat proves otherwise. I’ve sat in restaurants with people whom I’d never want to socialise with and had dinner with people whose opinions differ totally from mine except for a mutual affection for pizza and cold, cheap beer. That might not sound like much, but it’s enough to get us around the same table. • Chris Ying is appearing at the Melbourne Food and Wine festival; he is presenting at the Theatre of Ideas – Sustainability on 17 March ($20-$40) and at the Eat Your Words by Cordon Bleu food-writing course on 17-18 March ($478).

" The Arctic winter has ended with more news that is worrying even the scientists who watch the effects of climate change closely. The region experienced its warmest winter on record. Sea ice hit record lows for the time of year, new US weather data revealed on Tuesday.  “It’s just crazy, crazy stuff,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, who has been studying the Arctic since 1982. “These heat waves – I’ve never seen anything like this.” Experts say what’s happening is unprecedented, part of a global warming-driven cycle that probably played a role in the recent strong, icy storms in Europe and the north-eastern US. The land weather station closest to the North Pole, at the tip of Greenland, spent more than 60 hours above freezing in February. Before this year, scientists had seen the temperature there rise above freezing in February only twice before, and then extremely briefly. Last month’s record-high temperatures have been more like those typical of May, said Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute. Of nearly three dozen different Arctic weather stations, 15 of them were at least 10F (5.6C) above normal for the winter. “The extended warmth really has staggered all of us,” Mottram said.  In February, Arctic sea ice covered 5.4m sq miles, about 62,000 sq miles smaller than last year’s record low, the ice data center reported, and it was 521,000 square miles below the 30-year normal. Sea ice is frozen ocean water that, in contrast to icebergs and glaciers, forms, grows and melts on the ocean. It is still growing, but “whatever we grow now is going to be thin stuff” that easily melts in the summer, Serreze said. Something similar has been noted in the Pacific with open water on the normally iced-up Bering Sea, said the data center senior scientist Walt Meier. To be happening on opposite sides of the Arctic at the same time was unusual, he added. “Climate change is the overriding thing,” Meier said. "
"  For a South Korean presidential hopeful, Ahn Hee-Jung is not what you would expect.  He appears younger than his age of 52 years would suggest – an age that already makes him positively youthful by Korean political standards. He has a casual demeanour, and before sitting down with the Guardian in the lobby of a hotel in Sydney, Australia, he is stopped by Korean tourists desperate to get a selfie with him – something he appears to enjoy but his minder says regularly delays him for meetings. And for a governor of a province – South Chungcheong – that hosts the majority of South Korea’s coal power, with 29 massive coal power stations including the biggest in the world, he’s not who you would expect to be spearheading a “coal phase-out alliance” and declaring his province “post-coal”. But that’s exactly what he’s done. On his visit to Australia, which sells more than $6bn worth of coal to South Korea each year, he has a message for the country and its precious coal exports: the world is changing and coal will soon be history. “After the Paris agreement in 2015, I think everything should change,” he says. “Because after all, that is the global consensus, and that is the global commitment that involved countries have made.” During South Korea’s Democratic party primary contest in 2017, Ahn took full advantage of his relative youth, and the exploding appetite for change in Korea. Following the scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park, and the revelations she was allowing business conglomerates (known as “chaebols” – huge family-run conglomerates such as Samsung) to meddle in state affairs, his approach struck a nerve. “Let’s change the world together with a young president, Ahn Hee-Jung!” the Korean press reported him saying at the launch of his presidential primary campaign. “We need a young leader who can create a new world with his mind, body and actions, not just someone who talks about new things. This the beginning of a shift into a new era.” Ahn lost by a significant margin to Moon Jae-in, who went on to win the presidency, but through the contest Ahn became famed for his Obamaesque messages and his youthful demeanour. Ahn’s distaste for coal appears shared by his party, and by President Moon. Since winning the presidency, the Moon administration has committed to building no new coal power stations, has been looking at how to halt the construction of partially built ones, and is expanding the country’s production of wind and solar. Beyond the moves that South Korea is taking at a national level under the leadership of Moon, Ahn has personally spearheaded a regional network of sub-national governments that is aiming to make coal a thing of the past.  At a forum of local governments his province hosted last year, Ahn launched what he describes as a “vision” for phasing out coal throughout East Asia. He said he was committed to creating the “East Asia Coal Phase Out Alliance,” which would be a network of sub-national governments committed to phasing out coal. Describing the group, Ahn refers to other moves around the world to achieve similar goals. He points to the “Powering Past Coal Alliance,” which aims to phase out reliance on coal power by 2030, and includes both national governments and subnational governments including Washington and Oregon in the US. Ahn also refers to the Under2 Coalition, which includes a large range of subnational governments who have signed an agreement aiming to radically lower emissions in line with keeping global warming below 2C by 2100. East Asian governments are under-represented in the Under2 Coalition, and a locally organised alliance could shift the balance. Before interviewing Ahn, the Guardian was told by an officer at the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that there was some concern there that the topic of the interview was coal. Unease in Australian government circles about Ahn’s attitude to coal is not surprising. Australia depends heavily on its thermal coal exports. It is the world’s second-biggest exporter of coal used for generating electricity (following Indonesia) and its exports primarily go to China, Japan and South Korea – with South Korea taking more than $6bn worth of coal each year. But recent Australian government forecasts of increasing coal demand from South Korea have been brought into question following Korea’s anti-coal moves, and the more radical those moves, the faster Australian coal exports will decline. Coal was no doubt among the issues Australian diplomats wanted to speak with Ahn about when they invited him. His visit was part of the “special visits program”, which the government says is targeted at “influential foreign officials … who are likely to be in positions which deal with issues of direct relevance to Australia’s foreign and trade policy interests.” Meeting South Korea's Governor An Hee-jung to discuss working together to meet regional challenges & #WinterOlympics2018 ~🏂❄️🇰🇷🇦🇺 pic.twitter.com/nnGrchOsSo Regardless, Ahn’s message remains clear while speaking with the Guardian. Asked whether Australia should prepare for a declining market for coal, Ahn encourages Australia to take action to implement the Paris agreement. “Australia is also signed onto the Paris agreement, so under this agreement, I’m sure the Australian government and citizens of Australia are well aware of the commitment they made, and ... will be doing their part in order to implement [this] agreement into action,” Ahn says. “I’m also a firm believer that this kind of energy transition will bring both crisis as well as opportunities. Crisis of course for the existing coal industries, but opportunities for everyone involved in the new renewable industry, as well as citizens around the globe as well.” Ahn calls on Australia and South Korea to stand together and take leadership in the transition away from coal. “I think it’s clear that by leading this kind of energy transition, those countries will be able to increase more jobs and create more added value,” he says. “So as part of the Paris agreement, I think Australia and the Republic of Korea should stand next to each other and move forward together.”"
"The South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, did not oppose some of the country’s largest fossil fuel expansions during an environment-focused election debate, prompting conservation groups to question his government’s leadership on climate change. On Tuesday the leaders of the four most popular parties answered questions curated by OurFutureSA, a coalition of 33 climate and nature groups who say they collectively represent 130,000 members in South Australia.  “The single biggest environmental challenge in our state, the nation, the world is action on climate change,” Weatherill said. “And I’m proud to say that this state government is a leader not just in the nation but in the world.” The state Labor leader listed his government’s achievements in renewable energy, which have attracted worldwide attention and proved popular with voters. Weatherill said that those moves – which include shifting the state’s electricity supply from “basically 99% fossil fuels” to 48.9% – would be the dominant issues at voting booths. “Make no mistake, this next election will be treated, whether we like it or not, as a referendum on renewable energy,” he said. “If we go down, they will be wagging their fingers at everybody around the nation, to say that’s what happens if you push too hard into renewable energy. That’s what the prime minister is trying to do and that’s what is going to happen.” The audience applauded that statement but was less pleased when attention turned to large-scale fossil fuel expansions in the state. Several companies including Statoil are lining up to explore for oil in the virtually pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight. The potential oil reserves there have been compared to the Gulf of Mexico, one of the world’s most productive off-shore oil regions. Weatherill said he supported existing processes, where any application to drill for oil would be assessed by the federal regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Agency. The Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, took a similar line, while the SA Best leader, Nick Xenophon, and the Greens leader, Mark Parnell, repeated their opposition to the proposed drilling. The parties lined up differently when it came to another proposed fossil fuel expansion – fracking in the state’s south-east. The Liberal party has proposed a 10-year moratorium, supported by both the Greens and SA Best. The Labor party continues to support expansion of fracking there, despite strong community opposition based on fears about contamination of the water resources in the prime agricultural region. “A government championing its climate change credentials while also pushing for massive expansions to the fossil fuel industry is pretty disingenuous,” said Peter Owen, the South Australia director of the Wilderness Society and spokesman for OurFutureSA. “South Australia is currently supporting massive expansions to the climate damaging fossil fuel industry in the state’s south-east, north and offshore in the Great Australian Bight. “This could lead to hundreds of times more carbon pollution than SA’s current emissions, completely undermining the government’s leadership position on renewables. We must stop the expansion of the fossil fuel industry to have any chance of providing our children with a liveable climate.” • This article was amended on 21 February. It previously incorrectly stated that Chevron was involved in oil exploration in the Great Australian Bight. Chevron abandoned plans to drill there in 2017."
"What is fracking?Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking as it is better known, is a method of extracting oil and gas trapped in shale and other rock formations. The modern version involves pumping large amounts of water down a well at high pressure, along with sand and chemicals that make up a tiny fraction of the volume. Together, this “stimulation fluid” fractures the rock and releases the gas or oil, which flows to the surface. The hole drilled for a well is about the size of a manhole cover. As the UK industry body explains, the sand is there to keep fractures in the rock open. The chemicals are included for several purposes, such as lubrication and keeping bacteria out. The other big technological development that has made fracking economical is horizontal drilling. This means that several horizontal boreholes can be drilled off one well, like tributaries off a river, maximising the amount of oil and gas that can be recovered. This spring, either Third Energy in North Yorkshire or Cuadrilla in Lancashire will become the first company to frack in the UK since 2011. Fracking can also be undertaken on a well that has already been drilled and for which conventional techniques were unable to extract more hydrocarbons. What chemicals are used?Under UK regulations, operators have to submit a list of the chemicals they will use to the Environment Agency, or they will be refused consent. In the UK, one of the most commonly used chemicals is diluted hydrochloric acid. A government expert told the Guardian that in the case of a leak, the risk from the chemicals used is “very low”. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency found a median of 14 chemicals for each sample it took. The most common were methanol (an alcohol), hydrochloric acid, and hydrotreated light petroleum distillates (a combination of hydrocarbons).  Shale formations will be fractured at depths of more than 1km below the surface in the UK, after new regulations were introduced in 2015. The Kirby Misperton one, for example, is about 3,000m deep. Who pioneered fracking?Fracking transformed the US energy landscape, putting the country on course to becoming a net exporter of oil after output declined over the last three decades of the 20th century. That trajectory means it is now starting to create similar shockwaves globally. The modern version of fracking came of age in the late 1990s, unlocking oil and gas reserves across more than 20 US states. As a result, US oil production has increased faster than at anytime in the country’s history, dwarfing the giddy days of the country’s black gold rush in the 19th century. About half of US crude now comes from fracking.  The boom has also been a boon for US householders, who have enjoyed falling gas prices to heat their homes and stable wholesale electricity prices. Around two-thirds of the country’s gas is produced by fracking. The US now has so much oil and gas that it has dropped a decades long embargo on exports and is looking to step up shipments. Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the US is on course to become the world’s undisputed oil and gas growth story – and it’s because of fracking. “What is happening in the US between now and 2025 [is] a huge expansion of oil production, about 80% of the global oil production growth comes from the US. It exceeds the huge expansion of Saudi Arabia which we witnessed in the 1960s and 70s,” he told the Guardian. Where else is fracking taking place?For several years, Europe was talked up as a new frontier for shale exploration. Poland was seen as one of the most promising prospects, attracting US companies such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon, as Warsaw hoped to ease its reliance on Russian gas. But the geology did not prove as promising as hoped and, one by one, companies pulled out. A similar pattern occurred in Romania. Other European countries have gone further and banned fracking: France, Germany and Ireland have all imposed moratoriums.  Despite bans in every part of the UK apart from England, the country now stands as one of the last parts of Europe where fracking firms are still actively drilling and hoping to frack. While no well has been fracked since 2011 due to a moratorium, regulatory changes and planning delays, at least three sites look likely to be fracked in 2018.  But even that new wave of activity looks fragile, with the sector at risk from any change in government. The SNP banned fracking in Scotland, while the 2017 election manifestos of Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Greens all promised fracking bans.  The governing Conservative party still officially backs fracking, but has lately been much quieter in its support, with some MPs even questioning if there is still a need for it, and Conservative-controlled local authorities rejecting shale drilling applications.  The right geology is key to success. The British Geological Survey found the best shale oil prospects are in southern England, in the Weald Basin between the North and South Downs. For gas, the group said the best resource appears to be in the Bowland shale, which stretches beneath much of Lancashire and Yorkshire. On the other side of the world, the industry has largely stalled in Australia.  Concerns over scarce water supplies have seen five of the country’s eight states and territories essentially temporarily banning fracking. The federal government wants to see the bans dropped, but polls have found 49% of Australians support the fracking ban in their state, compared to 24% against it. Elsewhere in the southern hemisphere, South Africa and Argentina have both been eyed by fracking companies. But, as in many other parts of the world, neither country is yet to see a serious exploration and appraisal phase. Why is fracking so controversial?The UK government has repeatedly said that fracking can be done safely and without harming the environment or human health, so long as it is properly regulated. New rules mean that companies have to closely monitor and report seismic activity, as well as potential water and air pollution. But that’s not been the case throughout fracking’s history, particularly during some of the ‘wild west’ years when it grew rapidly in the US.  Water contamination has been one of the biggest environmental concerns and where some of the most egregious incidents have occurred. A years-long piece of research by the US Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 2016 that in some cases fracking had harmed drinking water supplies.  Most of the cases of water pollution in the US have involved boreholes that were not built properly, or mishandling of wastewater. Images of burning taps in the 2010 documentary Gasland arguably turbocharged the anti-fracking movement in the US, even though cases of gas contaminating water supplies have been hard to prove.  What are the other concerns?Earthquakes caused by hydraulic fracturing have been another big concern. While the two earthquakes in 2011 that led to the UK’s fracking moratorium were both ranked minor on the Richter scale, the US has experienced much stronger ones. In Oklahoma, experts have reported a millennium’s worth of quakes in two years because of fracking there. Other local concerns listed by fracking critics include industrialisation of rural areas, noise from lorries and the air pollution impact from flaring, when excess gas is burned off. The big picture issue, of course, is climate change. Fracking advocates have argued the technology is good for global warming because, at least in the US, gas has been displacing coal in the power mix.  But that coal is usually still burned elsewhere in the world, meaning fracking is simply adding to fossil fuel supplies – and the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  The UK government was warned last year by its climate advisers that, without stricter rules, fracking on a large scale would bust the country’s legally-binding carbon targets. It is this combination of local and global concerns that has galvanised a vocal, well-organised anti-fracking movement, including public figures such as author Naomi Klein and actor Mark Ruffalo. What does the future hold?After years of delays, whether fracking in the UK ever takes off remains to be seen, but industry claims America’s continued progress will help them. UK-based iGas, which plans to frack one well and drill several others in 2018, told the Guardian it is taking advantage of advances in technology made in the US. In the short term, fracking looks likely to stay as a largely American story, unless China decides to seriously invest in extracting its vast shale gas reserves, which are estimated to eclipse those in the US. “What is happening in the US is all driven by the shale revolution,” said Birol. That revolution will have profound ramifications around the world for years to come, from Europe’s reliance on Russian gas to US foreign policy and headaches for the oil cartel, Opec."
"Australia’s energy market operator says an additional 850 megawatts of dispatchable generation capacity will be needed in New South Wales after the closure of the ageing Liddell power plant if AGL Energy fails to complete all three stages of its transition plan. Last December AGL confirmed it would close Liddell in 2022 and replace the coal plant with a mix of renewables, gas power for peak periods and battery storage.  The company’s decision to retire the coal plant defied extraordinary public pressure from the Turnbull government. The Coalition wanted AGL to prolong the operating life of Liddell a further five years. AGL rebuffed Canberra’s request and is proceeding with its own plan. The company says the extra capacity to replace Liddell will come from: a gas peaker power plant at Newcastle or another New South Wales site (250MW); an upgrade of the Bayswater coal plant (100MW); a Liddell battery (250MW); demand response (up to 150MW); a second gas peaker (500MW); and renewables (1,600MW). The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, sought advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator after AGL made its decision public, and that advice will be released by the government on Friday. Aemo concludes that extra generation capacity will be required in NSW unless AGL rolls out all three stages of its transition plan, or a competitor steps into the breach. It says without full commitment from AGL or new capacity from elsewhere “there remains a high risk of load shedding following the closure of Liddell”. It says if an additional 850MW of dispatchable power resources is added to the electricity market by 2026-27, that will reduce the risk of load shedding to a one-in-10-year likelihood after the closure of the coal plant. While there is a significant level of contracted capacity for renewable generation coming on stream over the next few years, Aemo says more dispatchable power is required because there is insufficient interconnector capability to ensure the reliable delivery of new electricity supply into NSW from other regions during periods of peak demand. There is also a risk that generators underperform in high-demand conditions. The impact of climate change is another factor. Aemo has told the government that the number of days each year involving “extreme peak temperatures” are increasing, requiring the market operator to work with the Bureau of Meteorology on its modelling and forecasting methods. It says its experience in running the national electricity market over the past two summers indicates that a combination of higher-than-average temperatures, unplanned generation outages and loss of generation owing to weather conditions have pushed the grid into “lack of reserve” conditions. Another factor is the increasing penetration of solar panels. Aemo says embedded solar PV generation across the national electricity market is leading to a later and shorter peak in operation demand. The change in the generation mix is impacting the market operator’s forecasting models, as well as leaving the grid more exposed to prevailing weather conditions. Aemo says if governments can agree on the government’s proposed national energy guarantee, that will provide the underlying policy framework to drive the necessary investments in disptachable generation in NSW. It says if governments don’t sign off on the national energy guarantee and have the mechanism in place by next December, an alternative process to contract the 850MW of capacity will need to be pursued. It recommends a mechanism that can be used specifically in NSW, that is consistent with a pending national energy guarantee, be agreed by the end of 2018. The national energy guarantee, if it is adopted by governments, would impose new reliability and emissions reduction guarantees on energy retailers and large energy users from 2020. The Energy Security Board is leading consultations with a range of stakeholders about the design of the policy, which will be considered by federal and state energy ministers on 20 April. While environment groups and several market analysts have significant concerns about the Turnbull policy, the government’s chances of securing support for the national energy guarantee have improved courtesy of Jay Weatherill’s departure as the South Australian premier after Saturday’s state election. Frydenberg says the Aemo advice reinforces the need for “governments at federal, state and territory level to get behind the national energy guarantee as our pathway to a more reliable and affordable energy system”. He is calling on AGL “to commit as soon as possible to the next stages of their plan”, saying “the existence of a major shortfall in dispatchable power following Liddell’s closure would clearly present an unacceptable situation undermining the stability of the system”. AGL welcomed the Aemo advice, saying it confirmed the NSW generation plan “addresses the potential shortfall” that may follow the closure of Liddell. “We also welcome the market operator’s view that a competitive market approach to deliver the required resources is best for consumers,” AGL said in a statement. It noted an independent assessment of AGL’s plan found the replacement generation would cost $83/MWh, compared with extending Liddell at $106/MWh.  On Friday Frydenberg told Radio National those figures only reflected “the costs to them as a company in terms of maintaining Liddell staying open”.  “What they’re not talking about is the cost to the market of having greater volatility in it,” he said."
"An alarming heatwave in the sunless winter Arctic is causing blizzards in Europe and forcing scientists to reconsider even their most pessimistic forecasts of climate change. Although it could yet prove to be a freak event, the primary concern is that global warming is eroding the polar vortex, the powerful winds that once insulated the frozen north. The north pole gets no sunlight until March, but an influx of warm air has pushed temperatures in Siberia up by as much as 35C above historical averages this month. Greenland has already experienced 61 hours above freezing in 2018 - more than three times as many hours as in any previous year. Seasoned observers have described what is happening as “crazy,” “weird,” and “simply shocking”. “This is an anomaly among anomalies. It is far enough outside the historical range that it is worrying – it is a suggestion that there are further surprises in store as we continue to poke the angry beast that is our climate,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “The Arctic has always been regarded as a bellwether because of the vicious circle that amplify human-caused warming in that particular region. And it is sending out a clear warning.”  Although most of the media headlines in recent days have focused on Europe’s unusually cold weather in a jolly tone, the concern is that this is not so much a reassuring return to winters as normal, but rather a displacement of what ought to be happening farther north. At the world’s most northerly land weather station - Cape Morris Jesup at the northern tip of Greenland – recent temperatures have been, at times, warmer than London and Zurich, which are thousands of miles to the south. Although the recent peak of 6.1C on Sunday was not quite a record, but on the previous two occasions (2011 and 2017) the highs lasted just a few hours before returning closer to the historical average. Last week there were 10 days above freezing for at least part of the day at this weather station, just 440 miles from the north pole.  “Spikes in temperature are part of the normal weather patterns – what has been unusual about this event is that it has persisted for so long and that it has been so warm,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Going back to the late 1950s at least we have never seen such high temperatures in the high Arctic.” The cause and significance of this sharp uptick are now under scrutiny. Temperatures often fluctuate in the Arctic due to the strength or weakness of the polar vortex, the circle of winds – including the jetstream – that help to deflect warmer air masses and keep the region cool. As this natural force field fluctuates, there have been many previous temperature spikes, which make historical charts of Arctic winter weather resemble an electrocardiogram. But the heat peaks are becoming more frequent and lasting longer – never more so than this year. “In 50 years of Arctic reconstructions, the current warming event is both the most intense and one of the longest-lived warming events ever observed during winter,” said Robert Rohde, lead scientist of Berkeley Earth, a non-profit organisation dedicated to climate science. The question now is whether this signals a weakening or collapse of the polar vortex, the circle of strong winds that keep the Arctic cold by deflecting other air masses. The vortex depends on the temperature difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes, but that gap is shrinking because the pole is warming faster than anywhere on Earth. While average temperatures have increased by about 1C, the warming at the pole – closer to 3C – is melting the ice mass. According to Nasa, Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.2% per decade, leaving more open water and higher temperatures. Some scientists speak of a hypothesis known as “warm Arctic, cold continents” as the polar vortex becomes less stable - sucking in more warm air and expelling more cold fronts, such as those currently being experienced in the UK and northern Europe. Rohde notes that this theory remains controversial and is not evident in all climate models, but this year’s temperature patterns have been consistent with that forecast. Longer term, Rohde expects more variation. “As we rapidly warm the Arctic, we can expect that future years will bring us even more examples of unprecedented weather.”  Jesper Theilgaard, a meteorologist with 40 years’ experience and founder of website Climate Dissemination, said the recent trends are outside previous warming events. “No doubt these warming events bring trouble to the people and the nature. Shifting rain and snow – melt and frost make the surface icy and therefore difficult for animals to find anything to eat. Living conditions in such shifting weather types are very difficult.” Others caution that it is premature to see this as a major shift away from forecasts. “The current excursions of 20C or more above average experienced in the Arctic are almost certainly mostly due to natural variability,” said Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth. “While they have been boosted by the underlying warming trend, we don’t have any strong evidence that the factors driving short-term Arctic variability will increase in a warming world. If anything, climate models suggest the opposite is true, that high-latitude winters will be slightly less variable as the world warms.”  Although it is too soon to know whether overall projections for Arctic warming should be changed, the recent temperatures add to uncertainty and raises the possibility of knock-on effects accelerating climate change.  “This is too short-term an excursion to say whether or not it changes the overall projections for Arctic warming,” says Mann. “But it suggests that we may be underestimating the tendency for short-term extreme warming events in the Arctic. And those initial warming events can trigger even greater warming because of the ‘feedback loops’ associated with the melting of ice and the potential release of methane (a very strong greenhouse gas).”"
"NSW Labor has demanded that climate change be on the table as part of a full scientific assessment of the state’s regional forest agreements (RFAs), which are set to expire over the next two years. Penny Sharpe, opposition environment spokeswoman, said NSW Labor would not sign off on proposed extensions because the government “knows the science underpinning the RFAs is out of date and incomplete”. She said: “Importantly, the RFA assessment must include climate change as a consideration. Given the key role of forests for carbon storage, no RFA should be renewed without investigating their impact on climate change. “The unnecessary rush to push ahead with early renewal of these agreements lays bare the government’s intentions: a quick and dirty escape from a complex policy issue before the 2019 state election.” Sharpe’s comments came after Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday the “now quite old” science that underpins the existing RFAs and whether they “remain valid for proposed extensions”. The move by NSW Labor puts pressure on federal Labor to toughen its position on the RFA renewals across Australia. A delegation of environment groups led by the National Parks Association of NSW will be in Canberra next Tuesday lobbying government and Labor MPs over the science underpinning the extended RFAs. Oisin Sweeney, senior ecologist for the NPA, said it was significant that NSW Labor was insisting climate change be considered as part of new assessments of Australia’s native forests. “Climate science wasn’t part of the comprehensive regional assessments for the old RFAs done 20 years ago, but clearly it should be now.” Also yesterday, the Bob Brown Foundation flagged the possibility of challenging the Tasmanian RFA, which was extended last year on a permanent rolling five-yearly basis. Jenny Weber, campaign manager for the foundation said, “[We’re] not surprised by the revelations today in The Guardian that the regional forest agreements are at risk of being legally invalid. “The Tasmanian regional forest agreement was rolled over last year and the death warrant was signed on thousands of hectares of wild forests in Tasmania. This RFA, and any that will be rolled over in other states of Australia, is based on 20-year-old environmental and scientific assessments. That makes them a farce. “We know this old science is driving species to the brink of extinction, for example the critically endangered swift parrot. Despite pleas by scientists working to prevent the swift parrot’s rapid spiral towards extinction – they have called for logging not to occur in the parrot’s habitat – logging of their habitat continues in Tasmania’s southern forests.” Logging also continues in the Tarkine rainforests. A Sharpe criticised the Berejiklian government’s consultation on the long-overdue reviews of the RFAs and called for a proper assessment without a predetermined outcome. “No one has been fooled by this all-in-one review and sham consultation exercise being undertaken in NSW – a review for which the outcome has already been decided is not really a review, so it is no wonder that numerous key stakeholders abandoned the consultation process. She said concerns about the consultation had also been raised by scientists and environment groups which have withdrawn from the consultations because the government announced that it is was committed to renewing the RFAs regardless.  “Labor has been unequivocal: Labor will not sign off on a rollover of the RFAs until there is a proper, independent, scientific assessment of their outcomes, and the assumptions of the original RFAs are revisited.  "
"The mining union says there is no need for Labor to toughen its stance on the controversial Adani coalmine, warning there is no point in winning the Melbourne seat of Batman while losing seats in central Queensland. The CFMEU’s national president, Tony Maher, told Guardian Australia if federal Labor took the hardline stance against the Adani coal project it was currently telegraphing, promising to stop the mine if it won the next election, then “what do you do with the next [coalmine], and the next one, and the one after that?”  “I see no reason for Labor to toughen its position,” Maher said in an interview. “Why win Batman and lose in central Queensland? “The environment groups have worked themselves up into a passion about it. I don’t know why. Adani is just another project and it should be judged on its merits.” The union leader expressed scepticism about whether the Adani project would ultimately proceed but he said if it did, the union would seek to make an agreement with the company. Maher said he believed it was possible for the mine to be opened up and the world to meet the pollution reduction targets set at the Paris climate conference. The negative comments from a significant internal stakeholder come as Labor in Canberra is continuing to deliberate on its Adani stance, mulling potential legal options it could take to stop the project. While the ALP federally has been weighing up Adani for some months, Labor leader Bill Shorten’s recent signal that Labor was considering adopting a more hardline position coincided with a decision by David Feeney to resign from parliament because he could not demonstrate that he wasn’t a dual citizen – triggering a byelection in his Melbourne electorate of Batman. Adani is a hot-button issue in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, where the Greens have been running a ground campaign against Labor’s initial support for Adani for months. Labor strategists are pessimistic about holding Batman in a head-to-head contest with the Greens. While adopting a stance of public opposition to the Adani project could neutralise progressive activist campaigns on the ground in the crucial byelection, Maher’s argument is that position will trigger a broader debate in the Labor party and the labour movement about the future of coal. With a national conference due in the middle of the year, the CFMEU will resist Labor inching towards a no new coal stance, viewing that position as alienating to the party’s traditional blue collar base. One of the options Labor is mulling as a policy response is the insertion of a “climate trigger” in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which could be used to prevent any new coal mines on climate grounds. Labor is also understood to be working up a regional package designed to reassure voters in Queensland concerned about a loss of economic activity and jobs if Adani doesn’t proceed, which will focus on opportunities beyond coal.  There are a range of internal views about how hard to go against the project. Adani was discussed by the shadow cabinet last Monday and it was thought Labor could make a decision last week, but no final position has yet emerged."

"Michael Dukes’ Weatherwatch report at the back of Tuesday’s Guardian (20 March) is far too important to be relegated to such a minor position. He is giving us what should be considered front-page news and his few column inches must be expanded into a longer article that fully explains the science and mechanism behind the two unprecedented weather events of the past three weeks, when London was colder than the north pole. Climate change, bringing Arctic meltdown, has serious global effects which mean very much more than the extinction of polar bears. Climatologists have long been warning of new atmospheric conditions which make freak events the new normal. The latest by Jennifer Francis comes in the April edition of Scientific American, which predicts massive coastal flooding within the next 20 years. In the short term, however, we should be concerned about the return of more “beast” events next month or even in May, when plant growth will be in full swing. Imagine the effect on food production.Dr Tim MegarryLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Fifty years ago, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) delivered a report titled Sources, Abundance, and Fate of Gaseous Atmospheric Polluters to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade association for the fossil fuel industry. The report, unearthed by researchers at the Center for International Environmental Law, is one of the earliest attempts by the industry to grapple with the impacts of rising CO2 levels, which Stanford’s researchers warned if left unabated “could bring about climatic changes” like temperature increases, melting of ice caps and sea level rise.  The year was 1968, and the term “global warming” would not appear in a peer-reviewed academic journal until 1975. Famed Nasa scientist James Hansen would not testify before Congress that “global warming has begun” for another 20 years. And the US would not enter into – only to later pull out of – the Paris climate accord for nearly half a century. The anniversary of SRI’s report to the API on climate change represents not just a damning piece of evidence of what the fossil fuel industry knew and when, but a signal of all that we have lost over the decades of policy inaction and interference. It should also serve as a potent motivator in the fight for climate accountability and justice. At the time, CO2 levels in the atmosphere stood about 323ppm. The planet was warming but was still well within the historical norm. Sea levels had risen by about 4in compared with 1880 levels. The report, however, cautioned that “man is now engaged in a vast geophysical experiment with his environment, the Earth” and that “significant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000”. Those predictions proved to be correct: by the turn of the century, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to 369ppm, causing a temperature increase of nearly half a degree over pre-industrial averages. Today, virtually all climate scientists agree there is little or no chance the world can stay within the goal of 1.5C, the limit of what scientists believe to be safe. With each decade of delay and denial the impacts and costs of climate change have continued to mount Over the next 20 years, the scientific community and policymakers around the world began to reach a consensus on the threat posed by rising CO2 levels. Scientists at least one major oil company, Exxon, did their own climate modeling, which agreed with the scientific consensus. During this period a budding movement to cut emissions began. To counter and slow down that effort to address climate change, the fossil fuel industry began its long and powerful strategy of climate denial and obstructionism. Even though they knew the science, they also realized that attempts to control emissions could seriously damage their bottom lines. In 1998, as the first global attempt to rein in climate pollution, the Kyoto protocol, was headed to the Senate for ratification, API circulated what has come to be known as the Victory Memo, a detailed road map to undermining science and promoting denial of climate change. According to API’s top strategists: “Victory will be achieved when: those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality.” The memo’s end goal was clear: create doubt about science where none existed, deceive the media and Congress about the risks of climate change, and block the momentum that was building to address rising emissions through the Kyoto protocol, a precursor to the Paris accord. ExxonMobil alone would go on to spend upwards of $30m on ads, front groups, and pseudoscience intended to carry out the plan. That’s in addition to the cash that flooded the coffers of climate deniers in Congress who are rewarded amply for willful ignorance. API’s strategic deception campaign was a success, which is why we now stand at the brink of the highest global temperature considered safe. Just what it will mean to cross that line remains an ongoing question for atmospheric scientists, but we’ve already started to get a glimpse and it doesn’t look good. The damage is all around us, from hurricanes on steroids – scientists attribute 15-40% (8in-24in) of the epic rain of Hurricane Harvey to climate change – to California’s deadly wildfires which were set up by five years of drought, followed by record snowfall, then record heat that turned huge areas of the state into tinderboxes. In 2017 there were 16 separate billion-dollar disasters in the US, resulting in a total of $306bn of damages, nearly $100bn more than the second highest year 2005 (Katrina). While technically climate change did not “cause” these disasters, most of the carnage was aggravated in some way by climate change and the fossil fuel emissions that cause it in the first place. Other impacts are more long-term and irreparable. Anyone born after 1985 has never experienced a month with average temperatures that fall below the historical norm and, without action, probably never will. Mass coral bleaching events due to warming waters and ocean acidification have rendered large swaths of some of the ocean’s most diverse ecosystems lifeless. The vanishing Arctic ice cap appears already to be affecting global weather patterns, and the loss of ice in Antarctica may have reached a tipping point that many now view as irreversible, a development that will require tough and costly decisions for coastal cities. It never had to be this way. But with each decade of delay and denial the impacts and costs of climate change have continued to mount. Now taxpayers are left holding the bill for a literal rising tide of impacts that pose the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced. Meeting that challenge must begin with accountability on the part of climate polluters, and justice for citizens who did nothing to cause the problem other than drive to work and heat their homes when they had no other alternatives. We can’t turn back the clock, but we can turn off the fossil fuel firehose that’s been pumping CO2 into our atmosphere and demand that those who left it running help foot the bill for the cleanup. Already we’ve seen cities like New York, San Francisco, and other coastal cities file lawsuits against climate polluters, seeking to recover costs associated with planning for and adapting to a warming world. With massive costs facing hundreds more cities and no remedy in sight, more litigation will follow. Making up for 50 years of delay and denial will not be easy, nor will it be cheap. But taxpayers should not have to shoulder the burden alone. The API and its climate polluters knowingly and deliberately caused this mess. They must help pay to clean it up. "

"Warning: the drone footage of the discovery of a “supercolony” of Adélie penguins, released by researchers last week, is addictive. The finding, based on penguin guano originally noticed on satellite imagery, led to a penguin census in the region using drone-based cameras before teams were sent in to the region. It’s a story of hope. Adélie penguin populations have fallen by more than 65% in the past 25 years. Over the last seven years, thousands of chicks have died in a “catastrophic breeding failure” in the west of the Antarctic peninsula. So the discovery of an additional 1.5 million Adélie penguins living quietly on the Danger Islands, in the east Antarctic peninsula, is the conservation equivalent of finding a substantive amount of change down the back of a sofa on the day rent is due. Eviction and extinction have seemingly been postponed. But we shouldn’t count our chicks. Announcing the secret colony to the world will be an anxious time for the scientists. In popular imaginations, populations are either endangered or fine. The nuances get lost. Society at large has a binary approach to species conservation. Hopeful news throws us off the scent of the enormous amount of work and funding needed to stem what some scientists are calling the “biological annihilation” of wildlife in recent decades. One of the greatest conservation conundrums is that public support (essential) tends to flow towards species but generally we couldn’t give two hoots about protecting the actual spaces where the species live. Last week’s penguin discovery has been wrapped in important assertions. The site of the find of 700,000 breeding pairs on the Danger Islands in the Weddell Sea is an area where the impacts of climate change have not yet been felt and there is little human activity. Enthusiasm for this supercolony needs to translate into a legally enforceable marine protected area, so that the penguins, left undisturbed for 60 years, remain that way. • Lucy Siegle is a journalist who writes about ethical living"
"What is the recipe for a cloud? This is like asking for the recipe for curry. There are many different types of curry, and the result depends upon which spices are used and how they are combined. For a long time, clouds over the Southern Ocean have puzzled meteorologists; there are more of them and they hang around for longer than climate models predict. Benjamin Murray and his colleagues from the University of Leeds have shown this is because of the delicate ingredients that goes into Southern Ocean clouds.  Writing in the journal PNAS, they show that the ultra-clean air in this region means there is a paucity of particles to encourage the growth of ice. So, instead of progressing through the usual cloud cycle, where particles help ice crystals to grow and fall out, Southern Ocean clouds persist as a mist of miniscule droplets, struggling to gain weight and fall from the sky.  Currently, climate models don’t include the right type of particles in their recipe for clouds and, consequently, they fail to reproduce massive areas of Southern Ocean cloud – some as big as the entire UK. This means they miscalculate the amount of heat reflected, with knock-on consequences for predicting weather and climate. "

"Climate change will result in a massive movement of people inside countries and across borders, creating “hotspots” where tens of millions pour into already crowded slums, according to the World Bank. More than 140 million people in just three regions of the developing world are likely to migrate within their native countries between now and 2050, the first report on the subject has found.   The World Bank examined three regions, which between them account for 55% of the developing world’s population. In sub-Saharan Africa, 86 million are expected to be internally displaced over the period; in south Asia, about 40 million; and in Latin America, 17 million. Such flows of people could cause enormous disruption, threatening governance and economic and social development, but the World Bank cautioned that it was still possible to stave off the worst effects. “Climate change-driven migration will be a reality, but it does not need to be a crisis, provided we take action now and act boldly,” said John Roome, a senior director for climate change at the World Bank group. He laid out three key actions governments should take: first, to accelerate their reductions of greenhouse gases; second, for national governments to incorporate climate change migration into their national development planning; and third, to invest in further data and analysis for use in planning development. Within countries, the effects of climate change will create multiple “hotspots”: made up of the areas people move away from in large numbers, and the areas they move to. “Local planners need to make sure the resources are made available, and to make sure it takes place in a comprehensive and coordinated manner,” said Roome. Globally, many tens of millions more are expected to be similarly affected, creating huge problems for national and local governments. Nearly 3% of the population was judged likely to move owing to climate change in the areas studied – a proportion that might be repeated elsewhere. Migration between countries has previously taken the spotlight, with its potential for cross-border conflicts, but internal migration may cause as much disruption, putting pressure on infrastructure, jobs, food and water resources. The 140 million figure extrapolates from current trends, but could be reduced if changes are made. If economic development is made more inclusive, for instance through better education and infrastructure, internal migration across the three regions could drop to between 65 million and 105 million, according to the report. If strong action is taken on greenhouse gas emissions, as few as 30 million to 70 million may migrate. Climate change is likely to most affect the poorest and most vulnerable, making agriculture difficult or even impossible across large swaths of the globe, threatening water resources and increasing the likelihood of floods, droughts and heatwaves in some areas. Sea level rises and violent storm surges are also likely to hit low-lying coastal areas, such as in Bangladesh. Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive of the World Bank, in her introduction to the report published on Monday, said: “There is growing recognition among researchers that more people will move within national borders to escape the effects of slow-onset climate change, such as droughts, crop failure and rising seas.  “The number of climate migrants could be reduced by tens of millions as a result of global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and with far-sighted development planning. There is an opportunity now to plan and act for emerging climate change threats.” "
"Planes and trucks powered by hydrogen will be a crucial part of efforts to cut carbon emissions to safe levels, according to oil giant Shell. For the first time, the Anglo Dutch firm, which is facing calls by activist shareholders to take stronger action on global warming, has mapped out how the world could hit the Paris climate deal’s target of keeping temperature rises below 2C. While development of hydrogen cars has stalled in the face of rapid growth in battery-electric vehicles, Shell believes the gas could account for 10% of global energy consumption by the end of the century. The company’s Sky scenario, published on Monday, envisages that as fossil fuel use declines, old oil and gas facilities will be repurposed for hydrogen storage and transport. Shell has no large scale hydrogen production but is a major player in natural gas, from which hydrogen can be made. The company launched its first hydrogen refuelling point in the UK last year and on Tuesday will open a second at a service station in Buckinghamshire. The scenario envisages the first intercontinental hydrogen flight in 2040. By 2070, the majority of trucks will be powered by hydrogen or batteries, as Tesla is planning. Shell sees oil demand stagnating in the 2020s, followed by gas demand falling rapidly from 2040 as competition from renewables bites.  Many power grids will be forced by legislation to become entirely run off solar, wind and hydro power by 2040. But the biggest impact from governments will come from carbon taxes or prices put in place by 2030 across rich countries and China. Industry watchers noted that the Sky scenario would still see temperatures rise to around 1.7-1.8C, above the Paris accord’s goal of pursuing efforts to limit rises to 1.5C, in addition to “well below” 2C."
"In order to understand today’s global warming, we need to understand how Earth’s temperatures varied in the past. How does the rapid warming we see now compare with past natural climate changes? Also, how long have humans been having an impact on the climate? These are some questions that can be answered through paleoclimate studies. Paleoclimate research uses natural measurements of the Earth’s temperature. Clever scientists are able to estimate how warm or cold the Earth was far back in time, way before we had thermometers.  Readers of this column are probably familiar with some of these paleoclimate techniques that may use ice cores or tree rings to infer temperature variations. A different method that uses plant distribution was a technique used in a very recent study published in Nature. That technique used pollen distribution to get an understanding of where plant species thrived in the past. Those distributions gave them insights about the temperatures. On the surface, it’s pretty straightforward. Tropical plants differ in major ways from plants that live in, say, the tundra. In fact, plants that thrive where I live (Northern USA) differ from plants that populate landscapes further south.  The authors used the pollen of various plants to help determine where they thrived in the deep past. I communicated with Dr. Bryan Shuman, from the University of Wyoming and I asked him why they used pollen. He responded:  Pollen works well as a temperature recorder because plants have specific temperature ranges that they can tolerate. By combining the temperature requirements for dozens of different plants that we can recognize from their pollen, we are able to narrow down the possible temperatures at the location where the pollen was collected.  We use pollen rather than other plant fossils because pollen is widespread each spring and settles to the lake bottom where it is surprisingly resistant to degradation. We wash the samples of lake bottom mud with acids that can dissolve minerals, but the pollen can tolerate it. It lasts up to millions of years with degrading. What the authors found was very interesting. Using data from 642 sites across North America and Europe, the temperatures they found closely matched those expected from computer simulations. They found that throughout most of the Holocene period (the last ~11,000 years), the Earth was warming very slightly. Only in the last ~2000 years has the Earth been in a cooling period (which probably would have continued except that human emissions of greenhouse gases have now reversed the cooling).  The authors attempted to put the recent warming (last century or so) into context. They found that the recent temperatures are much higher than temperatures over the past 11,000 years. In fact, according to their calculations, 2016 was warmer than 99.41% of all simulated Holocene years.  This finding is profound. First of all, it means that human greenhouse gas emissions were easily able to overturn what should be a natural cooling trend. Second, the warming we have caused is far outside of the natural range. According to Dr. Shuman:  The major significance here is temperature across two continents over the last 11,000 years. The paper provides a geologically long-term perspective on recent temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere and the ability of climate models, such as the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) models used in the study, to predict the changes. Climate simulations do a strikingly good job of forecasting the changes. I would say it is significant that temperatures of the most recent decade exceed the warmest temperatures of our reconstruction by 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit, having few -- if any -- precedents over the last 11,000 years. Additionally, we learned that the climate fluctuates naturally over the last 11,000 years and would have led to cooling today in the absence of human activity. People who deny or try to minimize the importance of human-caused climate change will often argue that climate changed naturally in the past. And while that’s true, we know the climate change is now being dominated by what humans are doing. That’s one clear result of this new paper.  We have now pushed the Earth’s environment outside of where it should be. There are consequences for this disruption. Those consequences will include significant sea level rise, changes to rain/drought patterns, acidification of ocean waters, and a warmer atmosphere and ocean. There is still time to stop some of the coming climate change, but we are rapidly running out of time. The longer we delay, the worse things will get."
"Nearly 60 Australian industrial sites have been given the green light to increase greenhouse gas pollution, potentially cancelling out hundreds of millions of dollars of public spending on emissions cuts under the Coalition’s Direct Action climate policy. The increases have been quietly approved under the “safeguard mechanism”, which was introduced as part of Direct Action to ensure cuts paid for using the main part of the policy – the emission reduction fund – were not undone by emissions increasing in other parts of the economy.  Under the safeguard mechanism, government agency the Clean Energy Regulator sets an emissions limit for each large industrial site based on its highest level of emissions over the previous five years. But companies can apply to have the limit recalculated. The regulator has signed contracts worth $2.25bn under the emissions fund, mostly with businesses that plan to plant trees and repair degraded habitat over the next decade. The idea is the vegetation will store carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere. But an analysis of data on the regulator’s website by consultants RepuTex Carbon found the regulator had simultaneously allowed 57 industrial sites to increase emissions above their previous highest level. If all sites emitted to their newly approved level, it could add up to 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year – 4% of Australia’s annual emissions. Based on the average price paid by the government – $11.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide – it would effectively cancel out up to $261.8m of emissions cuts a year. This has prompted fresh accusations that Direct Action is doing little to curtail Australia’s emissions, which were already rising before a round of 44 industrial facilities had their emissions increases approved on 25 January. The RepuTex executive director, Hugh Grossman, said it showed the safeguard mechanism was ineffective. “It’s a safeguard in name only. There is no doubt emissions growth is outpacing the abatement from the emissions reduction fund, so what has been the point?” he said. RepuTex found that by 2030, emissions from large industrial sites were projected to be 30% higher than in 2005, and 16% higher than when the safeguard mechanism was announced four years ago. They are expected to grow to be the biggest source of Australia’s emissions, surpassing those from burning coal and gas for electricity.  The biggest increases allowed under the safeguard mechanism have been for coalmining operations, including Whitehaven’s Maules Creek open cut mine in New South Wales, BM Alliance’s Broadmeadow mine in Queensland and Citic Pacific’s Sino Iron project in the Pilbara. Liquefied natural gas plants such as the projects of Chevron at Gorgon and Santos at Curtis Island have opened with approved emissions limits that are not offset elsewhere.  Grossman said the industrial sector now posed a larger problem than electricity emissions, which had started to decline, though not quickly enough. “It’s black and white – if industrial emissions are not resolved, we won’t meet our Paris commitments,” he said. Under the 2015 Paris deal, Australia pledged to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The growth in industrial emissions suggests deeper cuts would be needed in other parts of the economy for that commitment to be met. But the government is not proposing deeper cuts in the electricity sector, currently the biggest emissions source. Under the national energy guarantee, it proposes to cut pollution from generators by 26% and is considering allowing electricity retailers to defer some cuts. It is also considering making the safeguard mechanism less stringent. A Turnbull government climate policy review released in December suggested emissions limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”. The environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the safeguard mechanism was operating in accordance with legislation, rules and regulations. A spokeswoman for the Clean Energy Regulator said they included allowing reappraisal of how much a facility could emit if there was not enough historic data over the previous five years, or if the data did not accurately represent activity at the industrial site now. She said the safeguard mechanism was meant to make sure cuts paid for using the emissions reduction fund were not offset by “significant increases above business-as-usual levels”, but also to accommodate economic growth. The Australian National University economist Paul Burke said the safeguard mechanism had been designed to be loose and flexible. “It is a complicated and inefficient way to approach the goal of reducing emissions,” he said. Frydenberg said the mechanism was part of a suite of policies, including the successful emissions reduction fund, the renewable energy target and a national energy productivity plan, the details of which are yet to be released. He said contracts had been signed to cut emissions by 191m tonnes over the coming years, and the Climate Change Authority, a government agency, had found the fund was performing well. The minister said Australia was on track to comfortably beat its 2020 target of a 5% cut below 2000 levels. He did not mention the 2030 target. Environment department data released in December showed national emissions have increased each year since 2014, when the carbon price scheme that put a charge on greenhouse pollution was repealed. They rose 0.7% last financial year. The department projects its current trajectory emissions will be about 2% higher in 2030 than in 2005. RepuTex projects Australia will also fall short of its 2020 target of a 5% cut in absolute terms, with emissions expected to be at the same level as in 2000. But the country will meet its target under United Nations greenhouse accounting rules by using credits carried over from the previous target period, when Australia’s target was an 8% emissions increase between 1990 and 2012.

"One year after the closing of the camp at the Standing Rock Reservation, Standing Rock is everywhere. Our collective water has been assaulted for many generations to the possible point of no return.  Our Elders foretold of a Black Snake and how the Water of Life — “Mni Woc’oni,” which is our first medicine — would be affected if we did not stop this oncoming disaster. Mni Woc’oni is part of our creation story, and the same story that exists in many creation stories around Mother Earth.  When we say “Mni Woc’oni” — Water of Life — people all over the world are now beginning to understand that it is a living spirit: it can heal when you pray with it and die if you do not respect it. We wanted the world to know there have been warnings in our prophecies and, as we see it, those warnings are now taking place. It was said water would be like gold. It was said that our spirit of water would begin to leave us.  We are at the crossroads. In April 2016, after receiving concerns about the construction of an oil pipeline, I was invited to Sacred Stone Camp at the northeastern border of the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota to assist with a water ceremony. At that time, not many were there, but it was enough to create a prayer to wake up the people. I told the young people that Standing Rock is everywhere.  Later that month, our indigenous youth set out on foot to run from the Standing Rock Reservation to Washington D.C. in an attempt to bring attention to the poisonous bitumen oil pipeline coming through our treaty territory. For our young people, it was important to explain to U.S. government leaders that this was unacceptable.  As I look back at my experiences at Standing Rock, I think about the circle we created through prayer on December 4, 2016. Our traditional Elders asked all nations to join us and stand in prayer. Thousands, including many religious representatives, joined in prayer on that very cold day. An invitation video was made and sent all over the world.  After the prayers were offered to the fire, I asked the people to surround the camp and ride horseback around the whole perimeter. On this day, President Obama and his administration halted the Dakota Access Pipeline by denying the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers an easement that would have allowed the pipeline to cross beneath Lake Oahe.  The closing of the camp at Standing Rock a year ago and the continued construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has been a great disappointment. So, too, was the November 2017 spill of 210,000 gallons of oil from the Keystone Pipeline, west of the Sisseton Wahpeton Reservation, despite the tribe’s fight against it since 2003. So, too, was the April 2011 spill of 1.2 million gallons of oil onto Lubicon Cree territory, northeast of Peace River.  What happened at Standing Rock has awakened many of my own people, and people across the world.  It was at Standing Rock that so many came together to share their stories and knowledge of what was happening in their territory, sharing ideas on how to move toward sustainable living in our relationship to land, water, and food.  Standing Rock has marked the beginning of an international movement that will continue to work peacefully, purposefully, and tirelessly for the protection of water along all areas of poisonous oil pipelines and across all of Mother Earth.  In the protection of Mni Woc’oni, it is more than oil pipelines threatening the well-being and future of our water. Near the native territory of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, concentrated animal feeding operations or “CAFOs” are draining and degrading the land and water. As a result, the air is toxic, swamps have dried up, and aquifers, to which the people are supposed to have water rights, are being drained. Residents have mortgaged their homes to fight these threats in court and lost. In other places — in mining spills across South America and Africa and at Fukushima — man has gone too far.  Water is a source of life, not a resource.  My life’s work has been to bring attention to water and to unite all nations, all faiths in one prayer. As Keeper to the White Buffalo Calf Woman Bundle, I have also brought attention to the white animals being born, signaling us of changes globally.  As an indigenous leader, I have supported the establishment of a World Peace and Prayer Day, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and, most recently, the Nayzul Declaration.  In our tradition, we pray for everything we eat and drink so our minds can be good. When the environment that we live in is sick and suffering, so too are the minds and decisions of our leaders.  We must continue to work together for the health and well-being of our water and our Earth.  In a Sacred Hoop of Life, there is no ending and no beginning. Hec’ed Onipikte (that we shall live).
