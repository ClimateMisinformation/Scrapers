Share this...FacebookTwitterIn my last post I wrote about how German public broadcasting network Deutsche Welle is holding a 3 day conference dubbed: Climate Change and the Media, which features a number of let’s-save-the-planet and let’s-redefine-journalism workshops. Click list of workshops. You’ll find some real doozies. Here are some interesting ones, in case you’re interested in attending.Psychotherapist Mark Bayne
One workshop: It’s about Attitudes: Understanding and Reporting the Psychology of Climate Change, is chaired by former BBC foreign correspondent turned psychotherapist Mark Brayne. In a German interview here, he:
 …is convinced that our media in its current form is overwhelmed and cannot handle this core task of the 21st century.
Bayne is also convinced that as long as politicians, business leaders and voters don’t grasp just how critical the situation is, there will be no chance for a change in opinion, and adds:
And what is the most powerful tool when it comes to changing how people think? The media!  In our reporting, we have to portray the coming collapse as unavoidable. Ironically, that could be the only chance to prevent it – maybe.”
I’d say here, we aren’t the ones in urgent need of psychotherapy.
Advocacy Media
Here’s another journalist workshop: Coverage vs. advocacy – Does the media guide or reflect cultural shift?. It calls on considering media advocacy in place of just plain old coverage.

‘Media advocacy isn’t about a mass audience. It’s not about reaching everybody. It’s about targeting the two or three per hundred who’ll get involved and make a difference. It’s about starting a chain reaction. And reaching critical mass.’
Informing the public is not enough; now it has to be told how to think. Does Germany still sound like a democratic country? Perhaps more and more like the old German Democratic Republic (East Germany – the one that built a wall to keep its people from running away).
Behavioural Changes Are Necessary 
The objective of another workshop Fragile environments in the Himalaya region – The responsibility of local media is to change human behaviour:
This workshop will examine the state of climate change effects now and in the near future and will analyze the role the local media can play in educating people about the environment and the behavioural changes necessary as a result of global warming.
I’m not making this up – it’s for real!
Clearly, with this conference, the publically funded Deutsche Welle is calling for a more dictated news reporting. But should this dictatorial approach be a surprise? Not really. A look at how German public radio and TV are  funded can tell you something about how these media elites operate. In Germany, all radio and TV owners are required to pay hefty licensing fees every year. The fees are collected by an organisation called GEZ – where they are often collected by plainclothes officials who go door-to-door busting fee-shirkers. It’s not enough that they take our money, now they want to tell us how to think and behave too.
Obsessed and drunk with something, the German media are going off course from journalism to thought control. Sound familiar?

Share this...FacebookTwitterEven the prominent German online DIE WELT reports here that Pacific islands are not in danger because they are growing and keeping ahead of rising sea levels. When Germany starts reporting such things, then you know the warmists are sinking fast.According to a very basic but indisputable study, scientists Paul Kench of the University of Auckland and Arthur Webb of the Geosciences Commission of the Fiji Islands simply compared aerial photographs of 27 islands taken in the 1950s and compared them to satellite photos and determined that only 4 islands have gotten smaller. DIE WELT reports:
Climate change and rising sea levels have no effect because many Pacific islands have been  growing over the last 60 years, rather than sinking. That’s the result of a study that contradicts all expectations, reports the British magazine New Scientist.
23 islands were as big or even bigger.
So you mean the Pacific islands aren’t sinking! Afraid not. You AGW alarmists have been screwed again.
The islands are growing because they are made up of dying coral reefs. The coral reefs are living organisms, and so they keep reproducing and thus keep adding more material to the ever-growing islands.

Webb also notes that hurricane Bebe washed roughly 140 hectares of sediment onto the island, increasing its size by a whopping 10% in a single shot. Now there’s new beachfront property for the island. DIE WELT writes:
The study shows that rising sea levels don’t always threaten these islands. ‘Everyone claimed that sea levels are rising and the islands are drowning. But they are not. Sea levels are rising, but the islands are responding accordingly.’
But the scientists warn!!
If the sea level rises more quickly, then sediment accumulation will not keep up and the islands will drown.
Really? Well, I’m sure the inhabitants are just shaking at the knees. Don’t count on it. As the islands continue to grow, they are most likely laughing at the rest of the world, for having suckered it with yet another phony scare story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMarc Morano of Climate Depot presents his written testimony at the Congressional Hearing on Climate Change in Fairview, West VA of May 30, 2013. This represents just the latest milestone on how far the global warming science has collapsed in the face of growing scientific skepticism over the recent years.
Ten years ago and more, the scales were actually tipped completely in favor of the warmists. The theory of man-made global warming at the time was rather new to the public and seemed plausible. The planet had just seen a couple of decades of strong warming, and it all appeared to fit together. Yet, much of the science was still poorly understood, and, as is always the case in science, skepticism refused to let go.
In the beginning the number of skeptic voices represented only a small and cautious minority – only a few scientists and blogsites were actively challenging the theory. By the early and mid 2000s, serious challenges began mounting. For example Steve McIntyre exposed Michael Mann’s hockey stick as a worthless statistical artifact, Michael Crichton had written a bestselling thriller critical of global warming, and skeptic blogs capable of reaching broad audiences were beginning to communicate skeptical science and findings. The skeptics grew in numbers, yet resembled more a disorganized motley crew who possessed limited public communication power.
But that changed in the late 2000s. Suddenly the Earth had stopped warming for 10 years, winters turned harsh, and lots of skeptic blogs were coming online and piling on. That the IPCC 4AR of 2007 was riddled with errors, exaggerations, and relied on a lot of gray literature had become clear and thus seriously damaged the UN body. The IPCC was humiliated and on the defensive.
The release of the Climategate e-mails and failure of the Copenhagen Conference made the situation even more desperate for the warmists. Claims of broad agreement on the science were exposed as having been premature and wildly exaggerated. The science was coming apart. All that was left was to effectively communicate that reality to the public.
Expert communicator Marc Morano routs the warmists
The effective communication of skeptical science got a major boost when Marc Morano stepped onto the stage. Although Morano had already been active in debunking the AGW scare and the notion of consensus as Communications Director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee under Senator James Inhofe in the 2000s, it wasn’t until he published his award-winning Climate Depot climate science/news clearinghouse site in 2009 that the message began to be heard in earnest.
With Morano, the science debunking the AGW claim had now found a powerful and talented PR expert who effectively communicated the inconvenient climate science findings to the media and public. Often we find Morano on television, radio and in the print media, nationally and internationally. Since Morano helped fire up the climate science communication machinery, the debate for the skeptics has turned into a virtual rout of the warmists.
In his written congressional testimony, Morano writes “that on virtually every claim — from A-Z — the claims of the promoters of man-made climate fears are failing, and in many instances the claims are moving in the opposite direction. The global warming movement is suffering the scientific death of a thousand cuts.” He adds “these are not good times for the promoters of global warming” and “the idea that CO2 is the tail that wags the dog is no longer scientifically tenable.”
Just how bad have things gotten for the global warming scientists? Morano adds in his testimony:

Gore and the UN IPCC are now reduced to pointing to every storm, flood, hurricane or tornado as proof of man-made global warming. The UN has been reduced to blaming man-made global warming for prostitution. See: Climate Astrology — ‘It Has Been Foretold’ of Extreme Weather: ‘UN IPCC science has a status similar to interpretations of Nostradamus and the Mayan calendars’ & Climate Astrology borrows from the past: ‘Before That Witch Moved Into The Neighborhood, We Never Had Bad Weather Or Disease’.”
Morano adds later on:
UN IPCC scientist Kevin Trenberth has said every weather event now influenced by global warming. […] They are turning themselves into anti-science activists. […] Their theory that somehow the weather is unusual that we have a ‘new normal’ — not only does it fail to convince — it becomes a laughing stock when you start actually looking at the hard data’.”
Not only have climate scientists and CO2 activists desperately used single weather events to defend their crumbling science, they also have spent the last years trying to launch smear campaigns against the skeptics, claiming they are massively funded by Big Oil, Koch Industries and coal. This is only a diversion from the real debate and scientific data.
In truth the warmists and global warming activists have been showered with billions in funding, compared to only a few million finding their way to the hands of skeptics in recent years. So why are the skeptics drubbing the warmists in the debate, even though they are outfunded thousands to one? It’s called: focusing on the scientific data. Period.
Smear jobs, weather claims, appeals to authority, and models in the end are admissions of defeat.
In his testimony, Morano sticks to the science, citing almost 2 dozen renowned international scientists, e.g.: Bengtsson, de Freitas, Plimer, Svensmark, Happer, Schmitt, Levitin, Curry, Christy, Pielke Jr., to name some. In the testimony, we do not see Morano using the diversionary tactic of questioning the billions in funding behind warmists scientists and activist groups. Keep the focus on the science and data!
On energy Morano reminds Congress that coal and “other carbon based forms of energy have been one of the greatest liberators of mankind in the history of our planet. Is it greedy to want heat, A/C, lower infant mortality, longer life expectancy? Coal is the moral choice.” Little wonder one coal power plant is coming online every week in China and that even green Germany is burning more coal once again.

This was the worst storm in 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, …well, make that 0.1 years.
Where I live the storm ended yesterday evening. One news media outlet (NDR radio) summed it nicely earlier this morning, saying that the storm “was worse than expected”, but then just two sentences later the report said “the damage was far less than expected”. This is like saying the day was hotter than they thought it would be, but that the thermometer rose less than expected.
All in all, Xaver was just a normal big North Sea storm of the type seen dozens of times already. If the hype served a purpose, it was that people were extra careful and so the loss of life was practically near zero.
 
20:45:
Where I live the wind has died down considerably. I went for a walk and there really wasn’t that much wind at all. Maybe it’s just a calm spell. The evening news have hyped it up as much as they could and seem to be hoping for a storm surge to flood Hamburg early in the morning. No deaths to report yet. Overall, it’s just another typical winter storm.
Latest wind gusts (km/hr) so far at some locations:
– Where I live: 78
– Helgoland (North Sea island): 128
– Sylt (North Sea island): 128
– Emden: 92
– Hamburg: 89
– Bremen: 89
– Rostock: 83

18:05
Some exaggerations going on in the media. For example, the northern port city of Kiel was reported (by Bild) to have seen a wind gust of 137 kph. but the weather station shows only 76 kph!
Winds appear to have peaked. In places like Hamburg and Bremen they are nowhere near reaching the forecast highs of up to 140 km/hr. Good news: so far no reported deaths, and only two injured. And no mention that the storm is caused by “climate change”.  Obviously the PIK has not issued any statements to the press up to now.

– Helgoland (North Sea island): 154
– Sylt (North Sea island): 135
– Emden: 93

– Bremen: 85
– Rostock: 90
 
15:20
Meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann reports gusts of 154 km/hr in Helgoland, but he doesn’t expect any record wind speeds to be recorded. Matters not much better in the UK: www.bbc.co.uk/weather.
Already lots of media hyping it up as if Xaver were the storm of the century. But Kachelmann tweets: “And just for the record: Xaver is not and never will be the worst storm in decades.”
Top wind gusts (km /hr) so far at some locations:
Where I live: 85
Helgoland (North Sea island): 154
Sylt (North Sea island): 130
Emden: 81
Hamburg: 85
Bremen: 85
Rostock: 74
Keep in mind these are wind gusts, and not sustained wind speeds.
 
14:00
This morning at 8:30 am all was calm. But by mid morning the winds started acting up by mid morning. Now we are getting gusts over 70 km/hr and mixture of rain and ice.
The peak of the storm is expected to hit Hamburg by 4 pm. So far no reports of deaths or injuries. Also no comments from the PIK house of horrors or from Mojib Latif.
Top wind gusts so far:
Where I live: 70 km/hr
Helgoland (North Sea island): 115 km/hr
Sylt (North Sea island): 116 km/hr
Emden: 77 km/hr
Hamburg: 80 km/hr
Bremen: 40 km/hr
Rostock: 65 km/hr
Expect the numbers to go up in the next hours.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe French website Contrepoints (Counterpoints) has an excellent general summary on how the Turney Expedition course of events unfolded in an article titled: Akademik Shokalskiy: the time to ask questions. Turney really does appear to be in a lot of hot water.
Contrepoints introduction starts:
Persuaded to have nothing to worry about from ice in the Antarctic, an expedition of climatologists wound up getting caught in 5 meters of sea ice. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers are safe and sound, now come to the questions.”
Vessel was low budget, inadequate
Contrepoints starts by questioning the adequacy of the vessel chosen for the expedition, citing the harshness of the environment that would be entered. It is turning out that Commonwealth Bay is indeed notorious for ice blockage and that cruise companies generally avoid the area. The list of sunken shipwrecks littering the ocean floor is growing. Contrepoints presents examples that include the Explorer in 2007 and Brazilian ship Endless Sea in 2012:
Also, it seems the decision to charter a vessel of the type that is the Akademik Shokalskiy can be explained in large part by budgetary reasons, but also by the certainty of the organizers that there would be nothing to worry about from icebergs because of climate warming.”
Far more sea ice “than expected”
Contrepoints then informs its readers that in fact it has gotten colder in the Antarctic over the past years and presents a sea ice chart which shows near record high sea ice extents. This all raises questions on what the expedition organizers were thinking back in November, before starting the jouney, a time when sea ice charts were showing 1 million sq km more ice than normal, Contrepoints reminds us.
Tourism disguised as science
Contrepoints then questions the wisdom of bringing on tourists and family members onto the expedition.
Under these conditions, and based on the synopsis of the expedition, as well as the accounts of a more than festive ambiance on board, one is entitled to wonder about the real scientific character of this adventure.”
“An obvious amateurism…obstinacy and naivety”
When comparing Turney’s expedition to other scientific expeditions, like those of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute with its Polarstern ice-breaker, the qualitive differences are nothing short of glaring. Contrepoints writes that Turney’s expedition, when you boil it down, was “an obvious amateurism“. The French site writes that the answer to the questionas to why the ship got caught in ice “lies probably not in an error by the captain but in the obstinacy and naivety of expedition leader Chris Turney.”

Knew well in advance a storm was approaching
Contrepoints, citing the blog of onboard tourist and Australian Green politician Janet Rice, describes how passengers bungled about with an Argo craft, causing an hours-long delay in the departure of the boat as a storm rolled in. The storm it turns out, was not something unpredictable, but had actually been forecast already on December 22. Rice writes in the first sentence of her blog on December 22:
There’s a blizzard on the way apparently!”
Even more damning, Contrepoints writes:
While Mawson found the bay completely free of ice 100 years earlier, his successor Chris Turney found himself nose to nose with an immense floe of ice that covered the bay and forced his ship to stop close to 70 km from where Mawson had set foot on land. This was already on 19/20 Decembre according to the entries made by Turney at his blog.”
Fault of amateurism
Contrepoints concludes the description of the debacle with:
Finally, what had to happen happened and the next day on December 24: The ice finally trapped the Akademik Shokalskiy. In short, contrary to what Turney claims, the misadventure experienced by his team is more the fault of amateurism than of having no luck.”
Contrepoints then concludes the piece by describing how the Turney’s botched expedition is now adversely impacting the other scientific operations taking place in Antarctica, as logistics are now seriously in disarray.
After publishing my blog article Expedition on the cheap here some five days ago, one global warming activist reader reacted with a knee-jerk claiming I didn’t know what I was talking about. Today we now see stories appearing every day, confirming precisely what I brought up. Goes to show who really doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Who approved the expedition in the first place? 
There are other important questions, as not all the blame can be put on Turney or the vessel’s captain. This was a huge expedition, and so various authorizations, approvals and permits had to have been necessary. Who signed them? Who was too incompetent to see that it wasn’t up to standard and that Turney was an amateur?

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a worthwhile piece by David Deming: http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/05/the_problems_with_al_gore.html
The ancient Greeks encouraged free thought, debate and critical analysis.  Pupils were encouraged to criticise their teachers.  Today we know that in science scepticism is the heart of progress; without it everything stops. The objective of science is not to prove existing theories, but to disprove them.
But in Al Gore’s world, things are just the opposite. Gore refuses to debate and continuously ridicules and demonises his critics. His approach: science is established by brute authority. Those who disagree with his view are not invited in discussion, but are marginalised and cast out. Only one dogma is tolerated.

AGW is probably the only scientific hypothesis that ever started with a consensus. In real science, that’s not how it works. This hypothesis is a dud.
In his piece, Deming writes in the end:
Gore and Obama have joined an elite group that includes Portuguese physician Egas Moniz.  In 1949, Moniz was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine for devising an innovative procedure known as the frontal lobotomy.  It seems fitting that Gore and Obama are grouped with Moniz, since their apparent goal is to lobotomize human civilization.
I don’t know about human civilisation, but they are certainly trying to lobotomise critics, dissenters and the scientific approach.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIce breakers getting trapped in near record high sea ice around Antarctica, Arctic sea ice seeing a whopping 50% gain last summer, record killer cold and snow gripping Canada and the USA, rare snowfalls in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The string of cold weather events just doesn’t end. And all this in a non-La Nina year.
So it comes as little surprise when we are told that global temperatures haven’t risen in close to two decades and that they have been trending downwards over the last 8 years or so.
Despite the mild weather that Europe has been experiencing over the last 5 weeks, the overall temperature trend here speaks a very different story.
German weather site www.wetter.net here reports that 2013 in Germany was the second coldest year in a decade.

Figure 1: Germany’s annual mean temperature since 2003. 2013 was the second coldest. The 10-year trend is clear: Germany is cooling.

What’s more, wetter.net writes:
Based on the last 25 years, 2013 was the fourth coldest. If we look at the average temperatures for the last 25 years, we see that they have pretty much remained constant.”
But Germany is not alone in seeing global warming gone AWOL. Benny Peiser’s GWPF site here writes that the same thing is being observed in Great Britain.

Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life.
Yes, the alarmist zealots think the very basis of life hinges on this.
A few journalists in Germany have actually practiced journalism on the issue of climate science recently, and this has infuriated the Established Climate “Science” Community. They too are threatened with the Big Cutoff. You see, although journalists have the competence to report critically on “rudimentary” issues like economics, finance, politics, law,  civics and so on, climate science is far too complex with too much at stake to leave in their hands.
Not only are the alarmist zealots calling for a suspension of democracy, claiming casus belli, but now they’re also demanding that journalists abandon journalism altogether. What gate-name ought I assign to this one? Dummkopf Journalism-gate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterLe Monde here has an article which in large part re-iterates what NYT journalist Andrew Revkin wrote 3 days ago. The selfish, adolescent follies of the Turney expedition are seriously disrupting the supply of serious scientific operations in the Antarctic. A number of scientists worldwide have not found Turney’s charade amusing at all.
The piece is titled: “Scientists angered by cruise trapped in Antarctica“.
After describing how the botched expedition and the ensuing helicopter rescue, Le Monde writes how the relief operations are now “endangering several major research programs being conducted on different scientific bases of the sixth continent.” There’s only a 3-month window available for supply ships to make vital deliveries. Time is of the essence when it comes to logistics in Antarctica.
On the Turney expedition, Le Monde quotes Yves Frenot, the French Director of the Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor (IPEV):
It is a tourist pseudo-scientific expedition. It’s a little ‘cruise fun’.”
Glaciologist Jérôme Chappellaz of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l’Environnement, who is still at the Casey Antarctic base, said:
The expedition was presented as being scientific, but there are tourists on board who paid to go on a trip.”
Because of the distress call coming from the Turney’s chartered expedition vessel Akademik Shokalskiy, Le Monde writes: “Vital supplies comprising hundreds of tons of food, fuel and equipment could not be fully discharged from the Aurora Australis, which was requisitioned in emergency.”

The supply disruption is not the only thing that irked scientists on other Antarctic bases in need of vitally important supplies, but they later had to watch booze-cruise, spring break like going-ons onboard the ice-bound Akademik Shokalskiy. Le Monde quotes Mr. Chappellaz:
At Casey, when the colleagues learned the ‘Australis’ had been requisitioned, there was a little panic. What was most shocking was the manner in which the members on the Shokalskiy expedition communicated: on screens we saw them partying, singing, etc. – without at any time seeming to ask what they were putting in peril.”
Le Monde also quotes glaciologist Joe McConnell (Australian Antarctic Division) in the New York Times, who stated the rescue operations will also likely cause considerable disruptions for French and Chinese programs because their vessels had also also been diverted.
Le Monde writes that the cost of the Chinese and Australian ice breakers are close to $80,000 per day – each! And that doesn’t include the crew! Right now the Chinese Xue Long is trapped in ice and no one can say how long before it will get out.
M. Chappellaz vents:
It is not normal that this expedition, which uses science as a pretext for adventure-tourism, is jeopardizing multi-annual research programs.”

Finally Le Monde raises concerns that the pictures of a stranded “climate science vessel” trapped in deep ice may be leaving a long lasting false message on the subject of global warming in the minds of the worldwide public.
Finally, perhaps these two reports from the New York Times and Le Monde provide hope in that in the future they will start to distinguish between the sophomoric alarmist climate scientists who want to change the world in a rush, and those that are truly serious about doing real science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUN fear-driven energy policy itself is responsible for accelerating large-scale destruction of biodiversity. Forests cleared to make way for ""green"" government-subsidised biofuel.
 There’s been talk recently about a new scare that environmentalists have come up with to replace the all-but-defunct AGW scare.  The evil villains are, again, the very thing that have made our lives immensely better: INDUSTRY. The new scare is: industry is destroying biodiversity.   
Today at least two of Germany’s leading online news outlets are reporting on industry’s threat to biodiversity, based on a UN study. Both Stern here and Die Zeit have almost the same title:   
UN: Corporations Driving Ruthless Destruction of Nature   
And both articles are almost identical, indicating they were likely press releases from the UN itself. According to Die Zeit:   
Species, even complete ecosystems, are disappearing at an unprecedented speed. Companies refuse to protect nature, the damage is in the trillions of euros.   
Species are dying 100 times faster than previously assumed. The environmental damage that is caused by the world’s 3000 leading companies is estimated by the UN to be 1.7 trillion euros, this from a study from the UN Environmental Program UNEP.

According to UN Environment Director Achim Steiner:   
The natural capital of the planet is being destroyed on a massive scale.   
Many economists are still blind to the enormous impact on the diversity of animals, plants and other forms of life and their role in the function of the ecosystem.   
The UN study says that awareness for environmental protection is increasing the most in Africa with 50% of company managers viewing environmental pollution as a threat to their business, 45% in Latin America and only 20% in Europe.   
The UN study will be made public at the International Conference for Species and Biodiversity on Tuesday in London.   
Readers ought to recall how it’s the UN itself and government politics based on UN climate fear mongering  are actually in large part responsible for their claimed massive destruction of nature. Read:
Europe’s Latest Green Megafolly. Burning Forests To Save The Planet!  
And maybe the UN has realised that it wasn’t getting anywhere by nagging and blaming the citizens of the planet. Now it probably thinks it can get more support by demonising industry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago I wrote about an article published in the print copy of Swiss magazine Weltwoche.
That same article also had a side feature story on the myth of climate science consensus titled: Skeptics On The Rise – by Alex Reichmuth.
Reichmuth writes that the claim of a scientific consensus in climate science is nothing but an illusion and that attempts to assert it has become a “ritual“. Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Ban Ki Moon and Naomi Oreskes have all tried to declare the climate science debate as ended. Yet, Weltwoche writes, the skeptics and dissidents are refusing to go away and that their ranks are swelling. Reichmuth cites almost a half a dozen petitions signed by scientists over the years refuting that the science is settled.
And skepticism is not isolated to Europe and USA, but is also found in Japan, Russia. Website Popular Technology.net lists 1100 peer-reviewed publications that support the arguments of skeptics.
Weltwoche also quotes German physicist Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, who wrote in his book Energie und Klima:
Climate skeptics outnumber climate alarmists and have much greater credibility”.
Reichmuth then focuses on John Cook’s survey, calling it one-sided” and that it uses a “trick” to produce the appearance of consensus. Stefan Rahmstorf used the same tactic in a recent interview with the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung:



<!--

That our greenhouse gases are leading to global warming belongs to the foundation of climate science.”
Reichmuth then adds that ‘climate scientists’ use the trick of trying to make skeptics appear as incompetent by claiming they aren’t real climate scientists who can be trusted. Yet Reichmuth points out that experts from other fields are indeed very well equipped to expose errors in climate science.
Even academics who have never researched climate are able to make valuable contributions. This is illustrated by Canadian mining specialist Stephen McIntyre. He showed that the hockey stick curve from leading IPCC scientists was based on a false statistical approach.”
Another example is the duo of Prof Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s IPCC critical book, Die kalte Sonne, which reignited the climate debate in Germany last year.
Reichmuth concludes:
‘The science is settled,’ Al Gore has been claiming for years. Yet there is absolutely no trace of consensus in climate science.”
Weltwoche’s report not only tells us that climate science consensus is a myth, but it also shows that the media in Europe are beginning to add to the dissent.

Chancellor Angela Merkel clashed vs. challenger Pier Steinbrück in yesterday’s only major televised campaign debate. Not once did the subject of climate change come up. Photo credits, Merkel: Alexander Kurz – CC-BY-SA-3.0 License; Steinbrück: SPD
But you would have never known it watching yesterday evening’s nationally televised campaign debate between incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel and challenger Pier Steinbrück. The debate was shown live by four major German networks as German voters get set to elect a new government on September 22, or to keep the one they now have. It’s the only debate scheduled between Angela Merkel of the conservative CDU party and Pier Steinbrück of the SPD socialist party.
The 90-minute debate was moderated by 4 media and television personalities and covered a variety of issues. Candidates fielded questions on issues ranging over every thing from the economy, jobs, pensions, health care, the euro crisis, Syria, foreign policy, taxes, Greece bailout, to name a few. Yet, not once were the candidates asked about the “greatest crisis facing humanity” – climate. In fact the word climate was not even uttered once by anyone! To add insult to injury, even minor issues such as day-care for toddlers and a proposed national toll for Germany’s autobahns were discussed. Climate? Absolute zero!
Major setback for climate activists

This is a major setback for the global warming alarmists who want to make climate change the central issue of our time, such as Professors Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Ottmar Edenhofer of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. If that doesn’t tell them where they really stand on the list of Germany’s priorities and the things that are really important for Germans, then they are living in a fantasy world. At Twitter, a number of German greens and activists grumbled bitterly that climate change had been ignored in the debate.
Renewable energies “a disaster”
Also the problems with Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) and the associated skyrocketing prices were discussed briefly. Candidate Steinbrück called the management of the Energiewende “a disaster“, and that the best anyone could hope for now is to slow down the price increase.
No support for a US-led attack on Syria.
Concerning support for a US led attack on Syria, both candidates said outright they would not support an attack without UN approval.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCOP 19 in Warsaw is fast approaching and part of the ritual is the ringing of climate disaster alarms, much like churches ring their church bells on Christmas Eve.
The Die Welt article here tries to explain to readers why the climate catastrophe is still approaching even if temperatures haven’t risen in 15 years. The German daily tries to give the impression that it has the explanation for the temperature stagnation, but later in the article we see that it concedes it’s pretty much all speculation.
Die Welt writes that the high temperatures are hiding in the ocean depths and that it’s only a question of time before they reappear in the atmosphere with a vengeance. The German daily quotes alarmist scientists who claim that skeptics are “misinterpreting the data” when they insist the warming has stopped.
So where has the heat gone? Die Welt quotes Stefan Rahmstorf and a TV weatherman to explain it:
In the oceans. The world’s oceans are the biggest heat storages. When vertical currents such as those of the recent years provide for a colder sea surface, the oceans are able to take up more heat. […] ‘The greenhouse effect has not let up; it’s just that there is now more heat in the deep ocean and less at the surface,’ says climate scientist Rahmstorf.”
German TV weatherman Sven Plöger adds:
“The southern oceans are able to absorb an unbelievable amount of energy and thus act as a buffer.”
So the mystery is solved, Die Welt tries to have us believe. Well, not really because Die Welt then concedes that the explanations are only “plausible” at best.

Later in the article Die Welt does call the stagnation “baffling” and even offers other explanations for the warming stop that it calls “plausible”, like Chinese aerosols possibly dimming the atmosphere. Obviously their use of the world “plausible” implies that the ocean and aerosol explanations are not much more than guesses as to what is happening. This is hardly what anyone would call settled science.
Peeved Rahmstorf: skeptics have scored success
And Die Welt is forced to admit:
The fact is also: The projections from scientists have failed to forecast the stop in the temperature rise.”
Die Welt adds that warmists like Rahmstorf are highly irritated by the mileage skeptics have derived from the warming stop:
Scientist Rahmstorf is peeved by the headlines made by skeptics over the past months over the supposed pause in climate change. Those who put too much emphasis on the phenomenon are confusing ‘the noise of natural variations with the signal of global warming’.”
Rahmstorf adds that this has been “a success scored by the skeptics who are trying to seed doubt over global warming using arguments that aren’t really serious.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother German association of journalists has publicly demanded the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) stop the distribution of a government “blacklist” of US and German skeptics. The UBA is headed by the German Ministry of Environment – Germany’s version of the EPA.
Today Germany’s association of science, the Wissenschafts-Pressekonferenz e.V. (WPK) issued a press release condemning the UBA’s brochure and blacklisting of skeptic journalists. The WPK is an association whose members mainly include science journalists working for the print, broadcasting and Internet media. The stated objective of the WPK: “to promote quality science journalism.”
Just last week the German Association of Journalists demanded an apology from the Federal Environment Ministry. Two of the journalists, Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, are suing the Ministry.
What follows is the press release of the WPK journalist association:

WPK criticizes the pillory of journalists by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA)
The Wissenschafts-Pressekonferenz e.V. (WPK), [English: The Science Press Conference] finds it unacceptable that individual journalists are being publicly paraded by the German Environment Agency, and portrayed as being as incompetent only because they are criticizing leading scientists.  The government body names the journalists who have opinions that ‘correspond to the state of knowledge of climate science’ in its brochure on climate change: ‘And indeed the warming continues’.
‘It is not the duty of state institutions to determine which opinions may be expressed and which may not,’ explained WPK Chairman Martin Schneider. ‘Journalists may and must represent different points of views, and they may and must always question established scientists.’ Overall it cannot be the job of a state authority to quasi certify certain scientific positions as being the truth. Also when the anthropogenic climate change can no longer be doubted, there is in the science an intensive discussion over many details, such as its consequences and the validity of certain climate models. ‘This discourse must take place within the science and journalists must accompany it critically,’ Schneider said.
The WPK requests that Environment Minister Peter Altmaier stop the further distribution of the brochure in its current form.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterJournal Nature can no longer be bothered to check facts anymore. Bad enough that they rarely subject global warming climate papers to real, rigorous peer-review, and so now even the most obvious rubbish gets by.
In a Nature comment, Professor Turney seems to be responding in part to harsh articles published by Cambridge University News and the The Mail on Sunday. Both these media outlets cited veteran polar explorer Robert Headland, who said “an ice-strengthened ship was totally unsuitable for the area where Turney conducted his expedition“.
Headland also accused Turney of carrying out the expedition “on the cheap” and that he had “needlessly taken many risks“.
In Turney’s Nature reaction to all the criticism, This was no pleasure cruise, Turney writes the following (my emphasis):
For the past six weeks on board the Russian icebreaker MV Akademik Shokalskiy, my colleague Chris Fogwill and I have led a team of scientists, science communicators and volunteers on a voyage from the New Zealand subantarctic islands to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.”
Turney claims that the ship is an icebreaker when clearly it is not. That’s a falsehood, if not an outright lie. The fact is that the Akademik Shokalskiy is simply reinforced for travel in icy areas and has only the lowly UL rating, meaning it is suitable for “independent navigation in the Arctic in summer and autumn in light ice conditions and in the non-arctic freezing seas all the year round“, see www.globalsecurity.org.
In the Nature comment Turney also writes:

That is the reality of polar science. It is difficult. Almost every season, ships get caught in sea ice, teams lose communications and planes are sometimes tragically lost.”
All the more reason for taking a real icebreaker – which he didn’t. Gee, the whole time I thought it was an icebreaker!
Turney is proving to be a basket-case
The Turney story is becoming ever more comical. What we have here is a humiliated scientist who wants everyone to believe the Antarctic is melting away, yet claims he went down there in what he thinks is an ice breaker to break through ice; says he knew that conditions there were treacherous, yet took his family and tourists along anyway; says that conditions there are unpredictable, but claims that the sea ice and wind unpredictability caught him by surprise; says the expedition was no pleasure cruise, yet had a fully-stocked bar and we saw pictures of partying almost daily.
Even funnier is that Turney is now trying to fool himself and others into believing that he has done the whole world a huge favor in that he created a “remarkable rekindling of public interest in science and exploration” and that he will wow the world with “the quality of the research“.
After this fiasco (even Andy Revkin of the New York Times calls it just that) it’s clear that Turney is someone who is incapable of acknowledging errors. Worse, and even scarier, he and Nature seem to be telling us that he deserves a medal for what he has done.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeet deepsea diver Gustavo. Gustavo is a a 3-ton elephant seal that scientists at Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute have put into service to collect ocean data. Some elephant seal bulls were tagged with state-of-the-art satellite transmitters at the Dallmann Laboratory on King George Island, Antarctica. Read about it here:  Alfred Wegener Institute.The scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association furnished some elephant seals with transmitters that operate using the satellite-aided ARGOS location system. Here’s how it works:
During the annual migrations to their oceanic feeding grounds elephant seals cover thousands of kilometres. They dive down to depths of over 2000 metres and remain under water for periods of over an hour. When a seal with a transmitter dives, it collects data – even under the ice – and then appears on the surface again to breathe after some time. While it breathes fresh air, the recorded data package is sent to a satellite that passes on the signals received.
The elephant seals will gather and transmit data during the Antarctic winter, a time when ships are not able to perform this job because of too much sea ice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse have released their November solar activity report. It follows in English.
===================================
The sun in November 2013: You’re going to have to add more antifreeze
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In November 2013 the sun showed signs of more activity as sunspot number (SSN) was 77.6. This solar cycle month (the 60th of the current cycle) was therefore “only” 32% below the level of a normally active sun. Just as a reminder: February 2013 was 66% below the mean value of all the previous observed cycles 1-23! Compared to the mean (blue) the current cycle (red) appears as follows:

Figure 1: Current cycle 24 (red) versus mean solar cycle (blue) and solar cycle 5 (gray).  
Since solar cycle 24 began in December 2008, we have been witnessing a much weaker than normal solar cycle. Temporary spikes like those of last month reaching mean value have been the exception rather than the norm. Thus we continue to be on a similar track as SC 5, which was the first of the Dalton Minimum just after 1800. If one accumulates the sunspot number anomalies of each cycle up to the current month 60, we get the following graphic:

 Figure 2: Accumulated sunspot anomaly for each cycle after 60 months.
One immediately sees the abrupt drop in solar cycle 23, which ended in April 2006. Already SC 23 was slightly below normal, and the current cycle has been the calmest since SC 7 in 1833.
What lies ahead?
We have already cited forecasts based on physical attributes where the behavior of the corona (a very warm zone above the visible surface of the sun) and the magnetic field strength about the sun spots suggest continued weakening activity for the next solar cycle (Livingston/Penn). We now cite a study by Salvador (2013) that attempts to reconstruct solar cycles using planetary tidal effects on the sun. Even though we view this approach with skepticism, an amazing level of congruence with observed data is achieved:

Figure 3: Source: study by Salvador (2013).

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The red curve depicts the model and the blue curve shows the observed sunspot data since 1749. On this basis the author then makes a forecast where he takes the data starting in 1987 and calibrates his models using amplitudes and extends it into the future:

Figure 4. Source: Figure 7 of study by Salvador (2013).
Also in his model, SC 25 and 26 are projected to be very weak and in fact he forecasts a weak sun to persist until the end of the century. It is not our intention to forecast so far into the future, but little is expected to happen with our sun in the next 30 years the author of the article believes in addition to other authors. What impact will this have on the Earth?  Shouldn’t the drop in solar activity have and impact? What follows is a chart of the global wintertime temperature distribution comparing the values of the last 10 years to the 12 years that preceded them:

Figure 5. Source: GISS
The land-based temperatures in the winter between 30N and 60N have fallen. Especially the Eurasian region has been experiencing much colder winters since 2002. The datasets yield the following interesting results:

Figure 6.
Depicted by the red curve is the annual SSN anomaly since 2002 as to the first figure. Can the drop since 2003 indeed at least be partially because of the reduced solar activity?
There is plenty of literature available on this, and a possible relation is explained by Sarah Ineson (2012) in a presentation by the British Met Office. The reduced UV radiation of the sun at low activity has an impact on the stratosphere and this has an effect especially on the winter circulation down to the Earth’s surface.
What does this tell us?
The trend to colder winters here in Europe and elsewhere, all the way to China in the Far East and the east coast of the USA, has truly been robust over the last 10 years. From this we conclude that we hardly can anticipate warmer winters for the near future and that it may remain that way for a very long time should the solar relationship be confirmed. Therefore add more anti-freeze in the windscreen wiper reservoir of your car! Winter has arrived and likely it isn’t going to be a mild one!

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago environmentalists stridently demanded mankind stop its addiction to fossil fuels and convert to renewable energy sources, like wind power. And so some countries did just that. But now we’re finding out that environmentalists don’t like that either.Today Der Spiegel online reports that environmentalists are going to court and challenging almost every planned windpark project under the sun, now claiming they are a threat to birds and wildlife.
For example in 2007 the company Neue Energie Berlin GmbH was getting ready to install Hamburg’s first windpark in an industrial zone called Pankow-Nord. It seemed like a model project for responsible energy production. But before too long, the project ended up getting challenged in court. The environmental protection group called Nabu filed a lawsuit claiming the planned 180-meter tall windmills endangered the only two remaining red kite bird pairs in the city. The project was halted.
Eventually, the court decided the birds were not at risk and gave the project the green light. The nests after all were three kilometres from the construction site. The case clearly illustrates that not only are windparks riddled with technical probelms as reported read here, but also face huge, costly legal obstacles.
Because windparks generally are situated out in the countryside, conflicts with natural wildlife habitats are inevitable. Environmental lawsuits against planned windparks are mounting and threatening to throw sand into Germany’s vision of a green future. Indeed, according to Der Spiegel, Germany’s Minister for Environment Norbert Röttgen warns:
That of all things, precisely the environmental activists are putting plans to expand renewable energy at risk.
The exasperated Minister Röttgen then demands

…that the German environmental organisations put forth their own plans as to how they think wind energy and biomass plants are to be intensified without billions of euros in investments getting blocked by ecological objections.
Currently environmentalists are barricading against government plans for further expansion of windparks in the North Sea. Already 4400 square kilometers of sea area are now planned for offshore windparks. But environmentalists now cite dangers to sea birds and whales. Der Spiegel writes:
A total of 95 offshore-parks are planned to be built in Germany’s so-called  Excluded Business Zones  and thus will seriously encroach on the living space of protected species such as the red-throated and Arctic divers. Even the Federal Office for Nature Protection says the birds will respond by making a wide circle around the windmills. There’s also a danger that construction noise will harm the protected common porpoise.
The regulators at the Federal Office for Nature Protection say:
For this reason not every place in the Excluded Business Zone will be permitted.
So indeed it looks like billions of euros emarked for investment in wind energy are about to hit the big green legal wall.

Many of the old Christmas traditions we so very much cherish today originate in Germany. Here’s a video of Christmas market activity. (Don’t worry, it’s not superimposed with “Last Christmas” by Wham).

Perhaps a few of the ex-British forces stationed near Osnabruck will relate to the images. The footage was taken at the downtown Osnabruck Christmas market, which is only a short drive away from my house. The singing, of course is in German.
It is easy to get sidetracked by all the commerce and kitsch. One could easily argue that it is the pursuit of the things that we were taught would make us happy is in fact precisely what makes many among us miserable.

The German online news magazine Focus recently carried a story, “Warm Times Will Soon Be Over!” Commenting on the “new NASA high temperature record,” which may be set, the magazine blames it on El Nino.
Meteorologists, like Joe D’Aleo of the Weather Channel, are publicly distancing themselves from the false doctrine of global warming. D’Aleo says, “We’ll have La Nina conditions before the summer is over, and it will intensify further through the fall and winter. Thus we’ll have cooler temperatures for the next couple of years.”
These are the exact words, which I translated from the original German, I used in my post here.
My 6th grade English teacher, Mrs. Emma Brown at the Barton Academy, would be proud, I think. The best I could do in her class was a C+.
Just yesterday I wrote that I’d continue to focus on writing about stories that readers might otherwise not hear about. Well, I think it’s safe to say that at least some of us now have heard about the FOCUS story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Aphan posted a comment providing a link to the website of one of the passengers, Janet Rice, an Australian Green politician, who was along on the trip. In it she describes the events of December 23 that led to a delay in the departure of the vessel, and thus causing it to lose the race against the invading sea ice.
Here’s an excerpt from the day’s entry (my emphasis):
The first drama of the day was the sinking – or almost! – of one of the Argos. The Argos are designed to be amphibious – just. They were launched today off the ship – and two of the three made it safely being towed by a zodiac the 50 metres or so to shore. The third was towed too fast it seems – and water came over the bonnet / bow, flooding both the engine and the vehicle itself. Ben tried in vain to bail out with a spade and luckily they made it to shore before the vehicle sunk entirely. Ben ended up rather wet too, but similarly to Mary, not submerged enough for the lifejacket to come into play. Sadly Argo engines don’t take too kindly to being submerged… the ships engineers are still working on it and not very optimistic about its prospects.
The third drama of the day is the one which is still unfolding. Because of the Argo mishap we got off late, and had one less vehicle to ferry people to and fro.I’m told the Captain was becoming rather definite late in the afternoon that we needed to get everyone back on board ASAP because of the coming weather and the ice closing in. As I write we are continuing to make extremely slow progress through what looks like a winter alpine snow field – it’s yet another surreal part of this journey that we are in a ship trying to barge our way through here! I’m sure the Captain would have been much happier if we had got away a few hours earlier. Maybe we would have made it through the worst before it consolidated as much as it has with the very cold south- easterly winds blowing the ice away from the coast, around and behind us as well as ahead.
We’ll see where we are in the morning – it may be a very white Christmas Eve!
PS. 9.30am 24/12. We have moved less than a kilometre over night, and are now stationary in a sea of ice. The word is that we are not stuck, merely waiting for a weather change. It seems to me that we are having the quintessential Antarctic experience.J Stay tuned.”
Clearly the captain of the ship had gotten antsy and wanted to leave hours sooner. But the passengers’ escapades and dithering likely became the decisive screw-up that led to them getting trapped in ice for 10 days and turning the expedition into a debacle for the world to see.

Share this...FacebookTwitter“U.K. Energy Secretary Attacks Climate Skeptics Before Bill Vote” is the headline at Bloomberg here.
U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Davey will make his strongest attack yet on climate change skeptics he accuses of purveying a what he calls a ‘seductive’ and’dangerous’ message that global warming has stopped.”

Sir Clueless Ed
Davey insists that global warming hasn’t stopped. Yet, a number of prominent warmist scientists don’t agree with the fear-stoking politician. Reader Jimbo sent me a list of comments from climate scientists acknowledging that the warming has stopped. Some of these scientists even recognised this years ago already.
Phil Jones saw it 8 years ago! Here’s Jimbo’s list:
5 July, 2005
“The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998. OK it has but it is only 7 years of data and it isn’t statistically significant…,” Dr. Phil Jones – CRU emails.
7 May, 2009
“No upward trend…has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried,” Dr. Phil Jones – CRU emails.
15 Aug 2009
“…This lack of overall warming is analogous to the period from 2002 to 2008 when decreasing solar irradiance also countered much of the anthropogenic warming…,” Dr. Judith L. Lean – Geophysical Research Letters.
19 November 2009
“At present, however, the warming is taking a break.[…] There can be no argument about that,” Dr. Mojib Latif – Spiegel.
19 November 2009
“It cannot be denied that this is one of the hottest issues in the scientific community. [….] We don’t really know why this stagnation is taking place at this point,” Dr. Jochem Marotzke – Spiegel.
13 February 2010
Phil Jones: “I’m a scientist trying to measure temperature. If I registered that the climate has been cooling I’d say so. But it hasn’t until recently – and then barely at all.”
BBC: “Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically-significant global warming?”
Phil Jones: “Yes, but only just.”
2010
“…The decade of 1999-2008 is still the warmest of the last 30 years, though the global temperature increment is near zero…,” Prof. Shaowu Wang et al – Advances in Climate Change Research.

2 June 2011
“…it has been unclear why global surface temperatures did not rise between 1998 and 2008...,” Dr Robert K. Kaufmann – PNAS.
18 September 2011
“There have been decades, such as 2000–2009, when the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series shows little increase or even a slightly negative trend1 (a hiatus period)…,” Dr. Gerald A. Meehl – Nature Climate Change.
14 October 2012
“We agree with Mr Rose that there has been only a very small amount of warming in the 21st Century. As stated in our response, this is 0.05 degrees Celsius since 1997 equivalent to 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade.” Source: metofficenews.wordpress.com/, Met Office Blog – Dave Britton (10:48:21) –
30 March 2013
“…the five-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade,” Dr. James Hansen – The Economist.
7 April 2013
“…Despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the Earth’s mean near-surface temperature paused its rise during the 2000–2010 period…,” Dr. Virginie Guemas – Nature Climate Change.
22 February 2013
“People have to question these things and science only thrives on the basis of questioning,” Dr. Rajendra Pachauri – The Australian.
27 May 2013 
“I note this last decade or so has been fairly flat,” Lord Stern (economist) – Telegraph.
Many are using the word “pause” or “break” to describe the recent trend because they refuse to believe their theory is failing before their eyes. But this is only the language of denial.
Even the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) admitted that the warming has stopped and are puzzled by it: “In the years leading up to the year 2000, the temperature curve rose very sharply. But since then it isn’t rising so, in fact it’s not rising at all, the curve. The average temperature has stagnated at a very high level – we sort of have a plateau, and that during a time when CO2 emissions have risen considerably.” (2013)
And even the prince of climate darkness himself, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber conceded in April that the “pause” may even continue another decade!
Many insist that it’s only a pause, and that temperature will resume climbing with abandon once the hidden heat comes out of hiding deep somewhere in the ocean. But that’s pure speculation with no data to back it up. Right now the atmospheric data and observations are clear:
WARMING HAS STOPPED.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s good to see that there are a few journalists who actually take journalism seriously and question what they are being told. One publication that has been doing a good job on this is Switzerland-based Weltwoche, which has written two pieces about the latest IPCC report. See here and here.
Photo: Alex Reichmuth, Weltwoche.
 Hat tip: Reader Kurt Arner
Now Weltwoche follows up with a commentary by veteran journalist Alex Reichmuth, titled: “The Perspiration of Fear” and Climate appearing in the print edition. In it he writes that the alarmist warnings of the IPCC have become a worn-out ritual, having little more than a bounce of a dead cat. Moreover, like all other environmental predictions of doom and gloom made in the past, man-made climate change will also be relegated to the dustbin of history.
IPCC has confused the public
Reichmuth writes that if anything, the climate scientists and the IPCC, in their desperate scramble to explain the unexpected changes in climate science, have been only successful in confusing the public. Last winter renowned climate institutes admitted the “climate pause” and the IPCC came under pressure to come up with an explanation for it. Climate change was no longer happening, the public was told, thus contradicting all the earlier claims of run-away warming that the IPCC had consistently preached for years and years. The science had been settled, but then it was not.  So what was the IPCC to do? Reichmuth:
Ultimately the IPCC decided that the pause could be explained as being unimportant.”
As Reichmuth describes it, the move by the IPCC resembled more a last-ditch effort to salvage the global warming scare. He writes:
Indeed only with great difficulty is the IPCC able to hide that it has a serious problem. […] If the thermometer remains stuck at its current level for a few more years, then all IPCC models calculations will become irrelevant and the basis for justifying CO2 reductions would be gone. So the IPCC decides to ignore the warming pause and claims that global warming continues and that man is responsible.”

And so the media and public get their cue to resume their panic. Few, however, are listening anymore.
In the 1980s dying forests refused to die
The call to resume the climate panic reminds Reichmuth of the 1980s forest die-off scare. Soon, because of man-made acid rain, the globe would become a barren wasteland, it was claimed – unless of course mankind stopped industry immediately. But the forests defied projections and refused to die. And as is the case today with CO2, authorities refused to acknowledge that reality and relentlessly insisted that the forest was indeed dying. Reichmuth writes, “It didn’t help. Just a few years later it become clear that the forests weren’t dying.”
Reichmuth writes that the IPCC is now threatened with the very same fate of irrelevance. Even worse the public is losing interest and few are heeding their cries of “wolf” anymore. Reichmuth points out that today only 39% of Germans (who for years had been relentlessly bombarded by dire predictions of a climate catastrophe and shielded from real dissenting views) are afraid of climate change  – that figure was 62% just seven years ago. The same trend holds for Switzerland. Reichmuth:
In 2007 the Swiss media databank reported 5200 articles that contained the word “climate change”. In 2009 the figure was down to 3700. This year at the end of September it was just over 1500. With the other environmental ‘hype stories’ a phase of declining interest was always followed by forgetting altogether”.
Scare goes from acid rains…to acid oceans
The environmentalists are on the move again to the next scare story. They went from population explosion in the 1960s, to global cooling in the 1970s, then to acid rain in the 1980s before moving on to global warming in the 1990s, and today they are gearing up to retrofit their freak show over to acid oceans.

Share this...FacebookTwitter“It was just a photo of Antarctica that we happened to have around and we were in a hurry.” This is surely the kind of answer you would get if you asked the climate propaganda-meisters at the AP and The Weather Channel about their choice of photo for their latest story.
Hat-tip: Reader ES.

They’ll insist that the photo used to illustrate the story of record cold in the Antarctic was just something random they had given little thought about and that they were in a hurry. What a joke…these guys and gals think they are soooooo clever. Boy, they sure almost fooled us.
Anyone with just an inkling of experience in journalism knows that words and picture are carefully chosen to effectively communicate a message. So you have to wonder why Borenstein or The Weather Channel used a photo of melting ice to illustrate the headline story of Antarctica setting a record cold temperature of -135.8°F. Hey, why not use a parched-land photo to illustrate the next flood story…or overweight people to depict starvation in Africa!
The answer is clear. Science journalist Seth Borenstein and the Weather Channel are infamous for their alarmist positions on global warming and have long been known for their glaring bias when reporting on the issue. It was hard enough for them to have to print words on the record cold temperatures, and so by golly they weren’t about to depict it with a photo. That would be asking too much. No, better to use the “1000 words” to stealthfully tell the other story – the one that contradicts Antarctic reality…and make damn sure that picture gets placed right smack at the top of the story, immediately after the headline, where no one can miss it.
With a little luck, the melting ice photo will be just enough to distract readers from what’s really going on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s citizens are less willing than ever to accept higher costs for green electricity. Enough is enough, they are now saying.
WDR German public television has a report at its website here on the results of an opinion survey conducted by polling institute Infratest dimap to find out if the public is willing to pay more for green electricity.
54% answered “no”.
That’s 6% more than a year earlier. The results are sobering when one considers how Germans pride themselves as being among the greenest people in the world. Only 41% said they would accept paying more. 3% said they were willing to pay more, but only if the price increase was kept under control.
In 2012 a total of 48% answered “no”.
Not surprisingly the willingness depended on income. 56% of the people with a higher net income said they would accept paying more. However, low income citizens were much less ready to accept higher prices for green electricity: 59% said they were not ready to pay more. What about people earning middle incomes? The ZDF-commissioned survey showed that these people reject green energy even more than the poorer ones: 62% said they would not accept higher prices.
Some years ago, Germans as a whole were convinced that something had to be done to “rescue the climate” and were much more open to paying higher prices for electricity. However the rapid increase in electricity prices over the last years, and hence correspondingly greater pain, has led the public to rethink. Also 5 consecutive unexpectedly harsh winters and the fact that the globe isn’t warming anymore also has had an impact.
As a whole German acceptance of renewable energy is waning rapidly. This also shows that Germans are less alarmed about the threats of climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German Der Spiegel has just come out with a piece called: The Myth of Climate Scepticism. You know all that scepticism you’ve been hearing about? Well, it never really existed. It was all just a myth, so says Der Spiegel.
You see, it’s all been disproven by a study coming out of Stanford. All those polls conducted earlier were simply misinterpreted! That’s right, there really isn’t any scepticism at all out there. It was all just a big miragee.
Climategate really has had no effect on what people think about climate change. In fact, there never really was a Climategate. The Oxbourgh report has proven that too.
Indeed last winter in Europe was actually very warm – the warmest we are allowed to remember. Didn’t we all go swimming in the Baltic Sea last February? Shit! A new study shows that too. Just ask Finland.
And weren’t all them potholes we had in the streets in March all caused by the blistering heat of last winter?
I guess all us sceptic bloggers have been just wasting all our time, and we really ought to stop blogging about all that scepticism. The Stanford report says so. Der Spiegel says so too.
A new reality is being manufactured and pulled over our eyes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAdd another to the list of absurd things claimed to be caused by global warming: Vessels getting trapped in unexpected sea ice!
This morning Switzerland’s online flagship daily NZZ here has a report on yesterday’s rescue of the Professor Chris Turney’s ill-fated Antarctic expedition. Once again we see naughty climatologist kids hiding behind mother media’s dress for protection.

Alvin Stone, media manager of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition and ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science blames global warming for vessel getting trapped in thick summertime sea ice. Photo: ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science.
Like many major western media outlets, the NZZ is well known for its biased, faith-based position when it comes to reporting on the man-made climate warming issue, often coming to the rescue of climate scientists whenever they find themselves in a jam. Turney’s expedition is no exception.
The article, written by Heidi Gmür, goes out of the way to defend Turney’s botched junket expedition, claiming that “passengers and crew on the ship were never in any immediate danger.”
The NZZ writes that it inquired directly with Alvin Stone, Media and Communications Manager at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales, to obtain more details about the expedition. According to Stone, except for the minor inconvenience of getting trapped in sea ice for nine days, the expedition was a success. The NZZ writes:
…the surprising turn of events that the expedition had taken didn’t hinder the scientists in finishing their work: ‘Fortunately the scientific measurements had been completed only hours before the vessel got stuck in ice’.”
The NZZ then looks at the massive internet and blog criticism that the debacle unleashed, characterizing it as “furious remarks and commentary from those who question climate warming“. The NZZ goes on to defend Turney’s expedition against the irony that his vessel got stuck in summertime sea ice and that the event starkly illustrates the myth of a warming Antarctic. The NZZ writes (my emphasis):

Wrongfully so, Alvin Stone claimed upon inquiry on Thursday. Moreover, indications are that it is precisely climate warming that led to the vessel’s awkward predicament. This is the ice in which the Shokalskiy got caught, so-called fast ice which had broken off from the continent years earlier, said Stone; moreover measurements show that there has been a decrease of precisely this kind of fast ice in the Antarctic – this in contrast to so-called sea ice that is created by the freezing of water around the continent.”
Blame all the thick vessel-trapping sea ice on climate warming. Can you believe it?
It’s also unclear whether the NZZ is telling readers untruths or if it is reporting out of plain ignorance. As ice on the continent grows, so would the rate of calving due to pressure.
Again we are being asked to accept that increased sea ice is a sign of climate warming, and the same goes for a decrease. This is not science – rather it very much appears as creative rationalization by those desperately clinging to doctrine.
The NZZ then informs that Turney suspects that the situation in the Commonwealth Bay, where the Shokalskiy got stuck, “has changed dynamically as three years earlier a spectacular collision between an ice berg with the Mertz Glacier took place.”
Now we see Turney is blaming his vessel getting stuck on climate warming. It couldn’t possibly get more desperate than that, nor more embarrassing for the institution of academics. I wonder if he intends to sue the fossil fuel industry for the millions in damages incurred by the expedition so far.
In reaction to the NZZ article, a vast majority of readers leaving comment are responding with outrage. Climate science crazy train has gone off the rails.
Finlly the NZZ writes that vessel owner will have to bear the costs of the rescue, citing international maritime law. The owner is reported to be the Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute of Russia. That will be interesting to watch, especially given the latest revelations discussed here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year the media were overflowing with reports about how a “super El Niño” was shaping up and that it could be a powerful one, so powerful in fact that it would make 2015 “very likely to become the hottest year on record by far.” Read for example posts by noted climate end-of-world theorists/cheerleaders Joe Romm, Andrew Freedman, Stefan Rahmstorf, Live Science…
Today German blog site Die kalte Sonn here brings us up to speed on the “super El Niño” topic. To sum it up, once again predictions by leading “experts” have turned out to be completely wrong. Call it climate false-alarmism.
=============================
Australian Meteorological Institute sees little chance of an El Nino in 2014
By Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In mid May we reported here on developments in the tropical Pacific and directed attention to a possible El Niño, but left out the use of vocabulary such as “wreak”, “catastrophe” and “chaos”. But other German media outlets didn’t hold back:
Focus 24 February 2014: Global climate problem: Floods, hurricanes, droughts– this is what El Niño has done
FAZ am 12 May 2014: Warming and weather chaos: “El Niño” is taking off
Neue Zürcher Zeitung: «El Niño» could lead to chaos

And also one or the other followers of alarmism were hoping the heat from the ocean would finally end the observed global temperature stagnation.
Already in early June 2014 we warned here at our blog that the probability of an El Niño was less than what the models had been projecting. On 29 July 2014 the Australian Meteorological Institute announced at their website that the probability of an El Nino developing in the near future was greatly reduced:
EL NINO INDICATORS EASE
Despite the tropical Pacific Ocean being primed for an El Niño during much of the first half of 2014, the atmosphere above has largely failed to respond, and hence the ocean and atmosphere have not reinforced each other. As a result, some cooling has now taken place in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, with most of the key NINO regions returning to neutral values. While the chance of an El Niño in 2014 has clearly eased, warmer-than-average waters persist in parts of the tropical Pacific, and the (slight) majority of climate models suggest El Niño remains likely for spring. Hence the establishment of El Niño before year’s end cannot be ruled out. If an El Niño were to occur, it is increasingly unlikely to be a strong event. Given the current observations and the climate model outlooks, the Bureau’s ENSO Tracker has shifted to El Niño WATCH status. This means the chance of El Niño developing in 2014 is approximately 50%, which remains significant at double the normal likelihood of an event. El Niño is often associated with wide scale below-average rainfall over southern and eastern inland areas of Australia and above-average daytime temperatures over southern Australia. Similar impacts prior to the event becoming fully established regularly occur. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index has been below −0.4 °C (the negative IOD threshold) since mid-June, but needs to remain negative into August to be considered an event. Model outlooks suggest this negative IOD is likely to be short lived, and return to neutral by spring. A negative IOD pattern typically brings wetter winter and spring conditions to inland and southern Australia.
The “missing heat” (as the temperatures have stood still since the start of our new millennium and thus are no longer in harmony with the pretty models…) now also appears nowhere to be found in the water. Keep searching!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDepleted of scare stories, the global warming scare industry is desperate and has resorted to the latest scare tactic, claiming that warming leads to violent conflict.
The online Spiegel reports here on a study appearing in the journal Science by Solomon Hsiang et al claiming that global warming causes shortages in resources and thus increases the risk of war and violent conflict. The title of the Spiegel article: Global Warming: Study on Climate Change/War Met With Harsh Criticism.
In a nutshell, Spiegel discovers that the Hsiang study is hardly worth the paper it’s printed on.
The Hsiang study is even too absurd for the leftist Spiegel to swallow. In their study, Hsiang of the University of California in Berkeley and his team of researchers conclude:
We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each 1 standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%.”
Spiegel writes, according to Hsiang’s study, that should the global temperature rise by 2 – 4 sigma by 2050, then the frequency of violent conflicts could rise by 50% in some regions. No region is exempt, the scientists say.
“Gross errors and a distortive selection of data”
Even the left-leaning Spiegel finds that assessment suspicious, and so the renowned news weekly asked a number of top experts (most of them warmists) and discovered that they massively criticize Hsiang’s findings and flat out dismiss the study’s conclusions. Spiegel writes that the:
Experts accuse the authors of gross errors and a distortive selection of data.”
Data was cherry-picked
Jürgen Scheffran, Professor for Climate Change and Security at the University of Hamburg and his colleagues evaluated 27 studies and found that 16 were statistically significant in showing that global warming increased the probability of violent conflict, but that 11 studies said they could actually have the opposite effect, i.e. decrease the likelihood of violent conflict. Eight of these papers were not even considered by Hsiang and his colleagues, Scheffran says.

Moreover, Spiegel then writes that Oslo economist Halvard Buhaug is quoted saying that Hsiang and his team “ignored data”. Worse, Buhang says that the “authors used data that produced the strongest results“.
Alternative explanations were “wiped off the table”
Spiegel writes that Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, was also highly critical of Hsiang’s methodology, saying that alternative explanations were “wiped off the table” in order to give climate fluctuations maximum power as an explanation. Spiegel writes:
All in all, Marotzke says that he is ‘skeptical when it comes to the robustness of the results’.”
Authors confused weather with climate
Spiegel also reports that economics professor Richard Tol of the University of Sussex also has expressed “massive criticism” on the Hsiang paper, saying that the authors confused weather as climate. Spiegel writes:
Most of the Hsiang team’s evaluated studies had to do with weather phenomena, Tol believes. ‘Forecasts on the conflict-enhancing effect of future climate was therefore strongly exaggerated’.”
Hsiang et al ignores man’s ability to adapt
Finally Sociology Professor Nico Stehr and climate scientist Hans von Storch also told Spiegel that the worst error in the Hsiang study was that it ignores man’s ability to adapt to weather and climate events. Hans von Storch says “they falsely assume that man’s reaction to climatic stimulations would be unchanged“. Another expert reminds us that man will be even better equipped in the future to adapt to changes than we are today.
Readers will find a complete debunking of the preposterous notion that warmer climates lead to more violent conflict, read here.

By Ed Caryl
We do have the real world measurements of CO2, resolved to a monthly measurement with a well established seasonality that I will not describe here. We also know fairly accurately how much carbon we are injecting into the atmosphere from fossil sources.

Figure 1 is a plot of annual fossil carbon emissions (green trace), the annual atmospheric carbon increase (red trace) computed from Mauna Loa CO2 figures, and emissions minus the ocean and biosphere flux.
In Figure 1, the blue trace (fossil carbon emissions with all the biospheric carbon uptake subtracted) should equal the red trace, and in the long term average (pink trace), it comes close, so our simple model is reflecting the real world in that half the carbon emissions are being taken up by the ocean and the biosphere. The other half is contributing to the atmospheric CO2 increase. The difference between the pink and the green curves in 1977 is about 2.5 Gigatons and is increasing at an ever faster rate. The current difference is about 5 Gigatons. An increasing amount of CO2 is disappearing into the biosphere.
The part that remains is called the “air-borne fraction”. If this part is charted as a percentage you get a plot that looks like this (from James Hansen’s paper here. His Figure 3, is my Figure 2. Hansen’s caption is quoted.

Figure 2: Hansen’s Figure 3 “Fossil fuel CO2 emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed atmospheric CO2 increase to fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.”
I duplicated Hansen’s figure in the next figure, extended, and showed the un-averaged data. The heavy red trace is Hansen’s blue trace above:

Figure 3 above duplicates Hansen’s Figure 3 using the original data. The narrow red trace is the un-averaged computation. The black trace is a 2nd order polynomial trend line.
Note in Figure 3 that the airborne fraction of fossil-fuel carbon polynomial trend line goes to zero in about 30 years. When this happens, atmospheric CO2 will stop increasing. This roughly agrees with the atmospheric CO2 increase ceasing in mid-century as found in the previous article.

The cement industry consumes about 2 to 3% of the world’s energy and emits more than 5% of manmade CO2, approximately 3 to 4 times more than air traffic.
Not only does the process involve the mining of limestone as the raw material, but also includes transport, handling, processing in rotary kilns, stocking and distribution.
Conventional Cement Production Process
The Celitement® process was developed by KIT researchers and uses new chemical processes during the curing of concrete, according to Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, President of the Helmholtz Association, to which KIT is a member.
Beginning in 2011, the pilot plant will deliver about 100 kilograms per day. By 2014 an industrial plant will be put into operation and have the capacity to produce 30,000 tons per year. The target is to bring an environmentally friendly, energy-saving product to market as soon as possible.
More information is available at celitement.com here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace is back in the media, right where it likes to be. This is what brings in the donations. But this time they are not finding the headlines quite to their liking as 30 of its members are now being accused of piracy by Russian authorities. Piracy? You mean the peaceful and angelic Greenpeace activists may have criminally behaved like pirates?
Greenpeace is arguing that the piracy charge is nonsense. Piracy, after all, “involves weapons and taking control of another vessel” and that isn’t what the activists were trying to do, at least that’s what the mother of a detained Greenpeace activist is claiming.
Al Jazeera writes: “Several activists scaled the oil platform in the Barents Sea to denounce Russia’s plans to drill in the pristine Arctic.”
Unfortunately for the activists, Greenpeace has a long history of taking the law into its own hands and putting other people’s lives in real danger. Many of their actions do involve real violence. Today Ottawa Citizen.com quotes the mother of one of the protesters: “Nicole Paul said her son has travelled the globe the last seven years to defend his ideals and that he once spent a night in prison in Scotland before being released without charge.” No doubt from that the kid probably learned he can get away with mischief simply by fancying himself as a hero who’s rescuing the world.
Russia throws the book at world-saving activists
I have my doubts about the Greenpeace activists being peaceful. My guess is that plenty of video footage was taken during the whole publicity-seeking stunt. And now that the Russian authorities have reviewed all the material, they’ve decided to throw the book at the Greenpeace out-of-control brats. One of the protesters was a Russian free-lance photographer, according to news reports.
Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said the charges are being laid against those “whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience.” The media also portray the activists as innocent and peaceful protesters, obviously relying solely on Greenpeace statements and not bothering to really check the story.
About three years ago I wrote a piece on Greenpeace violence. What happened in the Arctic waters just seems to fit an all-too-familiar pattern. This time they picked the wrong people to mess with.
Greenpeace has a history of seeking violent confrontation
What follows are some examples and videos of “peaceful” Greenpeace action. Now imagine if the Tea Party or climate skeptics behaved like that.
First let’s recall how a leading Greenpeace official made threats directed at global warming skeptics. Prison Planet writes (my emphasis):
An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda, while ominously threatening climate skeptics, ‘we know where you live.'”
Next is a video of a Greenpeace ship “peacefully” ramming a Japanese vessel:

Next is an angry and threatening Greenpeace-brainwashed kid, trained to hate those who have a different opinion:

Poor kid will probably have to spend a lifetime in therapy.
Next is Greenpeace resisting arrest in Rotterdam:

Here’s Greenpeace trying to breach security at a G8 meeting. In this fracas some “peaceful” activists were injured:

Also here’s another “peaceful” activist injured by French fishermen, who obviously had become fed up with being harassed:

Just some examples. There are many more out there for sure.
Sure people have the right to protest, but not to put yourself above the law and illegally, and at times dangerously, violate other people’s space.  There are civilized ways of protest.
Greenpeace activists do behave very much like pirates at times, and they do put other people’s lives in very real danger.
Of course their target is not to capture and steal property, rather it is to capture attention – lots of it. The real cash flows in once their on-board filmmakers cut and edit all the raw footage and get it out to the media and television for cash-generating publicity.
What was Greenpeace management thinking sending a group of young, naïve protesters up to the Russian Arctic? Are they using them as pawns for generating cash and publicity? Seems to me that Greenpeace has lots of questions to answer.
If you have a link to a clip of “peaceful” Greenpeace planet rescuers, do post it!

Share this...FacebookTwitterMaverick meteorologist Pier Corbyn at his site here has issued a statement on the rescue of Professor Turkey and his global warming boatpeople.
As the story unfolds, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Turney’s preparation was really not quite up to standard, to put it kindly. I wrote about this at length 3 days ago here.
Funny how he made sure to have top journalists from the top media outlets right on the spot, yet couldn’t be bothered to seek out competent weather forecasting services. Eventually the expedition ended up relying on help from “denier” meteorologists. Oh the irony.
And as Anthony Watts now mentions here, it’s clear that they really did not charter the most adequate of vessels. Also it seems that communication with the Russian crew was a bit impaired by a language barrier. Did anything go right?
Piers writes:
The Ice will weaken as winds change in WeatherAction’s next big circulation change which is around ~17JAN so maybe by 20th or so they could have another go at getting the ship(s) out. We base this estimate on the fact that the world weather system is just that – a world system. Major changes in the NH circulation and Jet stream have correspondences in the SH. [Follow reports from our New Zealand & Australian subscribers and you can see that]. Subscribers to WeatherAction Eu /Br+Ir or USA will have noticed major changes in circulation through 17-20th and I estimate it is 80% likely this also means DIFFERENT winds in Antarctica which should do the business.
Of course when this happens the Warmist liars in BBC and the intellectually strained Independent, Guardian and New York Times will doubtless say the wind change is a sign of their lost Global Warming cause being redeemed.
I urge all who support evidence-based science and accountable policies THIS YEAR to give these fraudsters, spongers and thieves NO QUARTER WHATSOEVER. We have to make 2014 so uncomforable for them and their lie machine that they would wish they could return to the sanctuary of an ice-bound ship or a Russian jail to escape the wrath of the people who are now suffering – and some dieing – under rising fuel charges and hiked food prices and taxes which are a direct consequence of the insane policies these green parasites have foisted upon the world”.
Finally, I just get a kick out of the way Turney keeps insisting that weather down there is unpredictable and so none of it is his fault. Yet the guy turns right around and has the next person believing he can tell us what the climate will be in the year 2100!

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote 2 posts on the renewable energies folly in Germany, see here and here.
Now the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) confirms the mess with a press release and survey results of businesses and industries. The survey (see right) shows that energy prices and supply risks are threatening the ability of many German industrial companies to compete, and that many are now gearing up to move their operations to friendlier foreign locations.
Renewable energies are leading to higher prices, unreliable supply, less competitiveness and widespread job loss
In total, some 2400 companies of all sizes, sectors, and regions were surveyed throughout the country.
“Only a small share of the companies see more opportunities than risks,” reported Eric Schweitzer, President of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. Most companies view renewable energies skeptically because of rising energy prices and fears with respect to the reliability of the energy supply.
Most of the companies see renewable energies more as a burden than a bonus. More than half of the industrial companies surveyed view renewable energies as hampering their competitiveness. The DIHK survey also says that 25% of the industrial companies are now active in some way in moving their operations to foreign countries. Three percent have already done so, 8% are currently in the process of doing so, and 14% are planning to do so. In a nutshell, renewable energies have made Germany a less attractive place for industry.

This is especially true in the energy-intensive chemical industry. For example natural gas prices are almost 70% cheaper in the USA – thanks to shale gas.
Energy prices on the rise, supply reliability in question
The DIHK report states that electricity prices in Germany are especially high and that 50% of the companies say that the importance of energy prices has increased over the last 12 months. Every tenth company is now attempting to pass the higher energy costs along to their customers.
The survey also shows that many companies are worried about the reliability of the electricity supply. Twenty one percent say that the importance of disruptions in power supply has gone up. 12% of the companies surveyed saw a power outage lasting more than 3 minutes and one out every six companies saw a power outage of less than three minutes. Ten percent of the companies incurred costs because of electric power or gas supply disruptions. Already a single short power outage can cause a company 10,000 euros in losses.

Share this...FacebookTwitter35 scientists from 12 countries led by the Leibniz Institute for Ocean Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR) studied for 6 weeks the effects that increasing CO2 concentrations would have on life in the sea. Read here (German).Human emissions of CO2 lead to higher concentrations in sea water and thus lower its pH value. The study is led by marine biologist Prof. Dr. Ulf Riebesell, who explains:
This phenomenon can lead to drastic changes in maritime life systems. Calcium forming organisms like shellfish, snails and microscopic plankton, which are at the base of the food chain, react sensitively to ocean acidification.
Cold water  can absorb more CO2, and so ocean acidification will occur earlier and more intensely in the Arctic than in other regions, according to the IFM-GEOMAR press release.
Scientists anchored nine 17-meter long tubes in the Kongsfjord of northwest Spitzbergen. These jumbo sized test tubes held a water column of 50 cubic meters and were subjected to various concentrations of CO2.
According to Dr. Riebesell:
We simulated conditions that we expect to see 20, 40 and 60 years in the future.

As the scientists took measurements and samples daily, they observed changes in the seawater and the enclosed life systems. The simulated ocean acidification led to unexpectedly large changes in the production activity of the plankton with considerable impacts on the release of climate-relevant gases and in turnover rates of important elements in the seawater.
The scientists took measurements and samples for 6 weeks. Every day 300 liters of water were removed from the large tubes and analysed. With over 60 measurement parameters and tens of thousands values, this will be the most comprehensive experimental data set ever taken in studying ocean acidification, according to the press release. Dr. Riebesell says:
We expect to make a great jump in the research of ocean acidification.
Currently the large tubes are now being removed from Kongsfjord. For this job, the scientists are getting assistance from Greenpeace, who have put their vessel ESPERANZA at their disposal.
Greenpeace is on expedition in the Arctic this summer to record the life systems on the sea floor of the Arctic Ocean for the first time and to continue work on glacier melt in Greenland. (Yeah right! Science by an environmental activist group – I wonder what kind of results they’ll come up with!)
The Greenpeace ESPERANZA vessel is expected to arrive in Kiel on July 22. The ship will be open to the public at the IFM-GEOMAR pier on July 24-25.
EPOCA (European Project on Ocean Acidification) started the project in May 2008. The project involves more than 100 scientists from 27 institutes from 9 countries (and Greenpeace). The project will be 4 years long and is funded by the European Commission.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat Are We Doing To The Biosphere?
By Ed Caryl
There have been many worried papers and articles on tropical rainforest destruction (including by this author), and this destruction’s effect on CO2 sequestration. There are countervailing forces in play, however. Tropical forests cut for “slash and burn” farming are typically allowed to return to the forest state as the soil is depleted after a few years of harvesting crops, unless the ground is reserved for permanent pasture. The crops themselves replace part of the biosphere. In temperate forests, clear-cuts are replanted. Forest regeneration typically takes from 40 to over a hundred years, but the average is probably about 80 years. An evergreen forest destroyed by forest fire that I helped replant as a Boy Scout 60 years ago was recently harvested and replanted again. Another plot in the same area that was clear-cut 90 years ago, was naturally re-seeded and harvested again three years ago. Most of that carbon was sequestered into homes.
CO2 fertilization improves biosphere growth. Present CO2 levels are more than 100 ppm over pre-industrial levels, and are allowing about 15% increased primary biosphere production. The problem is that both forest destruction and CO2 fertilization are not known very accurately for the biome as a whole. The guesses in the literature range from 1.5 Gigatons to 4 Gigatons carbon annually released to the atmosphere from forest destruction, and 10 to 20% CO2 fertilization. In the following figures, 2 Gigatons forest destruction to date and 1 Gigaton future destruction have been used, and 15% CO2 fertilization for 100 ppm CO2 increase.

Figure 1 is a plot of total biosphere assuming 2 Gigatons forest annually burned to date and 1 Gigaton burned annually in the future, along with 15% fertilization for each 100 ppm CO2 increase, plus a 1.25% annual regrowth of tropical forests.

The result is a declining biosphere where destruction exceeds growth until about 1966. But then there is an increasing growth rate since as the CO2 level increases, where growth exceeds destruction.
The amount of carbon taken up by the oceans is another factor that is not known very accurately. The current “consensus” guess is that the ocean takes up half of the carbon that is emitted by man’s activities. Here is my attempt to chart land and ocean CO2 flux over time from 1946 to the present and projecting into the future to 2075. The resulting atmospheric CO2 is also plotted. The historical fossil carbon emissions are plotted, with a future increase to 10 Gigatons annually. The land numbers are based on the data used in notrickszone.com/ and the above 15% figure for CO2 fertilization. The ocean CO2 uptake numbers are based on this paper and are linearly projected into the future.

Figure 2 is a plot of CO2 (blue curve, left scale), biosphere carbon uptake with CO2 fertilization (red curve, right scale), and ocean carbon uptake (green line, right scale).
If the world holds fossil carbon emissions to less than 10 Gigatons per year, CO2 should never exceed 430 ppm, and will begin falling after mid-century. If we put modest effort into tropical forest preservation, and replanting temperate forests, along with other biome improvements, we might stop the increase at an even lower figure. We don’t need to reduce carbon emissions. We will never see CO2 doubling. No one has projected the impact of CO2 biosphere fertilization on the CO2 increase in the atmosphere. NASA has projected that CO2 will be 550 to 800 ppm by the end of the century. This could only be true if the biosphere is severely damaged by forest destruction.

In 2012 former President of the Maldive Islands Mohamed Nasheed said: “If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be underwater in seven years.”
With such a prediction and recalling how the latest UN IPCC report boosted its estimate of sea level rise, and taking into account that CO2 emissions show no signs of abating, you would think the Maldives would be the last place developers would build anything. The Maldives are barely more than a meter above sea level on average.
But according to veteran Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke at his Die Welt blog here in a piece titled Tourist industry does not believe in the downfall of the Maldives, this is not at all the case. Kulke writes:

30 additional new luxury class hotel complexes are planned for the next 6 to 10 years, never mind the countless smaller homes. Tourism is currently increasing 20% annually.”
Whatever is really behind all the rising sea level scare stories, huge commercial investors are obviously dismissing them. If anything, these scare stories are providing lots of publicity for the islands’ tourism industry. Already more than 1 million tourists are flocking to the islands every year and, Kulke writes, Nasheed says the islands can handle many more.
Kulke writes, “Environmental protection in the Maldives is practically non-existent.”
Moreover he suggests that the climate change issue is being used by Nasheed to generate lots of cash:
At the big climate conferences – and supposedly also in Warsaw in two weeks – Nasheed meets regularly to milk cash compensation from climate-sinning countries on behalf of his country and other island nations (on which environmental protection plays a subordinate role). Almost the entire supply of energy on the island for the millions of tourists flowing in, by the way, is produced by diesel generators, this while Nasheed continues to press for foreign countries to switch over to renewable energies.”

Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele wants to legalize incest. Photo credit: Sargoth, public domain.
There are some things they want to legalize: incest for example. According to FOCUS magazine here:
The incest ruling by the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (EGMR) against a 34-year old man from Leipzig has led to controversial reactions. Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele reacted the most sharply. He wants to permit sex between siblings and other close relatives, and is requesting doing away with the incest laws. It is an isolated relic of another time when adultery was punishable, which we also have done away with,’ Ströbele told news network N24. Paragraph 173 no longer matches ‘in this time of enlightened opinion on marriage and family. It must be abolished’.”
Wonderful. Now Germans can stop driving on weekends, stay home and keep intimate company with family members. Now you know just how wacky German greens can be.
It should be noted that the early Green Party in Germany in the 1980s also supported advocates of pedophilia, this according to the leftist TAZ here, quoting Spiegel.
‘The pedophile past – In the 80s, the Green Party supposedly financially supported a working group that called for the legalization of sex with children. Cohn-Bendit: ‘That was mainstream’.'”
Amazingly, the Greens today are what often passes in the West as “progressive”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy last 2 posts have been about this topic, where a one-sided international conference for journalists will provide their marching orders for the months ahead. Normally such a conference if organised privately would be legitimate.
But the shocking thing about this conference is that it is organised by a German publically funded radio and TV broadcaster – Deutsche Welle, and therefore the total absence of neutrality and objectivity is a violation of Germany’s Consitutional Law.
The conference calls on journalists to:
1. Abandon neutrality and to report only on the single extreme view of AGW calamity.
2. Abandon professional procedures in journalism. See here and here.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany has sent a Letter of Protest (in German) to Deutsche Welle demanding that they refrain from this misuse of public funds and cancel the one-sided conference which clearly excludes any views that disagree with the extreme gloom and doom world downfall view. It requests that it too obey the law, like every other citizen or guest in the country is rightfully expected to do. Currently the letter is only in German.
Hopefully EIKE will post a copy in English.
In the meantime, we urge readers to write or call Deutsche Welle at:
Phone: +49 228 429-2008 (Ask for a Mr Bettermann)
Fax: +49 228 429-2140

They speak excellent English. Please politely ask him why they are violating the law by presenting only one radical side of the issue, and insist they present all the other wide range of views from other scientists and experts on climate change. Why is it they are presenting only the worst of scenarios? Is it really their job to emotionalise the audience with the aim to get them to think in one particular way?
Let us know what they tell you. I left my name and number with the secreatry, who said Mr Bettermann will call me back.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Bundesnachrichtendienst (Federal Intelligence Service) BND is Germany’s version of the CIA, and it has just released a report on the threat posed by climate change and CO2 emissions. It claims that the conflicts of the future will be over CO2 emission allowances!

Image: Cropped from photo by A.Fiedler, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license.
First, readers need to be cautioned that such reports issued by intelligence agencies (always eagerly released to the public) often times have very little to do with reality, and most are designed to manipulate public sentiment. Those familiar with climate science will quickly put the report on par with reports of Martians preparing to attack the planet. In simple terms: it’s a lot of BS.
Germany’s leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) wrote yesterday a piece titled: Bundesnachrichtendienst sounds the alarm on climate change.
The good news: “Energy supply security no longer an issue”
Before getting into the scary CO2 climate conflict details from the BND report, there are some very good news – news we’ve suspected all along – especially amid all the reports on the discoveries of huge shale gas and crude oil reserves popping up almost daily. The BND report writes (my emphasis):
The conflicts of the future now revolve around carbon dioxide. Energy supply security is no longer an issue.”
The bad news however, so projects the BND, is that future conflicts will be about “who will be able to emit how much CO2.” Countries will be fighting over CO2 emission rights, BND scenarios suggest.
Now that there are no longer any natural developments left to fight over like water, oil, food, living space, natural resources, etc., the German government seems to be creating an artificial global conflict by designating CO2 as a pollutant that mustn’t be emitted. Too bad the BND never bothered reading the latest scientific literature on global temperatures and CO2 climate sensitivity. Expect the German government to eagerly use the BND report to justify more intervention into private lives.
Wikipedia writes that the “BND acts as an early warning system to alert the German government to threats to German interests from abroad. It depends heavily on wiretapping and electronic surveillance of international communications.” Somehow from these activities the BND has concluded that climate is the worst threat.

Green Party officials immediately seized on the report. The FAZ quotes Green Party chief Simone Peter: “Whoever keeps using fossil energies such as coal and oil, accelerates climate change, exacerbates international conflicts, and is messing with the coming generations of the future.“
The BND writes that the problem is that emerging countries will emit increasing amounts of CO2 as they develop, thus quickly exhausting the world’s emission allowances, which in turn will lead to international conflict.
Another problem is America’s booming shale gas revolution, which will act to depress prices worldwide. Consequently renewable sources will have no chance to compete. Cheap US coal is already being exported by the USA to Germany, throwing sand into the gears of the country’s renewable energy transition. The FAZ adds:
And the earlier worries of oil and gas reserves running out are gone. [..] The reason for this is new technologies that have made it possible to exploit previously in accessible reserves.”
Again the historical pattern of false doomsday scenarios is once again clear and confirmed…developing, unexpected technology repeatedly canceling earlier seemingly certain projections of disaster. Five years ago few people believed the world had enough reserves of fossil fuels to last 50 years. That was one of the argumentation pillars used by green energy proponents. Today we find ourselves practically drowning in fossil fuels. Prices are in a free fall.
Any journalist investing 30 minutes time researching earlier projections made by intelligence services globally will find most of them at one time or another issued doomsday reports of “fossil fuels running out and global conflict erupting as a result.”
Expert: CO2 conflict claims are “pure comedy”
These earlier doomsday projections probably were legitimate at the time, as it did appear reserves were in decline: The data suggested this to some extent. But the latest projections that CO2 will lead to conflict are not even based on data and observations, but on bogus computer scenarios. They are utterly baseless.
In an email, geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning called the BND’s latest CO2 conflict claims “pure comedy” and “brain-washing”.
The BND also states that in the future there is going to be a “CO2 disposal problem” because CO2 concentrations are expected to reach the critical 450 ppm level, a level that activist scientists say may cause the climate “to tip”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week in Potsdam, Germany, the First World Conference on Climate Impact took place.
No matter how many studies come out contradicting the models of catastrophic climate change, the Potsdam and IPCC scientists insist catastrophic warming is a fact and can only be averted by implementing drastic CO2 reduction measures, i.e. transforming society. The catastrophe is just postponed a bit.

In the press conference video above at the 7:19 mark, Connie Hedegaard tells the press concerning the Otto et al paper:
“I was in my home city of Copenhagen last weekend, and there last week some knowledge came out that maaaaybe things are slowing down a bit because, yes, we have past the 400 parts per million mark, but did the temperature really follow suit? And I think the interesting things is that there is something in the nature of man that makes us grasp this so that you immediately find the headlines: “Climate Change is Postponed” or we can wait to do something, you know that sort of headlines. Although if you sort of came down to the details you could see that no,l it just meant that maaaaybe we have a bit more time… .
In other words she is telling everyone not to believe any news suggesting that climate warming has slowed down. Don’t believe the observations, just believe the models.
Schellnhuber was hardly able to hide that he too is puzzled by the 15 years of no warming and the claims of the Otto et al paper. At the 34:08 mark of the video above, a journalist asks Schellnhuber about the temperature stagnation we’ve seen over the last 15 years and the Otto et al paper:
First of all, this was a sort of a Leserbrief, a correspondence to Nature Geoscience, which was done actually by former members of the Potsdam Institute who work at Oxford University. And if you read it carefully, it tells you 2 different things: The first one is the long-term projections of the climate models are confirmed actually. So it means the big picture is intact. The second is, just taking into account what you said, what happened over the last 15 years, since the big El Nino event in 1998 actually. There has been a slowing of global warming at the Earth’s surface, yes, which is very important. Taking that into account, simply the projections, again projections, for the next two, three decades have been revised a little bit to the lower side, actually. So we see no surprise because everybody can see that we didn’t have a steeper rise in global temperature in the last decade as we had in the previous decade. But if you now analyze this, why does it happen? And there has been a number of important scientific papers on that recently, which did not make it to the media, is people had analyzed where does the heat go to? Because if you look at satellite data at the top of the atmosphere, you clearly see we have an excess of energy, more energy going into our planetary system then what is going out. This is the first law of thermodynamics: energy is conserved. So it has to go somewhere. So now obviously most of it is now going into the deeper layers of the ocean. And you have to appreciate that the top three meters of the ocean globally contain as much heat as the entire atmosphere. So things are going deeper down. Then of course you will have a certain slowing down of what is happening at the surface. So what we probably see now is a sort of saturation of deeper ocean layers, …but once the job is done, the surface will warm once again, and even faster actually later on. This is by the way accompanied by, if you look at the data as I did this morning, you had many more La Nina events, that is the cool phase in the Pacific, in the last decade then you had in the previous decade. This is in a sense precisely in a La Nina event the oceans more or less take up heat while in an El Nino event they release heat. So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature. So again, what does this tell us? It simply tells us that global warming does not happen in a linear way where every year the same amount of warming happens. Nobody was actually expecting that, we always talk about natural variability. So I’m as a physicist not at all surprised and there’s no reason, unfortunately, there’s no reason to call off global warming.”

Unbelievably, Schellnhuber says nobody was really expecting a steady rise (er, except 44 modellers and lots of other scientists), and so is indirectly saying that nobody really expected the models to get the short-term (first 20 years) right.
What Schellnhuber is saying can be summed up as follows: We are not surprised that the short-term (up to 2025) models have been wrong, but we are sure the long-term models are right.

Schellnhuber claims he is not at all surpised by the 15-year absence of warming. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.
The only conclusion that one can draw is: If the models up to 2025 are completely wrong, then the long-term models (2100 or 2200) are complete rubbish.
Looking at Roy Spencer’s chart above, the models expected a 0.5° rise from 1998 to 2013 – but we’ve gotten nothing. And the models expect another 0.5°C rise from 2017 to 2022. That too no longer looks tenable given the current ocean and solar cycles.
Schellnhuber’s only option now is to act like he is not surprised about the models getting the first 15 years completely wrong, and to insist the heat will come later, but with more strength.
Haven’t we heard that kind of talk before from slippery investment bankers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday the online Daily Mail echos what NTZ wrote 5 days ago, and also brings in an expert to confirm exactly what I was suspecting: Prof Chris Turney may have been reckless in his planning for a major expedition. Although combining tourism and science on a cruise ship may seem like a creative idea on the surface, it is not a good idea in the world’s harshest environment.
The Daily Mail writes:
An experienced polar explorer has accused climate scientists who hired a ship now trapped in Antarctic ice of endangering passengers and crew – by carrying out the expedition ‘on the cheap’.”
Later adding:
Robert Headland, of Cambridge University’s Scott Polar Research Institute, blamed the team for not investing in a ship suitable to the ‘easily predictable’ sea ice.”
Mr Headland, who has completed successful missions to where the ship was going, said: ‘The expedition was hopelessly optimistic in trying to carry out this mission on the cheap and has needlessly taken many risks.”
Good to see the major media doing their job in digging into this debacle. And it looks some are even reading NoTricksZone once in awhile.
And now that an expert like Robert Headland is calling the expedition “needlessly risky”, Turney is finding himself standing on increasingly thin ice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Russia’s German edition of Ria Novosti online, a Russian WWF climate expert claims that the recent “climate anomaly” of winter weather and a hurricane strength storm occurring in southern France in late spring confirms the anthropogenic impact on global climate. http://de.rian.ru/science/20100505/126183713.html.
Ria Novosti interviewed WWF climate expert Alexei Kokorin, who says:
The situation in France fits right in with the theory of anthropogenic climate change. We are now able to observe marginal climate change. Temperature and precipitation fluctuations have increased 10-fold. In Russia the number of dangerous hydrometeorological events have increased 10-fold in the last 15 years.
Nothing you wouldn’t expect from an alarmist. But then he adds (original German):
Wir können in Zukunft mit einem etwas wärmeren und zugleich weitaus instabileren Klima, darunter mit Schneefällen im Mai und Juli, rechnen.
In English:
In the future we [Russians] can anticipate a somewhat warmer and much more unstable climate, including snowfalls in May and July.
Warmer and yet snowfalls in the summertime? You gotta be kidding.
But do expect the IPCC to cite them in its upcoming 5th assessment report. The chances of being cited are quite good – Alexei Kokorin is the director of the Russian WWF Climate Protection Program.  In the past the IPCC has had no qualms about citing such sources.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke of the German blog Die Welt has a report claiming that how sea levels are not rising anywhere near as fast as climate science alarmists are claiming.
First Kulke reminds readers that measuring sea level is no easy task because, depending on the location, sea levels can vary by several decimeters – even up to a meter. Much of the science relies on complex statistical computations and the results depend on the methods used.
Kulke writes:
A scientific study by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has closely examined data from the measurement stations located mainly at the coasts and reached the result that sea level rise calculations were exaggerated upwards. In the study Michael Beenstock and colleagues reached the result that sea level rise on a global average is only 1 millimeter and that by the end of the century it will rise only 10 centimeters; only 1/3 of the stations showed a detectable rise, 61% showed no movement and 4% showed a drop.”
Overall 1 mm/year is about 67% less than what Jason TOPEX satellite altimetry is showing (3 mm). If anything, Beenstock’s result indicate a sea level rise slowdown.

Beenstock is not the only scientist who has found sea level rise is much slower than believed. Kulke writes that other peer-reviewed studies reach similar conclusions. For example Nicola Scafetta of Duke University (see full paper here) shows that sea level is subject to 60-year cycles and concludes that the human impact on sea level is too small and is statistically insignificant.
Unfortunately these finding were not available in time to be included in the last IPCC assessment report AR5. Kulke writes that this was also “the case for other studies which recently showed that Co2’s effect on the global climate is present, but is however greatly exaggerated“.
Kulke cites another study that shows that the extraction of groundwater has caused close to half of the sea level rise of the last years. Kulke concludes that there’s no indication that sea level is rising faster because of man-made CO2 and that we are facing the fall of civilization, even if “scientists like Stefan Rahmstorf tirelessly paint pictures of man-made apocalypses on the wall“.
The studies cited here tell us one thing: Whoever tells us that there is a consensus among scientists that climate change is happening faster and faster, is just plain wrong.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline CO2 Handel here reports that German news weekly FOCUS recently commissioned a survey on how Germans view climate change: According to the survey of 1004 persons, conducted by Emnid at the end of May:
63% of Germans think that warnings of future global warming are justified.
28% feel they are exaggerated.
8% think that the dangers of warmer climates are not dramatic enough.
By contrast, in the year 2007 FOCUS found that 85% of Germans found global warming to be a “threat”.
Online The Epoch Times also reports on the FOCUS survey, writing that:
Germans are predominantly calm about global warming: In an Emnid-survey for FOCUS news magazine, 35% said that the climate in their region had not gotten warmer over the last 10 years. 46% felt that the climate had been more or less unchanged. 17 percent said they thought that temperatures over the last ten years went up.”
What can we draw from the results? After 10 years of climate catastrophe media bombardment, a vast majority of Germans see no warming or little climate change.
The FOCUS site itself only has a short summary of the survey results. The title: Germans Not Perceiving Climate Warming.
A majority of Germans believe that global warming is taking place, yet most of them are unable to perceive it. It’s strange that a news magazine like FOCUS would pay Germany’s top polling organization for such a survey, and then remain quiet about the results.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman sceptic site Readers Edition has a good story today about the Alpha Ventus windpark, Germany’s first offshore windpark, which officially started up with much media hype last April. It’s made up of twelve 5-MW turbines. It’s a €250-million pilot project that serves to spearhead several other coastal power plants in the coming years.The wind farm is operated by energy companies Eon, Vattenfall and EWE and is supposed to provide power to about 50,000 households. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists because of its threat to migratory birds.
But for now environmental problems are the least of concerns for the project’s backers. Technical problems have hampered the project from the get-go. Today it has been reported that two of the twelve wind turbines had been shut down for weeks.
Originally estimated to cost €189 million, the Alpha Ventus park has been plagued by cost overruns and delays.  In late summer and autumn of 2008, bad weather made installation of the first 6 turbines impossible.  Then the equipment to install the monster turbines was not available. Next there were major problems with the transformer facilities.
A few weeks ago the temperature of the bearings in the turbine made by Areva Multibrid was too high and thus they had to be taken out of operation. Now the turbines have to be removed from their 500+ ft. high towers and the bearings have to be replaced. Repair works will take weeks and extend into late summer. It’s still unclear if the other four of the Multibrid turbines have a problem. The remaining 6 turbines are made by Repower and are reported to be running smoothly. There are no reports on how high the costs for the troublesome dismantling and repair works will run.
And if that weren’t bad enough, the construction works on the massive Bard Offshore 1 commercial windparks have been delayed as a 300-foot foundation column crashed onto the construction ship Wind Lift 1 three weeks ago. Now other turbines have to be thoroughly inspected. The Bard project foresees the installation of 320 five-megawatt class turbines over the coming years. The cost for the first 80 Bard turbines alone is climbing far beyond original estimates. First they were estimated to cost over €500 million. Now it’s estimated costs will exceed a billion euros. German online newspaper projects the costs will even reach €1.2 billion.
The promoters of the offshore projects cannot say they weren’t warned of the risks of installing windparks in the North Sea’s harsh conditions. The Nysted offshore windpark and Horns Rev park in Denmark are examples, and have struggled with big problems. For example in 2007 a transformer malfunction occurred at Nysted just 4 years after being commissioned, causing a months-long shutdown. At the Horns Rev windpark there were problems with the turbines only 2 years after they had gone into operation. World leading turbine manufacturer Vestas had to remove all 80 turbines, haul them onshore and perform extensive repairs. Luckily these turbines were only of the smaller 2 to 2.3-MW class, and so much easier to do repair works. Repairs and maintenance on the 5-MW monsters will be much tougher and expensive.
But as long as windpark companies continue to have the full backing of wasteful governments, costs won’t matter.
UPDATE, 17 June 2010: I’m delighted to see one of my favourites, James Delingpole, has featured this post at his blog here. Thanks!

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy local newspaper Osnabruecker Zeitung (OZ) has an online story here about the dramatic ARCTIC sea ice melting in June. This is typical of German media climate reporting. The introduction reads:
Arctic sea ice last month melted faster than in any June since measurements have been taken, since 1979. 88,000 square kilometers of white area disappeared daily, reports the American NSIDC in Boulder.
The OZ peppers the story with dramatic details like:
Also the extent of northern ice this June reached a record low average of 10.87 million sq km. According to the NSIDC, this ice area is 190,000 sq km below the previous June record set in 2006.
The air temperature is very high, and the ice continues to melt very rapidly.
The OZ then brings in the WWF as experts and polar bears for emotion to round out the propoganda effect.
So let’s stop right here. This is why it’s so important to keep an eye on the 11 Climatic Indicators which I have provided on the right side of my homepage. They allow a sure way to quickly debunk all media climate propaganda. The 11 Climatic Indicators are links to updated charts and graphs that treehuggers and alarmists don’t want you to see.

ARCTIC TEMPERATURES
Have Arctic temps really been very high lately? Judge for yourself, see below, or click here:
Arctic temps
Clearly the chart shows that since the start of June temperatures in the Arctic over 80°N latitude have not been “very high”. Most of the melting ice was ice that had formed in the cold late spring at lower latitudes.
CURRENT MELTING RATE
What about the claim that Arctic ice is melting rapidly now. Again, look at the chart under my 11 Climatic Indicators as follows or, click here (Sea Ice Arctic IJIS).
Arctic Sea Ice
If you look closely you’ll observe a few things: 1) There was a record high ice extent in April, 2) the ice indeed melted rapidly in May and June, but 3) the melting rate has slowed down considerably over the last 10 days, averaging only 59,000 sq km – something the media forgets to mention.
TOTAL GLOBAL SEA ICE
The media also forgot to mention that total global sea ice is dead-on normal, see next chart. They completely ignore Antarctica at the South Pole. Here’s where total sea ice stands now. It’s actually been increasing over the last few years.
Total sea ice, north and south poles
Now let’s take a look at what the sea ice in Antarctica alone is doing, see below or click here. Indeed Antarctic sea ice is near a record high!
Antarctic sea ice anomaly. Sea ice extent is far above average and trending upwards. 
Moreover, look at the trend (blue line which I eyeballed in) over the last 25 years or so. Have we heard any reports about that? Perhaps the journalists at the OZ ought to take a closer look.

The international conference, scheduled to take place in Bonn from June 21 till June 23, excludes all views that disagree with the extreme AGW gloom and doom, world downfall view.  However, because Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded institution, it is required by German Law to remain neutral and honest.
Instead, Deutsche Welle has decided on its own to abandon journalism and to resort to promoting one single extreme view on the topic of climate change, and to shut out the rest. It’s activism run amok.
One workshop is How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The workshop’s objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
This conference has infuriated a number of scientists and citizens. As a result EIKE has drafted and dispatched a letter of protest to Deutsche Welle. The letter states:

It certainly cannot be in the interest of a publicly financed broadcaster to put its own existence into question with a debate over its objectivity.
and
Enlightened thinking has always been at the centre of our culture, along with sceptical, critical and scrutinising thought. It is intolerable that, here in Germany, public funds are being illegally used under your supervision and under your responsibility to marginalise a large number persons (the majority!) who share a different opinion.

But that’s about to change, reports the German edition of the online Russian news service Ria Novosti here.Russian scientists say that the sun will soon come alive after having observed a total eclipse at Easter Island in the Pacific yesterday. They warn that magnetic storms could soon occur.
Dimitri Semyonov, who belongs to the team of observers, says the shape of the sun’s corona indicates an increase in solar activity, but cautions that the observed data still need to be evaluated. He adds:
 The sun is waking up.
Ria Novosti reports:
Dr. Sergei Bogatchov of the Laboratory for Solar X-Ray Astronomy at the Lebedev Institute of Physics told Ria Novosti that the back side of the sun has probably just seen the highest level of activity since the start of the year.
Dr. Sergei Bogatchov says:
In seven to ten days this active area of the sun will reach a position that will enable charged particles to reach the earth. That’s going to impact the geomagnetic situation – may even lead to magnetic storms.
The following graphic shows the location where the solar eclipse was observed yesterday. Sorry it’s in German, but it’s still interesting to look at.
So, it looks like a Maunder Minimum type of solar lull may not happen after all. We ought to be thankful for that. The next one or two weeks will tell us more.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt appears that now even Professor Chris Turney admits blaming his expedition mishap on global warming was an astronomical stretch after all.
Yesterday I reported here, quoting flagship Swiss daily (NZZ), that his communication director Alvin Stone blamed global warming for the vessel getting trapped in ice. The whole world laughed.
I couldn’t believe it myself so I wrote an e-mail to Stone asking if they really believed this.
Stone answered circa 9 hours later:
Dear Pierre,
That is not quite the quote that I gave.
This is my understanding from talking to Chris and other glaciologists.

The 120km long ice berg B09B that is grounded in Commonwealth Bay broke away from the continent three years ago, very likely as a result of climate change.
B09B collided with the Mertz Glacier, smashing a large ice tongue that released the ice into that area.
It was a mix of this ice that was blown across the path of the Shokalskiy, which led to it being trapped and explains why much of the ice surrounding the ship is old ice.

Chris discusses the situation in a blog entry, here.

I believe you are probably aware of a number of papers this year that show land ice on Antarctica is in decline and that only seasonal sea ice has been expanding, likely due to the increase in westerly winds and potentially because of the decrease in salinity.
Thanks for your interest.”
Here we see that the major backpedalling had already begun. This morning in a piece where the Guardian and Turney attempt to defend the expedition, Turney retracts the claim altogether, sort of: In the Guardian article he writes (my emphasis):
Let’s be clear. Us becoming locked in ice was not caused by climate change. Instead it seems to have been an aftershock of the arrival of iceberg B09B which triggered a massive reconfiguration of sea ice in the area.”
Note here how Turney continues to blame “unforeseen” events for the vessel’s fate, when it is now clear from postings and records that they new well in advance there was ice out there and a storm was approaching. His excuses may be anough for the average Guardian reader, but I don’t expect they’ll hold much water elsewhere.
Expect bogus commissions to clear Turney
I suspect in the end that a commission, even two or three of them, are going to be set up to investigate the whole thing. Then after some months each will issue an authoritive report claiming that although Turney could have done things better, all in all no serious violations were committed and he’ll be cleared. Of course everyone will know that the commissions were bogus. And later, with no one watching, future expeditions will be carried out under far stricter oversight.
In the end the taxpayer will pick up the rescue tab and legal expenses.

The English-language Russian RT News here writes about the new all-time record low for the planet Earth as well, but states that it is also being disputed by one Russian scientist. The RT (my emphasis):
American researchers from the US National Snow and Ice Data  Centre (NSIDC) prepare to make public satellite temperature measurements data which maintains that a record temperature of -91.2°C was registered in Antarctica on August 3, 2004, near the  Japanese Dome Fuji station, situated on the Valkyrie Dome in the heart of the White Continent.”
According to the RT article, the NSIDC will present the report for the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in San Francisco. The report states that the “winters of 1997, 2001, 2003, and 2004 showed several temperature minima below -90°C.”
As mentioned, the record is being challenged by at least one scientist. The head of the Russian Antarctic Expedition’s logistics center Vyacheslav Martyanov disputes the readings, and told RIA Novosti that: “It is incorrect to declare a temperature record based on satellite data,” adding:
Air temperature is measured according to standards, at the height of 2 meters above the ground, like they do at meteorological observing stations, therefore recognizing a  temperature measured by remote sensing is unrealistic.”

Whether the new temperature record gets officially recognized or not is not sure at this point. But one thing is clear: Things aren’t warming up at all in Antarctica!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite the hundreds of billions of dollars diverted into CO2 reduction, man-made CO2 gas emissions continue to rise unabated globally. The latest UNEP report says it sees very little chance of the world reaching CO2 reductions targets.
The ever widening gap
Yesterday the online Die Welt here reported that UNEP is warning of “a growing gap” between the target and actual emissions. The UN claims that only by meeting the CO2 reduction targets will it be possible to keep the planet from warming by 2°C by the years 2100. Alarmist scientists say 2°C of warming over pre-industrial level could send the planet over a tipping point. However the science underpinning those claims is very much in dispute.
The UN claims that it is necessary for the global population to reduce its CO2 emissions from 50.1 gigatonnes annually today to just 44 gigstonnes by 2020. However, rather than going down, CO2 emissions are growing, and doing so quite strongly despite the massive investments in renewable energies. Spiegel here writes that CO2 emissions are actually accelerating.
Die Welt adds that at the current rate of increase, CO2 emissions will rise to 59 gigatonnes by 2020, or more than 34% above the target of 44 gigatonnes. Therefore the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars on Co2 reduction has had no effect.

Shift moves to agriculture culprit
What’s remarkable about the latest UN report is that it shifts the focus to a new climate villain: agriculture. UNEP is now claiming that agriculture produces too much Co2 and that new agricultural techniques could lead to savings of 4.4 gigatonnes. The potential here, they claim, is greater than the potential in the electricity sector, where a maximum of 3.9 gigatonnes can be saved. Large CO2 savings can also be achieved sustainable forestry management, the report says.
UNEP completely ignores 15-year temperature stagnation
Die Welt points out that the UNEP in its latest report ignored the 15-year warming stop altogether:

The debate on the stagnation in climate warming over the past 15 years and on man’s share in warming was completely ignored in the calculations by the UNEP: The scientists continued to argue within the established paradigm of a manmade climate change.”

The UNEP is obviously living on another planet and refuses to believe that the climate catastrophe is not happening.

The concentrated sunlight scorches parked cars, blisters paintwork, cracks tiles, singes fabric, and is reported to even have ignited fires.
Clearly architect Vinoly goofed and failed to take into account the impacts of the building’s shape and orientation. But it’s not like he couldn’t have know about such problems. The Mail writes that another building he designed in Las Vegas, the Vdara Hotel, built in 2010, had the very same problems.

Spiegel writes and quotes Vinoly:
The developers did not take the sun enough into account. But: When he came to London years ago, it wasn’t as sunny. Now there are lots of sunny days. ‘So, shouldn’t we also make climate change responsible, or not?'”
Right. What was the architect thinking? He knew it was a mistake in Las Vegas. Did he think that London would never see sunny days in the summertime? You only need one sunny day and the problem is there.
Vinoly’s sorrowful attempt to dodge responsibility is typical today. Nobody is ever responsible for big screw-ups or gross incompetence anymore. Now it’s always climate change. Mankind is collectively responsible for the foul-ups of sloppy and incompetent individuals.
Granted Vinoly doesn’t blame it all on climate, which any competent architect learns to take into account from day one. According to Spiegel he concedes:
We’ve made lots of mistakes with the building. We will address the problems.”
Hooray. Vinoly appears to have learned that the sun indeed does shine in London after all.

1) Hans von Storch at Klimazwiebel comments of the WBGU.
Hans is known for his direct speech and speaking his mind. Yet, I found a comment he left at his blog even more direct than usual – about the German FDP party blocking the re-assignment of the WBGU, the advisory board of alarmist “experts” who are tasked to advise the German government of matters concerning the environment and climate.
For me the WBGU is essentially a club of alarmists that is suffering from planet-rescue fantasies and a chronic overstepping of competence. Actually it is a good thing that a political group is for once requesting a reining in.”
Unfortunately the latest news is that the FDP party has ended its resistance to the re-appointment of the WBGU members. So they will still be there, yet no one says they will have to be listened to.
2. Stefan Rahmstorf concedes natural factors (at least when it cools).
At the German RealClimate sister-blog klimalounge, bedwetter in-chief Stefan Rahmstorf boasts about the Klimalounge site getting a million hits since coming online 5 years ago (NTZ reached that mark after just a year, and WUWT gets three times that every month). Anyway, while boasting about that, Rahmstorf brings up the global temperature stagnation, telling readers not to worry, the climate catastrophe is coming. For those who question this:

The answer is still the same as in 2008: no, global warming is unfortunately not over and has not slowed down significantly, the deviations from a steady, continuous warming trend are part of the usual short-term fluctuations, which are caused by, among other things, El Niño, ocean circulation fluctuations and solar activity.”
(My emphasis) At least he finally admits natural factors, though only for the short-term. So you see how simple it is for them.  When it cools, it’s because of natural factors. But when it warms it’s all because of CO2. Not surprisingly, this is how they’ve rigged their models. And so you warmists can all go on wetting your beds without worry.
3. Joe Bastardi on climate science at his Saturday Summary of the 4th of May (see video, right side bar). The warmists he says are only making excuses when they start changing the terminology:
You folks have to understand that it’s been getting cold in a lot of places and that it hasn’t been reported on. And of course, the value, if you want to call it that, in this climate fight that is going on, the value is that it’s waking some people up in America. They’re saying, ‘Where in the heck did this come from?’ And again, I don’t think you can change the playing field from global warming to climate change. You know, you just change the terminology – you know you’re wrong about what is going on, and you’re giving us excuses. So that’s what I think. Get used to it because that’s what nature does.”
4. Neil Cavuto in a Fox News interview with Joe Bastardi on Al Gore’s latest unhinged performance in Hollywood, at the end of the clip:
He’s nuts, by the way. I just think he’s nuts. But that’s just me.”

The German edition of the Financial Times has a story today on wind energy’s latest debacle in Germany: treehugger-bureaucrats. In one corner we have environmentalists demanding the installation of wind energy to avert a climate catastrophe, and in another corner you have environmentalist bureaucrats stopping windparks in order to protect local wildlife.
Green offshore windparks clash with green German bureaucrats.
Meanwhile, energy prices for the consumer are going through the roof.
The Federal Office For Nature Protection (no joke!), responsible for approving offshore wind parks,  is having second thoughts about the foundations used for offshore windmills because “they pose a threat to wildlife”.  As a result that have stopped approving any additional windmills until further notice. This is confirmed by a letter to the FT from the Federal Office For Nature Protection.
The FT reports that 2 types of foundations are used for anchoring offshore wind generators. In one type, huge piles are rammed into the seabed by 15,000 blows delivered by a heavy pile driver. But the noise this work creates is disturbing the whales, and they are leaving their living areas for quieter places. That has to stop.
The second type of foundation is the so-called gravity foundation made of concrete. But the heavy concrete pads end up sealing the seabed and thus damage crabs and mussels. Can’t have that either. According to the letter:
Gravity type foundations cannot be considered as an alternative foundation because they are installed on the seabed using  acoustic ramming. A better way would be to use a foundation that is installed using some sort of boring process.

Technically this is possible, but there exists no company to do it. Meanwhile investors and the numerous companies that are currently installing offshore windparks in Germany’s North Sea now face heavy losses. The FT writes:
Severely impacted are companies that are deep into the approval process. This is because the approval processes are lengthy and costs millions of euros, as they entail comprehensive expert attestations and environmental impact studies.
Needless to say, offshore windpark companies are outraged. And all companies that are in the approval process have left out the question on foundations – fearing not being granted approval. But without a foundation, it’s impossible to put up a windmill – thus every approval becomes worthless.
Lawmakers are also outraged by the delays. Yet, the Federal Office For Nature Protection insists it is not imposing a moratorium of any kind, and that rather it is only trying to find a way to bring offshore wind energy production in harmony with nature.
According one German Parliamentarian, Torsten Staffeldt.
The Federal Office For Nature Protection is drifting into absurdity. If we continue like this, we’ll never reach our goals for expanding offshore wind energy.
Well I’d hate to disappoint Herr Staffeldt, but that point has long been reached and surpassed. Worse yet – the treehugger wars are just beginning.

Spiegel’s print edition cover story today features Snowden and Obama on the front cover:

This week’s SPIEGEL cover: “Alone against America. Edward Snowden: hero and traitor. How the US intelligence agency spied in Germany”.
Latest must read Spiegel story today here: www.spiegel.de/html. 
I keep hearing people like John Kerry, Diane Feinstein, Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, etc. say that espionage is all part of the game, and are all trying to put the full blame for the debacle on a single man: Edward Snowden. Few of us are so naïve to believe that. The truth is that US intelligence has run totally amok. It is no longer even able to distinguish friend from foe.

One essential part of successful intelligence is at least first having the cerebral intelligence of being able to distinguish between your friends and foes. If you can’t do that, then soon everyone starts appearing like a foe, and everything runs amok very quickly. Perhaps Snowden felt this was the case, and could not take what he saw anymore. Intelligence operations are supposed to be aimed at real foes like Iran, North Korea, China, or Venezuela and Cuba. Maybe competitors like India, Russia… But if you start treating all your allies like foes, and go to town on them like the Stasi, then you are going to find yourself alone and isolated real fast. That unfortunately has now happened.
If it had not been Snowden, then it would soon have been someone else. If Washington was trying to shed its image that it is corrupt to the core, it didn’t do itself any favors with this affair. A country that spies on its own citizens and allies on such a massive scale needs to ask itself some serious questions.
In the 20+ years I find myself in Europe, I cannot recall any situation where trust between Europe and America has disintegrated so much and so rapidly. Europeans, once in love with Obama, are struggling and unable come to terms with the new Obama reality – that they are dealing with a real Chicago-style politician, and not with a well-intentioned community organizer.
Spiegel presents here has a list of 17 quotes made by German leaders in response to the affair.
So how much damage has Snowden done? Perhaps the question that needs to be asked is: How much damage has America’s strayed foreign policy done to itself? One of the virtues of a real patriot is to have the courage to stand up and to point out the faults of your country and to demand that they be fixed. Patriots are what America needs more than ever today, and not the sort who cluelessly wave the stars and stripes on cue.
Washington needs a serious house-cleaning. Denying and scapegoating a lowly contractor is not going to work this time.

http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2010/05/us-carbon-dioxide-emissions-fell-record-7-last-year/1
While part of the reductions came from energy conservation and more efficient technology, a big part came from the nasty economic slowdown.
Heck, at the current rate the USA will be practically carbon-free by 2020! Not everybody thinks there’s been an economic price and pain. Take Joe Romm for example. The USA Today writes:

Romm says the CO2 decrease, larger than previously expected by the EIA, shows that such reductions are possible without harming the U.S. economy.

Say what! 10% of the workforce is idle and 20% is under-employed. Just how stupid can one possibly be?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the notion “the science is settled” isn’t dead by now, then it just got a few more 30D spikes pounded into its coffin. Make no mistake about it: THERE IS NO CONSENSUS.
Der Spiegel’s Axel Bojanowski has just published online a 7-part piece on the climate war between scientists.  http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,688175-7,00.html
I don’t have much time today, got some appointents and I have to take the bread home too. Here’s the general gist of it.
Part 1:  Bojanowski lays out the battlefield and describes how climate scientists got tangled up in conflict.
Part 2: Most scientists are somewhere in between the extreme views. There’s a lot of uncertainty concerning the consequences of AGW. Big Industry launched a sceptic campaign in the 1980s and 1990s.
Part 3: Climate scientists countered, and fiddled with activist environmental groups. Both pressured industry and politicians. Many German scientists fell in line with environmental groups. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK and the Max Planck Institute drew up position papers together with the WWF.
Part 4: The battle in the media. US media was balanced and alllowed Big Oil funded sceptic views to proliferate. Klaus Hasselmann blames the media for over-dramatizing climate scenarios. Sceptic scientists in Germany became marginalised. Media outlets reporting sceptic views came under fire from scientists and activists.

Part 5: Fighting in the trenches. Alarmist scientists were reluctant to reveal their work, fearing it would only be attacked. Their studies had great ranges of uncertainty, and this made it easy for sceptics to take them apart. Then Mann  put out the hockey stick curve, which turned out to be flawed. Briffa put out his curve in 1999, but warned of uncertainty, and wrote that the MWP was probably as warm as today. Mann’s stick was featured in TAR 2001, Btriffa’s curve not. Concerning hiding data sociologists believe that the damage is done. Without transparency, science is not credible.
Part 6: E-mails show Mann and Jones had too much influence on the journals, and acted as gatekeepers. Mann denies it, saying the journal editors decide the peer-reviewers. Conflicts in science are not unusual, but in climate science it has reached an extreme.
Part 7: Climate science is so politicised that it is now difficult to conduct. Mistakes were made in placing too much emphasis on consensus. Silvio Funtowicz sums it up: “Scientists who promise simple answers are best ignored”.

I wish I had more time to go into it more deeply – but I don’t right now. Hope to write more about this later.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the global temperature has not risen in 15 years, part of the German media is actually beginning to take a serious new look at the possibility of global cooling and are slowly questioning the alarmist assertion that the sun played little or no role in the climate change of the last 100 years.

Yesterday the online FOCUS magazine published a piece called: Scientists fear new little ice age.
What’s a bit surprising is that the article is written by typically warmist journalist Michael Odenwald.
In the FOCUS article Odenwald describes how solar cycle 24 started unusually slowly in 2008 and quotes David Hathaway of NASA: “It is not only the weakest cycle in the modern space age, but also the weakest in the last 100 years.“ Odenwald also tells readers how solar sunspots are driven by the solar dynamo, which also generates the sun’s magnetic field.
In Part 2 of Odenwald’s article, he points out that historical records suggest solar cycle 25 will very likely also be a weak cycle. In the recent past, alarmist climate scientists dismissed, or even scoffed at, the notion that weak solar activity could have a significant impact on the earth’s climate – a dismissal that flies in the face of a mountain of data showing a strong correlation between weak solar activity and cold periods.

Recently a growing number of scientists from the USA, Europe, and Russia have been warning of a potential approaching cooling period because of low solar activity, and the media are now taking more notice than ever. FOCUS quotes Hathaway’s colleague Matthew Penn of the National Solar Observatory (translated from the German):
Should this trend continue, then solar cycle 25 will have hardly any sunspots at all. Then we could reach a new Maunder Minimum.”
The Maunder Minimum, Odenwald writes, was an especially cold period during the Little Ice Age.
Still, Odenwald is hardly ready to give up believing that CO2 a major player in the overall climate scheme, insisting that a new grand solar minimum would not necessarily cool the planet. Odenwald cites that the Little Ice Age may in fact have been precipitated by a “giant volcanic eruption that supposedly occurred in the year 1257 in Indonesia“.
But to his credit, Odenwald concedes that solar activity could very well have a major role on climate:
It’s possible that the reduced solar activity may bring some good, which the scientists gathered at the AAS conference indicated. It could counter the global warming that man is causing with the continuously rising emissions of climate-impacting greenhouse gases.
Good to see responsible German warmist journalists opening their minds to alternatives theories. Give it a few more years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site today writes about a new peer-reviewed study that shows that the Arctic is not warming quickly after all. For years alarmist scientists have told us that nowhere is warming happening faster than in the Arctic. Wrong again!

A study by an international team of scientists led by Germany’s Potsdam-based Alfred Wegener Institute was published in September in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. It’s a temperature reconstruction from the Siberian Arctic. By examining pollen, the scientists were able to determine the July temperatures for the transition zone between tundra and taiga over the last 12,000, i.e. the Holocene.
Now here’s the surprising result (quoted from the study’s abstract) my emphasis:
A climate reconstruction based on fossil pollen spectra from a Siberian Arctic lake sediment core spanning the Holocene yielded cold conditions for the Late Glacial (1–2 °C below present T-July). Warm and moist conditions were reconstructed for the early to mid Holocene (2 °C higher T-July than present), and climate conditions similar to modern ones were reconstructed for the last 4000 years. In conclusion, our modern pollen data set fills the gap of existing regional calibration sets with regard to the underrepresented Siberian tundra–taiga transition zone. The Holocene climate reconstruction indicates that the temperature deviation from modern values was only moderate despite the assumed Arctic sensitivity to present climate change.”
Die kalte Sonne site’s reaction:
One exciting result: Today’s summer temperatures are hardly different from the values of the last several thousand years and are even below those for much of the post ice-age time. The otherwise publicity hungry AWI unfortunately failed to even publish a press release on this remarkable new study.”

Joe just calls it weather (that happens to be well below what the climate models predicted). My bet is that it has something to do with solar cycles.

But in mid July, something happened unexpectedly: the North Pole saw one of its coolest summers since instrumental records have been kept, and sea ice melt also slowed down markedly, proceeding at a rate we normally only see only in the second half of August, see chart that follows:

Suddenly all the salivating among the alarmists has turned to gloom – no Arctic meltdown on which to feast upon this year.
But hope is still holding out among the alarmists as there is a chance some freak storm or something will scatter the sea ice and send the 2013 curve downwards to a near record low. But if 2013’s current course continues, then it will wind up closer 2005-2006 levels. That of course would be a major setback for the alarmists, who then would have to search elsewhere for disaster stories this fall. The next 10 – 14 days will be decisive.
Already we are getting close to being a solid 1 million sq. km over last year, as to most datasets. The DMI even shows us approaching 1.5 million sq. km over last year. If that keeps up, it’s going to be painful for the alarmists.
As far as Antarctica is concerned, record highs are being recorded daily. Here we have absolute dead silence from the media and purveyors of gloom.
As the chances for an Arctic sea ice melt disaster fade with each passing day, expect the focus of the alarmists to increasingly shift to the hurricane season.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Irish Examiner here reports that Robert Devoy, professor of physical geography at UCC, says the greater wind speeds and flooding in Ireland of the last few days are “what we would expect from a warming climate caused by the impact of humans”.
However, he cites no substantial data to support that. In fact global data on accumulated cyclone energy, hurricanes, droughts, tornadoes, etc. all show no trend, or in many cases even a decline. Yet Devoy claims:
We have had some exceptional events in recent years and these exceptional events are becoming more common.”
How Devoy can claim this is a mystery. Even the alarmist IPCC in its last fifth assessment report stated that there is no link between severe weather and humans.
Prof Devoy also says that “weather patterns had gone outside the natural pattern of weather events and this is a continuation of that” and that “the nature of these storms is changing.”
The nature of storms? What exactly? Prof. Devoy is hiding behind vague statements and doesn’t provide a single measure. He is just saying that storms are different. Scientifically his comments are a dustbin overflowing with rubbish.
He also claims sea level near Dublin is accelerating, claiming that “in the past decade, a regional rise of 2mm-3mm has been recorded by satellite stations and tidal gauges.”
We don’t know if Prof Devoy and the Irish Examiner are oblivious to history, or if they are maliciously trying to mislead the public. Why look only at the past decade? The available data for Dublin from the NOAA go back 80 years and shows very little overall sea level rise trend. Moreover, ten years is by far too short a time to infer a trend.

This leads us to wonder why Professor Devoy would make so many outlandish claims. We suppose it has something to do with money. The Irish Examiner quotes Devoy at the end of the article:
He called for further investment in weather monitoring in this country so that scientists can better chart patterns.”
I think the weather is monitored just fine in Ireland with all the satellite and weather station data constantly being collected. What we need are scientists who are not too lazy to go back more than 10 years.
UPDATE: Ed Caryl has provided a link with an updated chart, now posted above. It appears that Professor Devoy’s Dublin sudden sea level rise came in a single year: 2001. In 2001, the gauge changed hands. More research on this could be most interesting.

Life is beginning to lose all meaning and purpose for some, as their religion collapses. For the AGW alarmists, it was so good despising and feeling superior to all the unenlightened flat-earthers and the rest of the planet-destroying humanity, and punishing them for their behaviour.
Sadly, the infliction of punishment is one primary element that makes the AGW religion so attractive for some, especially its leaders. In this religion it’s actually a virtue to seek ways to punish and control people instead of loving them. Those who join it are promised rescue, esteem and acceptance.

Inflicting punishment is a position of power. And when it comes to inflicting punishment, there’s an eerie thing about how people just queue up to do it – especially if there’s a social mechanism in place to reward it. Psychological experiments have confirmed this time and again, just as a recent French experiment on inflicting torture on pleading victims shows:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHRq7oMnZQ
http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1972981,00.html
In the experiment, those who inflicted the punishment eventually came back to their senses and were later horrified to see how they had been duped into taking it to such extremes. They even had to be psychologically debriefed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday here I wrote about some comments made by Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber at a press release  last week on the first day of the World Conference on Climate Impacts in Potsdam Germany.

Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber confirms that oceans are a major factor in global temperature. Image source: www.climate-impacts-2013.org/.
While answering a question from a journalist about why global temperatures have stagnated over the last 15 years, Schellnhuber blamed the cool oceans for absorbing the heat that everyone is missing and searching for.
At around the 35-minute mark of the video, Prof. Schellnhuber tells us (my emphasis):
So what we probably see now is a sort of saturation of deeper ocean layers, …but once the job is done, the surface will warm once again, and even faster actually later on. This is by the way accompanied by, if you look at the data as I did this morning, you had many more La Nina events, that is the cool phase in the Pacific, in the last decade then you had in the previous decade. This is in a sense precisely in a La Nina event the oceans more or less take up heat while in an El Nino event they release heat. So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature.”
First it is clear that Prof. Schellnhuber doesn’t really know where the heat is, and is only assuming that it is hidden at the “deeper layers of the ocean“.
Secondly, and more importantly, he tells us that La Ninas take up heat from the atmosphere and that El Ninos release heat into the atmosphere. “So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature.” Clearly he is telling us that the oceans indeed do have a big impact on global temperature. So why hasn’t he included this in the models?
If Schellnhuber agrees that El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) leave their mark on global temperature, then he cannot possibly deny that the PDO and AMO phases do the same. In cool phases they remove heat from the atmosphere, in warm phases they release heat into the atmosphere. Schellnhuber acknowledges this. We’ve been measuring this for decades now.
The following chart shows the PDO:

The positive PDO released gargantuan amounts of heat into the atmosphere from 1980 – 2006, a time when global temperature jumped 0.5°C. Chart source: Giorgiogp2, data from jisao.washington.edu/PDO.latest, the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
The chart above clearly shows that the massive equatorial Pacific was releasing mega-heat into the atmosphere from 1980 – 2007. This heats up the global atmosphere just as Prof. Schellnhuber describes above. The question is what factor got all the credit for that heat? The PIK and many warmist scientists wrongly assigned it to CO2. But now that the globe has stopped warming, they are blaming the oceans.
Why was the heat released by the 1980 – 2007 positive PDO not properly assigned in the climate models? No wonder the models look like jokes today. Schellnhuber needed the PDO heat in order to make CO2 look bad. It was the only way to come up with a dangerously high CO2 climate sensitivity.
The same applies with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO):

AMO climbed from 1975 until 2000. Public domain chart
So the heat that was added by the positive PDO and AMO since 1980 has to be subtracted from the CO2 account. If you do that, then you will see that CO2 climate sensitivity is far less, and is no longer a problem.
Good to see that Schellnhuber acknowledges the AMO and PDO. All he has to do now is build them into his climate models.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke at German national daily Die Welt has a commentary at his Die Welt blog about the upcoming IPCC report. IPCC: Discuss or Ignore Warming Stop. He starts:
According to News Service Bloomberg it is currently being discussed whether to mention the ongoing 15-year pause in global in the 5th Assessment Report“ (AR 5) to be released in late September, or if perhaps it would be better to simply ignore it in order not to unnecessarily supply so-called ‘climate skeptics’ with ammunition.”
Alarmist scientists find themselves in a dilemma and aren’t sure what to do. They are eager to argue back against skeptics’s claims that the warming has stopped, yet are petrified of bringing it up. Some are saying it is simply best to ignore the pause in warming. But Kulke writes:
The attempt to keep the warming pause out of the ongoing discussion surrounding the upcoming AR 5 would be ridiculous. Semantic and formal splitting of hairs would not stick because it cannot be denied that also the In-group of the IPCC scientists have acknowledged the stop in warming – at least internally – and view this as the biggest problem. It is “a travesty” they cannot explain. That quote comes from Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the 2001 and 2007 IPCC reports. […] In the meantime Trenberth suspects, according to his models, that the missing heat is somewhere in the depths of the oceans. But this is not certain in any way; perhaps it just doesn’t exist.”

Kulke then adds that the IPCC also will not be able to downgrade the warming pause to a mere weather event and claim that it has nothing to do with overall climate:
Just because it is still in the range of weather and has not yet reached the time span that one uses to discuss climate, ignoring the warming stop would also be outrageous because it would mean you couldn’t mention any weather event that is not at least 30 years long.”
If increasing frequency is the test that alarmists like to use, then it’s tough to get more frequent than every year over the last 15. You can’t claim a team is in a slump-trend after it has just won 15 games in a row.
For the alarmist IPCC scientists, it’s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t situation. Bringing up the warming stop surely will be ammo for the skeptics, but so would ignoring it. Should we feel sorry for them? I don’t think so. It was they themselves who maneuvered their own jewels between the jaws of the vise. Last chance to pull them out!

Share this...FacebookTwitterYet another vessel has been trapped by global warming sea ice! The Xue Long icebreaker has sent out a distress call.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has released another press release:
Aurora Australis on standby as a precautionary measure 
Xue Long notified AMSA at 1pm AEDT this afternoon it has concerns about their ability to move through heavy ice in the area. The Aurora Australis has been placed on standby by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s (AMSA) Rescue Coordination Centre Australia (RCC Australia) to remain in open water in the area as a precautionary measure. The Xue Long has advised RCC Australia that it will attempt to manoeuvre through the ice when tidal conditions are most suitable during the early hours of 4 January 2014.
There is no immediate danger to personnel on board the Xue Long.”
Prof Turney tweets he is gutted by the news. I guess he can’t believe that climate warming could trap so many ships in sea ice. His communication manager just announced that all the new sea ice is caused by global warming, see my last post.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online FOCUS news magazine has a short article on the results of a climate survey conducted by the ISOE – Institute for Social-Ecological Research of people in the German financial capital of Frankfurt.
The institute surveyed 1000 people on climate and facets of their day-to-day lifestyles like mobility and eating. Although 90% said the climate issue is important – the concern pretty much stops there. FOCUS gives the results:
Only one in five persons behave in an exemplary manner when it comes to climate protection. Another 40% have a lifestyle that is at least in parts climate friendly. Every third person held the opinion that the risks of climate have been portrayed as exaggerated.”
That “one third” is certainly a a figure that is much higher than say 5 years ago.
Another way of looking at it: 73% of the people surveyed in Frankfurt aren’t really up to changing their lives that much to protect the climate. That means they’ll accept minor policy changes, but nothing major that would disrupt their comfortable lives. It also suggests that all the hyping and exaggerating hurt the cause more than it helped.
The overall tone that I gather from the FOCUS piece is one of disappointment over the fact more people aren’t willing to do more. In the press release, project leader Immanuel Stieß said that “there’s still plenty of room for more climate protection commitment.”

No frequency increase in North Sea storms in 150 years. Photo by a U.S. Army helicopter, Netherlands flood 1953. Public domain photo.
So are North Sea storms getting worse? Bojanowski (my emphasis):
Measurements of air pressure and wind since the middle of the 19th century show no increase in storms in the North Sea. The region over the last years has even been low with respect to wind. Although the year-to-year fluctuations are high, a trend in storm frequency is not detectable by scientists.”
The high frequency, Bojanowski writes, is only found in model projections. He writes:
For the future, climate models foresee a light increase in winter storms over the course of the century. The calculations, however, are in dispute.”
But don’t take the word of a Speigel science journalist. Also read what the German Weather Service says in my last post.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s an interesting story brought to my attention by Readers Edition: http://www.readers-edition.de/2010/04/30/mein-klimagerechtes-leben/. German ZDF television, Germany’s version of the Beeb, shows its viewers how to live if you want to reach Salvation. It’s in German but you can read this post and then easily follow the clip.
Bathing Belgian in rainwater
The ZDF clip starts with a Belgian man using a fitness bike to power his laptop. He buys only second-hand clothes, bathes in rainwater – fish and meat of course are taboo. He cooks using only low energy methods; that is he removes the pot from the stove as soon as it starts to boil and places it inside an insulated box which he covers with his second-hand rags. The trapped heat does the rest. In all he cut his energy consumption by 70%. Not only does he save a lot of CO2, he also saves a lot of money – so much in fact that he has been able to buy a new shiny piano!  (Just don’t ask how the piano is manufactured or shipped).
This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes…  The one-year no-consumption experiment in New York City
Scene change over to New York, the capital of consumption, epicentre of trash production. Meet Colin Beavan, whose website http://noimpactman.typepad.com/ tells you how you too can be an “extraordinary person”. He conducted an experiment: one year without consumption. See how he and his family do not take the elevator, preferring to climb 22 flights of stairs. They neither use a car nor the subway, preferring to risk their daughter’s life on bikes. They do not produce any trash. They have their own compost in their appartment (Wow! imagine if we all had composts in our homes). And take a look at their leg-powered washing machine.
Beavan says: We have to consume way way less

So why does Colin put him and his family through all the trouble? He says he wants to find out what’s possible. How much can we refrain from in modern living? Beavan wants radical change. He says it’s not about changing your consumption habits, it’s about consuming “way way less”. The first step in the one-year no-consumption project was to throw out all those energy guzzling applicance and all the chemical products, and to impose an absolute halt on shopping. That’s right – no shopping for one year.
Beavan the ecostar
His wife Michelle is an editor for Businessweek and admits she was a typical consumer (er, sinner), who just couldn’t live without the modern vice called consumerism. But it’s Beavan’s project and the family decided to go along cold turkey. They kicked off the project by throwing a “lights-out” party and using candles for illumination. Beavan, the no-impact man, has since become an eco-star. His message: “Everybody can and must do something”.  My question is: Why “must”?
No toilet paper
Colin’s family did not even use an air conditioner during New York’s hot sticky summer and no refrigerator. They didn’t even use toilet paper – it’s waste of resources!  Some of Michelle’s BusinessWeek colleagues refused to shake her hand. Hot water? Didn’t mention it. Beavan did have second thoughts during the one-year ordeal. Yet he looked at the bright side, like better nutrition and more time with the family. Many habits have remained since the one-year experiment ended. For example he now uses canning jars as glasses. Ironically he says pessimism is the obstacle to change. That’s funny, aren’t the tree-huggers the ones always telling us a Climate Armegeddon is coming? How does one develop his brand of optimism?
Buy Beavan’s DVD, today!
By the way you can purchase Beavan’s story on a plastic DVD.  http://www.noimpactdoc.com/index_m.php.  Just don’t ask how the DVDs are recorded, manufactured, shipped, played or disposed of.  In fact, don’t bloody ask how German ZDF produced and aired it’s stupid report on Beavan, Ms BusinessWeek and Mr Secondhand Rags.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s renewable energy feed-in act, the EEG, forces power grid operators to buy up all renewable energy produced in Germany and to feed all of it into the power grid, whether it is needed or not. The aim is to squeeze out the fossil fuel energy that’s fed in. The problem however is that wild, unpredictable fluctuations in the supply of wind and solar energy often lead to huge, uncontrollable grid overloads.
The print edition of the Handelsblatt described in a feature titled “Energy Madness” how the absurd Germany’s energy feed-in act has become. Hat-tip: Hans Labohm here. He quotes the Handelsblatt:  
For the green energy branch, Sunday June 16 was a special day to celebrate. The sun shone for hours and a strong northwest wind blew across Germany. At 2 p.m. solar panels were sizzling with power and the wind turbines up north were turning strongly. Green energy was being fed into the power grid to the tune of 29,600 megawatts, and so provided 61% of the power demand. Never before had Germany’s power supply been so green.
However, the employees of the power grid operators were far less inclined to celebrate. As is the case every Sunday, the demand for power was relatively small. And as mandated by the renewable energy feed-in act, they were required to somehow get all the solar and wind power to the consumers. After all, green power has the right of way in the power grid. This meant gas-fired power plants had to be shut down, and Holland, Czech Republic and Poland had to accept, against their will, the excess German solar and wind power.
Power customers in the industry were delighted with all the green power on June 16: They could consume as much power as they wanted – and were credited with cash for doing so. One chemical concern that was able to take in more power between 2 – 3 p.m. than thought, did not have to pay the usual 30 to 60 euros per megawatt-hour. No, instead the company got more than 100 euros. The important thing was to somehow get the power out of the grid.
This is a story from Absurdistan, from the land of the Energiewende.”
Large companies with energy gobbling equipment are paid 100 euros for every megawatt they can burn. I guess they switch on as many of their huge furnaces, kilns or whatever and run them empty at full blast. Just burn off as much power as you can! – and get paid to do it.

Just the opposite is demanded in the dead of winter when there is no sun and when the wind dies down. During the week, energy demand soars and their is often not enough supply to meet the demand. And because many power companies are finding it unprofitable to run conventional systems part-time, many are simply mothballing such plants completely, thus making supply even rarer. As a result, the risk of blackouts is becoming a real increasing threat in Germany with each coming winter.
The chart that follows shows German power supply and consumption over the last 30 days. Solar energy is shown in yellow and wind in blue. Gray represents the conventional supply and the red line is the total demand. Often wind and sun spike and excess power needs to get dumped quickly…somehow, somewhere.

Chart source: www.agora-energiewende.de/
Note all the wild fluctuations, and so it is necessary to always have conventional power on stand by for calm sunless days.
Little wonder that the Handelsblatt, once a huge proponent of alternative energies, now calls it “energy madness”. Climate activists and greens, however, claim it’s a model for the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA History of Global Temperature
By Ed Caryl
We have somewhat reliable global scale land surface and sea surface temperature measurements since about 1880. We have lower troposphere satellite temperature measurements since 1979. We have ice core CO2 measurements and real atmospheric CO2 measurements that overlap and agree at the overlap for this time span. There is general agreement that CO2 was not responsible for warming before World War II. Here is a plot of that history.

Figure 1 is a plot of the history of global temperature since 1880, along with the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The various cooling and warming periods are color coded.
Figure 1 plots the global temperature according to GISS. There are two warming periods, two cooling periods, and one flat trend period: the current pause. During this entire 133 year span, CO2 has been rising steadily, for the first half at about three parts per million per decade, and during the last half at about four times that, an average of about 13 ppm per decade. It is generally recognized that the cooling and warming from before 1880 to 1976, a century span, could not have been related to CO2. Yet it is claimed that the brief 20-year warming from 1977 to 1997 was completely due to man’s use of fossil fuel and the resulting 30 ppm CO2 increase and that somehow the 22 ppm increase from 1940 to 1976, and the additional 30 ppm increase since 1997, did nothing.
The 1977 to 1997 warming is also recorded in the satellite measurements, but has a lower amplitude than the surface measurements. The satellite measurement in the last 16 years indicates flat temperatures or even a slight cooling. The case for CO2 caused global warming is restricted to one 20-year period in the last 133 years. What about the 80 years of cooling or flat temperature response? What was responsible for that? There are other, much more logical explanations than the variance of CO2.
Here is another plot, like Figure 1, but proposing another cause for temperature fluctuations.

Figure 2 is a plot of the history of global temperature since 1880, along with the Atlantic Multi-decade oscillation (AMO) in black. The various cooling and warming epochs are color coded. 
Note that in Figure 2 the number of fine details that match between the AMO and year to year temperature variations. Note also that when the AMO declines the temperature declines, and when the AMO is increases the temperature increases. The AMO is a de-trended index based on sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, so it will not show the rising temperature trend in global temperature as a whole. But it does reflect the cyclic nature of global temperatures. Also, because the AMO cycle is roughly 66 to 70 years, a down-turn in temperature is indicated for the next 35 or so years.
There is currently much discussion of the solar influence on temperature. We know that historically recognized minimums in solar activity have coincided with socially disruptive cooling, crop failures, famines, plagues and iced-over rivers and canals. The Maunder Minimum of the 17th century is the best known, but there have been others.

Figure 3 is a plot of reconstructed TSI data from Beryllium 10 isotope data from ice cores.


Figure 4 is a table of minimums and maximums with dates for beginning and end of each recognized event.
Next is a plot of temperature over that same period from the year 800. Note that the Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums together are responsible for the Little Ice Age from 1450 to 1850 with minor remissions. The Medieval and modern warming is due to solar activity.

Figure 5 from Moberg et al 2005, found here.
We can expand the solar influence on the most recent times to the same scale as Figure 1.

Figure 6 is a combination of (blue and red, left scale) the sunspot count with an 11-year moving average, and two TSI estimates based on Be10 studies (purple and black, right scale, source link in figure 3 title) and another study using sunspot and satellite radiance measurements (orange, right scale).
In Figure 6, the Gleisberg minimum is discernible at the turn of the 19th to 20th century, as is the unnamed drop in temperature in the 1960’s and 70’s. Solar activity and ocean cycles produce the warming and cooling periods seen in Figure 1 and 2. The “pause” since 1998 is due to reaching a peak in the AMO/PDO cycle and a reduction in solar radiance. Ocean cycles alone will force the next 30 years of cooling. As many others have repeatedly stated in this blog and elsewhere, this cooling could be extended and deepened by a new solar minimum. This will be called the Landscheidt or Eddy minimum.
Clearly ocean and sun drive temperature
CO2 has not been, and will not be, the driver of temperature. Clearly ocean and solar radiance cycles drive temperature, and then temperature (short term) and fossil carbon use (longer term) drives CO2.

“If you have 99 percent of doctors who tell you ‘you are sick’ and 1 percent that says ‘you’re fine,’ you probably want to hang out with, check it up with the 99. You know what I mean? The idea that we ignore that we are in some way involved in climate change is ridiculous. What’s the worst thing that happens? We clean up the earth a little bit?”
That’s the wrong question. The question Clooney needs to ask is:
If on one hand you have 99 quacks wearing lab coats pretending to be doctors and armed with phony charts, fudged data and scare stories, all of whom on the payroll of the pharmaceutical industry, asking you to pay $10,000 a year for a little snake oil or else you’ll die – and on the other hand you have a dozen of the most renowned doctors, among them Lindzen, Christy and Spence, saying the way you feel is normal and all part of life and it isn’t necessary to pay 10,000 a year, who are you going to listen to?
George Clooney is a Hollywood actor who parrots lines and only repeats things that have been written down for him. His highest educational achievement is nothing more than a high school diploma. Listening to Clooney on climate science would be as reckless as listening to John Wayne Gacey on responsible parenting.
Don’t expect Clooney to look at the data himself. He wouldn’t know where to begin.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA press release by the Max Planck Institute (MPI) describes how a recent study shows that people are not very willing to make sacrifices if the benefits follow only much later in the future. That’s no surprise.
Immediate rewards make our brains rejoice and when such a reward beckons we’re happy to behave cooperatively. But if achieving a common goal won’t be rewarded until a few weeks have gone by, we are rather less euphoric and less cooperative. And if, instead of money, we’re offered the prospect of a benefit for future generations, our enthusiasm for fair play wanes still further.
Climate change is the largest public goods game that has ever been played and the whole of humanity are its players. The problem is that while we are now making the payments, the fruits of our efforts will only be enjoyed very much later and they will be shared among the whole of humanity. We ourselves or our children will thus benefit only very slightly from any restrictions we place on our lives today and our motivation actually to do something is correspondingly low.
You can read the entire Max Planck Institute press release here.
What’s remarkable about the study is that it accepts, as proven fact, that the climate will be much worse in the future – although we know 98% of the climate models have completely overstated the warming for the last 15 years.
Just imagine what the results of the study would have been had the test subjects been shown the models’ true performance beforehand. Why sacrifice when you know there isn’t going to be any benefit at all, ever?
And why inflict pain on yourself when you know the politicians, elitists and scientists will simply continue jetting around and living high on the hog while letting the poor taxpaying masses make all the sacrifice?
What do the study’s results imply?

The MPI press release writes:
‘The result of our experiment paints a gloomy picture of the future;’ summarizes Milinski. ‘We were unfortunately able to confirm Schelling’s prediction – it’s a disaster.'”
Yes, it’s a disaster: people aren’t going to sacrifice and embrace Spartan green living.
As a solution, the MPI proposes providing “short term benefits” to make going green more attractive. But how? Very disappointingly, the only short-term benefit the MPI is able to come up with is the benefit of “exporting technology”. But that won’t work because only a very few people would benefit quickly from exporting green technology (and my how they’ve benefitted so far!), and the rest of us would have to, well, keep sacrificing.
Only option left: force people to sacrifice
It seems the only option left, the MPI implies, is to force the necessary sacrifices onto the citizens, i.e. to ram it down their throats. Wouldn’t that be the ultimate demonstration of power?
Politicians and activist scientists have already convinced many among us to open up wide and to let the big pill gun into their mouths. All that’s left to do now is to force it down with one mighty thrust.

North Germany is set for a very brief heat wave (1 day!). Source: www.wetter24.de
So this heat wave they are talking about is going to be a whole one and half days long, at least in the area I live. I think this is not even long enough to qualify it as  a “heat wave”. Granted for Southern and Eastern German areas the forecasts indicates much warmer temperatures. Here’s the forecast for Munich:

Munich forecast: Source: www.wetter24.de
But this is not something you wouldn’t expect to happen here in the summertime. Yet, llistening to the media and some climate scientists, you’d think the world is coming to an end, that the heat waves are more and more frequent than ever, and that Europe will soon burn up.

For example Express.de here warns of “horror heat”.
With all the heat in the headlines, we ask ourselves just how has 2013 been so far in Germany? Surely it will probably go down in the books as “one of the hottest on record!“.
Looking at the end of month reports from Germany’s DWD Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service), we find the monthly anomalies as to the 1981 – 2010 reference period. They are as follows:
January: -0.3°C
February: -1.8°C
March: -4.1°C
April: -0.1°C
May: -1.3°C
June: 0.0°C
July: +1.5°C
The average anomaly is -0.87°C, i.e. almost a full degree below normal. Only July was warmer than normal this year.
So tell me what has been more frequent this year, heat waves or cold snaps? It may turn out that we’ll get a few warm months and wind up with an average year, or even one that is a bit warmer than normal. This is because we have a factor out there that we used to call “weather”.
One thing is sure: Europe is not burning up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOttmar Edenhofer can hardly contain his glee – like a mad scientist thinking this time it’ll really end with a huge, spectacular result! That’s what he thinks his data show.
Face it, what we have in Germany are a group of out-of-control, dangerous academics, a group of elitist, unelected scientists, totally drunk on towering arrogance, given license to perform an experiment on an entire nation, and itching to perform it on the rest of the world. H/t: a reader by e-mail.

Prof. Ottmar Edenhofer wants to use Germany as an experimental economic guinea pig. (Photo: Marco Urban, PIK)
Just look at the PIK’s own words:
‘The energy transformation is one of the greatest experiments that an industrial society ever performed,’ Edenhofer said. ‘An experiment of this dimension needs to be supported by scientific policy advice.’ This should be organized as a social learning process, he pointed out. ‘Science is mapping possible pathways, but it is up to politics to decide which way to go,’ Edenhofer said.”

He calls it himself an “experiment”. They act like they can just gamble with an entire society. Do they think they’re in a casino! This is very close to madness. Read it all here.
The probloem with Edenhofer’s arrangement is that the citizenry is moved to the sidelines, stripped of having a say, and are expected to just accept whatever the scientists and leaders hand down. They no longer have the competence to decide it for themselves. Germany is entering a dictatorship by a scientific elite.
It doesn’t matter what data you present to them, or that other experts are already calling it “a capital destroyer of historical dimensions“, or that Germany’s entire solar manufacturing industry has already been wiped out despite 100 billion euros in subsidies. Oh no, just put the pedal to the metal – just drive right over the edge…don’t worry about the landing.
They are hell bent on pushing an entire nation over the precipice, once again, for the fourth time in the last 100 years.
The territory isn’t really uncharted; central planning has been tried many times before with the result being failure every single time. But the PIK, the WBGU, the drugged up on green leaders are convinced this time it’ll work – they made models that tell them so.
Maybe it’s time to cash in the chips and to move on to a saner place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to the climate debate, everyone knows that it really all boils down to how much is man’s impact. It has nothing to do with whether climate is changing or not. It always has.
The core question is how accurate are the climate models and are they really accurate enough to use for policymaking?
Skeptics have long argued that the models use a climate sensitivity for a doubling of Co2 that is much too high…even preposterously high. The alarmists, on the other hand, insist that it isn’t, and that the models are pretty much on target. Now that climate models have been making predictions for well over 15 years, we now have enough data to make a preliminary call.
If the models are right, then the observed temperature should be following the trend predicted of the ensemble of models. But if the two trends are diverging, then the models are inaccurate and should be revamped. C3 Headlines here has posted a chart comparing observed (blue) to model trend (red):

 Chart comparing model projections to observed temperature. The last few months have shown a record divergence. Chart: C3 Headlines.
As the above chart shows, the divergence between modeled temperature and observed is setting new records with every passing month. The divergence for the 36-month moving average is now at about 0.35°C, already an embarrassment for the climate modellers.

Even more stunning, the rate of divergence using the second order fitted trends shows that the models are performing even far worse than we thought. Rather than depicting a steady divergence, the curves show that the divergence is actually accelerating!
The following shows what the divergence will look like in about 10 years time should the current observed trend continue, i.e. a slight warming:

Extrapolating about 10 years out. By 2025, the divergence will be 0.6°C (and even more if the earth cools, which many scientists are projecting).
What does this all mean? Should the trend continue over the next decade or so, the error will be greater with each passing year, and it won’t be long before it’s glaring. Even the trickiest graphic layouts and chart manipulations soon will not be able to hide the gaping difference.
So even if the current decade manages to be a little warmer than the last, the model error will still be sticking out more than ever.
Time is truly on the side of the skeptics. For the alarmists, it is running out – fast!

After the Soviet Union imploded along with its Communist mismanaged, dilapidated industry in 1990, Russia’s CO2 emissions plummeted 29%. Throughout the nineties Russia suffered from economic malaise. Finally, during the 2000s, things began to turn around and today more and more Russians are getting to know for the first what prosperity is.
Davydova writes, citing a recent study released by the Russian Industry and Commerce Associations and the Brussels-based Climate Change Global Services (CCGS), that Russians are driving more automobiles than ever before, and that CO2 emissions have increased 4.5% in both 2010 and 2011. More and more Russians are buying their own car. In the last ten years the number of cars has risen 83 percent.
These statistics cannot be interpreted as anything else but as signs of real progress in prosperity and improving life for Russians. Although there is still a ways to go, most people view this as welcome news. Yet, for those who hate prosperity, it’s abhorring news. So it is for the granola eaters at Klimaretter.
Klimaretter frets that too many Russians are driving cars nowadays. Davydova writes:
Greenhouse gas emissions from the Russian transportation sector increased 150% from 2001 to 2011. There’s no end in sight for this trend. Just last year alone from 2010 to 2011 CO2 emissions in this sector increased by more than a third. In 2011 there were 36.5 million private automobiles registered in Russia. Therefore, however, automobile ownership is still below that of Germany where approx. 43 million cars are on the road. Statistically, while in Germany every second person has a car, in Russia every fourth person has one.”

Imagine that. Per capita Russians have the gall of driving half the number of cars that Germans do: Thirty six million cars in a country that is almost 50 times the size of Germany! And what’s worse and even more disturbing? Klimaretter writes:
Also the average CO2 emissions per vehicle is higher than in the previous years.”
Mend your ways or “feel the consequences of climate change”
The folks at the alarmist blogsite aren’t happy about the development taking place in Russia. At the end of her article Davydova warns of serious climatic consequences should Russians fail to mend their evil ways:
Russia would be wise to be more active in climate protection efforts. The country is going to seriously feel the consequences of climate change: According to a study by the Moscow University for Economics, the climate-related damages could be 150 – 500 million euros annually in just a few years.”
How these people can be taken seriously truly boggles even a half-witted mind. Climate kooks believe every climate catastrophe scenario that gets released, no matter how absurd it may be. Klimaretter continues:
Also in agriculture the consequences are clearly visible: Between 2010 and 2012 harvests in Russia have dropped by one quarter to one third due to droughts.”
And all because Russians are now driving half as many cars Germans in a country that is almost 50 times the size?
I bet Russian car drivers really get scared when someone tells them about all the serious climate “consequences” that supposedly result from sparse car-driving in a vast country. I’m sure they’re going to ditch their cars and all run back to the horse-and-buggy days – a time when Russian climate was balmy and fruitful.
PS: Car density in Germany is about 120 vehicles per sq km while in Russia it’s barely over 2.

And if the last few days are any indication, then things are going to get awfully mean this winter. Expect sky-high heating bills and lots of frost damage, especially to streets. For example here are this morning’s lows for Germany – and October has barely begun:

Widespread frost over Germany. Source: www.wetter.com/hoechst tiefst werte/.
The www.wetter.net/ press release today explains the winter forecast for both December and January taken from US weather models. The December chart from meteociel.fr shows the Beast from the East, a.k.a. Siberian Express, rolling across central and southern Europe, before seriously intensifying in January.

The American long-term model remains true to a cold winter when compared to the 1961 – 1990 reference period. The two charts show the expected mean temperature in Central Europe in the months of December and January.”
Jung writes that there’s been a shift over the years to colder winters in Europe. After the last, at times, really cold winters, this is no longer a surprise. “The mild westerly wind pattern of the 1990s that provided us with mild and stormy years have gotten markedly less. Increasingly the icy high pressure weather patterns are dominating,“ explains Jung.
Though these long-term forecasts entail a lot of uncertainty, they do tell us what has already become clear: Europe has entered a period of cold winters – like those experienced in the 1970s. It tells us that the chances for a cold one are greater. This winter the dice is loaded in favor of a cold one.
To know for sure, we’ll just have to wait until April.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo. Don’t get all your hopes up, all you conspiracy people out there. This is nothing really big and probably just has to do with how the mysterious inner machinery of Google works. I have absolutely no idea about how it works. To me it is just an amazing piece of machinery.
We know Wiki is infamous for its gatekeeping of climate content. But can we trust Google to deliver fair and balanced information searches? I bring this up because on the 31st of May I wrote a harmless blurb about Naomi Oreskes Naomi Oreskes Denial of Nonconsensus. After I posted it, I googled “Naomi Oreskes Denial” and my post appeared on page 1 at position 5 or 6, meaning anyone googling those words would have found it easily – right there on the first page. I remember feeling quite pleased about it.
But if I had been Ms Oreskes, I probably would not have been too happy about that. After all, in her world, there’s nothing but consensus out there, and so we can’t have any dissent, now can we?
A day later on June 1st I googled it again, and this time I was relegated to page 2, position no. 17 – meaning at that point I had already been put on the Google conveyor belt to obscurity. Today, 5 days later, I googled “Naomi Oreskes Denial” again. This time Google had moved my post down to page 5 position 56, meaning most searchers probably would not find it. Moreover, clicking on the link they provide no longer takes you directly to the post itself, but to my homepage instead. This assures that over time the post eventually gets buried. Naomi Oreskes’s illusion of consensus thus stays undisturbed.
I don’t know if other bloggers have had similar experiences. If so, it could be interesting to hear about them. There are lots of experiments we could try, like applying various inputs and to see what outputs are produced.
Try googling Googlegate! and see what happens.
As this is a harmless post, and I think Google may leave it at the top of their search results. Right Google?
Update: Many have already written about Googlegate. This is interesting: nationalpost lawrence-solomon

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German daily Die Welt here looks back at the month of October 2013 in an interview with meteorologist Dominik Jung, who is often widely quoted in the media and runs the German weather site Wetter.net.
Photo: Meteorologist Dominik Jung, Wetter.net. 
Overall this year’s October was warmer and wetter than normal, and featured “surprising” snowfall early in the month, followed by warm temperatures, and then punctuated by the fall’s first severe storm at the end of the month.
Die Welt wonders if all that variability, particularly the severe storm, was really normal.
Jung replies that an evaluation indeed shows that “there has been no real increase in storms over the past years. More the contrary is the case.”
Jung then reminds readers that central Europe saw a number of warmer-than-normal and stormier winters during the 1990s and 2000s, but that this trend now seems to be over. Die Welt quotes Jung:

Climate experts leaned far out the windows and declaring that winters with snow and ice in Germany were over. To that I can only say: All complete nonsense! The last five winters compared to the 1961-1990 reference period were normal or even a bit too cold! And at times they were plentiful with snow.”
Die Welt at the end of the interview poses the question of whether 2013 will be “an extreme year”. Jung replies

No, it is an entirely normal year. […] Up to now the weather in 2013 has not been really extreme.”

Model shows nightmare euro-winter
Meanwhile a new seasonal forecast has been put out by Italian weather service Meteo Dolomiti and shows a nightmare shock-freeze winter gripping heavily populated central Europe: If that forecast turned out to be true, then Central Europe would find itself in a big heap trouble.
Fortunately long-term forecasts are not accurate and are highly speculative at best. Let’s hope that Europe’s winter turns out differently.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German Weather Service recently issued a press release claiming that August had been “one of the warmest on record”. Yet German data show no warming at all in the last 20 years.
============================================
Where’s The Climate Warming? Nowhere To Be Found In Germany
By Josef Kowatsch for EIKE
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
The following chart shows Germany’s August temperatures for the last 20 years using the data from Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) in Offenbach. Nowhere is a steady warming trend to be found.

August mean temperatures last 20 years.
To the contrary, the trendline for the last 20 years is falling somewhat. However, the meteorologists of the German Weather Service publicly argue, in contradiction to their own data, that the trend of warming continues unabated.
But nowhere does anyone find a trend of continued warming. Also August data confirm what the annual data show.
The IPCC and other climate institutes have done their work. For 20 years temperatures have remained steady with a slight downward trend. The IPCC and the PIK Potsdam Institute can now be disbanded.
108 hectares of new UHI area every day in Germany

On the other hand, it is correct to say that summers have gotten warmer compared to the period 40 to 50 years ago. But this has more to do with a perception of warming that stems from the increasing urban heat island (UHI) from the growing and spreading building construction taking place. In Germany 108 hectares of natural landscape are converted by man into concrete, asphalt and buildings every day. Each new wind turbine consumes on average 5 hectares of land and forests. These added heat islands impact the measurement stations of the German Weather Service. The perceived warming does not stem from some greenhouse gas, but rather from the growing urban heat islands and paving over of natural areas.
Sometimes there are warmer periods and sometimes there are cooler ones. Currently the trend is again a light cooling. This is mainly due to the multi-faceted impacts of the sun and cosmic radiation. The climate of the Earth is created in space, and not on the Earth.  Apples still ripen at the same time of the year as they did 50-60 years ago. The May bug always comes out, if at all, in May just as it did 250 years ago, as described in our old songs about May. There haven’t been any major changes especially over the last decades compared to earlier times. The May temperatures for the last decades confirm this.

May mean temperatures last 21 years. 
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased relatively strongly over the last 20 years. However, temperatures have been dropping slightly. From this one could only assume that more CO2 has a cooling effect on the climate. That is precisely the opposite of what is claimed by our highly-paid climate warming protectors. The climate models showing rising temperatures as a result of rising, climate-killing CO2 are pure, invented fairy tales.
We are all in favor of real environmental protection and care. But climate protection on the other hand is a pure business scam

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that North Sea storm “Xaver” is on its way out and the media hype begins to die down, the question of whether the storm was due to climate change is making the rounds. When Yolanda struck the Philippines early last month, the IPCC momentarily forgot its own science and hysterically blamed man-made CO2 for the catastrophe.

Xaver was just a normal storm, German warmist experts concede. (Photo by Beeston, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported). See here.
Yesterday as Xaver raged, Germany’s DWD Weather Service DPA news agency reported on findings specifically regarding the relationship between climate change and storm frequency and intensity. The DPA writes:

Even with the two storms ‘Christian’ and ‘Xaver’ over Germany this fall, experts see no sign of climate change from them. ‘What we are experiencing are single events’, emphasizes Gerhard Lux, meteorologist at the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Thursday. ‘Over the last 100 years there have always been small waves of more or fewer storms in Germany.’ Also around 1990 and 1999 there were phases with relatively more frequent storms.”


Few major media outlets have bothered to deliver these non-trivial, non-alarmist findings to the public. Why aren’t we surprised?
Higher frequency and intensity found only in model projections

//-->




The DPA then explains in its piece that North Atlantic storms are brewed especially when cold polar air masses clash against warm ones from the south. The DPA adds, quoting Lux:
‘For Germany we cannot detect any statistical increased in storm frequency.’ The same applies for storm intensity.”
The über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for climate Impact Research (PIK) models beg to differ, but the DWD statistics and observations are clear on that: Higher frequency and intensity exist only in the model projections, and not in reality.
IPCC scientist affirms one or two storms “not a trend”
Unexpectedly, German IPCC climate scientist Mojib Latif, ever so eager to grab the media spotlight, displayed an unusual level sobriety in response to yesterday’s storm. At Die Welt here he called storm Xaver “a normal autumn storm“:
Indeed we have had two violent storms in a short time, but we cannot discern any trend from that.”
That’s a flabbergasting admission from a leading proponent of the man-made global warming hypothesis. Perhaps Latif has come to realize the foolishness of his earlier claims and that the media attention isn’t worth it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwiss news magazine Weltwoche (World Week) print edition just published a stinging article about the now disgraced IPCC’s fifth assessment report Summary for Policymakers where it describes the refusal by scientists to acknowledge observations and their obstinate clinging to faulty models and doomsday scenarios.
Figure right: from Weltwoche report, “Faulty Prognoses from Scientists”
The introductory heading of the Weltwoche reports reads:
For a quarter of a century leading climate scientists have been warning of a dangerous global warming due to CO2 emissions. Now under Swiss leadership [Thomas Stocker] they publish a new report. It shows: The scientists were wrong. By Markus Schär.”
Weltwoche writes how IPCC lead scientist Thomas Stocker may have experienced an historic moment when he introduced the IPCC’s AR5 Summary for policymakers, but one he may not wish.
Crumbling consensus
Weltwoche writes that in the days leading up to the report’s release, a dispute prevailed among the delegates who were busy hammering out the final text. The Germans wanted no mention of the 15 years of no warming, the Belgians wanted to keep the year 1998 out of the statistics, the Hungarians advised to hold back facts in order “not to provide climate skeptics with ammunition“.
Weltwoche writes that Dutch delegates, however, insisted on including the natural impacts on climate change which refuted the claims of galloping global warming. One thing is sure, writes Weltwoche, the IPCC must come to terms with: “The consensus among the climate scientists that had been cemented over the last decades, is cracking – or is even crumbling completely.”
“Pitiful” model performance
To explain what is driving this crumbling consensus, Weltwoche looks at the history of global warming, reminding readers of the doomsday prognoses made in the past by experts like NASA’s James Hansen and by the IPCC years ago. For example in 1988 James Hansen “predicted that with an annual increase in CO2 emissions of 1.5%, the temperature would rise by 1.5°C by 2011. But in fact CO2 emissions rose 2.5% annually and the temperature ended only 0.3°C higher – even below the value that scientists had calculated if no CO2 had stopped being added beginning in the year 2000“.
Worse for the IPCC, British meteorologists recently forecasted a cooling ahead for the next few years, Weltwoche writes.
Weltwoche comments as follows on this miserable performance:
Anyone that far off is not a scientist, rather he’s a fortune teller – and one with a pitiful performance.”

IPCC devestated by observed data
Today, the IPCC’s latest report ends up contradicting all the earlier forecasts and warnings it made earlier. Weltwoche writes (my emphasis):
In its new report, the IPCC refutes itself. … They [scientists] tried time and again to defend their theory using tweaked models and honed studies. It gladly made itself vulnerable to attack by making forecasts that it could not live to see. After 25 years many of the forecasts can indeed now be evaluated – the result for the IPCC is devatasting.“
IPCC abandons Mann’s flawed hockey stick
Weltwoche then explains the sorrowful story of Michael Mann’s hockey stick in depth and how it was shown to be flawed by a Canadian statistics expert and how the IPCC eventually abandoned it altogether in that they conceded that the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were real after all. Weltwoche writes:
The draft of the new IPCC report also admits that the same warm temperatures we have today also prevailed at the peak of the Medieval Warm Period and that people suffered later on during the ‘Little Ice Age’ – the climate Bible of 2001 with its hockey stick chart was obviously wrong.”
Lomborg: 20 trillion euros for 0.05°C
Weltwoche writes that the IPCC has (quietly) reduced CO2 climate sensitivity values, yet continues to insist that the world embark on a crash-course energy supply transformation. Too expensive, says Danish scientist Bjorn Lomborg. Weltwoche quotes Lomborg:
But we also need to recognize that our current climate policy is too expensive. Every year the EU wants to spend 250 billion euros until the year 2100. With this 20 trillion euros, the temperature will drop by 0.05°C by 2100.”
But none of this impresses Stocker and the IPCC, who continue sounding the alarms louder than ever. Weltwoche concludes:
The important thing is alarm, as Stocker continues to maintain what he told Weltwoche in April: ‘The problem is there, and it is one of the biggest ever for mankind, and we have the choice of how big it is going to be.'”

Here’s the announcement from CFACT:
CFACT press conference at UN climate conference in Bonn
will call for UN and Obama to acknowledge
global temperature standstill,
to abandon bias and extreme statements and to embrace debate
(Bonn) CFACT will hold a press conference at the UN conference on climate change at Hotel Maritim, Bonn, Wednesday, June 5th at 11:30 AM in room Haydn.
“We at CFACT continue to be amazed at how people stay on their global warming talking points at UN climate conferences as if no new information had come in,” said CFACT Executive Director Craig Rucker. “They pay no heed to real world observational data, or the expense, ineffectiveness, waste, fraud and abuse surrounding the policies being proposed. A UN climate conference is an unrealistic wonderland.”

Measurements of world temperatures show world temperatures to have stalled with no significant warming since the nineties. IPCC climate models and real world temperatures have diverged and the Earth is cooler than projected.
CFACT recently erected a billboard graphing world temperature data reported by the U.K. Met Office in Washington D.C. to raise awareness, however, the U.S. executive branch is operating within a similar information bubble to that which encloses the UNFCCC.
“I don’t have much patience for people who deny climate change” the American President said last Wednesday. His new Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said, “I am not interested in debating what is not debatable.”
“President Obama is not being well advised.” Rucker said. “He appears to have accepted an extreme position and may well be completely uninformed about the global temperature standstill. Obama’s use of the loaded and offensive term “deny” coupled with Moniz’s call for closed minds and stifled debate are the exact opposite of what is called for. This is the kind of rhetoric which has eroded public confidence in the climate process. This is not a way forward citizens of the world can have confidence in.”
At Wednesday’s press conference CFACT will provide evidence which contradicts extreme public climate pronouncements and will provide examples of climate policy waste, fraud and abuse.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother tasteless, shock-effect promotion video has been released, this one produced by one of Germany’s most prominent environmental groups BUND – for fund-raising!
The video, dubbed “Pesticides – manufactured to kill“, shows hundreds of beautiful babies in an agricultural field who end up getting gassed with pesticides sprayed by a passing airplane.

Hat/tip: Reader DirkH
This is what passes as “protest” by environmental groups nowadays. The more shocking and remote from the truth, the better. Stop at nothing in the pursuit of donations. Scream as loud as you can, shock as much as you can.
This reminds us of the infamous and explosive 10:10 No Pressure video released in 2010 where climate skeptics were blown to bits and pieces for complacency in energy saving. The text at the end of the clip reads as follows:
Pesticides manufactured to kill.
 Take action now.
 For a future without poison.

I have nothing against challenging the use of pesticides, but this is way over the top and lacks all sense of decency. And it has nothing to do with the truth.
Criminalizing agriculture
The BUND’s target of course is to emotionally incite using methods from the bottom drawer. Today anyone who disagrees with these zealot environmentalist gets labeled a murderer, or accused of killing.
Emotionalization is always what desperate debaters wind up using when they lack the facts to convince. And if these planet rescuers are so concerned about babies, then why don’t we ever see them lift a finger to protest abortion? These scammers are only concerned about money, power and attention.
As was the case with the 10:10 No Pressure video, the BUND Baby-Gassing video is going to backfire as well.
Already reaction has been harsh. Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes:
On the BUND’s new campaign against pesticides, business associations and trade groups have sharply criticized the environmental organization on Thursday. The German Federation of Agriculture accuses the BUND of ‘incitement’, ‘a virtual crusade’ and ‘false propaganda’.
