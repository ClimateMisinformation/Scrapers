"Hay fever season is under way in Britain and, thanks to record-breaking warm weather in February, many trees started producing pollen up to three weeks earlier than average. But if you think it is bad in the UK, try living in Tennessee. With a long growing season and geography that causes air to sit over the region for long periods, the southern state is the hay fever capital of the US.  Now the season is starting earlier and lasting longer. At the start of this month, allergy doctors were kept busy when a yellow haze blanketed much of the south-eastern US, caused by dense clouds of pollen carried on the breeze. Analysis of US weather data shows the growing season – from the last spring frost to the first autumn frost – has been increasing and is now an average of two weeks longer than it was in 1970. Meanwhile, about 30% of Americans have hay fever compared with 10% about 40 years ago. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists estimate the average growing season across most of the US will be a month longer, piling on the misery for hay fever sufferers in Tennessee."
"New York City has approved an ambitious plan to combat climate change by forcing thousands of large buildings to slash their greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation passed on Thursday by the city council puts caps on carbon emissions for buildings over 25,000 sq ft – requiring a 40% overall cut in their emissions by 2030. The mandates, touted as a local version of the Green New Deal embraced by many progressive Democrats, will apply to 50,000 buildings – from buildings with a few dozen apartments to Trump Tower, the president’s Fifth Avenue skyscraper which advocates have targeted as a major polluter. “It will be the largest emissions reduction policy ever, in any city,” said the city councilman Costa Constantinides, who spearheaded the bills. The law puts caps on how many tons of carbon a building may produce per square foot, with different limits for residential, commercial and industrial buildings. To reach them, many buildings will have to replace heating or air conditioning systems with more efficient models or put in better insulation and windows. Or, they can use electricity from clean sources like solar and hydropower, which will not produce emissions. It is an attempt to tackle the biggest source of greenhouse gas in New York, where buildings account for about 67% of emissions. Real estate owners have opposed the plan, calling it too costly and too riddled with exceptions to be effective. “The approach taken today will have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain a broad range of industries, including technology, media, finance and life sciences, that provide opportunity and continued economic growth that is so important for our city,” said John Banks, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. Rent-stabilized apartments will be exempt from the caps, though they will be required to do some upgrades to improve energy efficiency. Churches, synagogues and mosques are also exempt, as is the city’s public housing system. Banks wrote that the exceptions unfairly leave “mostly market-rate housing and commercial buildings to shoulder the entire burden of what is undeniably a shared societal problem”. Buildings that violate the caps will face fines of $268 a year for every excess ton of carbon they put out – which could add up to millions of dollars for the worst offenders. The city is also aiming to set up a carbon trading program, though details have not been determined. By 2050, the aim is to cut the buildings’ emissions by 80%. The package, called the Climate Mobilization Act, also requires new buildings to put in green roofs or rooftop solar panels.  A New York panel has predicted sea level rises of up to 6ft if climate change goes unchecked, leaving wide swaths of the city in the path of floods. Mayor Bill de Blasio last month proposed building a new chunk of Manhattan to protect the existing island from rising seas. New York is one of a host of US cities and states that have vowed to drive down their carbon emissions despite a retreat at the federal level under Donald Trump, who withdrew from the landmark Paris climate change agreement. De Blasio plans to sign the legislation. “It’s going to revolutionize our ability to reduce emissions through our buildings, which are really our number one problem here in New York City,” he said this week. “We were going to need to do something very aggressive, particularly because the federal government is not doing their role.”"
"Climate activists have kept control of four sites in London for a second night, with police saying they have caused “serious disruption” affecting half a million people in the city. After the Extinction Rebellion activist group threatened to disrupt the city’s public transport network on Wednesday, Transport for London disabled wifi on the underground at the request of the British Transport Police. Thousands of people have taken part in the civil disobedience protests since Monday, blockading four landmarks in the capital in an attempt to force the government to take action on the escalating climate crisis. On Wednesday morning, the four sites – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under the control of protesters, causing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas. “We’re working closely with the police to manage the impact of disruption to London’s transport network,” a TfL spokesperson said. “Customer wifi in underground stations has been temporarily switched off. We will restore access as soon as we are able to do so.” Passengers were not informed about the decision to turn off the network, and many travellers wrongly attributed the disruption to conventional technical faults. Disabling public communications networks is an increasingly common tactic used in policing disruption across the world. Almost eight years ago, San Francisco’s Bart transit system turned off the mobile phone service across the network to prevent a similar campaign aimed at stopping trains in protest at the killing of a man by Bart police. That decision was criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it was reminiscent of censorship in the Middle East. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said that while he shared the passion of the protesters about the urgent need to tackle climate change he was “extremely concerned” about plans to disrupt the underground. In a statement on Twitter, Khan said: “Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners’ safety and I’d implore anyone considering doing so to think again.” At least 168 arrests were made on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said, bringing the total of Extinction Rebellion-related detentions since Monday up to 290. Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion protesters were still dancing around a boat stage at Oxford Circus just after 10pm, as police tried – apparently in vain – to clear the area. The events in London were part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by Extinction Rebellion. Organisers said demonstrations had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries – from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague on Tuesday, activists occupied the international criminal court building.  In Scotland, more than 1,000 protesters blockaded the North Bridge in Edinburgh, bringing one of the main routes into the city centre to a standstill. Police said they made 29 arrests. The blockade began at 3pm, when groups of people on bikes converged from both sides of the bridge, before a human chain formed across the road. At about 5.30pm, protesters crossed Princes Street and unfurled banners. Most were immediately carried off the road by police. The biggest protests have been in London, with thousands of parents and their children joining scientists, teachers and environmentalists to demand urgent action in the face of “possible human extinction”. Among the protesters was the prominent UN environment lawyer Farhana Yamin, who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement. Just after 2pm, she glued her hands to the pavement outside Shell’s headquarters near the River Thames. Nearby, police moved on to Waterloo Bridge to begin a second wave of arrests as hundreds of protesters continued their blockade. Some of those on the bridge had been locked or glued to a lorry parked across the carriageway since Monday night. By about 5pm, the atmosphere at Waterloo Bridge had calmed after police stopped arresting people.  On Tuesday evening, police turned their attention away from Waterloo Bridge to Oxford Circus. Officers circulated around the crowd in groups, informing people that if they stayed in that location they were at risk of arrest. The Guardian witnessed at least one person being carried away, while others left the crowd voluntarily after speaking to police. “We are peaceful, what about you?” protesters chanted as police made an arrest. Many protesters said they were willing to remain at the junction all night in order to hold the space. Harriet Gold, 26, a student from Bristol, was among them. “I feel really confident,” she said. “I was surprised to wake up to hear that they had Waterloo Bridge still.” Elmo MB, 20, was manning a wellbeing tent. He said he was not worried about the police order to leave the area. “I think breaking the law is the point,” he said. “There are lots of brave folk and a lot of people have been arrested so far, but they pull one person off and two people come back on. I’m not sure how long this will last, but I imagine it will last through the night.” Extinction Rebellion was formed in the UK last year and held its first civil disobedience protests in London in November. It is calling on the UK government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss. On Tuesday, Supt Colin Wingrove of the Metropolitan police confirmed a section 14 order was in place and called on the protesters to leave Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square but they could continue their demonstration at Marble Arch. “In order to impose this condition, the Met required evidence that serious disruption was being caused to communities in London. We so far have 55 bus routes closed and 500,000 people affected as a result … we are satisfied that this threshold has been met and this course of action is necessary.”"

"Our unsustainable lifestyles and commitment to perpetual economic growth have become the major drivers of climate change and loss of biodiversity on Earth (Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse, 15 April). Our politicians fail to grasp the scale and urgency of the risk humanity faces. The UK signed up to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015, but has yet to develop a coherent and rigorous national plan for their domestic and international implementation. Encouragingly, the SDGs form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet, a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre shows that attempting to achieve the socioeconomic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation.  The research team tested three other scenarios, and the only one that met all goals implemented systemic transformational change. A key element was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income. We clearly have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us, with little choice but to engage as a mass movement to create a system-wide transformation in our politics and our economy.Stephen Martin Visiting professor, University of the West of EnglandStephen Sterling Emeritus professor of sustainability education, Plymouth University • Both Extinction Rebellion and the climate strikes are reminders that we need to rebuild our societies now if we are to avoid them facing climate collapse in the near future. But both initiatives need to avoid the fate of the Occupy movement, which had huge support 10 years ago but disintegrated because of a lack of precise demands and concrete policy goals. Fortunately, many such policies already exist. The organisation I founded, the World Future Council, has identified the best policy solutions available in countries, regions and cities worldwide. British Columbia has a carbon tax. Maryland, US, has obligatory environmental literacy education. Rwanda has a successful reforestation policy. Japan has an effective energy conservation law. Costa Rica has an exemplary biodiversity law. These provide starting points. But the UK has gone in the opposite way: 10 years ago the WFC helped MPs introduce feed-in tariff legislation (originating in Germany) to speed up the production of renewable energy. But the coalition government hastened to emasculate it. As many proposals are rejected over cost, a key recommendation is the adaptation of quantitative easing to fund the energy transition. One WFC proposal is for central banks to buy fossil fuel “stranded assets” on condition the money paid is invested in renewables. How this can be done sustainably is explained in our study “Unlocking the trillions”. As central banks cannot go bankrupt in their own currency, they can also buy – and add to their reserves – long-term and low- or zero-interest bonds to kickstart the required emergency reforms in poor countries.Jakob von UexkullFounder, World Future Council • Larry Elliott is informative on a subject that matters, as usual (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers: take climate change seriously, 16 April). But insurers have taken it seriously since at least 2009, when a representative of Munich Re wrote: “Climate change probably already accounts for a significant share of economic losses from weather-related natural catastrophes in the period since 1980, which totalled $1.6tn (in original values). “In the light of these facts, it is disappointing no breakthrough was achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. At Munich Re, we look closely at a multitude of risks and how best to handle them. Risks that change in the course of time are especially hazardous. Climate change is just such a risk of change.” But even the premium increases 10 years later don’t appear to have cut emissions sufficiently. So the Bank of England must convince the government to take more effective action. For example, as in the second world war, introduce rationing of any production of greenhouse gases.David MurrayWallington, Surrey • Are US college courses teaching how not to be duped by bullshit really necessary (‘Calling bullshit’: the college class on how not to be duped by the news, theguardian.com, 17 April)? If students haven’t developed their critical thinking faculty by the time they get to college, they are probably lost to the agencies of disinformation and manipulation. In Britain, it is obvious that our education system, designed as it is to provide compliant labour to increase the wealth of a few, has failed when its cities are filled with humanity-saving, peaceful demonstrators. It is inspirational to observe their ability to recognise what is truly important and disregard the odium of passersby – normal people going about their business, in many cases to finance or produce goods harmful to humanity and the natural world. These protesters are the freethinkers who have escaped the bullshit net.Geoff NaylorWinchester, Hampshire • In This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein defines one legacy of the free market: “In virtually every country the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare – indeed the habitability of our shared home – are clearly at stake.” In the streets, yes, but in the ballot box we bring about the inevitable and dismiss our free-market political class. We build a new system.John AirsLiverpool • I admire Ben Smoke’s action at Stansted (Journal, 16 April), but disagree with him about arrest, though agree about not glorifying it and being clear about the consequences. I am a Quaker, a psychotherapist member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, which aims to support activists therapeutically, and a member of Extinction Rebellion. What we need is a mass movement with arrest as a possible and necessary part of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt appears that now even Professor Chris Turney admits blaming his expedition mishap on global warming was an astronomical stretch after all.
Yesterday I reported here, quoting flagship Swiss daily (NZZ), that his communication director Alvin Stone blamed global warming for the vessel getting trapped in ice. The whole world laughed.
I couldn’t believe it myself so I wrote an e-mail to Stone asking if they really believed this.
Stone answered circa 9 hours later:
Dear Pierre,
That is not quite the quote that I gave.
This is my understanding from talking to Chris and other glaciologists.

The 120km long ice berg B09B that is grounded in Commonwealth Bay broke away from the continent three years ago, very likely as a result of climate change.
B09B collided with the Mertz Glacier, smashing a large ice tongue that released the ice into that area.
It was a mix of this ice that was blown across the path of the Shokalskiy, which led to it being trapped and explains why much of the ice surrounding the ship is old ice.

Chris discusses the situation in a blog entry, here.

I believe you are probably aware of a number of papers this year that show land ice on Antarctica is in decline and that only seasonal sea ice has been expanding, likely due to the increase in westerly winds and potentially because of the decrease in salinity.
Thanks for your interest.”
Here we see that the major backpedalling had already begun. This morning in a piece where the Guardian and Turney attempt to defend the expedition, Turney retracts the claim altogether, sort of: In the Guardian article he writes (my emphasis):
Let’s be clear. Us becoming locked in ice was not caused by climate change. Instead it seems to have been an aftershock of the arrival of iceberg B09B which triggered a massive reconfiguration of sea ice in the area.”
Note here how Turney continues to blame “unforeseen” events for the vessel’s fate, when it is now clear from postings and records that they new well in advance there was ice out there and a storm was approaching. His excuses may be anough for the average Guardian reader, but I don’t expect they’ll hold much water elsewhere.
Expect bogus commissions to clear Turney
I suspect in the end that a commission, even two or three of them, are going to be set up to investigate the whole thing. Then after some months each will issue an authoritive report claiming that although Turney could have done things better, all in all no serious violations were committed and he’ll be cleared. Of course everyone will know that the commissions were bogus. And later, with no one watching, future expeditions will be carried out under far stricter oversight.
In the end the taxpayer will pick up the rescue tab and legal expenses.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that North Sea storm “Xaver” is on its way out and the media hype begins to die down, the question of whether the storm was due to climate change is making the rounds. When Yolanda struck the Philippines early last month, the IPCC momentarily forgot its own science and hysterically blamed man-made CO2 for the catastrophe.

Xaver was just a normal storm, German warmist experts concede. (Photo by Beeston, licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported). See here.
Yesterday as Xaver raged, Germany’s DWD Weather Service DPA news agency reported on findings specifically regarding the relationship between climate change and storm frequency and intensity. The DPA writes:

Even with the two storms ‘Christian’ and ‘Xaver’ over Germany this fall, experts see no sign of climate change from them. ‘What we are experiencing are single events’, emphasizes Gerhard Lux, meteorologist at the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Thursday. ‘Over the last 100 years there have always been small waves of more or fewer storms in Germany.’ Also around 1990 and 1999 there were phases with relatively more frequent storms.”


Few major media outlets have bothered to deliver these non-trivial, non-alarmist findings to the public. Why aren’t we surprised?
Higher frequency and intensity found only in model projections

//-->




The DPA then explains in its piece that North Atlantic storms are brewed especially when cold polar air masses clash against warm ones from the south. The DPA adds, quoting Lux:
‘For Germany we cannot detect any statistical increased in storm frequency.’ The same applies for storm intensity.”
The über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for climate Impact Research (PIK) models beg to differ, but the DWD statistics and observations are clear on that: Higher frequency and intensity exist only in the model projections, and not in reality.
IPCC scientist affirms one or two storms “not a trend”
Unexpectedly, German IPCC climate scientist Mojib Latif, ever so eager to grab the media spotlight, displayed an unusual level sobriety in response to yesterday’s storm. At Die Welt here he called storm Xaver “a normal autumn storm“:
Indeed we have had two violent storms in a short time, but we cannot discern any trend from that.”
That’s a flabbergasting admission from a leading proponent of the man-made global warming hypothesis. Perhaps Latif has come to realize the foolishness of his earlier claims and that the media attention isn’t worth it.

"The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has returned to the fray to warn dumping the national energy guarantee – a decision taken by Scott Morrison – will drive up power prices. Turnbull took exception to a column at the weekend characterising the national energy guarantee as “Malcolm Turnbull’s Neg”, pointing out the policy had strong support within the cabinet, “including and especially the current PM and treasurer”.  The former prime minister took to social media over the weekend to argue that a majority in the government wanted the policy to proceed but “a right wing minority in the party room refused to accept the majority position and threatened to cross the floor and defeat their own government”. “That is the only reason it has been abandoned by the government,” Turnbull said. “The consequence is no integration of energy and climate policy, uncertainty continues to discourage investment with the consequence, as I have often warned, of both higher emissions and higher electricity prices. “I am simply stating the truth: the Neg was designed and demonstrated to reduce electricity prices. So dumping it means prices will be higher than if it had been retained.” Labor has resolved to try to preserve the framework of the Neg, which imposes security and emissions reduction obligations on the energy sector, if it wins on 18 May. The government proposed an emissions reduction target of 26% and Labor is proposing a target of 45%. Labor is also proposing to keep another government policy mechanism, the safeguard framework, to drive down pollution in heavy industry, again with a higher emissions reduction target. A debate over climate and energy policy has dominated the opening full week of the campaign with Labor facing questions over the cost of its policies and the Coalition blasting Labor’s decision to use international permits, even though the government in 2017 supported their use. Labor has not done new economic modelling to outline the costs of its climate policies, but draws on work already in the public domain to argue the economy will continue to grow with higher pollution targets. Scott Morrison continued to blast Labor’s decision to use international permits over the weekend even though the Liberals had previously resolved to use them in its suite of climate policies and their use is widely supported by the business community. “Bill Shorten has a plan to reduce emissions by 1.3bn tonnes,” the Liberal leader said. “Now, one of the questions he won’t answer is what proportion of that 1.3bn tonnes is going to be satisfied by buying foreign carbon credits? “Now, today those credits cost about 43 Australian bucks per credit, OK? For those credits, that will go to $52 by 2030. Now, our best estimate is around half of him meeting that target will be through carbon credits purchased offshore. Now, that’s about $35bn. “It shouldn’t be hard for Bill Shorten to explain this simple question – of your 1.3bn, Bill, what share of those are going to be achieved by purchasing foreign carbon credits and at what price?” Shorten expressed his growing frustration with the trajectory of the debate over the weekend. “This has been a 10-year torture on climate change, where the climate has got worse, the extreme weather events have got worse, and this government is still trying to delay and discourage,” the Labor leader said. “Here is a bet, here’s a bet I’ll make you. Future generations are going to despise the politicians right now who refuse to take action on climate change”."

"Meal-prep kits are often more environmentally friendly than the average trip to the grocery store, according to a University of Michigan study. Researchers at the School of Environment and Sustainability found that, on average, while kits provided by companies like Blue Apron, Sun Basket and HelloFresh often do involve more packaging waste, the emissions for grocery store meals carried two kilograms more of carbon dioxide per meal than those of the meal-prep kits. “There are lots of people who really liked meal kits but were saying ‘Ah, there’s so much plastic and I feel so bad because [it’s] so terrible environmentally,” said Dr Shelie Miller, one of the primary researchers. “I said ‘You know, I bet if we take a bigger picture look, they may not turn out to be that bad.’ Just largely because of the pre-portioned ingredients and potentially, the lack of food waste.” Using five different Blue Apron meals, the researchers tracked and compared the lives of the meals through several different environmental lenses, concluding the disparity in emissions was mostly due to the supply chain and the portions of food. The extra steps stores take to source food add up to more carbon dioxide, as well as encourage food waste. “It really is the food and the food waste that dictate the environmental impact,” Miller said. While the meals did come from Blue Apron, the company did not sponsor the study – but were obviously pleased with the result. “Blue Apron has long been driven by our vision of building a better food system,” said Dr Alison Grantham, their agro-ecologist and director of procurement. “We are delighted to see the positive benefits of our direct-to-consumer model materialize in lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.” Meal-prep kits like Blue Apron can be expensive, but there are other solutions for those who would like to be environmentally conscious. “One strategy that has been shown both to reduce food waste but will ultimately also save consumers money is meal planning,” said Brent Heard, the other researcher associated with the study. “It will decrease the amount of food you need to purchase at the store … In line with this, another thing consumers can do is try to purchase food in the smallest portion sizes. Try to select foods that are as close to pre-portioned as possible.” The study did not take into account people who participate in alternative forms of grocery purchasing, like community-supported agriculture. Despite this, both Heard and Miller agree the central message behind the study does not change. “The study really motivates looking beyond what’s directly in front of us when we think about the environmental impacts of a product,” says Heard."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMaverick meteorologist Pier Corbyn at his site here has issued a statement on the rescue of Professor Turkey and his global warming boatpeople.
As the story unfolds, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Turney’s preparation was really not quite up to standard, to put it kindly. I wrote about this at length 3 days ago here.
Funny how he made sure to have top journalists from the top media outlets right on the spot, yet couldn’t be bothered to seek out competent weather forecasting services. Eventually the expedition ended up relying on help from “denier” meteorologists. Oh the irony.
And as Anthony Watts now mentions here, it’s clear that they really did not charter the most adequate of vessels. Also it seems that communication with the Russian crew was a bit impaired by a language barrier. Did anything go right?
Piers writes:
The Ice will weaken as winds change in WeatherAction’s next big circulation change which is around ~17JAN so maybe by 20th or so they could have another go at getting the ship(s) out. We base this estimate on the fact that the world weather system is just that – a world system. Major changes in the NH circulation and Jet stream have correspondences in the SH. [Follow reports from our New Zealand & Australian subscribers and you can see that]. Subscribers to WeatherAction Eu /Br+Ir or USA will have noticed major changes in circulation through 17-20th and I estimate it is 80% likely this also means DIFFERENT winds in Antarctica which should do the business.
Of course when this happens the Warmist liars in BBC and the intellectually strained Independent, Guardian and New York Times will doubtless say the wind change is a sign of their lost Global Warming cause being redeemed.
I urge all who support evidence-based science and accountable policies THIS YEAR to give these fraudsters, spongers and thieves NO QUARTER WHATSOEVER. We have to make 2014 so uncomforable for them and their lie machine that they would wish they could return to the sanctuary of an ice-bound ship or a Russian jail to escape the wrath of the people who are now suffering – and some dieing – under rising fuel charges and hiked food prices and taxes which are a direct consequence of the insane policies these green parasites have foisted upon the world”.
Finally, I just get a kick out of the way Turney keeps insisting that weather down there is unpredictable and so none of it is his fault. Yet the guy turns right around and has the next person believing he can tell us what the climate will be in the year 2100!

"Police have warned Extinction Rebellion organisers that they face arrest if they incite protesters to block roads around Parliament Square. The Metropolitan police said it was imposing pre-emptive conditions restricting any demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday to the lawn in the centre of the square, after hearing that activists with the group planned to gather there. Protesters must clear the area by midnight, police said, and may not gather in Old Palace Yard, a site the group has requested as a permanent protest camp. In Parliament Square on Tuesday morning, a small crowd of Extinction Rebellion protesters who had been there since Monday waited for the main protest march to arrive. Amber, 23, who did not give her surname, said she was not hopeful the government would change its position on the climate emergency. “We just want to be heard … we have put a lot into these occupations and actions, now we just need some sort of engagement from the government. They have been on holiday so who knows – they might come back and want to engage properly, but I’m not hopeful.” Several hundred people arrived in Parliament Square just before midday on Tuesday, flags flying and drums beating. There was a big police presence as the protesters arrived in an attempt to prevent them blocking surrounding roads or Westminster Bridge. Clarissa Carlyon, from London, said: “We are coming into Parliament Square because we have captured the media’s attention and a lot of attention around the globe, and now it’s time for the politicians to come and talk to us.” Liam Geary Baulch, 26, also from London, said relations between the group and the police had become increasingly strained, with dismay over the Met’s decision to name those charged in connection with the protest and to seize a soundsystem it had been using at its base at Marble Arch. “We have seen thousands of people take non-violent action and over 1,000 arrests, yet we have had no complaints from the police about violence,” Geary Baulch said. “What there has been complaints about is that despite the civil relations between the officers on the ground and the activists, there has been a lack of respect by them releasing the names and locations of more than 50 of the people charged, so I think there has been a breakdown of trust between the people on the ground and some of the officers because that’s making these people vulnerable to being doorstepped by the press.” Activists were also surprised and dismayed by the police operation to seize their soundsystem on Monday night. “There were no liaison officers on shift, which I think was a big mistake, to do something that was going to make the crowd anxious,” Geary Baulch said, adding that the operation had also contributed to the breakdown of trust. Four activists had secured themselves up tall trees at the back of Parliament Square where they had dropped banners saying “eyes on government in action” and “May profiting from war: citizens assembly now.” Their friend, who was at the base of the trees, said they had climbed up in the early hours of the morning.  ""I've got a steeplejack with me, we are rigging the rest of the trees into Systems. We are going to set up a traverse and hang more banners.""Dav, 40, from Bristol, who is up a tree in #parliamentsquare for #extinctionrebellion pic.twitter.com/CptSHK2DZQ More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action orchestrated by the group to highlight how little time the world has left to halt manmade ecological breakdown. Most have been arrested for breaching section 14 orders that restrict rights to protest in each location. But Tuesday’s order is the first to explicitly mention that organisers could be targeted for arrest. A statement circulated to the media said: “Any organiser or person taking part in the protest failing to comply with these conditions or inciting others not to comply with them will be committing an offence and will be liable to arrest.” Over the bank holiday weekend it took a mass police operation to clear Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square of the small festivals of protest, which included stages, sound systems, workshops, wellbeing tents and free food. Activists at each location had formed human barricades, securing themselves across roads and to key pieces of infrastructure using lock-on devices and superglue."
"Britain needs to reach, by no later than 2050, net zero emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This means any greenhouse gases we release must be balanced by the removal of an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. The 2050 deadline represents our fair share of international responsibility for implementing the Paris agreement on climate change and meeting its goal of holding the rise in average global temperature to well below 2C – and pursuing best efforts to limit warming to no more than 1.5C.  Until global emissions reach net zero, average temperature will continue to rise. It is already about 1C above its pre-industrial level, and is fundamentally altering the Earth’s climate. Extreme weather events – heavy rainfalls and heatwaves – have occurred, and sea levels have risen. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of very serious consequences if average temperature rises by more than 1.5C, with many millions more people threatened by food and water shortages, for instance. Worse, the higher that temperatures climb, the greater is the prospect of major catastrophic events occurring such as polar ice sheets in west Antarctica and Greenland being destabilised, leading to an inevitable sea-level rise of several metres. The 2008 Climate Change Act commits the UK to reducing its annual emissions by at least 80% by 2050. But that was based on the assumption that global average temperature would rise by up to 2C. Since then scientific evidence has emerged to suggest that this level of global warming would be too dangerous. The UK is leading by example and has already reduced its annual emissions by more than 43% since 1990, a period during which our economy has grown more than 75%, proving that tackling climate change does not mean financial ruin. But this has mainly been achieved by phasing out coal as a source of electricity. To reach net zero emissions by 2050, the UK needs strong action across the whole economy. We have many of the technologies we need already, and we will need to make more use of nuclear and renewable power. But it is not yet clear how we will, for instance, stop emissions from agriculture, including from livestock. We will need to make significant investments, but the returns will be huge, not just in terms of avoided climate change impacts, but also new opportunities for innovative UK businesses serving the growing global demand for zero-emissions technologies. A zero-emissions economy will be cleaner, smarter and more efficient, ensuring prosperity and wellbeing for current and future generations.

Chancellor Angela Merkel clashed vs. challenger Pier Steinbrück in yesterday’s only major televised campaign debate. Not once did the subject of climate change come up. Photo credits, Merkel: Alexander Kurz – CC-BY-SA-3.0 License; Steinbrück: SPD
But you would have never known it watching yesterday evening’s nationally televised campaign debate between incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel and challenger Pier Steinbrück. The debate was shown live by four major German networks as German voters get set to elect a new government on September 22, or to keep the one they now have. It’s the only debate scheduled between Angela Merkel of the conservative CDU party and Pier Steinbrück of the SPD socialist party.
The 90-minute debate was moderated by 4 media and television personalities and covered a variety of issues. Candidates fielded questions on issues ranging over every thing from the economy, jobs, pensions, health care, the euro crisis, Syria, foreign policy, taxes, Greece bailout, to name a few. Yet, not once were the candidates asked about the “greatest crisis facing humanity” – climate. In fact the word climate was not even uttered once by anyone! To add insult to injury, even minor issues such as day-care for toddlers and a proposed national toll for Germany’s autobahns were discussed. Climate? Absolute zero!
Major setback for climate activists

This is a major setback for the global warming alarmists who want to make climate change the central issue of our time, such as Professors Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Ottmar Edenhofer of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. If that doesn’t tell them where they really stand on the list of Germany’s priorities and the things that are really important for Germans, then they are living in a fantasy world. At Twitter, a number of German greens and activists grumbled bitterly that climate change had been ignored in the debate.
Renewable energies “a disaster”
Also the problems with Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energy) and the associated skyrocketing prices were discussed briefly. Candidate Steinbrück called the management of the Energiewende “a disaster“, and that the best anyone could hope for now is to slow down the price increase.
No support for a US-led attack on Syria.
Concerning support for a US led attack on Syria, both candidates said outright they would not support an attack without UN approval.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday here I wrote about some comments made by Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber at a press release  last week on the first day of the World Conference on Climate Impacts in Potsdam Germany.

Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber confirms that oceans are a major factor in global temperature. Image source: www.climate-impacts-2013.org/.
While answering a question from a journalist about why global temperatures have stagnated over the last 15 years, Schellnhuber blamed the cool oceans for absorbing the heat that everyone is missing and searching for.
At around the 35-minute mark of the video, Prof. Schellnhuber tells us (my emphasis):
So what we probably see now is a sort of saturation of deeper ocean layers, …but once the job is done, the surface will warm once again, and even faster actually later on. This is by the way accompanied by, if you look at the data as I did this morning, you had many more La Nina events, that is the cool phase in the Pacific, in the last decade then you had in the previous decade. This is in a sense precisely in a La Nina event the oceans more or less take up heat while in an El Nino event they release heat. So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature.”
First it is clear that Prof. Schellnhuber doesn’t really know where the heat is, and is only assuming that it is hidden at the “deeper layers of the ocean“.
Secondly, and more importantly, he tells us that La Ninas take up heat from the atmosphere and that El Ninos release heat into the atmosphere. “So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature.” Clearly he is telling us that the oceans indeed do have a big impact on global temperature. So why hasn’t he included this in the models?
If Schellnhuber agrees that El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) leave their mark on global temperature, then he cannot possibly deny that the PDO and AMO phases do the same. In cool phases they remove heat from the atmosphere, in warm phases they release heat into the atmosphere. Schellnhuber acknowledges this. We’ve been measuring this for decades now.
The following chart shows the PDO:

The positive PDO released gargantuan amounts of heat into the atmosphere from 1980 – 2006, a time when global temperature jumped 0.5°C. Chart source: Giorgiogp2, data from jisao.washington.edu/PDO.latest, the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
The chart above clearly shows that the massive equatorial Pacific was releasing mega-heat into the atmosphere from 1980 – 2007. This heats up the global atmosphere just as Prof. Schellnhuber describes above. The question is what factor got all the credit for that heat? The PIK and many warmist scientists wrongly assigned it to CO2. But now that the globe has stopped warming, they are blaming the oceans.
Why was the heat released by the 1980 – 2007 positive PDO not properly assigned in the climate models? No wonder the models look like jokes today. Schellnhuber needed the PDO heat in order to make CO2 look bad. It was the only way to come up with a dangerously high CO2 climate sensitivity.
The same applies with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO):

AMO climbed from 1975 until 2000. Public domain chart
So the heat that was added by the positive PDO and AMO since 1980 has to be subtracted from the CO2 account. If you do that, then you will see that CO2 climate sensitivity is far less, and is no longer a problem.
Good to see that Schellnhuber acknowledges the AMO and PDO. All he has to do now is build them into his climate models.

"Business groups are defying the Morrison government’s political assault on the use of international permits, arguing a credible climate policy should include access to high-quality international offsets, because they are a key mechanism to help Australia meet its Paris target. With climate change persisting as a significant campaign flashpoint, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James Pearson, told Guardian Australia international permits were part of the toolkit for mitigating climate change in a cost-effective way.  “Australia’s carbon emissions reduction policies should be stable, predictable and provide long-term certainty for business,” Pearson said. “They should include access to credible international offsets; be market-based; implemented nationally; and minimise the potential for carbon leakage”. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors, such as super funds, with total funds under management of over $2tn, said international carbon credits were a key component of meeting Australia’s Paris targets. “They must have integrity and there should be limits on the amount you can use, but there is wide agreement that they have to be part of the policy toolkit,” Herd said. She noted that the Morrison government – despite its recent criticisms – had been “negotiating hard” for Article 6 of the Paris agreement “to support credible carbon markets which deliver access to international offsets for Australian business”. Herd pointed out that during the last climate change talks in Poland in December last year, that issue “was actually a core priority for Australian negotiators”. The Business Council of Australia and the AiGroup also pointed to their previous statements of support for the use of permits on Thursday. After days of the Coalition bombarding Labor’s climate policy, and in response to claims that business could be forced to spend between $25bn and $35bn on international credits to meet a 45% pollution reduction target, Bill Shorten muscled up on the hustings in Darwin on Thursday. Shorten abandoned the low-key demeanour he has made a study of projecting in the opening week of the campaign, and branded the government’s campaign against Labor’s climate change policies “malicious and stupid”. “It’s a malicious campaign by this government,” the Labor leader said. “What they want to do is scare Australians and say that it’s too hard to take action on climate change. “In climate change, there will never be enough figures to satisfy the climate sceptics. If you don’t believe in the science of climate change, no amount of evidence will ever convince you because, fundamentally, it’s a stupid position not to take action.” Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target of 45% and has signalled business will be permitted to use international permits to help meet its liabilities. Herd told Guardian Australia some of the cost estimates being deployed during the election campaign about permits appeared to be based on the European Unit Allowance, the compliance unit in the European Emissions Trading Scheme. “This is the most expensive reference price you could currently find,” she said. “Project-based international offset credits are usually much cheaper, especially if the company has in place a direct off-take agreement with the project”. She pointed out the local carbon price, the Australian Carbon Credit Unit, was also significantly cheaper than the European allowance price being quoted. “It looks like much of the commentary is potentially conflating the EU compliance price with international offsets, and then using it as a generic carbon price to calculate an inflated total cost of climate action for Australia. This is not helpful for anyone.” While Morrison is now pillorying the use of permits, the Coalition in 2017, when the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was environment minister, took a decision “in principle” to allow the use of foreign carbon credits. When it reviewed its existing suite of climate change policies in late 2017, the government accepted the use of permits and said a final decision “on the timing of use and appropriate quantity and quality limits” would be taken by 2020. On Thursday, on the hustings in Tasmania, Scott Morrison declared Shorten “can’t even tell you how much money that companies are going to have to send offshore”. “The Australian reports today $25bn, we actually think it’s higher than that. I understand it’s around $35bn that they will force companies to send offshore for those foreign carbon credits. “That could be invested here in Australia, in employing more people, increasing wages.” Morrison also appeared to leave open the option the government could consider nuclear energy during a radio interview in Tasmania. He said the government didn’t intend to subsidise nuclear energy but it was “not, not on the agenda”, even though there are legislative bans on nuclear energy. The prime minister suggested the test of whether a project could proceed was whether it could pay its own way, and he said the evidence to date suggested nuclear power was too expensive."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAmerica’s spying activities remind me of a paranoid husband who hires a private eye to keep constant tabs on his wife. It’s time for America’s foreign policy leaders to visit the shrink and to cure its neurosis.
Spiegel’s print edition cover story today features Snowden and Obama on the front cover:

This week’s SPIEGEL cover: “Alone against America. Edward Snowden: hero and traitor. How the US intelligence agency spied in Germany”.
Latest must read Spiegel story today here: www.spiegel.de/html. 
I keep hearing people like John Kerry, Diane Feinstein, Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, etc. say that espionage is all part of the game, and are all trying to put the full blame for the debacle on a single man: Edward Snowden. Few of us are so naïve to believe that. The truth is that US intelligence has run totally amok. It is no longer even able to distinguish friend from foe.

One essential part of successful intelligence is at least first having the cerebral intelligence of being able to distinguish between your friends and foes. If you can’t do that, then soon everyone starts appearing like a foe, and everything runs amok very quickly. Perhaps Snowden felt this was the case, and could not take what he saw anymore. Intelligence operations are supposed to be aimed at real foes like Iran, North Korea, China, or Venezuela and Cuba. Maybe competitors like India, Russia… But if you start treating all your allies like foes, and go to town on them like the Stasi, then you are going to find yourself alone and isolated real fast. That unfortunately has now happened.
If it had not been Snowden, then it would soon have been someone else. If Washington was trying to shed its image that it is corrupt to the core, it didn’t do itself any favors with this affair. A country that spies on its own citizens and allies on such a massive scale needs to ask itself some serious questions.
In the 20+ years I find myself in Europe, I cannot recall any situation where trust between Europe and America has disintegrated so much and so rapidly. Europeans, once in love with Obama, are struggling and unable come to terms with the new Obama reality – that they are dealing with a real Chicago-style politician, and not with a well-intentioned community organizer.
Spiegel presents here has a list of 17 quotes made by German leaders in response to the affair.
So how much damage has Snowden done? Perhaps the question that needs to be asked is: How much damage has America’s strayed foreign policy done to itself? One of the virtues of a real patriot is to have the courage to stand up and to point out the faults of your country and to demand that they be fixed. Patriots are what America needs more than ever today, and not the sort who cluelessly wave the stars and stripes on cue.
Washington needs a serious house-cleaning. Denying and scapegoating a lowly contractor is not going to work this time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Foundation for Freedom recently featured a speech by German journalist/author Michael Miersch, whose works often appear at FOCUS and who is a regular contributor at the Achse des Guten (Axis of the Good) blogsite. The title of his speech: “Courage for the Future”.
Rarely do I see a message delivered as powerfully as seen by Miersch here. Every young person in Germany should see this video.

Miersch tells us how that, by almost every measure, the world is a far better place today than is portrayed by Europe’s and Germany’s white-wine-sipping intellectuals.
In the clip, Miersch is first introduced by Spiegel journalist Alexander Neubacher, who brings up the Club of Rome book, “The Limits of Growth” and reminds the audience of some of the just utterly asinine predictions they made, and taken seriously by the public, 40 years ago.
Miersch, once a trendy pessimist journalist, became optimistic about the future in the 1990s and realized that German intellectuals have a completely disfigured, hopelessly pessimistic view of the world. What follows are some of the comments Miersch makes:
2.10: “For German intellectuals, optimism is a sort of American mental illness. This applies to journalists as well. Optimists are the ones with rose-colored glasses who don’t want to see just how horrible reality is: the American ‘think-positive’ gurus who either deny or are just plain uninformed.”
3.35: “Nothing sparks more outrage than optimism [in Europe].”
4:41: “I don’t view optimism for the future as an American mental illness, but as a justified life view.”
5.24: Miersch, once a trendy, pessimistic science journalist who believed all the end-of-the-world stories, tells how he turned optimist, inspired by a single innocent remark:
“One day in the 1990s in the springtime during an editorial meeting, in the middle of the city, the window was open and the song of a blackcap could be heard, to which a young intern completely inapproporiately said, ‘Hey listen, one of your extinct birds is out there tweeting again.’ The laughter triggered a sort of subversive effect and the blackcaps slowly began to change my mind.”
6.14: Miersch on his subsequent attempt by his magazine to report that things weren’t that bad, and what happens they reported good news to readers:
“…led to a wave of subscription cancellations, which quickly brought us on the list of endangered editors. It was clear that our subscribers didn’t want facts, and they begged for gloomy, hopeless, unsolvable disasters, and please, most of all, spare us the solutions.”
7.50: Miersch tells us the first law of the media: “Only bad news are news“.

8.00: Miersch then illustrates just how bad things have gotten in the media, citing a news report delivered German flagship ARD television, where the editors took good news and spun them into bad news. Miersch:
The news was actually good news: Life expectancy is rising, and not only in industrial countries, but also in developing countries. And how did the ARD News present this? ‘The global population is aging faster than ever!'”
8.25: He cites another media example, a headline about growing forest area in the Alps: “Forest growth threatens meadows!”
To illustrate the absurdity of the environmentalism, Miersch then tells the story of a reporter who showed how easy it is to get lots a people to sign a petition against “dihydrogen-monoxide” (H2O).
10.20: Miersch tells us that by all statistical measures, only one conclusion can be drawn: “The world is getting better – contrary to the impression conveyed by the media and newspapers.”
11.00 Miersch reminds the audience of the UN Millennium targets:
In the spring of 2012, the World Bank was able to announce that the most important Millenium target is already reached: the halving of global poverty by 2015. However, there were no headlines about this in Germany.”
11.50: Miersch tells the audience of the media reaction to the news from the MetOffice that global temperatures have stagnated: “This made front-page headlines in many papers in England, but in Germany there were no news about this.”
Miersch in his speech tells his audience that, no matter which measure you look at, the world’s ills are shrinking: war, mortality, disease, poverty, pollution, natural disasters, etc.. “This contradicts all the predictions from the intellectuals. There are even more polar bears today!”
14.20: Miersch then says that according to environmentalist ideology, communist East Germany should have developed into an ecological paradise:
No flights to Majorca, no kiwis from New Zealand, restricted individual mobility, no McDonalds, and highly restricted consumption. However what resulted was a huge garbage dump.”
16.35: Miersch says again that by any measure, the world is a far better place today, and that it is going to get better:
The world today could be better, and will be better if we just finally stopped bad-mouthing progress and viewing the human race as the plague of the planet. At its core, the green future-pessimistic and technologically hostile zeitgeist is an anti-humanistic ideology down to its roots. It’s only about restriction, limitation, and constant surveillance. Man is viewed as destructive and as a contaminator – in the best case as a consumer – and never as an inventor, creator.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite the hundreds of billions of dollars diverted into CO2 reduction, man-made CO2 gas emissions continue to rise unabated globally. The latest UNEP report says it sees very little chance of the world reaching CO2 reductions targets.
The ever widening gap
Yesterday the online Die Welt here reported that UNEP is warning of “a growing gap” between the target and actual emissions. The UN claims that only by meeting the CO2 reduction targets will it be possible to keep the planet from warming by 2°C by the years 2100. Alarmist scientists say 2°C of warming over pre-industrial level could send the planet over a tipping point. However the science underpinning those claims is very much in dispute.
The UN claims that it is necessary for the global population to reduce its CO2 emissions from 50.1 gigatonnes annually today to just 44 gigstonnes by 2020. However, rather than going down, CO2 emissions are growing, and doing so quite strongly despite the massive investments in renewable energies. Spiegel here writes that CO2 emissions are actually accelerating.
Die Welt adds that at the current rate of increase, CO2 emissions will rise to 59 gigatonnes by 2020, or more than 34% above the target of 44 gigatonnes. Therefore the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars on Co2 reduction has had no effect.

Shift moves to agriculture culprit
What’s remarkable about the latest UN report is that it shifts the focus to a new climate villain: agriculture. UNEP is now claiming that agriculture produces too much Co2 and that new agricultural techniques could lead to savings of 4.4 gigatonnes. The potential here, they claim, is greater than the potential in the electricity sector, where a maximum of 3.9 gigatonnes can be saved. Large CO2 savings can also be achieved sustainable forestry management, the report says.
UNEP completely ignores 15-year temperature stagnation
Die Welt points out that the UNEP in its latest report ignored the 15-year warming stop altogether:

The debate on the stagnation in climate warming over the past 15 years and on man’s share in warming was completely ignored in the calculations by the UNEP: The scientists continued to argue within the established paradigm of a manmade climate change.”

The UNEP is obviously living on another planet and refuses to believe that the climate catastrophe is not happening.

"The Italian photojournalist Federico Borella has won the top prize in the Sony World Photography Awards, including a $25,000 (£19,000) cash prize. His photo-series Five Degrees was commended by judges for sensitively documenting a little-known but tragic side-effect of climate change: male suicide among Indian farmers.  Borella is a photojournalist with over 10 years’ experience, who has worked across the world. In 2015, he embarked on a trip to India to photograph victims of acid attacks. While there, he became increasingly aware of extreme weather in India but wanted to tell the story in a different way. “I wanted to be able to show how our choices in the west affect people in places like India,” Borella said. “I felt obliged – but I didn’t want to produce cliched photos of desperate conditions in India. I wanted this to tell a personal story.” He set about researching and months later he stumbled across a paper from the University of California, Berkeley, documenting a correlation between climate change and almost 60,000 Indian farmers taking their own lives. “For me, this story spoke to the connection between environmental destruction and self-destruction. I felt obliged to tell it. I wanted to show how our choices in the west are having these huge consequences for people in the rest of the world, in terms of climate change.” His photographs, telling the story of a farming community in Tamil Nadu facing its worst drought in 140 years, were praised by the judges who said it instantly stood out as winner. The chair of judges Mike Trow, who was previously a picture editor for British Vogue, said Borella’s work was urgently needed, adding: “Borella documented this with incredible sensitivity, imagination and a direct aesthetic that we all agreed worked on a number of levels.” Borella wanted the photographs to speak to the absence created by suicide, and decided to photograph some of the widows, choosing a square format to create intimacy. Although it was his first time entering the competition, he was quietly confident because of the personal power of the stories he was capturing. “Of course it was a beautiful surprise when I got the call,” he said, adding “but as a journalist, you can recognise when you are really on to something that is outstanding. I really felt something about this project. I knew it had the possibility of raising huge awareness.” “Every story of every widowed woman was so intimate and so moving,” he said, talking about a woman whose husband killed himself in front of the bank whose loan he could not replay, by drinking the pesticide that he used for his crops. Borella found it difficult not being able to immediately help the women that he was photographing, but hopes the award will bring international attention to their stories. Alongside winning Photographer of the Year, he also won in the Professional Documentary category."
"Donald Trump issued on Monday an Earth Day proclamation that omitted any mention of climate change or the cavalcade of environmental threats posed by deforestation, species loss and plastic pollution. The president chose instead to praise the benefits of a “strong market economy”. In response, one leading climate scientist said Trump’s environmental policy was “in many cases the antithesis of protection”. The executive director of the Sierra Club said Trump was “the worst president for the environment our nation has ever had”. Trump praised the “abundant beauty and life-sustaining bounty” of the American environment but did not echo growing warnings from scientists over rising temperatures or the precipitous decline of many species. “Environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand,” Trump said in his message for Earth Day, a global event held to support environmental protection annually since 1970. “A strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation. My administration is committed to being effective stewards of our environment while encouraging opportunities for American workers and their families.” Trump added: “At the same time that our nation is experiencing historic economic and job growth, our air and water quality ranks among the highest in the world.” He stated that his administration has “expanded support for conservation of land, water and wildlife”. Last year, US government scientists issued a 1,000-page climate change assessment that warned the country faces hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses due to rising temperatures, flooding and wildfires. Thousands of Americans are expected to die in worsening heatwaves, with diseases such as West Nile, dengue fever, chikungunya and Lyme set to expand in range as temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change. “The fact that they’re not mentioning what many consider to be the gravest existential threat facing humanity is a good indication of the priorities of this administration,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. “The clear priority of the administration is extracting unsustainable short-term profits from the environment, which is in many cases the antithesis of environmental protection. This is not surprising.” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, called Trump “the worst president for the environment our nation has ever had”, adding: “He has regularly and consistently prioritized the profits of corporate polluters over clean air, clean water and the health of our communities. “The fact that he continues to ignore the climate crisis endangers the nation and will be viewed by history with scorn.” Trump has routinely disparaged climate science and has attempted to dismantle every major policy aimed at lowering planet-warming emissions, favoring a watered down alternative his administration admits would cause an extra 1,400 deaths a year from air pollution. In June 2017, he announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate deal. The administration has thrown open vast tracts of public land and almost all US waters to oil, gas and coalmining, removed protections from some prized landscapes and scrapped rules that stopped mining waste being dumped into rivers. Trump, who recently erroneously claimed that wind turbines cause cancer, has repeatedly stated that the US has some of the cleanest air and water in the world. In fact, while the US’s air is generally far healthier than growing economic powers such as China and India, the American Lung Association has pointed out that four in 10 Americans still live in counties with harmful levels of smog. Millions of Americans are also exposed to drinking water containing industrial chemicals, while lead in water remains a widespread issue five years after the notorious contamination in Flint, Michigan."

"The global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform, the governors of the Bank of England and France’s central bank have warned, writing in the Guardian. In an article published in the Guardian on Wednesday aimed at the international financial community, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, said financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world had to “raise the bar” to avoid catastrophe. They said: “As financial policymakers and prudential supervisors we cannot ignore the obvious physical risks before our eyes. Climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a central role to play.” The warning comes as concern over the impact of climate change and the lack of urgent action is increasing, reflected in the Extinction Rebellion protests and schoolchildren’s strikes across the world. The heads of two of the world’s most influential central banks urged other financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, while also calling for more collaboration between nations on the issue. They warned that a “massive reallocation of capital” was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2°C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement, with the banking system required to play a pivotal role. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” Carney and De Galhau said. Climate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses. There are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses. Carney has previously warned that plunging sales of diesel cars, due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had knock-on effects for manufacturers and the wider economy, are an example of this in action. Banks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed. The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change. Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses. Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself without tougher regulation being introduced. Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “Central banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem. The question is whether they have the right balance between being thought leaders on this issue and identifying problems and taking action.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMarc Morano of Climate Depot presents his written testimony at the Congressional Hearing on Climate Change in Fairview, West VA of May 30, 2013. This represents just the latest milestone on how far the global warming science has collapsed in the face of growing scientific skepticism over the recent years.
Ten years ago and more, the scales were actually tipped completely in favor of the warmists. The theory of man-made global warming at the time was rather new to the public and seemed plausible. The planet had just seen a couple of decades of strong warming, and it all appeared to fit together. Yet, much of the science was still poorly understood, and, as is always the case in science, skepticism refused to let go.
In the beginning the number of skeptic voices represented only a small and cautious minority – only a few scientists and blogsites were actively challenging the theory. By the early and mid 2000s, serious challenges began mounting. For example Steve McIntyre exposed Michael Mann’s hockey stick as a worthless statistical artifact, Michael Crichton had written a bestselling thriller critical of global warming, and skeptic blogs capable of reaching broad audiences were beginning to communicate skeptical science and findings. The skeptics grew in numbers, yet resembled more a disorganized motley crew who possessed limited public communication power.
But that changed in the late 2000s. Suddenly the Earth had stopped warming for 10 years, winters turned harsh, and lots of skeptic blogs were coming online and piling on. That the IPCC 4AR of 2007 was riddled with errors, exaggerations, and relied on a lot of gray literature had become clear and thus seriously damaged the UN body. The IPCC was humiliated and on the defensive.
The release of the Climategate e-mails and failure of the Copenhagen Conference made the situation even more desperate for the warmists. Claims of broad agreement on the science were exposed as having been premature and wildly exaggerated. The science was coming apart. All that was left was to effectively communicate that reality to the public.
Expert communicator Marc Morano routs the warmists
The effective communication of skeptical science got a major boost when Marc Morano stepped onto the stage. Although Morano had already been active in debunking the AGW scare and the notion of consensus as Communications Director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee under Senator James Inhofe in the 2000s, it wasn’t until he published his award-winning Climate Depot climate science/news clearinghouse site in 2009 that the message began to be heard in earnest.
With Morano, the science debunking the AGW claim had now found a powerful and talented PR expert who effectively communicated the inconvenient climate science findings to the media and public. Often we find Morano on television, radio and in the print media, nationally and internationally. Since Morano helped fire up the climate science communication machinery, the debate for the skeptics has turned into a virtual rout of the warmists.
In his written congressional testimony, Morano writes “that on virtually every claim — from A-Z — the claims of the promoters of man-made climate fears are failing, and in many instances the claims are moving in the opposite direction. The global warming movement is suffering the scientific death of a thousand cuts.” He adds “these are not good times for the promoters of global warming” and “the idea that CO2 is the tail that wags the dog is no longer scientifically tenable.”
Just how bad have things gotten for the global warming scientists? Morano adds in his testimony:

Gore and the UN IPCC are now reduced to pointing to every storm, flood, hurricane or tornado as proof of man-made global warming. The UN has been reduced to blaming man-made global warming for prostitution. See: Climate Astrology — ‘It Has Been Foretold’ of Extreme Weather: ‘UN IPCC science has a status similar to interpretations of Nostradamus and the Mayan calendars’ & Climate Astrology borrows from the past: ‘Before That Witch Moved Into The Neighborhood, We Never Had Bad Weather Or Disease’.”
Morano adds later on:
UN IPCC scientist Kevin Trenberth has said every weather event now influenced by global warming. […] They are turning themselves into anti-science activists. […] Their theory that somehow the weather is unusual that we have a ‘new normal’ — not only does it fail to convince — it becomes a laughing stock when you start actually looking at the hard data’.”
Not only have climate scientists and CO2 activists desperately used single weather events to defend their crumbling science, they also have spent the last years trying to launch smear campaigns against the skeptics, claiming they are massively funded by Big Oil, Koch Industries and coal. This is only a diversion from the real debate and scientific data.
In truth the warmists and global warming activists have been showered with billions in funding, compared to only a few million finding their way to the hands of skeptics in recent years. So why are the skeptics drubbing the warmists in the debate, even though they are outfunded thousands to one? It’s called: focusing on the scientific data. Period.
Smear jobs, weather claims, appeals to authority, and models in the end are admissions of defeat.
In his testimony, Morano sticks to the science, citing almost 2 dozen renowned international scientists, e.g.: Bengtsson, de Freitas, Plimer, Svensmark, Happer, Schmitt, Levitin, Curry, Christy, Pielke Jr., to name some. In the testimony, we do not see Morano using the diversionary tactic of questioning the billions in funding behind warmists scientists and activist groups. Keep the focus on the science and data!
On energy Morano reminds Congress that coal and “other carbon based forms of energy have been one of the greatest liberators of mankind in the history of our planet. Is it greedy to want heat, A/C, lower infant mortality, longer life expectancy? Coal is the moral choice.” Little wonder one coal power plant is coming online every week in China and that even green Germany is burning more coal once again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ever excellent Achse Des Guten (Axis of the Good) has what is probably one of the most stinging criticisms of the solar industry I’ve read to date (and I’ve read some awfully harsh ones up to now). The latest is authored by Dr. Wolfram Weimer, a leading German publisher of news and economics magazines.

Wolfram Weimer calls Germany’s solar subsidies “a capital destroyer of historic dimensions”. Photo credit: Reto Klar, FOCUS, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
His latest piece is titled: Das sozialistische Solar-Desaster (The Socialist Solar Disaster). German solar energy and the EEG renewable feed-in act, once hailed as examples for the rest of the world to follow, are described by Weimer as a sure road to economic ruin.
Any country or state leader considering following the path of Germany may want to contact Weimer first. It may save you billions.
Over the past two years, dozens of German solar manufacturers have been shuttered, among them big ones like Solon, Q-Cells, Solar Millenium and Conergy. Recently electrical engineering giant Bosch announced that its solar operations had lost 1 billion euros, read here.
Recently German solar leader Solarworld reported it was on the brink of insolvency, drowning in billions of red ink, and that its high-flying CEO Frank Asbeck was begging the country of Qatar for a bailout.
The overall result under the bottom line for the German solar industry, despite all the massive subsidies, is devatstation. Weimar writes (my emphasis):
More than 100 billion euros in solar power subsidies have been wasted, and not a single target of the transition to solar energy has been reached. […}

A chain reaction of insolvencies and bankruptcies litters the landscape, more than 30,000 jobs have been lost. […] The German solar industry has in the meantime become a capital destroyer of historic dimensions. […]
The existing solar socialism shows where this is all headed – to a world of bankruptcies, rising electricity rates and panhandling trips to Qatar.”
Weimer writes that subsidizing industries is the sure way to ruin them.
In many fields of machine building, Germany is the global leader. And it is precisely in the fields where billions in forced payments are mobilized does one become a loser.
The solar ruin did not happen despite the subsidies, but it was because of them that it turned into a disaster. It is the very combination of eco-ideology and central planning methods that assured the collapse.
The state robs the market of the possibility to develop cheaper and more competitive power generation. Instead green bureaucrats decide what share each different type of energy is to have. Like in the five-year plans of the Soviets, quotas, targets, and amounts are prescribed inside central ministries. This ecological central planning and its subsidy monopoly continuously erodes away the market price mechanisms.”
For readers who are interested in finding out more about the total  failures of subsidzed renewable energy, you’ll find dozens of posts I’ve written over the last couple of years in the right side bar under: Categories – Alternative Energies.
Meanwhile leaders from 35 nations are now meeting in Petersberger in Berlin in order to find ways to get the whole world to embark on the “road to ruin”.

"This morning two very different kinds of harbingers brought us a message of climate doom. One was a colourful crowd of climate activists called Extinction Rebellion, who have been blocking traffic in London for the last two days, and who are today planning further “economic disruption” aimed directly at the city’s jugular: the tube and rail networks. The other was less expected. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, along with the governor of France’s central bank, Villeroy de Galhau, has written an article for the Guardian warning banks and insurers that climate change threatens them too. In the wallet. Insurance claims from droughts and floods are bad for business. Then there’s the fact that governments are now taking carbon emissions seriously, which means companies that don’t adjust will likely be adjusted out of existence. And at a certain point, when climate catastrophe deepens, there will be a “Minsky moment” – a sudden collapse in asset prices, true economic disruption.  It feels like an important moment, this joining together of the solemn and besuited with the members of a group last seen supergluing their arses to the gallery glass in the House of Commons. It amplifies the message. Tackling climate change is, after all, about psychology. How should one talk about catastrophe? Make a problem too big and people will simply ignore it (just look at Brexit). Tell them it is too late, and the human instinct is to give up, rather than make vast efforts to save the scraps. And guilt doesn’t work on most people either – they are too wrapped up in their daily concerns. This is true of institutions too: David Cameron’s government was keen on green measures for a while, but only until something more important came along. But there are certain milestones movements can hit, when it feels as if they are on their way. One is that they become cool. This happened to the modern feminist movement around the time Caitlin Moran’s book How to Be a Woman hit the shelves in 2011. It has gradually happened to climate activism too. Veganism is no longer something to sneer at. Celebrities who might have once tried to avoid looking too “hempy” now fall over themselves to burnish their climate credentials. But an even more important milestone – when you know the movement has really picked up speed – comes when it directly threatens those in power. For feminism, again, this was #MeToo: the fear it has inspired among powerful men has done more for equality than decades of gentle awareness raising and women-friendly schemes. And now Carney is framing climate change in a language banks understand: as a threat to profits. It will add to other messages reaching the city. Five Volkswagen executives face up to a decade in prison for their role in faked diesel emission tests – a scandal that has also taken a chunk out of car sales. The investor Legal and General is cutting out companies they judge bad for the climate. For the planet, a turning point might just be at hand. • Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent"

Share this...FacebookTwitterEven the prominent German online DIE WELT reports here that Pacific islands are not in danger because they are growing and keeping ahead of rising sea levels. When Germany starts reporting such things, then you know the warmists are sinking fast.According to a very basic but indisputable study, scientists Paul Kench of the University of Auckland and Arthur Webb of the Geosciences Commission of the Fiji Islands simply compared aerial photographs of 27 islands taken in the 1950s and compared them to satellite photos and determined that only 4 islands have gotten smaller. DIE WELT reports:
Climate change and rising sea levels have no effect because many Pacific islands have been  growing over the last 60 years, rather than sinking. That’s the result of a study that contradicts all expectations, reports the British magazine New Scientist.
23 islands were as big or even bigger.
So you mean the Pacific islands aren’t sinking! Afraid not. You AGW alarmists have been screwed again.
The islands are growing because they are made up of dying coral reefs. The coral reefs are living organisms, and so they keep reproducing and thus keep adding more material to the ever-growing islands.

Webb also notes that hurricane Bebe washed roughly 140 hectares of sediment onto the island, increasing its size by a whopping 10% in a single shot. Now there’s new beachfront property for the island. DIE WELT writes:
The study shows that rising sea levels don’t always threaten these islands. ‘Everyone claimed that sea levels are rising and the islands are drowning. But they are not. Sea levels are rising, but the islands are responding accordingly.’
But the scientists warn!!
If the sea level rises more quickly, then sediment accumulation will not keep up and the islands will drown.
Really? Well, I’m sure the inhabitants are just shaking at the knees. Don’t count on it. As the islands continue to grow, they are most likely laughing at the rest of the world, for having suckered it with yet another phony scare story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreen Radio of the Umweltbundesamt – UBA – (German Federal Department of the Environment) recently had a radio interview with Henrik Kirchhof, some climate expert for the UBA I guess. Topic: Why has there been no warming in 15 years? 
The German government finally concedes.
The host of the interview starts by telling the audience that “climate scientists have come under pressure because the average temperature indeed has not risen in 15 years“. Kirchhof:
In the years leading up to the year 2000, the temperature curve rose very sharply. But since then it isn’t rising so, in fact it’s not rising at all, the curve. The average temperature has stagnated at a very high level – we sort of have a plateau, and that during a time when CO2 emissions have risen considerably.”
Kirchhof then claims the 15-year period of stagnation is indeed relatively short, and, to add authority to this, Prof. Jochem Marotzke of the warmist Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg provides an audio comment:
What we are seeing here is a relatively short-term fluctuation, If one really wants to know how CO2 and global temperature are related, then you have to look at a longer time period.”
Marotzke refuses to say how long, though. We do know that CO2 was at about 280 ppm for 1000 years before the Industrial Revolution, and that during this time the global temperature fluctuated more than 1°C (in sync with solar activity). Of course Marotzke only wants to go back to 1900, as beyond that there is no correlation with CO2.
Kirchhof then adds (my emphasis):
…there is no doubt about the greenhouse effect, but even so this warming pause is remarkable because the climate scientists with all their models did not expect this.”
At this point Kirchhof of Green radio of the German Federal Department of the Environment are finally admitting that there are suddenly many more unknowns than they first thought, that the warmist scientists are indeed baffled, and that the science is not settled after all.
At the 2-minute mark, a somewhat surprised host is forced to ask how can it be that the temperature has not risen even though more CO2 is being emitted into the atmosphere. Here Kirchhof, in summary, admits they don’t know why:
Yeah, that’s the big question. The scientists here are not completely sure. But there are many possible explanations.”
Many possible explanations? That means they don’t have freaking clue! When it comes to complex systems like climate, it takes years and years of analyses and observation to untangle it all. Kirchhof (my emphasis):
A big role may be played by the oceans, which possibly are absorbing more heat, and so the additional heat is no longer being taken up by the atmosphere but instead is moving into the water. This can be measured. However if these surface water temperatures increased sharply until 15 years ago but now have stagnated, then it means that the ocean is absorbing more heat than it did before. You can suspect this, it’s very plausible, but you cannot prove it because of methodology reasons, says Jochem Marotzke.”
Marotzke:
The problem is, although it is plausible, and it is in principle in agreement with model calculations, the problem is that we do not have enough good measurements from the past to say: ‘Ah, back then the deep oceans absorbed less heat and today it is taking in more heat. These observations are simply missing.”
It makes us wonder with so much missing data and so many unknowns, how could they even have dared to think the science was settled a few years ago? Suddenly they tell us they don’t know squat, that they are completely baffled, and that they are scrambling for explanations!

//-->




The host then asks Kirchhof if there are other possible explanations. Kirchhof:
Yes. For example they have measured that the stratosphere has gotten drier. And when there is less water vapor up there in the stratosphere, then less heat is radiated back down. However, the scientists who have found this out have themselves said this effect is too small and only accounts for a quarter of the stopped warming.”
They can’t find the heat. Unknowns, mysteries, surprises…such is the life of a closed-minded climate scientist. But apart from all that, they are sure of the science.
The host then asks about the remaining three quarters of the heat. Kirchhof plays the aerosol card, which the IPCC loves to play whenever cooling isn’t supposed to happen, like from 1945 to 1975:
Yes. there’s also a third theory that sounds plausible for laypeople, namely that more dust particles, ‘dirt’ in everyday terms, is high up in the atmosphere. As a result, less solar radiation reaches the Earth and so as a whole it gets cooler.”
Kirchhof then goes on to say that Chinese and Indian power plants may be to blame for this, and says that polluting the atmosphere is not the way to solve climate change.
The host then brings up the excellent question of how long a pause in warming is necessary before climate scientists really have to rethink their science. Kirchhof:
There are in fact prognoses that this plateau could go on another five years, and if that indeed occurs, and meteorologist Jochem Marotzke also says the same, then there is something seriously wrong with the models, also when certain fluctuations cannot be precisely forecast.”
Five more years and all their arguments will disappear. And in ten years the climate scientists are going to be left standing there looking like total asses – because it’s not going to get warmer for another 30 years. The PDO, AMO and sun are all now beginning their cold phases simultaneously. One only needs to look at the past winters to see the first indications. If one major volcano blows then we are very likely back to the Little Ice Age conditions of the 17th century.
========================================
UPDATE: Meteorologist Joe Bastardi just tweeted: “IF THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE 1950S THEY WOULD SEE THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR
THEIR BLUNDER”
========================================
The models would have had much better results had the scientists taken the ocean cycles into account. But they refused to consider them because the warming that occurred from 1980 to 2000 would have had to be assigned in part to the warm phase of the ocean cycles, and correspondingly less so for CO2. The scientists were too obsessed with blaming every warming on CO2. Result: the climate scientists are left standing on the verge of humiliation today. All this is explained in detail by Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning in their book: Die kalte Sonne.
It should therefore come as no surprise that the only model that is correct today so far is the one proposed by Lüning and Vahrenholt, who took ocean and solar cycles into account. The UBA would do the German taxpayers a huge favor by reading this book.
Also crackpot scientists out there should really think twice before opening up their big, alarmist mouths in the near future. Us skeptics aren’t going to let you off the hook by any means in 5 years time. Whether you get tarred and feathered in 2020 depends on what you say today. Do you really want to become the David Viners and Mojib Latifs of the future?
Amazingly, the alarmist scientists are looking at everything except what’s really obvious: the sun. Solar activity during the 20th century was at it’s highest level in 500 or more years, but today it is at its lowest level in some 200 years. Gee, you think that could matter? The data clearly show that it did in the past.
To sum it up, it is amusing to see the UBA all baffled, surprised, and now scurrying for explanations. My feeling is that unless certain people smarten up real quick, there is going to be a lot to laugh about in the years ahead.

"Britain is set for a sunny Easter bank holiday weekend, with temperatures potentially breaking national records. Temperatures reached 25C (77F) on Good Friday and were forcecast to hit 27C on Monday.  The Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said there would be dry, sunny and very warm conditions with temperatures continuing to rise slightly on Saturday and Sunday to a possible 27C on Easter Monday. The Met Office said it would be “a glorious day” in most areas, but that outbursts of rain might clip north-west Scotland on Saturday. On Saturday, temperatures broke records in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with both areas seeing their warmest ever Easter Saturday. Temperatures reached 23.2C in Scotland, compared to a previous record high of 21.4C. For Northern Ireland it was 21C on Saturday, compared to the previous record of 19.4C. Easter Sunday and Monday records are likely to be broken, according to the Met Office. The warmest Easter on record was on Easter Sunday in 1949, when the temperature was recorded at 29.4C in Camden Square, north London.In 2011, the temperature reached 26.9C at St James’s Park in central London on Good Friday, and 25.3C on Easter Sunday and 24C on Easter Monday, both in the Solent. Roberts said these last two temperatures were the ones that could beexceeded this weekend. She said the highest temperature on Friday was 24.5C, recorded at Wisley in Surrey. Southern England and south Wales could experience mist and fog, but that would dissipate pretty quickly in the morning with the strong sunshine. Roberts said cloud and rain would disappear by Monday. The warmest Easter Mondays recorded nationally were 21.4C in Culzean Castle, Scotland, in 2014, 23.2C in Nantmoor, Wales, in 1984, and 21.1C in Knockarevan, Northern Ireland, also in 1984. One person tweeted: “Last night is the very first night this year I’ve slept with the window open. And how did I spend the hottest day of the year so far? At work!” Others expressed concern about the high temperatures, with one person tweeting: “I think the new story here is the fact that the planet is about to be incinerated with climate change.” Hundreds of demonstrators were in London this weekend as part of the Extinction Rebellion protest over climate change. The Metropolitan police said 106 people had been arrested on Friday, bringing the total number of arrests to 682 since the action started on Monday. Emma Thompson, who joined the climate action protest, told activists her generation had failed young people."
"As the top Republican on a congressional climate change committee, Louisiana’s Garret Graves is a surprising pick. Other Republicans on the Democrat-initiated panel have publicly doubted climate change science. Donald Trump has called global warming a hoax and the party as a whole is seen by many as an obstacle to tackling climate change. But not Graves. The third-term lawmaker sees rising temperatures as a direct and urgent threat to his state and district, which stretches from the capital, Baton Rouge, to the Gulf coast. He acknowledges fossils fuels are heating the planet, though he thinks Democrats’ plans to quickly shift away from them are unrealistic, and he hasn’t yet offered alternative proposals of his own.  Speaking in his Capitol Hill office – with signed football helmets for both Louisiana State University and the New Orleans Saints behind him – Graves chooses his words carefully. He leans over occasionally to whisper to his press aide about the most diplomatic way to phrase a thought, a skill that will be critical to his mission. “Years ago I said that I thought the Republican position on climate change is unsustainable,” Graves said. “Just sitting around totally denying the science is an unsustainable position.” Given his home state, Graves’s deviation from his party is perhaps not surprising. Louisiana is losing a football field of land every 100 minutes as its shoreline is sinking and seas are rising – a reality Graves can’t ignore. Damage from hurricanes and more intense flooding are already costing the state. Graves said people worried about climate change could emphasize conservation, efficiency and innovation, which he sees as Republican principles. They could talk about cutting electricity bills, rather than just cutting emissions. They could focus on proposals that wouldn’t undercut US competitiveness, which he said Trump is “laser-focused” on promoting. “We can be talking about the exact same thing but explaining it differently,” he said. Graves supports planning to adapt to climate change and to protect people from its worst effects. He wants to prepare Louisiana for a changed world. Graves once introduced an amendment to count his state’s Cajuns as an endangered species to overcome regulatory hurdles to coastal restoration efforts. And he acknowledges pollution reductions are also necessary. But at the same time, he represents an oil and gas state. He declined to specify how much or how quickly he thinks the US should cut fossil fuel use or say whether natural gas should ever be phased out. More and more Republicans may find themselves walking that fine line, as Americans see climate change in daily life and Democrats aim to make it a 2020 election issue. Graves said he accepted the committee position on the issue so he could ensure that Congress is planning for the risks Louisiana is already facing. He likens the idea of fighting climate change without also preparing for it, to standing on railroad tracks facing a swiftly approaching train. He said he found Trump receptive to planning for extreme weather when he talked to him at a bill signing ceremony at the White House. “The president is a numbers person. When you look at Harvey, Maria, Michael, Florence, you look at what’s happening in the midwest right now with the rivers … the president doesn’t deny the economics of making principled flood protection strategies,” he said. Graves, 47, was appointed by a Republican governor to run the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, where he negotiated with oil company BP over damages from the Gulf oil spill. Graves was born near the bayou but loves the mountains. His children are named after favorite peaks. In 1990, he stopped eating meat as part of a bet when he was at a base camp. He outlasted his friends, eventually adding back in seafood because he said there’s “only so much tofu and cottage cheese” a person can eat, particularly in Louisiana. But even though he stands out in the Republican party, he is hardly likely to embrace such Democratic policies as the Green New Deal (GND) any time soon. On the committee, Graves said Republicans plan to push Democrats to consider the costs and effectiveness of specific proposals, and he criticized the GND that many Democratic presidential contenders have endorsed as “utopian”. Despite Graves’s love of nature, he still got a 0 out of 100 on the League of Conservation Voters’ scorecard. The oil and gas industry is huge to Louisiana. And the “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that Graves and House Republican leaders promote includes burning natural gas, which is less damaging than coal but still heats the planet. Asked when the US might transition away from natural gas, Graves said “that’s crystal ball material” and that “natural gas is going to play a vital role in our energy policy for decades”. He thinks the international Paris agreement – which Trump plans to exit – would have been bad for US competitiveness because China and India will keep burning coal. But on the core science behind global warming Graves has little doubt. Even if the US used only renewable power starting next year, he said “the seas are still going to rise, according to climate models. And the temperature’s going to get warmer, according to climate models.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterCOP 19 in Warsaw is fast approaching and part of the ritual is the ringing of climate disaster alarms, much like churches ring their church bells on Christmas Eve.
The Die Welt article here tries to explain to readers why the climate catastrophe is still approaching even if temperatures haven’t risen in 15 years. The German daily tries to give the impression that it has the explanation for the temperature stagnation, but later in the article we see that it concedes it’s pretty much all speculation.
Die Welt writes that the high temperatures are hiding in the ocean depths and that it’s only a question of time before they reappear in the atmosphere with a vengeance. The German daily quotes alarmist scientists who claim that skeptics are “misinterpreting the data” when they insist the warming has stopped.
So where has the heat gone? Die Welt quotes Stefan Rahmstorf and a TV weatherman to explain it:
In the oceans. The world’s oceans are the biggest heat storages. When vertical currents such as those of the recent years provide for a colder sea surface, the oceans are able to take up more heat. […] ‘The greenhouse effect has not let up; it’s just that there is now more heat in the deep ocean and less at the surface,’ says climate scientist Rahmstorf.”
German TV weatherman Sven Plöger adds:
“The southern oceans are able to absorb an unbelievable amount of energy and thus act as a buffer.”
So the mystery is solved, Die Welt tries to have us believe. Well, not really because Die Welt then concedes that the explanations are only “plausible” at best.

Later in the article Die Welt does call the stagnation “baffling” and even offers other explanations for the warming stop that it calls “plausible”, like Chinese aerosols possibly dimming the atmosphere. Obviously their use of the world “plausible” implies that the ocean and aerosol explanations are not much more than guesses as to what is happening. This is hardly what anyone would call settled science.
Peeved Rahmstorf: skeptics have scored success
And Die Welt is forced to admit:
The fact is also: The projections from scientists have failed to forecast the stop in the temperature rise.”
Die Welt adds that warmists like Rahmstorf are highly irritated by the mileage skeptics have derived from the warming stop:
Scientist Rahmstorf is peeved by the headlines made by skeptics over the past months over the supposed pause in climate change. Those who put too much emphasis on the phenomenon are confusing ‘the noise of natural variations with the signal of global warming’.”
Rahmstorf adds that this has been “a success scored by the skeptics who are trying to seed doubt over global warming using arguments that aren’t really serious.”

In it she describes the events of December 23 that led to a delay in the departure of the vessel, and thus causing it to lose the race against the invading sea ice.

The first drama of the day was the sinking – or almost! – of one of the Argos. The Argos are designed to be amphibious – just. They were launched today off the ship – and two of the three made it safely being towed by a zodiac the 50 metres or so to shore. The third was towed too fast it seems – and water came over the bonnet / bow, flooding both the engine and the vehicle itself. Ben tried in vain to bail out with a spade and luckily they made it to shore before the vehicle sunk entirely. Ben ended up rather wet too, but similarly to Mary, not submerged enough for the lifejacket to come into play. Sadly Argo engines don’t take too kindly to being submerged… the ships engineers are still working on it and not very optimistic about its prospects.
The third drama of the day is the one which is still unfolding. Because of the Argo mishap we got off late, and had one less vehicle to ferry people to and fro.I’m told the Captain was becoming rather definite late in the afternoon that we needed to get everyone back on board ASAP because of the coming weather and the ice closing in. As I write we are continuing to make extremely slow progress through what looks like a winter alpine snow field – it’s yet another surreal part of this journey that we are in a ship trying to barge our way through here! I’m sure the Captain would have been much happier if we had got away a few hours earlier. Maybe we would have made it through the worst before it consolidated as much as it has with the very cold south- easterly winds blowing the ice away from the coast, around and behind us as well as ahead.
We’ll see where we are in the morning – it may be a very white Christmas Eve!
PS. 9.30am 24/12. We have moved less than a kilometre over night, and are now stationary in a sea of ice. The word is that we are not stuck, merely waiting for a weather change. It seems to me that we are having the quintessential Antarctic experience.J Stay tuned.”
Clearly the captain of the ship had gotten antsy and wanted to leave hours sooner. But the passengers’ escapades and dithering likely became the decisive screw-up that led to them getting trapped in ice for 10 days and turning the expedition into a debacle for the world to see.

"When Mark Carney sounded a klaxon on Wednesday, the blare was unmistakable; yet it was as polite and moderately voiced an alarm as you might expect from the leader of an institution at the heart of the establishment. The governor of the Bank of England and his French counterpart warned that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change. Writing in the Guardian, they told companies: “Fail to adjust … fail to exist.”.  There could hardly be a greater contrast than between Mr Carney’s intervention and the thousands of Extinction Rebellion activists disrupting central London and other cities worldwide. Earlier this month they grabbed attention by supergluing themselves to the public gallery in the House of Commons, semi-naked. Mr Carney is unlikely to shed his suit for the cause. But the activists’ peaceful campaign of civil disobedience is essentially a louder, brighter, less genteel version of the same essential message: “This is an emergency.”  Who is more likely to save us? Even supporters of Extinction Rebellion have voiced doubt about specific tactics, including the intention to use mass arrests as leverage for change. But a bigger debate underlies these. It has dogged the activism from which the movement explicitly draws inspiration, including the suffragettes and the civil rights movement in the US. The question is whether real change is achieved on the streets or in the corridors of power; whether moderates or militants prevail; and whether progress is made through careful negotiation and the pursuit of acceptable compromises, or radical demands which rupture the status quo. The truth is that both are needed. Young people have led the way. The 1.4 million who took part in last month’s school strikes have grown up learning that climate change is a fact, not a theory; it is built into their worldview. They know that they will pay the price for our inaction. They bat away excuses. That sense of impatience always pushes social change, but is all the more critical in this case, when every delay increases the risk of disaster. But their urgency is felt more broadly. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was an early backer of Extinction Rebellion. An 80-year-old woman locked herself to the bottom of a lorry because, she said, “I refuse to leave a barren and broken world for my beautiful grandchildren.” Even inconvenienced drivers have voiced support. The shift can be seen at an institutional level too. Businesses are waking up to the costs, financial and physical, of the changes. Whether for reasons of strategy, sympathy or both, the police approach to these largely white and middle-class protesters has been unusually light-touch: hundreds of arrests, but made gradually, and with plenty of amicable chat on the sidelines. Yet most politicians remain shockingly timid. Labour’s declaration of a climate emergency and promise of a “green industrial revolution” is encouraging; on Wednesday protesters chained themselves to a fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, saying they hoped to persuade him to go further. True, voters who voice alarm at rising temperatures can be equally vocal about rising fuel prices. But the public mood is shifting. Though the climate change deniers are entrenched, and have drawn encouragement from the election and actions of Donald Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and others, the alarm about global warming is rising worldwide. According to Pew research, Britons now list it as the top threat to the UK. The evidence is mounting, and each grain of it is more alarming. The changes are felt, as well as read about, in the form of heatwaves, storms and other extreme weather. There is nothing moderate about the approaching catastrophe. Adaptation to rising temperatures is inevitable; accommodation with the forces fuelling them will be disastrous. Social movements exert pressure on internal processes of change, which are inherently incremental and cautious. That parts of the establishment are now pressing for action on climate change is critical. That others are pushing from the outside is at least equally so."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German language Voice of Russia here wrote yesterday that US scientists had recorded, by satellite, a new all-time record low of -91.2°C in Antarctica. The reading was taken at the Japanese research station Dome Fuji, 3786 meters above sea level in 2004. The old record was -89.2 set in 1983.
Where’s the warming!

The English-language Russian RT News here writes about the new all-time record low for the planet Earth as well, but states that it is also being disputed by one Russian scientist. The RT (my emphasis):
American researchers from the US National Snow and Ice Data  Centre (NSIDC) prepare to make public satellite temperature measurements data which maintains that a record temperature of -91.2°C was registered in Antarctica on August 3, 2004, near the  Japanese Dome Fuji station, situated on the Valkyrie Dome in the heart of the White Continent.”
According to the RT article, the NSIDC will present the report for the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in San Francisco. The report states that the “winters of 1997, 2001, 2003, and 2004 showed several temperature minima below -90°C.”
As mentioned, the record is being challenged by at least one scientist. The head of the Russian Antarctic Expedition’s logistics center Vyacheslav Martyanov disputes the readings, and told RIA Novosti that: “It is incorrect to declare a temperature record based on satellite data,” adding:
Air temperature is measured according to standards, at the height of 2 meters above the ground, like they do at meteorological observing stations, therefore recognizing a  temperature measured by remote sensing is unrealistic.”

Whether the new temperature record gets officially recognized or not is not sure at this point. But one thing is clear: Things aren’t warming up at all in Antarctica!

"When I was arrested I did not hear most of the words of the police caution. I was being led from the front wheel of a deportation charter flight that I’d helped blockade at Stansted airport in March 2017. There were 15 of us in total, four around the wheel and 10 around a tripod behind the left wing. One of our number had been arrested before locking on. As an officer put handcuffs on me and walked me to the waiting bus, he started to arrest me. “I am arresting you on suspicion of aggravated trespass. You do not have to say anything – ”. When I rounded the corner, glimpsing the collection of my fellow activists, who I’d not seen since we’d cut through the fence many hours before, we all cheered, obscuring the words. Once I was arrested though, and sat alone in a police cell for hours on end, those cheers rang hollow. When we were released, and eventually charged with a terrorism-related offence – one carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment – that jubilance was replaced by endless worry, stress and pain.  Today, and in the coming days, weeks and months, hundreds – perhaps thousands – of activists hope to be arrested. Some hope to go to prison. They are part of Extinction Rebellion, a group seeking urgent action on climate change in the 12 years we have left to avert cataclysmic ecological breakdown. As part of their International Rebellion, they are seeking to “shut down” areas of central London today for as long as possible to “disrupt the ‘business as usual’ which is sending our species on a one way track to extinction”. These are laudable and righteous aims, ones that I agree with. There is no doubt in my mind that we need to move faster on climate change. Nor is there any doubt that most people would quite like to avoid a mass extinction event. Underneath it all, though, I can’t help but feel deeply concerned. In a recent video for the Guardian, the founder of the group, Roger Hallam, tells a police officer that “arrests aren’t happening quickly enough”. Later, he’s seen telling a town hall meeting that “letters, emailing, marches don’t work. You need about 400 people to go to prison. About two to three thousand people to be arrested.” After a blood-pouring action outside Downing Street, protesters bemoaned the lack of arrests. In a recent article, one protester talks about giving up their training as a dancer to devote their full time to activism. There’s undoubtedly something sexy about direct action. As activists we spend our life trying to agitate for change in a system built to resist it. Wins are rare, and the day-to-day grind of trying to transform the world into a better place – one that works for everyone – bears down on all of us. To take part in something material, that feels real, as if you’re actually doing something, is overwhelmingly attractive. But the reality is, direct action and becoming entombed in the endless bureaucracy of our glacial criminal justice system because of it, should make up only a tiny portion of our work as activists. There is an inherent privilege in being able to be arrested for protesting. The hugely disproportionate number of BAME people in prisons for relatively minor offences shouldn’t be underestimated here. To have people like Roger Hallam speaking of prison so casually undermines those who are the poorest or most oppressed in our society whose lives are ripped apart by it. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t feel guilty about our trial and subsequent conviction (no pun intended). Not because what we did was wrong – far from it. But because even though 11 people remain in Britain because of our action, the two years that followed the action saw an unfathomable amount of resources, time, money and energy from across the movement poured into helping us fight our case, to helping us stay afloat, and avoid a life incarcerated. It took valuable resources away from those at the sharp edges of the hostile environment that we were protesting about. This is the issue with Extinction Rebellion’s ethos. The notion that 2,000 arrests will evoke the kind of systemic change needed to fight climate change is naive at best. At a time when the government has cracked down on protest, to not see that this could go the other way, and be used simply as a way of increasing already draconian anti-protest legislation and prosecutions, is shortsighted and irresponsible. But beyond that, the cost to individual activists, and the movement as a whole, would be huge. That so many people are involved and excited about activism is great – but we must be wary of glorifying arrests and incarceration as the only valid way of engaging with a movement. A movement, particularly one seeking to change society as we know it, should not be a coterie of privileged activists who can afford the expense and time getting arrested.  It should be about as many people as possible being brought on board. About making noise from all parts of society that’s so deafening, there is no option for those in power but to listen to our demands. It remains a mystery how wrapping up a whole new generation of activists in lengthy and costly court battles will achieve the changes we so urgently need. • Ben Smoke is a freelance journalist and activist"

"The release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost will accelerate global warming and add up to $70tn (£54tn) to the world’s climate bill, according to the most advanced study yet of the economic consequences of a melting Arctic. If countries fail to improve on their Paris agreement commitments, this feedback mechanism, combined with a loss of heat-deflecting white ice, will cause a near 5% amplification of global warming and its associated costs, says the paper, which was published on Tuesday in Nature Communications.  The authors say their study is the first to calculate the economic impact of permafrost melt and reduced albedo – a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed – based on the most advanced computer models of what is likely to happen in the Arctic as temperatures rise. It shows how destabilised natural systems will worsen the problem caused by man-made emissions, making it more difficult and expensive to solve. They assessed known stocks of frozen organic matter in the ground up to 3 metres deep at multiple points across the Arctic. These were run through the world’s most advanced simulation software in the US and at the UK Met Office to predict how much gas will be released at different levels of warming. Even with supercomputers, the number crunching took weeks because the vast geography and complex climate interactions of the Arctic throw up multiple variables. The researchers then applied previous economic impact models to assess the likely costs. Permafrost melt is the main concern. Greenhouse gases – which are released when organic matter that had been frozen below the soil for centuries thaws and rots - have already begun to escape at the current level of 1 degrees Celsius of global heating. So far the impact is small. Ten gigatonnes of carbon have been released from the permafrost but this source of emissions will grow rapidly once temperatures rise beyond 1.5C. On the current trajectory of at least 3C of warming by the end of the century, melting permafrost is expected to discharge up to 280 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and 3 gigatonnes of methane, which has a climate effect that is 10 to 20 times stronger than CO2. This would increase the global climate-driven impacts by by $70tn between now and 2300. This is 10 times higher than the projected benefits from a melting Arctic, such as easier navigation for ships and access to minerals, says the paper. It would also add to global inequality because most of the economic burden – equivalent to almost the entire world’s current annual GDP – is likely to be borne by countries in warmer poorer regions such as India and Africa, which are most vulnerable to a rise in temperatures. “It’s disheartening that we have this in front of us,” said Dmitry Yumashev of Lancaster University. “Even at 1.5C to 2C, there are impacts and costs due to thawing permafrost. But they are considerably lower for these scenarios compared to business as usual. We have the technology and policy instruments to limit the warming but we are not moving fast enough.” The new projections contained a modicum of good news because the impact of land permafrost melt was at the lower range of what had been feared. Previous estimates suggested these Arctic tipping points could add more than 10% to climate costs. Some feared the methane alone could prove catastrophic but the new figures show CO2 remains the greatest concern. “We still have a time bomb, but it may not be as large as previously believed,” said Yumashev. But he warned against complacency because even at the low end the damages are huge, the study has a considerable degree of uncertainty and the costs of several other potential tipping points have yet to be calculated."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCold is gripping globally, and not only in the US or Antarctica.
Hat-tip: Jurian Sterk at Facebook.
The French language www.hebdometeo.com here reports that in Alberta: “Temperatures Saturday in the Canadian prairies were glacial and that many cold records fell.”
The report writes that Edmonton bottomed out at -39°C thus smashing the old record of -37°C set in 2009, also a time of supposedly intense global warming.
No wonder the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) feels so desperate to roll out once again its bogus model claims that all the cold is due to Arctic warming!
At Brooks, Alberta the mercury fell to -42.2 °C. The old record was -38.3°C set in 1977. With the wind chill factored in, the temperature felt like -52°C, the hebdometeo site writes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now as I write in Germany we are having nice comfortable summer weather with temps in the 20s C (70s F). But that is set to change today as a couple of hot days are in store. Here’s the forecast for my area:

North Germany is set for a very brief heat wave (1 day!). Source: www.wetter24.de
So this heat wave they are talking about is going to be a whole one and half days long, at least in the area I live. I think this is not even long enough to qualify it as  a “heat wave”. Granted for Southern and Eastern German areas the forecasts indicates much warmer temperatures. Here’s the forecast for Munich:

Munich forecast: Source: www.wetter24.de
But this is not something you wouldn’t expect to happen here in the summertime. Yet, llistening to the media and some climate scientists, you’d think the world is coming to an end, that the heat waves are more and more frequent than ever, and that Europe will soon burn up.

For example Express.de here warns of “horror heat”.
With all the heat in the headlines, we ask ourselves just how has 2013 been so far in Germany? Surely it will probably go down in the books as “one of the hottest on record!“.
Looking at the end of month reports from Germany’s DWD Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service), we find the monthly anomalies as to the 1981 – 2010 reference period. They are as follows:
January: -0.3°C
February: -1.8°C
March: -4.1°C
April: -0.1°C
May: -1.3°C
June: 0.0°C
July: +1.5°C
The average anomaly is -0.87°C, i.e. almost a full degree below normal. Only July was warmer than normal this year.
So tell me what has been more frequent this year, heat waves or cold snaps? It may turn out that we’ll get a few warm months and wind up with an average year, or even one that is a bit warmer than normal. This is because we have a factor out there that we used to call “weather”.
One thing is sure: Europe is not burning up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeet deepsea diver Gustavo. Gustavo is a a 3-ton elephant seal that scientists at Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute have put into service to collect ocean data. Some elephant seal bulls were tagged with state-of-the-art satellite transmitters at the Dallmann Laboratory on King George Island, Antarctica. Read about it here:  Alfred Wegener Institute.The scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association furnished some elephant seals with transmitters that operate using the satellite-aided ARGOS location system. Here’s how it works:
During the annual migrations to their oceanic feeding grounds elephant seals cover thousands of kilometres. They dive down to depths of over 2000 metres and remain under water for periods of over an hour. When a seal with a transmitter dives, it collects data – even under the ice – and then appears on the surface again to breathe after some time. While it breathes fresh air, the recorded data package is sent to a satellite that passes on the signals received.
The elephant seals will gather and transmit data during the Antarctic winter, a time when ships are not able to perform this job because of too much sea ice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow far off have climate scientists been in projecting the future of our climate – winter in particular? They and their “models” couldn’t have gotten it more wrong!
Ten years ago they were telling us to forget seeing snow in the wintertime in the future. Now we are seeing tons of the stuff in the wintertime – and spring as well!
Reader and contributor “Jimbo” sent me a link to a report out of Saudi Arabia, a country famous for its heat and desert (my emphasis):
Saudi city covered with snow following unrelenting weather
Saudi Arabia’s northwestern city of Hael was covered with snow Sunday after almost three days of unrelenting weather conditions, according to Al Arabiya correspondents.
A number of provinces in the kingdom have been hit with floods and hailstones as temperatures dropped dramatically.
People have posted pictures on Twitter and other social networking sites showing snow allegedly taken in Saudi Arabia’s Hael.”
Unfortunately, the western climatically-correct media are just too embarrassed to bring us these news because they totally believed the global warming hoax. For years they told us that the whole world, and even the polar regions, could turn into a giant Saudi Arabia. Now, Saudi Arabia has turned polar instead (at least for a couple of days)! You just couldn’t possibly get it any wronger.
In the US, there are lots of news about snow falling across the Midwest, with some parts getting a foot or more of the stuff children weren’t ever supposed to know about.

Jimbo also provides us with a link to snow in Spain:
26 regions in Spain are under snow following an unprecedented snowfall over the weekend, reported Voice of Russia. Roads have been closed to traffic as snow thickness reaches 20 centimeters in some areas.”
A stunned reporter writes:
Also unbelievable sight are beaches under snow.”
Gee, kids won’t know what sand at the beach is anymore. A few days ago there were also reports of snow falling in Germany as well.
Isn’t it amazing how far off climate models can be? We weren’t supposed to see snow anymore, not even in the dead of winter, and now we are seeing it in late spring! Even the most sketpical among us could never have imagined the models botching it this badly. Just goes to show who is in control of the weather: Mother Nature! (and not some obscure gas molecule).
The “climate scientists” have to be beginning to feel like total idiots by now.

Many of the old Christmas traditions we so very much cherish today originate in Germany. Here’s a video of Christmas market activity. (Don’t worry, it’s not superimposed with “Last Christmas” by Wham).

Perhaps a few of the ex-British forces stationed near Osnabruck will relate to the images. The footage was taken at the downtown Osnabruck Christmas market, which is only a short drive away from my house. The singing, of course is in German.
It is easy to get sidetracked by all the commerce and kitsch. One could easily argue that it is the pursuit of the things that we were taught would make us happy is in fact precisely what makes many among us miserable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a worthwhile piece by David Deming: http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/05/the_problems_with_al_gore.html
The ancient Greeks encouraged free thought, debate and critical analysis.  Pupils were encouraged to criticise their teachers.  Today we know that in science scepticism is the heart of progress; without it everything stops. The objective of science is not to prove existing theories, but to disprove them.
But in Al Gore’s world, things are just the opposite. Gore refuses to debate and continuously ridicules and demonises his critics. His approach: science is established by brute authority. Those who disagree with his view are not invited in discussion, but are marginalised and cast out. Only one dogma is tolerated.

AGW is probably the only scientific hypothesis that ever started with a consensus. In real science, that’s not how it works. This hypothesis is a dud.
In his piece, Deming writes in the end:
Gore and Obama have joined an elite group that includes Portuguese physician Egas Moniz.  In 1949, Moniz was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine for devising an innovative procedure known as the frontal lobotomy.  It seems fitting that Gore and Obama are grouped with Moniz, since their apparent goal is to lobotomize human civilization.
I don’t know about human civilisation, but they are certainly trying to lobotomise critics, dissenters and the scientific approach.

"Had we put as much effort into preventing environmental catastrophe as we’ve spent on making excuses for inaction, we would have solved it by now. Everywhere I look, I see people engaged in furious attempts to fend off the moral challenge it presents. The commonest current excuse is this: “I bet those protesters have phones/go on holiday/wear leather shoes.” In other words, we won’t listen to anyone who is not living naked in a barrel, subsisting only on murky water. Of course, if you are living naked in a barrel we will dismiss you too, because you’re a hippie weirdo. Every messenger, and every message they bear, is disqualified on the grounds of either impurity or purity.  As the environmental crisis accelerates, and as protest movements like YouthStrike4Climate and Extinction Rebellion make it harder not to see what we face, people discover more inventive means of shutting their eyes and shedding responsibility. Underlying these excuses is a deep-rooted belief that if we really are in trouble, someone somewhere will come to our rescue: “they” won’t let it happen. But there is no they, just us. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The political class, as anyone who has followed its progress over the past three years can surely now see, is chaotic, unwilling and, in isolation, strategically incapable of addressing even short-term crises, let alone a vast existential predicament. Yet a widespread and wilful naivety prevails: the belief that voting is the only political action required to change a system. Unless it is accompanied by the concentrated power of protest – articulating precise demands and creating space in which new political factions can grow – voting, while essential, remains a blunt and feeble instrument. The media, with a few exceptions, is actively hostile. Even when broadcasters cover these issues, they carefully avoid any mention of power, talking about environmental collapse as if it is driven by mysterious, passive forces, and proposing microscopic fixes for vast structural problems. The BBC’s Blue Planet Live series exemplified this tendency. Those who govern the nation and shape public discourse cannot be trusted with the preservation of life on Earth. There is no benign authority preserving us from harm. No one is coming to save us. None of us can justifiably avoid the call to come together to save ourselves. I see despair as another variety of disavowal. By throwing up our hands about the calamities that could one day afflict us, we disguise and distance them, converting concrete choices into indecipherable dread. We might relieve ourselves of moral agency by claiming that it’s already too late to act, but in doing so we condemn others to destitution or death. Catastrophe afflicts people now and, unlike those in the rich world who can still afford to wallow in despair, they are forced to respond in practical ways. In Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, devastated by Cyclone Idai, in Syria, Libya and Yemen, where climate chaos has contributed to civil war, in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,, where crop failure, drought and the collapse of fisheries have driven people from their homes, despair is not an option. Our inaction has forced them into action, as they respond to terrifying circumstances caused primarily by the rich world’s consumption. The Christians are right: despair is a sin. As the author Jeremy Lent points out in a recent essay, it is almost certainly too late to save some of the world’s great living wonders, such as coral reefs and monarch butterflies. It might also be too late to prevent many of the world’s most vulnerable people from losing their homes. But, he argues, with every increment of global heating, with every rise in material resource consumption, we will have to accept still greater losses, many of which can still be prevented through radical transformation. Every nonlinear transformation in history has taken people by surprise. As Alexei Yurchak explains in his book about the collapse of the Soviet Union – Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More – systems look immutable until they suddenly disintegrate. As soon as they do, the disintegration retrospectively looks inevitable. Our system – characterised by perpetual economic growth on a planet that is not growing – will inevitably implode. The only question is whether the transformation is planned or unplanned. Our task is to ensure it is planned, and fast. We need to conceive and build a new system based on the principle that every generation, everywhere has an equal right to enjoy natural wealth. This is less daunting than we might imagine. As Erica Chenoweth’s historical research reveals, for a peaceful mass movement to succeed, a maximum of 3.5% of the population needs to mobilise. Humans are ultra-social mammals, constantly if subliminally aware of shifting social currents. Once we perceive that the status quo has changed, we flip suddenly from support for one state of being to support for another. When a committed and vocal 3.5% unites behind the demand for a new system, the social avalanche that follows becomes irresistible. Giving up before we have reached this threshold is worse than despair: it is defeatism. Today, Extinction Rebellion takes to streets around the world in defence of our life-support systems. Through daring, disruptive, nonviolent action, it forces our environmental predicament on to the political agenda. Who are these people? Another “they”, who might rescue us from our follies? The success of this mobilisation depends on us. It will reach the critical threshold only if enough of us cast aside denial and despair, and join this exuberant, proliferating movement. The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWell at least President Barack Obama is reaching his climate protection targets by cutting CO2 emissions like he promised he would. The USA’s CO2 emissions fell a whopping 7% last year.
http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2010/05/us-carbon-dioxide-emissions-fell-record-7-last-year/1
While part of the reductions came from energy conservation and more efficient technology, a big part came from the nasty economic slowdown.
Heck, at the current rate the USA will be practically carbon-free by 2020! Not everybody thinks there’s been an economic price and pain. Take Joe Romm for example. The USA Today writes:

Romm says the CO2 decrease, larger than previously expected by the EIA, shows that such reductions are possible without harming the U.S. economy.

That is a great age, we have been told. When you have all of your life ahead of you. But I am not so sure it will be that great for us. I was fortunate to be born in a time and place where everyone told us to dream big; I could become whatever I wanted to. I could live wherever I wanted to. People like me had everything we needed and more. Things our grandparents could not even dream of. We had everything we could ever wish for and yet now we may have nothing. Now we probably don’t even have a future any more. Because that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money. It was stolen from us every time you said that the sky was the limit, and that you only live once. You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. And the saddest thing is that most children are not even aware of the fate that awaits us. We will not understand it until it’s too late. And yet we are the lucky ones. Those who will be affected the hardest are already suffering the consequences. But their voices are not heard. Is my microphone on? Can you hear me? Around the year 2030, 10 years 252 days and 10 hours away from now, we will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, that will most likely lead to the end of our civilisation as we know it. That is unless in that time, permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society have taken place, including a reduction of CO2 emissions by at least 50%. And please note that these calculations are depending on inventions that have not yet been invented at scale, inventions that are supposed to clear the atmosphere of astronomical amounts of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, these calculations do not include unforeseen tipping points and feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost. Nor do these scientific calculations include already locked-in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Nor the aspect of equity – or climate justice – clearly stated throughout the Paris agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. We must also bear in mind that these are just calculations. Estimations. That means that these “points of no return” may occur a bit sooner or later than 2030. No one can know for sure. We can, however, be certain that they will occur approximately in these timeframes, because these calculations are not opinions or wild guesses. These projections are backed up by scientific facts, concluded by all nations through the IPCC. Nearly every single major national scientific body around the world unreservedly supports the work and findings of the IPCC. Did you hear what I just said? Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder. During the last six months I have travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours in trains, electric cars and buses, repeating these life-changing words over and over again. But no one seems to be talking about it, and nothing has changed. In fact, the emissions are still rising. When I have been travelling around to speak in different countries, I am always offered help to write about the specific climate policies in specific countries. But that is not really necessary. Because the basic problem is the same everywhere. And the basic problem is that basically nothing is being done to halt – or even slow – climate and ecological breakdown, despite all the beautiful words and promises. The UK is, however, very special. Not only for its mind-blowing historical carbon debt, but also for its current, very creative, carbon accounting. Since 1990 the UK has achieved a 37% reduction of its territorial CO2 emissions, according to the Global Carbon Project. And that does sound very impressive. But these numbers do not include emissions from aviation, shipping and those associated with imports and exports. If these numbers are included the reduction is around 10% since 1990 – or an an average of 0.4% a year, according to Tyndall Manchester.And the main reason for this reduction is not a consequence of climate policies, but rather a 2001 EU directive on air quality that essentially forced the UK to close down its very old and extremely dirty coal power plants and replace them with less dirty gas power stations. And switching from one disastrous energy source to a slightly less disastrous one will of course result in a lowering of emissions. But perhaps the most dangerous misconception about the climate crisis is that we have to “lower” our emissions. Because that is far from enough. Our emissions have to stop if we are to stay below 1.5-2C of warming. The “lowering of emissions” is of course necessary but it is only the beginning of a fast process that must lead to a stop within a couple of decades, or less. And by “stop” I mean net zero – and then quickly on to negative figures. That rules out most of today’s politics. The fact that we are speaking of “lowering” instead of “stopping” emissions is perhaps the greatest force behind the continuing business as usual. The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels – for example, the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports as well as the planning permission for a brand new coal mine – is beyond absurd. This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind. People always tell me and the other millions of school strikers that we should be proud of ourselves for what we have accomplished. But the only thing that we need to look at is the emission curve. And I’m sorry, but it’s still rising. That curve is the only thing we should look at. Every time we make a decision we should ask ourselves; how will this decision affect that curve? We should no longer measure our wealth and success in the graph that shows economic growth, but in the curve that shows the emissions of greenhouse gases. We should no longer only ask: “Have we got enough money to go through with this?” but also: “Have we got enough of the carbon budget to spare to go through with this?” That should and must become the centre of our new currency. Many people say that we don’t have any solutions to the climate crisis. And they are right. Because how could we? How do you “solve” the greatest crisis that humanity has ever faced? How do you “solve” a war? How do you “solve” going to the moon for the first time? How do you “solve” inventing new inventions? The climate crisis is both the easiest and the hardest issue we have ever faced. The easiest because we know what we must do. We must stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. The hardest because our current economics are still totally dependent on burning fossil fuels, and thereby destroying ecosystems in order to create everlasting economic growth. “So, exactly how do we solve that?” you ask us – the schoolchildren striking for the climate. And we say: “No one knows for sure. But we have to stop burning fossil fuels and restore nature and many other things that we may not have quite figured out yet.” Then you say: “That’s not an answer!” So we say: “We have to start treating the crisis like a crisis – and act even if we don’t have all the solutions.” “That’s still not an answer,” you say. Then we start talking about circular economy and rewilding nature and the need for a just transition. Then you don’t understand what we are talking about. We say that all those solutions needed are not known to anyone and therefore we must unite behind the science and find them together along the way. But you do not listen to that. Because those answers are for solving a crisis that most of you don’t even fully understand. Or don’t want to understand. You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before. Like now. And those answers don’t exist any more. Because you did not act in time. Avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking. We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling. Sometimes we just simply have to find a way. The moment we decide to fulfil something, we can do anything. And I’m sure that the moment we start behaving as if we were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe. Humans are very adaptable: we can still fix this. But the opportunity to do so will not last for long. We must start today. We have no more excuses. We children are not sacrificing our education and our childhood for you to tell us what you consider is politically possible in the society that you have created. We have not taken to the streets for you to take selfies with us, and tell us that you really admire what we do. We children are doing this to wake the adults up. We children are doing this for you to put your differences aside and start acting as you would in a crisis. We children are doing this because we want our hopes and dreams back. I hope my microphone was on. I hope you could all hear me."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe junior partner of Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU center-right government, the business-friendly FDP Liberal Democrats under Philipp Rösler, have made an astonishing and bold move.

The Süddeutsche Zeitung here reports:
FDP blocks climate expert Schellnhuber
He is one of the world’s most famous climate scientists. But that does not seem to impress the liberal democrats at all: The Economics Ministry under Philipp Rösler refuses to reappoint physicist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber as director of the Environmental Advisory Board. His colleagues are outraged and are now speculating on what’s behind it.”
Hat-Tip: Roger Pielke Jr. at Twitter.
That WBGU board, filled mostly with German academics, is the famous WBGU that not long ago produced a whacko “masterplan” dubbed “The Great Transformation”, which would lead to a coercive global decarbonization of the global economy by 2050 and the civil marginalization of climate science skeptics and dissidents.
If you can credit the FDP for anything, it’s Courage. This takes really massive reproductive spheres to attempt this.
Merkel’s junior coalition partner, headed by Rösler, now we must expect the full fury and hellfire of Germany’s mainstream media to rain down upon their FDP party. In today’s modern Germany, Climatism has taken over as the country’s official religion and Schellnhuber is deemed its infallible pope.

This is a real hornets’ nest. Challenging Schellnhuber is challenging the very core of the world’s environmental movement. I hope they know what they are doing.
To know what could be behind the move, look no further than here. Schellnhuber is the main scientific force driving the green energy debacle that has pushed Germany’s energy industry and economy to the brink.
The green-leftist Süddeutsche Zeitung in its article extols Schellnhuber’s numerous achievements and awards. In there minds, he is Prof. Climate Authority.
The Süddeutsche also writes:
Now from Germany, the physicist, top climate advisor to the German Chancellor, is facing resistance. More precisely said: from the Federal Ministry of Economics. The house of Minister Philipp Rösler (FDP) is resisting with all its might the reappointment of Schellnhuber as director of the WBGU.”
Schellnhuber’s appointment would be for another 4 years, and it normally should proceed as a mere formality. But now there appears to be growing, real resistance among Angela Merkel’s government – the process of appointing Schellnhuber has been blocked for weeks now. The Süddeutsche writes: “Formally the WBGU has not been in existence for two months.”



     Also the director of the infamously green Wuppertal Institute, economist Uwe Schneidewind is facing resistance. The Süddeutsche reports that Rösler’s Economics Ministry is suggesting two alternatives to Schellnhuber and Schneidewind: Professor Axel Ockenfels of Cologne and Joachim Weimann of Magdeburg.

Schellnhuber has not commented on the stalled re-appointemnt. But the Süddeutsche writes that “the outrage among his council colleagues is big.”



This is an immense development. A junior coalition partner does not block such a key position or take such a stance without first closely consulting with its senior coalition partner, in this case Angela Merkel and her CDU/CSU party. This indicates that dissatisfaction with Schellnhuber and the WBGU has long been festering within the ruling government, and that Merkel has probably had enough of Schellnhuber’s doom and gloom scenarios, global transformation fantasies and social engineering designs. Time to get back to reality.
I repeat, expect a very very messy and ugly attack campaign against the FDP and Rösler from the media and Germany’s climate Vatican in the weeks and months ahead.

Die Welt writes:
Green parliamentary group leader Fritz Kuhn wants cars of German drivers to be idle on weekends. […] With a driving ban a clear signal against climate change would be made. According to estimates by Kuhn, the citizens would quickly notice, “that you can also get along without cars”.
Fritz Kuhn, the mayor of Stuttgart, cites a ban used in Northern Italy in 150 cities last Sunday in order to fight air pollution. People can use their bicycles or go by foot.
By now readers may be thinking that the German Greens want to ban everything. Though it seems to be that way, this is not true.

Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele wants to legalize incest. Photo credit: Sargoth, public domain.
There are some things they want to legalize: incest for example. According to FOCUS magazine here:
The incest ruling by the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (EGMR) against a 34-year old man from Leipzig has led to controversial reactions. Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele reacted the most sharply. He wants to permit sex between siblings and other close relatives, and is requesting doing away with the incest laws. It is an isolated relic of another time when adultery was punishable, which we also have done away with,’ Ströbele told news network N24. Paragraph 173 no longer matches ‘in this time of enlightened opinion on marriage and family. It must be abolished’.”
Wonderful. Now Germans can stop driving on weekends, stay home and keep intimate company with family members. Now you know just how wacky German greens can be.
It should be noted that the early Green Party in Germany in the 1980s also supported advocates of pedophilia, this according to the leftist TAZ here, quoting Spiegel.
‘The pedophile past – In the 80s, the Green Party supposedly financially supported a working group that called for the legalization of sex with children. Cohn-Bendit: ‘That was mainstream’.'”
Amazingly, the Greens today are what often passes in the West as “progressive”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIce breakers getting trapped in near record high sea ice around Antarctica, Arctic sea ice seeing a whopping 50% gain last summer, record killer cold and snow gripping Canada and the USA, rare snowfalls in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The string of cold weather events just doesn’t end. And all this in a non-La Nina year.
So it comes as little surprise when we are told that global temperatures haven’t risen in close to two decades and that they have been trending downwards over the last 8 years or so.
Despite the mild weather that Europe has been experiencing over the last 5 weeks, the overall temperature trend here speaks a very different story.
German weather site www.wetter.net here reports that 2013 in Germany was the second coldest year in a decade.

Figure 1: Germany’s annual mean temperature since 2003. 2013 was the second coldest. The 10-year trend is clear: Germany is cooling.

What’s more, wetter.net writes:
Based on the last 25 years, 2013 was the fourth coldest. If we look at the average temperatures for the last 25 years, we see that they have pretty much remained constant.”
But Germany is not alone in seeing global warming gone AWOL. Benny Peiser’s GWPF site here writes that the same thing is being observed in Great Britain.

"In times of crisis and catastrophe, children are often forced to grow up quickly. We are now witnessing this premature call to action on a planetary scale. As the adults in government accelerate their consumption of fossil fuels, children are leading the campaign against our species’ looming extinction. Our survival now depends on the prospects for a global movement to follow their lead and demand an International Green New Deal. Several countries have proposed their own versions of a Green New Deal. Here in Europe, DiEM25 and our European Spring coalition are campaigning under the banner of a detailed Green New Deal agenda. In the UK, a new campaign is pushing similar legislation with MPs such as Caroline Lucas and Clive Lewis. And in the US, dogged activists in the Sunrise Movement are working with representatives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push their proposal to the front of the political agenda.  But these campaigns have largely remained siloed. Their advisers may exchange notes and ideas, but no strategy has emerged to coordinate these campaigns in a broader, global framework. Unfortunately, climate change knows no borders. The US may be the second-largest polluter in the world, but it makes up less than 15% of global greenhouse emissions. Leading by example is simply not enough. Instead, we need an International Green New Deal: a pragmatic plan to raise $8tn – 5% of global GDP – each year, coordinate its investment in the transition to renewable energy and commit to providing climate protections on the basis of countries’ needs, rather than their means. Call it the Organization for Emergency Environmental Cooperation – the namesake of the original OEEC 75 years ago. While many US activists find inspiration in a “second world war-style mobilization”, the International Green New Deal is better modeled by the Marshall plan that followed it. With financial assistance from the US government, 16 countries formed the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), dedicated to rebuilding the infrastructure of a devastated continent and coordinating its supply of energy. But if the original OEEC entrenched an extractive capitalism at Europe’s core –protecting the steel and coal cartel – the new organization for an International Green New Deal can empower communities around the world in a single transformational project. The transnational scope of this mobilization is crucial for three main reasons. The first is production. Recent studies show that, as long as countries cooperate, all continents have the wind, solar and hydropower resources they need in a zero-emissions world. Northern countries and mountainous regions have better access to wind power, while southern lands are better suited to exploiting the sun. An International Green New Deal could exploit these differences and ensure that renewable energy is available to all of them year-round. The second is innovation. Confronting the climate crisis will require more than keeping fossil fuels in the ground. We will also need major scientific breakthroughs to develop renewable sources of energy, adapt existing infrastructure, detoxify our oceans and decarbonize the atmosphere. No country alone can fund the research and development necessary to meet these challenges. The OEEC would pool the brainpower of the global scientific community: a Green Manhattan Project. The third is reparation. For centuries, countries such as the US and the UK have plundered natural resources from around the world and polluted them back out. Less developed nations have been doubly dispossessed: first, of their resource wealth, and second, of their right to a sustainable life – and in the case of many small island developing states, of their very right to exist. An International Green New Deal would redistribute resources to rehabilitate overexploited regions, protect against rising sea levels, and guarantee a decent standard of living to all climate refugees. The UN climate change conferences will not save us from extinction – the demise of the Paris agreement should be evidence enough. These frameworks lock us into prisoners’ dilemmas, in which every country has an incentive to defect on their climate commitments, even if cooperation between them would yield a greater collective good. As long as climate cooperation is framed around sacrifice, it is vulnerable to strongmen like Donald Trump who vow to buck international rules in the name of national interests. The International Green New Deal changes the frame. Rather than pleading for restraint, it sets out a positive-sum vision of international investment, in which the gains from joining in outweigh those to going it alone. This is the strategy that won Franklin D Roosevelt the original New Deal. His plan addressed people who had given up hope and inspired in them the idea that there is an alternative. That there are ways of pressing idle resources into public service. It made sense to the disheartened and offered opportunity to the entrepreneurial. The same is true of the International Green New Deal, which mobilizes public finance to crowd in private investments that, together, fund the $8tn transition. Just like in the original New Deal, public financing will involve a mix of taxes and bond instruments. On the former, we can introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate that is then redistributed on the basis of their sales. On the latter, public investment banks – including the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank – can coordinate the issue of green bonds that the major central banks agree collectively to support in the secondary markets. Suddenly, countries with large trade surpluses will realize they are better able to invest their excess capital if green investments in deficit countries are coordinated under the auspices of an international plan. The positive-sum dynamic will prevail. In this sense, the stakes of the International Green New Deal are not merely environmental. By uniting countries in the project of bottom-up economic transformation – and coercing multinationals to fund their fair share of it – it will also stem the tide of bigotry and xenophobia engulfing the world. “Advanced” capitalist countries today are literally falling apart. In the US, net public investment has fallen below half of one per cent of GDP. Across the eurozone, net public investment has remained below zero for nearly a decade. It is little wonder that political monsters are rising again: just as in the 1930s, the grapes of wrath are ripening and “growing heavy for the vintage”. To revive the liberal democratic project, some pundits have suggested making China into a bogeyman. But the real bogeyman is of our creation: a climate crisis wrought by decades of inaction and underinvestment. To address the true existential threat that we face today, we must reverse the economic policies that brought us to this brink. Austerity means extinction. The promise of an International Green New Deal to is to avoid the pitfalls of cold war politics and unite humanity in the only project capable of preserving a habitable planet. To do this, however, we need a powerful progressive international movement to demand that our leaders begin to act beyond their own borders. Let’s start building it. The children are watching.

Share this...FacebookTwitter“U.K. Energy Secretary Attacks Climate Skeptics Before Bill Vote” is the headline at Bloomberg here.
U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Davey will make his strongest attack yet on climate change skeptics he accuses of purveying a what he calls a ‘seductive’ and’dangerous’ message that global warming has stopped.”

Sir Clueless Ed
Davey insists that global warming hasn’t stopped. Yet, a number of prominent warmist scientists don’t agree with the fear-stoking politician. Reader Jimbo sent me a list of comments from climate scientists acknowledging that the warming has stopped. Some of these scientists even recognised this years ago already.
Phil Jones saw it 8 years ago! Here’s Jimbo’s list:
5 July, 2005
“The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998. OK it has but it is only 7 years of data and it isn’t statistically significant…,” Dr. Phil Jones – CRU emails.
7 May, 2009
“No upward trend…has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried,” Dr. Phil Jones – CRU emails.
15 Aug 2009
“…This lack of overall warming is analogous to the period from 2002 to 2008 when decreasing solar irradiance also countered much of the anthropogenic warming…,” Dr. Judith L. Lean – Geophysical Research Letters.
19 November 2009
“At present, however, the warming is taking a break.[…] There can be no argument about that,” Dr. Mojib Latif – Spiegel.
19 November 2009
“It cannot be denied that this is one of the hottest issues in the scientific community. [….] We don’t really know why this stagnation is taking place at this point,” Dr. Jochem Marotzke – Spiegel.
13 February 2010
Phil Jones: “I’m a scientist trying to measure temperature. If I registered that the climate has been cooling I’d say so. But it hasn’t until recently – and then barely at all.”
BBC: “Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically-significant global warming?”
Phil Jones: “Yes, but only just.”
2010
“…The decade of 1999-2008 is still the warmest of the last 30 years, though the global temperature increment is near zero…,” Prof. Shaowu Wang et al – Advances in Climate Change Research.

2 June 2011
“…it has been unclear why global surface temperatures did not rise between 1998 and 2008...,” Dr Robert K. Kaufmann – PNAS.
18 September 2011
“There have been decades, such as 2000–2009, when the observed globally averaged surface-temperature time series shows little increase or even a slightly negative trend1 (a hiatus period)…,” Dr. Gerald A. Meehl – Nature Climate Change.
14 October 2012
“We agree with Mr Rose that there has been only a very small amount of warming in the 21st Century. As stated in our response, this is 0.05 degrees Celsius since 1997 equivalent to 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade.” Source: metofficenews.wordpress.com/, Met Office Blog – Dave Britton (10:48:21) –
30 March 2013
“…the five-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade,” Dr. James Hansen – The Economist.
7 April 2013
“…Despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the Earth’s mean near-surface temperature paused its rise during the 2000–2010 period…,” Dr. Virginie Guemas – Nature Climate Change.
22 February 2013
“People have to question these things and science only thrives on the basis of questioning,” Dr. Rajendra Pachauri – The Australian.
27 May 2013 
“I note this last decade or so has been fairly flat,” Lord Stern (economist) – Telegraph.
Many are using the word “pause” or “break” to describe the recent trend because they refuse to believe their theory is failing before their eyes. But this is only the language of denial.
Even the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) admitted that the warming has stopped and are puzzled by it: “In the years leading up to the year 2000, the temperature curve rose very sharply. But since then it isn’t rising so, in fact it’s not rising at all, the curve. The average temperature has stagnated at a very high level – we sort of have a plateau, and that during a time when CO2 emissions have risen considerably.” (2013)
And even the prince of climate darkness himself, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber conceded in April that the “pause” may even continue another decade!
Many insist that it’s only a pause, and that temperature will resume climbing with abandon once the hidden heat comes out of hiding deep somewhere in the ocean. But that’s pure speculation with no data to back it up. Right now the atmospheric data and observations are clear:
WARMING HAS STOPPED.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote 2 posts on the renewable energies folly in Germany, see here and here.
Now the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) confirms the mess with a press release and survey results of businesses and industries. The survey (see right) shows that energy prices and supply risks are threatening the ability of many German industrial companies to compete, and that many are now gearing up to move their operations to friendlier foreign locations.
Renewable energies are leading to higher prices, unreliable supply, less competitiveness and widespread job loss
In total, some 2400 companies of all sizes, sectors, and regions were surveyed throughout the country.
“Only a small share of the companies see more opportunities than risks,” reported Eric Schweitzer, President of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce. Most companies view renewable energies skeptically because of rising energy prices and fears with respect to the reliability of the energy supply.
Most of the companies see renewable energies more as a burden than a bonus. More than half of the industrial companies surveyed view renewable energies as hampering their competitiveness. The DIHK survey also says that 25% of the industrial companies are now active in some way in moving their operations to foreign countries. Three percent have already done so, 8% are currently in the process of doing so, and 14% are planning to do so. In a nutshell, renewable energies have made Germany a less attractive place for industry.

This is especially true in the energy-intensive chemical industry. For example natural gas prices are almost 70% cheaper in the USA – thanks to shale gas.
Energy prices on the rise, supply reliability in question
The DIHK report states that electricity prices in Germany are especially high and that 50% of the companies say that the importance of energy prices has increased over the last 12 months. Every tenth company is now attempting to pass the higher energy costs along to their customers.
The survey also shows that many companies are worried about the reliability of the electricity supply. Twenty one percent say that the importance of disruptions in power supply has gone up. 12% of the companies surveyed saw a power outage lasting more than 3 minutes and one out every six companies saw a power outage of less than three minutes. Ten percent of the companies incurred costs because of electric power or gas supply disruptions. Already a single short power outage can cause a company 10,000 euros in losses.

"The siege of the Berta Cáceres started started shortly after noon when police in high-vis jackets surrounded the bright pink boat in Oxford Circus, central London, with two cordons and then steadily peeled off the Extinction Rebellion activists stuck to it. Officers with angle grinders cut through the bars below the hull of the vessel, named after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, which protesters had chained and glued themselves to. Five hours later, however, the tables had turned as hundreds of activist reinforcements swarmed into side roads and blocked the end of Regent Street. The police were surrounded. As officers attached the Berta Cáceres to a lorry, the crowd chanted: “We have more boats.” By 7pm police had managed to move the boat just two streets away, only to find themselves pinned in by more rows of demonstrators singing the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love. After much obstruction the vessel was eventually driven away up Regent Street followed by jogging uniformed officers. Welcome to the fifth day of the Extinction Rebellion, the escalating but still methodically polite campaign of disruption that has turned several of central London’s best-known locations into a giant game of territorial to-and-fro. Despite more than 100 arrests on Friday, taking the total to 682 by early evening, the demonstration which has blocked four major London landmarks looked set to continue beyond the weekend, with organisers preparing to extend their disruption on Monday to “picnics on the motorway.” The activists reported an influx of supporters as the Easter holiday, balmy weather and gestures of support from school strike leader Greta Thunberg and the actor Emma Thompson injected new momentum into the weeklong climate protest. As on previous days, the mood was largely respectful on both sides, but video later emerged of activists being dragged roughly across the concrete near Regent Street. Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist and founder of the school strikes for climate movement, will visit parliament on Monday and Tuesday and said she was also keen to join the campaigners on the streets.  The Metropolitan police has admitted that it is overstretched and officers said additional forces were called in from Wales and other regions to prevent Heathrow from becoming a target, but fears proved exaggerated. A group of 15 youth activists staged a two-hour peaceful protest at a road junction close to the airport. At the biggest of the camps at Marble Arch, organisers said they had had about 300 signups in the afternoon alone, with dozens of people volunteering to work as brochure distributors. Wolfgang Wopperer-Beholz, who manned the sign-up desk, said there had been a marked increase compared with the previous day. “Earlier, the people who put their names on the list were already knowledgeable. Now we are seeing more people who don’t know so much, but are pretty enthusiastic.” He said many had mentioned the David Attenborough documentary on climate change that had aired on the BBC on Thursday night. Induction sessions at a tent in Parliament Square were so packed that the attendees spilled outside. “It’s growing at an amazing rate. I think the Attenborough documentary lit a fire in people’s bellies,” said one of the activists, who gave only the name Archer. “They are not just the usual dirty hippies either. There are doctors, architects, and the ethnic diversity is getting wider.” “I’ve campaigned on this for 30 years with very little effect. It’s only with Extinction Rebellion that I have a sense that we are getting somewhere,” said Bing Jones, a retired doctor from Sheffield, who was arrested and placed in a police cell in Belgravia on Thursday night. “When I was released, there was a volunteer waiting for me outside with a Mars bar and big smile. He had signed up that day, been trained, and then sat outside the police station for four hours until I came out. This is a wonderful, strange movement and new people continue to come along.” Among the newcomers on Friday was actor Sonera Angel, who was waving a yellow banner marked with the Extinction Rebellion symbol near the police perimeter at Oxford Circus. She said she had come by train with a big group from Southend. She planned to return over the weekend and persuade more of her friends to join. “There is no excuse now it is a holiday,” she said. “Climate change is such a huge issue and governments all over the world are doing almost nothing about it.” Thompson also joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning as activists read “poems to the Earth”. Later the actor gave a speech from the Berta Cáceres. Thompson said her generation had failed young people: “We have seriously failed them and our planet is in serious trouble. We have much, much less time than we thought. I have seen the evidence for myself and I really care about my children and grandchildren enough to want to be here today to stand with the next generation.” Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg, who will arrive in the UK on Sunday as part of a European tour that has included a meeting with Pope Francis and an excoriating address at the European parliament. Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories to the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament to party leaders and other MPs, meet fellow student activists and talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian. “I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting,” Thunberg said. “I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.” Activists and politicians say she and other young campaigners had a key role to play. “She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the school strike for climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.” The climate campaigners have also been boosted by a host of prominent supporters from the science and academic communities and the entertainment world. In an open letter on Friday, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”. Linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said. “The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German Weather Service recently issued a press release claiming that August had been “one of the warmest on record”. Yet German data show no warming at all in the last 20 years.
============================================
Where’s The Climate Warming? Nowhere To Be Found In Germany
By Josef Kowatsch for EIKE
(Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
The following chart shows Germany’s August temperatures for the last 20 years using the data from Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) in Offenbach. Nowhere is a steady warming trend to be found.

August mean temperatures last 20 years.
To the contrary, the trendline for the last 20 years is falling somewhat. However, the meteorologists of the German Weather Service publicly argue, in contradiction to their own data, that the trend of warming continues unabated.
But nowhere does anyone find a trend of continued warming. Also August data confirm what the annual data show.
The IPCC and other climate institutes have done their work. For 20 years temperatures have remained steady with a slight downward trend. The IPCC and the PIK Potsdam Institute can now be disbanded.
108 hectares of new UHI area every day in Germany

On the other hand, it is correct to say that summers have gotten warmer compared to the period 40 to 50 years ago. But this has more to do with a perception of warming that stems from the increasing urban heat island (UHI) from the growing and spreading building construction taking place. In Germany 108 hectares of natural landscape are converted by man into concrete, asphalt and buildings every day. Each new wind turbine consumes on average 5 hectares of land and forests. These added heat islands impact the measurement stations of the German Weather Service. The perceived warming does not stem from some greenhouse gas, but rather from the growing urban heat islands and paving over of natural areas.
Sometimes there are warmer periods and sometimes there are cooler ones. Currently the trend is again a light cooling. This is mainly due to the multi-faceted impacts of the sun and cosmic radiation. The climate of the Earth is created in space, and not on the Earth.  Apples still ripen at the same time of the year as they did 50-60 years ago. The May bug always comes out, if at all, in May just as it did 250 years ago, as described in our old songs about May. There haven’t been any major changes especially over the last decades compared to earlier times. The May temperatures for the last decades confirm this.

May mean temperatures last 21 years. 
Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased relatively strongly over the last 20 years. However, temperatures have been dropping slightly. From this one could only assume that more CO2 has a cooling effect on the climate. That is precisely the opposite of what is claimed by our highly-paid climate warming protectors. The climate models showing rising temperatures as a result of rising, climate-killing CO2 are pure, invented fairy tales.
We are all in favor of real environmental protection and care. But climate protection on the other hand is a pure business scam

Here’s the announcement from CFACT:
CFACT press conference at UN climate conference in Bonn
will call for UN and Obama to acknowledge
global temperature standstill,
to abandon bias and extreme statements and to embrace debate
(Bonn) CFACT will hold a press conference at the UN conference on climate change at Hotel Maritim, Bonn, Wednesday, June 5th at 11:30 AM in room Haydn.
“We at CFACT continue to be amazed at how people stay on their global warming talking points at UN climate conferences as if no new information had come in,” said CFACT Executive Director Craig Rucker. “They pay no heed to real world observational data, or the expense, ineffectiveness, waste, fraud and abuse surrounding the policies being proposed. A UN climate conference is an unrealistic wonderland.”

Measurements of world temperatures show world temperatures to have stalled with no significant warming since the nineties. IPCC climate models and real world temperatures have diverged and the Earth is cooler than projected.
CFACT recently erected a billboard graphing world temperature data reported by the U.K. Met Office in Washington D.C. to raise awareness, however, the U.S. executive branch is operating within a similar information bubble to that which encloses the UNFCCC.
“I don’t have much patience for people who deny climate change” the American President said last Wednesday. His new Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said, “I am not interested in debating what is not debatable.”
“President Obama is not being well advised.” Rucker said. “He appears to have accepted an extreme position and may well be completely uninformed about the global temperature standstill. Obama’s use of the loaded and offensive term “deny” coupled with Moniz’s call for closed minds and stifled debate are the exact opposite of what is called for. This is the kind of rhetoric which has eroded public confidence in the climate process. This is not a way forward citizens of the world can have confidence in.”
At Wednesday’s press conference CFACT will provide evidence which contradicts extreme public climate pronouncements and will provide examples of climate policy waste, fraud and abuse.
CFACT is a UNFCCC accredited NGO and the veteran of numerous UN conferences. CFACT is your ‘go to’ source for news and information for those seeking to balance coverage with reporting which challenges climate and sustainability orthodoxy. CFACT is available to all media.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCarbon Dioxide Will Cease To Be a Problem
By Ed Caryl
We do have the real world measurements of CO2, resolved to a monthly measurement with a well established seasonality that I will not describe here. We also know fairly accurately how much carbon we are injecting into the atmosphere from fossil sources.

Figure 1 is a plot of annual fossil carbon emissions (green trace), the annual atmospheric carbon increase (red trace) computed from Mauna Loa CO2 figures, and emissions minus the ocean and biosphere flux.
In Figure 1, the blue trace (fossil carbon emissions with all the biospheric carbon uptake subtracted) should equal the red trace, and in the long term average (pink trace), it comes close, so our simple model is reflecting the real world in that half the carbon emissions are being taken up by the ocean and the biosphere. The other half is contributing to the atmospheric CO2 increase. The difference between the pink and the green curves in 1977 is about 2.5 Gigatons and is increasing at an ever faster rate. The current difference is about 5 Gigatons. An increasing amount of CO2 is disappearing into the biosphere.
The part that remains is called the “air-borne fraction”. If this part is charted as a percentage you get a plot that looks like this (from James Hansen’s paper here. His Figure 3, is my Figure 2. Hansen’s caption is quoted.

Figure 2: Hansen’s Figure 3 “Fossil fuel CO2 emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed atmospheric CO2 increase to fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.”
I duplicated Hansen’s figure in the next figure, extended, and showed the un-averaged data. The heavy red trace is Hansen’s blue trace above:

Figure 3 above duplicates Hansen’s Figure 3 using the original data. The narrow red trace is the un-averaged computation. The black trace is a 2nd order polynomial trend line.
Note in Figure 3 that the airborne fraction of fossil-fuel carbon polynomial trend line goes to zero in about 30 years. When this happens, atmospheric CO2 will stop increasing. This roughly agrees with the atmospheric CO2 increase ceasing in mid-century as found in the previous article.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s citizens are less willing than ever to accept higher costs for green electricity. Enough is enough, they are now saying.
WDR German public television has a report at its website here on the results of an opinion survey conducted by polling institute Infratest dimap to find out if the public is willing to pay more for green electricity.
54% answered “no”.
That’s 6% more than a year earlier. The results are sobering when one considers how Germans pride themselves as being among the greenest people in the world. Only 41% said they would accept paying more. 3% said they were willing to pay more, but only if the price increase was kept under control.
In 2012 a total of 48% answered “no”.
Not surprisingly the willingness depended on income. 56% of the people with a higher net income said they would accept paying more. However, low income citizens were much less ready to accept higher prices for green electricity: 59% said they were not ready to pay more. What about people earning middle incomes? The ZDF-commissioned survey showed that these people reject green energy even more than the poorer ones: 62% said they would not accept higher prices.
Some years ago, Germans as a whole were convinced that something had to be done to “rescue the climate” and were much more open to paying higher prices for electricity. However the rapid increase in electricity prices over the last years, and hence correspondingly greater pain, has led the public to rethink. Also 5 consecutive unexpectedly harsh winters and the fact that the globe isn’t warming anymore also has had an impact.
As a whole German acceptance of renewable energy is waning rapidly. This also shows that Germans are less alarmed about the threats of climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke at German national daily Die Welt has a commentary at his Die Welt blog about the upcoming IPCC report. IPCC: Discuss or Ignore Warming Stop. He starts:
According to News Service Bloomberg it is currently being discussed whether to mention the ongoing 15-year pause in global in the 5th Assessment Report“ (AR 5) to be released in late September, or if perhaps it would be better to simply ignore it in order not to unnecessarily supply so-called ‘climate skeptics’ with ammunition.”
Alarmist scientists find themselves in a dilemma and aren’t sure what to do. They are eager to argue back against skeptics’s claims that the warming has stopped, yet are petrified of bringing it up. Some are saying it is simply best to ignore the pause in warming. But Kulke writes:
The attempt to keep the warming pause out of the ongoing discussion surrounding the upcoming AR 5 would be ridiculous. Semantic and formal splitting of hairs would not stick because it cannot be denied that also the In-group of the IPCC scientists have acknowledged the stop in warming – at least internally – and view this as the biggest problem. It is “a travesty” they cannot explain. That quote comes from Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the 2001 and 2007 IPCC reports. […] In the meantime Trenberth suspects, according to his models, that the missing heat is somewhere in the depths of the oceans. But this is not certain in any way; perhaps it just doesn’t exist.”
Scientists in a jam

Kulke then adds that the IPCC also will not be able to downgrade the warming pause to a mere weather event and claim that it has nothing to do with overall climate:
Just because it is still in the range of weather and has not yet reached the time span that one uses to discuss climate, ignoring the warming stop would also be outrageous because it would mean you couldn’t mention any weather event that is not at least 30 years long.”
If increasing frequency is the test that alarmists like to use, then it’s tough to get more frequent than every year over the last 15. You can’t claim a team is in a slump-trend after it has just won 15 games in a row.
For the alarmist IPCC scientists, it’s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t situation. Bringing up the warming stop surely will be ammo for the skeptics, but so would ignoring it. Should we feel sorry for them? I don’t think so. It was they themselves who maneuvered their own jewels between the jaws of the vise. Last chance to pull them out!

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski of Spiegel comments on winter storm “Xaver” that pounded the north German coast yesterday, and on North Sea storms in general.

No frequency increase in North Sea storms in 150 years. Photo by a U.S. Army helicopter, Netherlands flood 1953. Public domain photo.
So are North Sea storms getting worse? Bojanowski (my emphasis):
Measurements of air pressure and wind since the middle of the 19th century show no increase in storms in the North Sea. The region over the last years has even been low with respect to wind. Although the year-to-year fluctuations are high, a trend in storm frequency is not detectable by scientists.”
The high frequency, Bojanowski writes, is only found in model projections. He writes:
For the future, climate models foresee a light increase in winter storms over the course of the century. The calculations, however, are in dispute.”
But don’t take the word of a Speigel science journalist. Also read what the German Weather Service says in my last post.

"Game of Thrones (Sky Atlantic/Now TV)Climate Change: The Facts BBC One | iPlayerEarth from Space BBC One | iPlayerBack to Life BBC Three/One | iPlayerTrust Me BBC One | iPlayerChimerica Channel 4 | All 4 So we have a new date for our diaries, to split the nation once more between those howling bereft anguish and those who wish it would all just go away: 20 May is now going to be Threxit day, the day Game of Thrones finally departs our screens.  Whether you’re a diehard fan or not, you can’t really deny that it has been part of our on-off national conversation for the last eight years or so, even more so than Harry Potter the previous decade; and, if you happen to live in Ulster, Iceland or Croatia, it will even have brought a grin to your local finances. It has made fantasy, that spoddiest of jester genres, acceptable (because it wasn’t really about that, ever, just power-politics limned in a simpler medieval brutality); shown that women can be powerful without somehow having to be hobbled with niceness: perhaps, above all, reclaimed television’s vital and urgent power, aided immensely by the franchised dreck of cinematic “blockbusters”, so spawning an exodus of screenwriting, directing, acting talent back to the living room. This final series opener thus had a lot to live up to. It disappointed some, with its perceived failure to move things significantly forward: personally, I was delighted, as, after a nearly two-year hiatus, it gave us all a chance to remind ourselves precisely where we were. At Winterfell was where we were, barnacled in rime or covered in furs, though there have to be new definitions of intensity of “cold” to fully convey Sansa’s pass-agg mien on having to welcome Daenerys. The Wall has been breached, a dragon has been recruited to the undead Walkers, and all is set for a quite stupendous battle, possibly episode four or so, to rival, in scope and quite possibly in actual budget, the Normandy invasion. In all this, it was a grand opener, shot through with dark humour and the occasional tendresse. It all got a little briefly Hollywood with the dragon-ride over Iceland’s striated mad beauties, and my knee jiggled in sympathy with Thrones purists who must have gag-reflexed when came a dragon-snort, half-love, half-jealousy, at Dany and Jon’s waterfall-clinch, but still… and Jon! Jon Snow had a happy episode! Not only did he get to ride a dragon, and find out he was not a “bastard” (in the proper sense of the word rather than simply someone who carves you up on the motorway); but, even better, he’s actually heir to the Iron Throne. Good episode for Jon. (If bad news for his putative love life, but then again, 20 May is coming, and if you can’t shag your aunt before you die… one thing that particularly separates this from Lord of the Rings is its insistence on twincest and the like). And for us. I particularly loved what was surely a back-reference to the one misstep the casting directors have made, shoehorning in Ed Sheeran at the height of his unaccountable fame just because he was (unaccountably) famous, to act very badly as a soldier. As Bronn gossips in his naked frolicking, after the war with Daenerys that “boy Eddie... the ginger... came back with his face burned off”. These casting supremos know how to retro-suckerpunch. More of Iceland, little of it good though, in a simply superb exposition of Climate Change: The Facts. My, after his brief and ongoing Netflix sojourn, Attenborough’s really been allowed to take off the gloves, hasn’t he? No wonder, after 30 years of his trying to tell us all of this, politely thirled both by his love of the BBC and their absurd insistence on “balance”. Yet balance was what the many sharp scientists, most of whom have led the way in this, attempted throughout to show in this one-off (in many senses). Their language was always couched with “coulds” and “all indicators suggests”, as they told a quite simple horror story of, essentially, how our last chance to combat global warming has had the legs cut from under it by the recent deforestation of a third of global woodland for palm-oil growth, and the near-certain climatic tipping points this is entirely likely to engender. It was left to David Attenborough to quietly expound on how that immensely careful use of language by the least alarmist of scientists has been the very thing that has allowed politicians, oil companies, climate-change deniers, a tissue-thin excuse to delay. This was immense, and I do rather wish he’d taken the gloves off 30 years back. We had (blessedly briefly) old footage of Lord Lawson of Winterfell, apparently only him, again and again, telling us essentially that even if the world did get warmer it was a good thing because, said this gentleman who used to keep his hands tight on our Treasury’s windpipe, it would mean fewer people dying of cold. There’s still time, was the message, in both this programme and in Earth from Space, something I’d thought might be a bit gimmicky but turned out to be cloyingly watchable. We watched, rapt, as cameras from space zoomed in on elephants, individual seals, hippo-paths; importantly, though, on the interconnectedness of tiny planetary currents, oceanic and other. As Chiwetel Ejiofor nicely noted in this first (of four) he voices, we thought we were going looking into space; we are ending up learning a now-crucial lot about our planet. He had nicely prosaic hints as to ways forward, to gainsay, for instance, the destruction of half the world’s wildlife in 80 years. Eat all the food we buy. Avoid air-freighted food. Avoid beef and sheep, because they fart. This is something we can do, now. Back to Life, set in Hythe with a fat sprinkling of Dungeness, has something of the same flavour of Don’t Forget the Driver, in what may be termed the new genre of sadcom, but a very different premise. Lass released from jail after 18 years, returning (against all our instincts) to pick up her pieces, locally, where everyone hates her and her own mother hides the knives. This six-parter is, in places, bitter as nuclear wind, in places life-affirmingly warm and funny, and Daisy Haggard knows, very much, what she’s doing, holding a vial of smelling salts up to our own lazy censoriousness with wit and style and melancholy, and expect awards. Hard to get, yet, where the second series of Trust Me is going, with its crippled soldier-veteran in a Glasgow hospital where threat lurks, especially at night, with every pair of scissors, every abandoned nurse-station, as we thrust power ever further into beeping machines and hence hugely enable one dodgy human’s intervention. So far, so very tense, for the first of four, and I for one Trust It, even if you might never trust late-night wards again. In Chimerica, Lucy Kirkwood’s so far splendid adaptation of her own play, we get a killer line at the start of the first (of four) which sums up much of what will follow. “She [a protesting woman] wants to know what happens after you get a dream of democracy,” asks a translator, for a photographer in Tiananmen Square, 1989. “We know what China is dreaming of. What is America dreaming of?” The gung-ho snapper moves on from Pentax to digital Canon, and moves on from global fame, having snapped the man who stood against the tanks in the square, to ignominy. He adulterates a picture in Syria, today, for greater impact in a global half-hour news cycle, in a post-Trump, post-truth world. Obviously, it’s the very worst thing he could have done, braving the war zones but playing right into the prez’s tiny hands. The fallout, in the play, in the series, in real China, in real America, in real journalism, is enough to drive one to Westeros."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother German association of journalists has publicly demanded the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) stop the distribution of a government “blacklist” of US and German skeptics. The UBA is headed by the German Ministry of Environment – Germany’s version of the EPA.
Today Germany’s association of science, the Wissenschafts-Pressekonferenz e.V. (WPK) issued a press release condemning the UBA’s brochure and blacklisting of skeptic journalists. The WPK is an association whose members mainly include science journalists working for the print, broadcasting and Internet media. The stated objective of the WPK: “to promote quality science journalism.”
Just last week the German Association of Journalists demanded an apology from the Federal Environment Ministry. Two of the journalists, Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, are suing the Ministry.
What follows is the press release of the WPK journalist association:

WPK criticizes the pillory of journalists by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA)
The Wissenschafts-Pressekonferenz e.V. (WPK), [English: The Science Press Conference] finds it unacceptable that individual journalists are being publicly paraded by the German Environment Agency, and portrayed as being as incompetent only because they are criticizing leading scientists.  The government body names the journalists who have opinions that ‘correspond to the state of knowledge of climate science’ in its brochure on climate change: ‘And indeed the warming continues’.
‘It is not the duty of state institutions to determine which opinions may be expressed and which may not,’ explained WPK Chairman Martin Schneider. ‘Journalists may and must represent different points of views, and they may and must always question established scientists.’ Overall it cannot be the job of a state authority to quasi certify certain scientific positions as being the truth. Also when the anthropogenic climate change can no longer be doubted, there is in the science an intensive discussion over many details, such as its consequences and the validity of certain climate models. ‘This discourse must take place within the science and journalists must accompany it critically,’ Schneider said.
The WPK requests that Environment Minister Peter Altmaier stop the further distribution of the brochure in its current form.”

Although combining tourism and science on a cruise ship may seem like a creative idea on the surface, it is not a good idea in the world’s harshest environment.
The Daily Mail writes:
An experienced polar explorer has accused climate scientists who hired a ship now trapped in Antarctic ice of endangering passengers and crew – by carrying out the expedition ‘on the cheap’.”
Later adding:
Robert Headland, of Cambridge University’s Scott Polar Research Institute, blamed the team for not investing in a ship suitable to the ‘easily predictable’ sea ice.”
Mr Headland, who has completed successful missions to where the ship was going, said: ‘The expedition was hopelessly optimistic in trying to carry out this mission on the cheap and has needlessly taken many risks.”
Good to see the major media doing their job in digging into this debacle. And it looks some are even reading NoTricksZone once in awhile.
And now that an expert like Robert Headland is calling the expedition “needlessly risky”, Turney is finding himself standing on increasingly thin ice.

===================================
The sun in November 2013: You’re going to have to add more antifreeze
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In November 2013 the sun showed signs of more activity as sunspot number (SSN) was 77.6. This solar cycle month (the 60th of the current cycle) was therefore “only” 32% below the level of a normally active sun. Just as a reminder: February 2013 was 66% below the mean value of all the previous observed cycles 1-23! Compared to the mean (blue) the current cycle (red) appears as follows:

Figure 1: Current cycle 24 (red) versus mean solar cycle (blue) and solar cycle 5 (gray).  
Since solar cycle 24 began in December 2008, we have been witnessing a much weaker than normal solar cycle. Temporary spikes like those of last month reaching mean value have been the exception rather than the norm. Thus we continue to be on a similar track as SC 5, which was the first of the Dalton Minimum just after 1800. If one accumulates the sunspot number anomalies of each cycle up to the current month 60, we get the following graphic:

 Figure 2: Accumulated sunspot anomaly for each cycle after 60 months.
One immediately sees the abrupt drop in solar cycle 23, which ended in April 2006. Already SC 23 was slightly below normal, and the current cycle has been the calmest since SC 7 in 1833.
What lies ahead?
We have already cited forecasts based on physical attributes where the behavior of the corona (a very warm zone above the visible surface of the sun) and the magnetic field strength about the sun spots suggest continued weakening activity for the next solar cycle (Livingston/Penn). We now cite a study by Salvador (2013) that attempts to reconstruct solar cycles using planetary tidal effects on the sun. Even though we view this approach with skepticism, an amazing level of congruence with observed data is achieved:

Figure 3: Source: study by Salvador (2013).

The red curve depicts the model and the blue curve shows the observed sunspot data since 1749. On this basis the author then makes a forecast where he takes the data starting in 1987 and calibrates his models using amplitudes and extends it into the future:

Figure 4. Source: Figure 7 of study by Salvador (2013).
Also in his model, SC 25 and 26 are projected to be very weak and in fact he forecasts a weak sun to persist until the end of the century. It is not our intention to forecast so far into the future, but little is expected to happen with our sun in the next 30 years the author of the article believes in addition to other authors. What impact will this have on the Earth?  Shouldn’t the drop in solar activity have and impact? What follows is a chart of the global wintertime temperature distribution comparing the values of the last 10 years to the 12 years that preceded them:

Figure 5. Source: GISS
The land-based temperatures in the winter between 30N and 60N have fallen. Especially the Eurasian region has been experiencing much colder winters since 2002. The datasets yield the following interesting results:

Figure 6.
Depicted by the red curve is the annual SSN anomaly since 2002 as to the first figure. Can the drop since 2003 indeed at least be partially because of the reduced solar activity?
There is plenty of literature available on this, and a possible relation is explained by Sarah Ineson (2012) in a presentation by the British Met Office. The reduced UV radiation of the sun at low activity has an impact on the stratosphere and this has an effect especially on the winter circulation down to the Earth’s surface.
What does this tell us?
The trend to colder winters here in Europe and elsewhere, all the way to China in the Far East and the east coast of the USA, has truly been robust over the last 10 years. From this we conclude that we hardly can anticipate warmer winters for the near future and that it may remain that way for a very long time should the solar relationship be confirmed. Therefore add more anti-freeze in the windscreen wiper reservoir of your car! Winter has arrived and likely it isn’t going to be a mild one!

"For decades, we have faced an incontrovertible truth: that human lifestyles are risking the future habitability of our planet. For decades, political leaders have invoked rousing rhetoric in the face of this challenge while failing to act to avert catastrophe. Climate change is an existential risk to the future and the window available to prevent disastrous overheating is closing rapidly. Only now, almost 30 years after the International Panel on Climate Change published its first report setting out the scientific evidence, is there any sense that something may be shifting in popular and political perceptions. Extinction Rebellion protesters have brought parts of central London to a standstill, their action coming in the wake of the school climate strikes, when more than 1.4 million young people took part globally. For his part, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned the financial sector last week that it must take the threat seriously, framing the argument in terms that it understands best: that in a heated world there is a real risk to profit margins. These are different responses to the same hard facts. The 20 warmest years since records began occurred in the past 22 years and the IPCC estimates we are likely to reach 1.5C above temperatures in pre-industrial times as early as 2030 on current trends. If we are to have any chance of keeping global warming to well below 2C, as set out in the Paris agreement, the world needs to reach net zero-carbon emissions by the middle of this century. The UN secretary general has warned that we have one year to change course to avoid missing this target. The need for action is critical. The rate at which the world is warming is rapidly increasing and scientists fear we will soon reach a tipping point. One example would be the disappearance of Arctic sea ice in summer, an event that would impair Earth’s ability to reflect solar radiation and lead to even more warming and devastation. Global warming is already inflicting huge damage. We are seeing more extreme weather events – heatwaves, floods and droughts – with increasing cost to human, animal and plant life. Scientists believe 8% of the world’s species are at risk of extinction. A quarter of the world’s coral reefs have already died as a result of the warming of our oceans. It will be the world’s poorest nations that will bear the brunt of the devastation to come, even though they have the least responsibility – they have made a negligible contribution to historic emissions, and the poorest half of the world is responsible for just 10% of annual emissions. Yet the consequences will continue to fall on these underprivileged countries. However, there has been some progress. Carbon emissions are falling in many countries; in the UK, they have been cut to 19th-century levels. But these reductions have not come quickly enough and what has been achieved so far has been the gathering of the low-hanging fruit, such as closing coal-fired power stations, changes that have not required big lifestyle alterations. Since 2015 the British government has performed a series of dizzying U-turns on climate change policy, sacrificing commitments such as zero-carbon homes and investment in carbon capture storage on the altar of austerity. Now Brexit is distracting us even more from the impending crisis. As a result, the UK is on course to decisively miss its own legally binding emissions targets for 2027 and 2032. Internationally, the election of President Trump has seen the United States withdraw from the Paris agreement, and the election of rightwing populists such as Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil poses a further threat to global progress. The ratcheting up of the discourse reflects the ratcheting up of the stakes. Extinction Rebellion is a movement born of desperation, showcasing the determination of activists to use whatever peaceful tactics are necessary to get politicians to take the threat seriously. They enjoyed real success last week, forcing climate change into the headlines when it would otherwise have been ignored. But there are limits to the effectiveness of this approach. Limiting global warming requires widespread lifestyle change among the world’s richest populations. Proposals for a green new deal developed on both sides of the Atlantic illustrate how much government can do with political commitment. But action is far more likely if voters are applying pressure on government to take the radical action that will shift people’s lifestyles and behaviour – through measures such as green taxation, regulation or even rationing. So while a radical movement such as Extinction Rebellion can act as a much-needed catalyst to get people talking about climate change, the case for action will in the end need to be made in a much broader way that appeals to voters from across the political spectrum. There’s much to learn from the campaign for equal marriage in the US, which successfully won round conservative voters by framing the argument not primarily in the language of rights, but in values of love, commitment and family. This remains the missing link in avoiding catastrophic climate change. How to make people see that this is the most existential threat humankind has ever faced, yet without making them feel fatalistic about their lack of ability to influence events. If we fail to crack this conundrum, the future of our planet hangs in the balance."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Russia’s German edition of Ria Novosti online, a Russian WWF climate expert claims that the recent “climate anomaly” of winter weather and a hurricane strength storm occurring in southern France in late spring confirms the anthropogenic impact on global climate. http://de.rian.ru/science/20100505/126183713.html.
Ria Novosti interviewed WWF climate expert Alexei Kokorin, who says:
The situation in France fits right in with the theory of anthropogenic climate change. We are now able to observe marginal climate change. Temperature and precipitation fluctuations have increased 10-fold. In Russia the number of dangerous hydrometeorological events have increased 10-fold in the last 15 years.
Nothing you wouldn’t expect from an alarmist. But then he adds (original German):
Wir können in Zukunft mit einem etwas wärmeren und zugleich weitaus instabileren Klima, darunter mit Schneefällen im Mai und Juli, rechnen.
In English:
In the future we [Russians] can anticipate a somewhat warmer and much more unstable climate, including snowfalls in May and July.
Warmer and yet snowfalls in the summertime? You gotta be kidding.
But do expect the IPCC to cite them in its upcoming 5th assessment report. The chances of being cited are quite good – Alexei Kokorin is the director of the Russian WWF Climate Protection Program.  In the past the IPCC has had no qualms about citing such sources.

"This article is excerpted from a piece published by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. The Guardian is partnering with CJR and the Nation on a 30 April conference aimed at reframing the way journalists cover climate change. More information about the conference, including a link to RSVP, is here. Last summer, during the deadliest wildfire season in California’s history, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes got into a revealing Twitter discussion about why US television doesn’t much cover climate change. Elon Green, an editor at Longform, had tweeted, “Sure would be nice if our news networks – the only outlets that can force change in this country – would cover it with commensurate urgency.” Hayes (who is an editor at large for the Nation) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, All In With Chris Hayes spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”  The Twittersphere pounced. “TV used to be obligated to put on programming for the public good even if it didn’t get good ratings. What happened to that?” asked @JThomasAlbert. @GalJaya said, “Your ‘ratings killer’ argument against covering #climatechange is the reverse of that used during the 2016 primary when corporate media justified gifting Trump $5 billion in free air time because ‘it was good for ratings,’ with disastrous results for the nation.” When @mikebaird17 urged Hayes to invite Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University, one of the best climate science communicators around, on to his show, she tweeted that All In had canceled on her twice – once when “I was literally in the studio w[ith] the earpiece in my ear” – and so she wouldn’t waste any more time on it. “Wait, we did that?” Hayes tweeted back. “I’m very very sorry that happened.” This spring Hayes redeemed himself, airing perhaps the best coverage on American television yet of the Green New Deal. All In devoted its entire 29 March broadcast to analyzing the congressional resolution, co-sponsored by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, which outlines a plan to mobilize the United States to stave off climate disaster and, in the process, create millions of green jobs. In a shrewd answer to the ratings challenge, Hayes booked Ocasio-Cortez, the most charismatic US politician of the moment, for the entire hour. Yet at a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster, climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media. Especially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time. Many newspapers, too, are failing the climate test. Last October, the scientists of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a landmark report, warning that humanity had a mere 12 years to radically slash greenhouse gas emissions or face a calamitous future in which hundreds of millions of people worldwide would go hungry or homeless or worse. Only 22 of the 50 biggest newspapers in the United States covered that report. Instead of sleepwalking us toward disaster, the US news media need to remember their Paul Revere responsibilities – to awaken, inform and rouse the people to action. To that end, the Nation and CJR are launching Covering Climate Change: A New Playbook for a 1.5-Degree World, a project aimed at dramatically improving US media coverage of the climate crisis. When the IPCC scientists issued their 12-year warning, they said that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C would require radically transforming energy, agriculture, transportation, construction and other core sectors of the global economy. Our project is grounded in the conviction that the news sector must be transformed just as radically. The project will launch on 30 April with a conference at the Columbia Journalism School – a working forum where journalists will gather to start charting a new course. We envision this event as the beginning of a conversation that America’s journalists and news organizations must have with one another, as well as with the public we are supposed to be serving, about how to cover this rapidly uncoiling emergency. Judging by the climate coverage to date, most of the US news media still don’t grasp the seriousness of this issue. There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. We as a civilization urgently need to slow that train down and help as many people off the tracks as possible. It’s an enormous challenge, and if we don’t get it right, nothing else will matter. The US mainstream news media, unlike major news outlets in Europe and independent media in the US, have played a big part in getting it wrong for many years. It’s past time to make amends. If 1.5C is the new limit for a habitable planet, how can newsrooms tell that story in ways that will finally resonate with their audiences? And given journalism’s deeply troubled business model, how can such coverage be paid for? Some preliminary suggestions. (You can read this story in its entirety at Columbia Journalism Review or The Nation.) Don’t blame the audience, and listen to the kids. The onus is on news organizations to craft the story in ways that will demand the attention of readers and viewers. The specifics of how to do this will vary depending on whether a given outlet works in text, radio, TV or some other medium and whether it is commercially or publicly funded, but the core challenge is the same. A majority of Americans are interested in climate change and want to hear what can be done about it. This is especially true of the younger people that news organizations covet as an audience. Even most young Republicans want climate action. And no one is speaking with more clarity now than Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Villaseñor and the other teenagers who have rallied hundreds of thousands of people into the streets worldwide for the School Strike 4 Climate demonstrations. Establish a diverse climate desk, but don’t silo climate coverage. The climate story is too important and multidimensional for a news outlet not to have a designated team covering it. That team must have members who reflect the economic, racial and gender diversity of America; if not, the coverage will miss crucial aspects of the story and fail to connect with important audiences. At the same time, climate change is so far-reaching that connections should be made when reporting on nearly every topic. For example, an economics reporter could partner with a climate reporter to cover the case for a just transition: the need to help workers and communities that have long relied on fossil fuel, such as the coal regions of Appalachia, transition to a clean-energy economy, as the Green New Deal envisions. Learn the science. Many journalists have long had a bias toward the conceptual. But you can’t do justice to the climate crisis if you don’t understand the scientific facts, in particular how insanely late the hour is. At this point, anyone suggesting a leisurely approach to slashing emissions is not taking the science seriously. Make the time to get educated. Four recent books – McKibben’s Falter, Naomi Klein’s On Fire, David Wallace-Wells’s The Uninhabitable Earth, and Jeff Goodell’s The Water Will Come – are good places to start. Don’t internalize the spin. Not only do most Americans care about climate change, but an overwhelming majority support a Green New Deal – 81% of registered voters said so as of last December, according to Yale climate pollsters. Trump and Fox don’t like the Green New Deal? Fine. But journalists should report that the rest of America does. Likewise, they should not buy the argument that supporting a Green New Deal is a terrible political risk that will play into the hands of Trump and the GOP; nor should the media give credence to wild assertions about what a Green New Deal would do or cost. The data simply does not support such accusations. But breaking free from this ideological trap requires another step. Lose the Beltway mindset. It’s not just the Green New Deal that is popular with the broader public. Many of the subsidiary policies – such as Medicare for All and free daycare – are now supported by upwards of 70% of the American public, according to Pew and Reuters polls. Inside the Beltway, this fact is unknown or discounted; the assumption by journalists and the politicians they cover is that such policies are ultra-leftist political suicide. They think this because the Beltway worldview prioritizes transactional politics: what will Congress pass and the president sign into law? But what Congress and the White House do is often very different from what the American people favor, and the press should not confuse the two. Help the heartland. Some of the places being hit hardest by climate change, such as the midwestern states flooded this spring, have little access to real climate news; instead, the denial peddled by Fox News and Rush Limbaugh dominates. Iconic TV newsman Bill Moyers has an antidote: “Suppose you formed a consortium of media that could quickly act as a strike force to show how a disaster like this is related to climate change – not just for the general media, but for agricultural media, heartland radio stations, local television outlets. A huge teachable moment could be at hand if there were a small coordinating nerve center of journalists who could energize reporting, op-eds, interviews, and so on that connect the public to the causes and not just the consequences of events like this.” Moyers added that such a team should “always have on standby a pool of the most reputable scientists who, on camera and otherwise, can connect natural disasters to the latest and most credible scientific research”. Cover the solutions. There isn’t a more exciting time to be on the climate beat. That may sound strange, considering how much suffering lies in store from the impacts that are already locked in. But with the Green New Deal, the US government is now, for the first time, at least talking about a response that is commensurate with the scale and urgency of the problem. Reporters have a tendency to gravitate to the crime scene, to the tragedy. They have a harder time with the solutions to a problem; some even mistake it as fluff. Now, with climate change, the solution is a critical part of the story. Don’t be afraid to point fingers. As always, journalists should shun cheerleading, but neither should we be neutral. Defusing the climate crisis is in everyone’s interest, but some entities are resolutely opposed to doing what the science says is needed, starting with the president of the United States. The press has called out Trump on many fronts – for his lying, corruption and racism – but his deliberate worsening of the climate crisis has been little mentioned, though it is arguably the most consequential of his presidential actions. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has announced plans to keep producing large amounts of oil and gas through at least 2040; other companies have made similar declarations. If enacted, those plans guarantee catastrophe. Journalism has a responsibility to make that consequence clear to the public and to cover the companies, executives, and investors behind those plans accordingly. If American journalism doesn’t get the climate story right – and soon – no other story will matter. The news media’s past climate failures can be redeemed only by an immediate shift to more high-profile, inclusive and fearless coverage. Our #CoveringClimateNow project calls on all journalists and news outlets to join the conversation about how to make that happen. As the nation’s founders envisioned long ago, the role of a free press is to inform the people and hold the powerful accountable. These days, our collective survival demands nothing less."
"Many of the coastal sea defences erected after the 1953 flood that killed 307 people in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Lincolnshire are disintegrating through age, and need to be replaced. However, with a sea level rise of up to 1.15 metres, or possibly more, this century, and increasingly violent storms forecast, then simply rebuilding them or making them higher is too expensive to be a viable option. Since tourism and access to the sea are vital, and the benefits to birdlife and fish nurseries that the region’s marshes represent are valuable assets, then a different way has to be found.  Research has shown that a salt marsh just 40m wide can reduce the height of waves by 20%, and 80m wide to near zero. Academics from Cambridge (which, judging from a topographical map, might otherwise be needing a sea wall in the future), other experts from the region’s universities and conservation groups such as the National Trust that own a lot of the coast, are intent on expanding existing marshes.  Since it is the storm waves that demolish cliffs and even solid concrete walls, the plan is to retreat slightly inland and develop “soft defences” in front of valuable farmland and coastal settlements to prevent much larger swathes of East Anglia being swallowed by the sea.

By Ed Caryl
We have somewhat reliable global scale land surface and sea surface temperature measurements since about 1880. We have lower troposphere satellite temperature measurements since 1979. We have ice core CO2 measurements and real atmospheric CO2 measurements that overlap and agree at the overlap for this time span. There is general agreement that CO2 was not responsible for warming before World War II. Here is a plot of that history.

Figure 1 is a plot of the history of global temperature since 1880, along with the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The various cooling and warming periods are color coded.
Figure 1 plots the global temperature according to GISS. There are two warming periods, two cooling periods, and one flat trend period: the current pause. During this entire 133 year span, CO2 has been rising steadily, for the first half at about three parts per million per decade, and during the last half at about four times that, an average of about 13 ppm per decade. It is generally recognized that the cooling and warming from before 1880 to 1976, a century span, could not have been related to CO2. Yet it is claimed that the brief 20-year warming from 1977 to 1997 was completely due to man’s use of fossil fuel and the resulting 30 ppm CO2 increase and that somehow the 22 ppm increase from 1940 to 1976, and the additional 30 ppm increase since 1997, did nothing.
The 1977 to 1997 warming is also recorded in the satellite measurements, but has a lower amplitude than the surface measurements. The satellite measurement in the last 16 years indicates flat temperatures or even a slight cooling. The case for CO2 caused global warming is restricted to one 20-year period in the last 133 years. What about the 80 years of cooling or flat temperature response? What was responsible for that? There are other, much more logical explanations than the variance of CO2.
Here is another plot, like Figure 1, but proposing another cause for temperature fluctuations.

Figure 2 is a plot of the history of global temperature since 1880, along with the Atlantic Multi-decade oscillation (AMO) in black. The various cooling and warming epochs are color coded. 
Note that in Figure 2 the number of fine details that match between the AMO and year to year temperature variations. Note also that when the AMO declines the temperature declines, and when the AMO is increases the temperature increases. The AMO is a de-trended index based on sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, so it will not show the rising temperature trend in global temperature as a whole. But it does reflect the cyclic nature of global temperatures. Also, because the AMO cycle is roughly 66 to 70 years, a down-turn in temperature is indicated for the next 35 or so years.
There is currently much discussion of the solar influence on temperature. We know that historically recognized minimums in solar activity have coincided with socially disruptive cooling, crop failures, famines, plagues and iced-over rivers and canals. The Maunder Minimum of the 17th century is the best known, but there have been others.

Figure 3 is a plot of reconstructed TSI data from Beryllium 10 isotope data from ice cores.


Figure 4 is a table of minimums and maximums with dates for beginning and end of each recognized event.
Next is a plot of temperature over that same period from the year 800. Note that the Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums together are responsible for the Little Ice Age from 1450 to 1850 with minor remissions. The Medieval and modern warming is due to solar activity.

Figure 5 from Moberg et al 2005, found here.
We can expand the solar influence on the most recent times to the same scale as Figure 1.

Figure 6 is a combination of (blue and red, left scale) the sunspot count with an 11-year moving average, and two TSI estimates based on Be10 studies (purple and black, right scale, source link in figure 3 title) and another study using sunspot and satellite radiance measurements (orange, right scale).
In Figure 6, the Gleisberg minimum is discernible at the turn of the 19th to 20th century, as is the unnamed drop in temperature in the 1960’s and 70’s. Solar activity and ocean cycles produce the warming and cooling periods seen in Figure 1 and 2. The “pause” since 1998 is due to reaching a peak in the AMO/PDO cycle and a reduction in solar radiance. Ocean cycles alone will force the next 30 years of cooling. As many others have repeatedly stated in this blog and elsewhere, this cooling could be extended and deepened by a new solar minimum. This will be called the Landscheidt or Eddy minimum.
Clearly ocean and sun drive temperature
CO2 has not been, and will not be, the driver of temperature. Clearly ocean and solar radiance cycles drive temperature, and then temperature (short term) and fossil carbon use (longer term) drives CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe now half-constructed 37-story Walkie Talkie glass skyscraper in London was given a special concave shape by its architect, Rafael Vinoly. Read here at the Daily Mail.
Photo left: Walkie-Talkie building’s faulty design focuses sunlight and scorches property below. Photo by Eluveitie, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license. 
However, just after mid day whenever the sun is shining, the building’s unique shape focuses sunlight like a ray gun to a small area onto the street and adjacent buildings below. The concentrated sunlight scorches parked cars, blisters paintwork, cracks tiles, singes fabric, and is reported to even have ignited fires.
Clearly architect Vinoly goofed and failed to take into account the impacts of the building’s shape and orientation. But it’s not like he couldn’t have know about such problems. The Mail writes that another building he designed in Las Vegas, the Vdara Hotel, built in 2010, had the very same problems.
The Mail reports that Vinoly was unavailable for comment.
Spiegel: Architect blames climate change
But yesterday, Germany’s online Spiegel here reports that architect Vinoly has commented and is partly blaming climate change for the building’s intense reflected heat.

Spiegel writes and quotes Vinoly:
The developers did not take the sun enough into account. But: When he came to London years ago, it wasn’t as sunny. Now there are lots of sunny days. ‘So, shouldn’t we also make climate change responsible, or not?'”
Right. What was the architect thinking? He knew it was a mistake in Las Vegas. Did he think that London would never see sunny days in the summertime? You only need one sunny day and the problem is there.
Vinoly’s sorrowful attempt to dodge responsibility is typical today. Nobody is ever responsible for big screw-ups or gross incompetence anymore. Now it’s always climate change. Mankind is collectively responsible for the foul-ups of sloppy and incompetent individuals.
Granted Vinoly doesn’t blame it all on climate, which any competent architect learns to take into account from day one. According to Spiegel he concedes:
We’ve made lots of mistakes with the building. We will address the problems.”
Hooray. Vinoly appears to have learned that the sun indeed does shine in London after all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Irish Examiner here reports that Robert Devoy, professor of physical geography at UCC, says the greater wind speeds and flooding in Ireland of the last few days are “what we would expect from a warming climate caused by the impact of humans”.
However, he cites no substantial data to support that. In fact global data on accumulated cyclone energy, hurricanes, droughts, tornadoes, etc. all show no trend, or in many cases even a decline. Yet Devoy claims:
We have had some exceptional events in recent years and these exceptional events are becoming more common.”
How Devoy can claim this is a mystery. Even the alarmist IPCC in its last fifth assessment report stated that there is no link between severe weather and humans.
Prof Devoy also says that “weather patterns had gone outside the natural pattern of weather events and this is a continuation of that” and that “the nature of these storms is changing.”
The nature of storms? What exactly? Prof. Devoy is hiding behind vague statements and doesn’t provide a single measure. He is just saying that storms are different. Scientifically his comments are a dustbin overflowing with rubbish.
He also claims sea level near Dublin is accelerating, claiming that “in the past decade, a regional rise of 2mm-3mm has been recorded by satellite stations and tidal gauges.”
We don’t know if Prof Devoy and the Irish Examiner are oblivious to history, or if they are maliciously trying to mislead the public. Why look only at the past decade? The available data for Dublin from the NOAA go back 80 years and shows very little overall sea level rise trend. Moreover, ten years is by far too short a time to infer a trend.

This leads us to wonder why Professor Devoy would make so many outlandish claims. We suppose it has something to do with money. The Irish Examiner quotes Devoy at the end of the article:
He called for further investment in weather monitoring in this country so that scientists can better chart patterns.”
I think the weather is monitored just fine in Ireland with all the satellite and weather station data constantly being collected. What we need are scientists who are not too lazy to go back more than 10 years.
UPDATE: Ed Caryl has provided a link with an updated chart, now posted above. It appears that Professor Devoy’s Dublin sudden sea level rise came in a single year: 2001. In 2001, the gauge changed hands. More research on this could be most interesting.

"Polly Higgins, one of the most inspiring figures in the green movement, has died aged 50. Higgins, a British barrister, led a decade-long campaign for “ecocide” to be recognised as a crime against humanity. She sold her house and gave up a high-paying job so she could dedicate herself to attempting to create a law that would make corporate executives and government ministers criminally liable for the damage they do to ecosystems.  Such a legal instrument could be a powerful tool for conservationists, climate campaigners and activists trying to stop air and water pollution, but earlier proposals for this to be included in the Rome statute on international crimes against humanity were dropped in 1996. Ten years ago Higgins set out to revive the idea. She wrote a book, Eradicating Ecocide, lobbied the United Nations law commission, organised mock trials and established a trust fund for “Earth protectors”. Although the law has yet to be recognised, momentum is growing as a result of the ongoing climate crisis and growing evidence that major companies lobbied against policies that could protect people from pollution and other environmental harm. On her organisation’s website, Higgins lamented the continued absence of a law that she believed would change the world. “There is a missing responsibility to protect … What is required is an expansion of our collective duty of care to protect the natural living world and all life. International ecocide crime is a law to protect the Earth.” Higgins grew up on the shores of Loch Lomond and childhood discussions with her meteorologist father and artist mother were often about green issues. According to an interview with the Scotsman, her parents were initially shocked that their daughter had entered the legal profession, but Higgins later said: “The Earth is in need of a good lawyer.” Several other legal organisations are now fighting for the environment in the courts, with occasional successes such as the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, in which a judge ruled that the government’s efforts to fight climate change were inadequate and emissions cuts must be stepped up. Campaigners say an ecocide law would take this and other campaigns to protect nature to new levels. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot wrote that it could make the difference between a habitable and uninhabitable world by shifting the balance of power and forcing executives to think twice about actions that might damage the planet. After discovering she had an aggressive form of cancer and had only weeks to live, Higgins told Monbiot that the work she pioneered would go on after her death. “My legal team will continue undeterred,” she said. “But there are millions who care so much and feel so powerless about the future, and I would love to see them begin to understand the power of this one, simple law to protect the Earth – to realise it’s possible, even straightforward. I wish I could live to see a million Earth protectors standing for it – because I believe they will.” On social media, tributes and condolence messages were sent by a wide range of groups and individuals, including philosophers, human rights campaigners, lawyers and Extinction Rebellion activists. The author and activist Naomi Klein tweeted: “She devoted her life to changing broken laws that have failed so miserably to protect the natural systems on which we all depend. Her work will live on.” Kate Raworth, a teacher at the Environmental Change Institute of Oxford University, said she was devastated by the loss of the brilliant, pioneering legal campaigner. “May bright young lawyers worldwide be inspired to continue her essential work,” she tweeted."

"‘From space, the view of our planet is breathtaking,” purrs Chiwetel Ejiofor, who narrates the wonderfully soporific new nature series Earth from Space (BBC One). It is a difficult time for the genre: all the pleasure to be found in viewing our natural splendour is being tainted, somewhat, by an imminent sense of doom and destruction. It’s hard to show beautiful animals without acknowledging that their habitats are at risk of disappearing entirely. Earth from Space does not evade the perils of climate change, and some of its quiet power comes from simply showing the damage being done. It opens with a family of elephants in Kenya, with a calf in danger of starvation and a herd that has barely eaten because of an extreme dry season. These animals are heartbreakingly emaciated. But the rain comes and they make it through. The approach is more gentle than bombastic. Perhaps there is a hope that, in seeing animals in their glory, we might take more care of what we have.  Earth from Space promises a new perspective on nature documentaries by using, as its starting point, images taken from some of the thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, which are now so capable of capturing minute detail that they can pick out individual animals from space. The tinfoil hat side of my brain began to look up at the sky with suspicion, before I realised that it is safe to assume that a herd of elephants frolicking in the rain holds more interest than the tea-drinking habits of a writer in perpetual pyjamas, but even so. From these unimaginably far away shots, we get closer, and zoom in, until we’re right there on the delta with warring hippos, or in the Himalayas with snub-nosed monkeys whose tiny faces are extraordinary, their smeared, plumped lips looking as if they belong more on the cover of a celebrity weekly than slurping the nectar of rhododendron flowers. Ejiofor narrates us around the world with poetic flair, taking us from vignette to vignette with speed, and there is little time to linger. While some stories earn more time, we zip past seals on the coast of Namibia and an isolated, unexplored rainforest high on a clifftop in Mozambique; an underwater volcano is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it interlude. There is ample aesthetic appeal in seeing Earth from above, which will not be news to anyone who has recently found themselves having to select a new screensaver. Sweeping shots of Lake Baikal in Siberia, frozen over for five months of the year, reveal shards of ice stacked like tiles, and there is a grim beauty to even its most perilous spots, as the huge dark rings of meltwater threaten the survival of baby seals. There is far more here, however, than just a visual treat. Surveillance of this kind allows scientists to see places they might not have been able to access previously, and the resulting insights can be significant. The satellites pick up brown smears tainting the white ice of the Antarctic. The old adage that one should never eat yellow snow takes on a whole new meaning when its origins are revealed, and the diet of the emperor penguins that live there has a lot to answer for. It is a rare moment of optimism: spotting these new colonies, essentially identified by the trails of faeces they leave in their wake, has more than doubled the known global population. Enjoy that moment while it lasts; it is followed by a shot of a vast iceberg four times the size of Greater London breaking off from the Arctic shelf. Ejiofor explains that as well as spying on nature, satellites mean “we can also see our cities” (the tinfoil hat is vibrating again), and flashes of humans gathered en masse appear: in Mecca for hajj, Burning Man, even Glastonbury, though in my experience, it would be kinder all round not to zoom in on revellers too closely. In central China, though, the beauty is truly remarkable, and the programme-makers have saved the best until last. Thousands of students of Shaolin kung-fu, who train for six hours a day, six days a week, perform a routine in near-perfect unison. Even from a regular point of view, this is an astonishing spectacle. But from above, from far away, it looks like a grand, magnificent flower unfurling. It seems inappropriate, in the light of the underlying message that people are ruining everything, to come to this point, but here we are, with human beings, stealing the show again."
"The head of the Metropolitan police, Cressida Dick, has urged Extinction Rebellion activists to protest lawfully as officers continued a large-scale operation to clear environmental campaigners from sites at Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge in central London. With more than 1,500 officers on duty at the protests, Dick has asked demonstrators to move to an officially designated site in Marble Arch or go home. Later on Saturday, hundreds of police officers were clearing activists from a blockade on Waterloo Bridge, where protesters have been since the Extinction Rebellion disruption campaign started five days ago. The Press Association reported that by 6pm officers had removed six campaigners who had been chained and glued to the underside of a lorry on the bridge in an operation that took almost six hours. Quite the scene on Waterloo Bridge. Hundreds of police are here to clear the #extinctionrebellion protest camp. pic.twitter.com/7mCuOZnLs1 Earlier, crowds clapped and cheered as activists who had been chained to the road at Oxford Circus were lifted into police vans. Police drafted in 200 extra officers to deal with the protests, which began on Monday and have resulted in more than 750 arrests. Officers said they would try to clear Oxford Circus by the end of the Saturday. Speaking to Sky News, Cressida Dick said that “lots of people have had miserable disruption to their lives” because of the anti-climate change movement. “I’ve got one message for the protesters: please, go to Marble Arch where you can protest lawfully, stop your unlawful protests, and if you don’t want to go to Marble Arch then go home.” An Extinction Rebellion spokesman at Waterloo Bridge said there were more than 100 officers on the bridge, with 14 police vans and a large tow truck at its south end and more vans at the north. “It looks like they are making a concerted effort to clear the bridge,” the spokesman said. A video of police dragging demonstrators along the ground in an operation to remove a pink boat from Oxford Circus on Friday prompted concerns about police tactics against protesters, who have been polite and apologetic throughout. Officers used angle grinders to cut through the bars below the hull of the Berta Cáceres boat, named after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, to which protesters had chained and glued themselves. The intersection was calm on Saturday as bank holiday shoppers mingled with protesters, asking questions about the movement and its tactics. Of the 750 people arrested in connection with the campaign as of 4pm on Saturday, which has included protests at Marble Arch and Parliament Square, 28 have been charged. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The Met said most of the arrests had been for breaching section 14 orders, which are in place in all the protest areas except Marble Arch. The force announced that on Friday it had renewed the order requiring protesters to clear Waterloo Bridge for a further three days. On Saturday, police were accused of intimidating protesters, many of whom are young people, in an attempt to crush the movement. Mike Schwarz of Bindmans solicitors in London said he was concerned about elements of police conduct and tactics. Schwarz, who is representing a large number of protesters, told the Observer that officers appeared to be attempting to scare people at the demonstrations, many of whom faced being arrested for the first time. By Saturday afternoon, only 28 people had been charged with an offence out of 750 arrested by 4pm. “Police tactics, perhaps deliberately, run the risk of intimidating activists in the hope of subduing the protest,” Schwarz said. “Many of the arrests have been first-timers. The policing often appears disproportionate.” He added: “There is concern about police conduct at the stations. They have been detaining people for hours – why are they keeping them in cells for so long? What is behind this? It might be a lack of resources, a lack of coordination and, simply, a war of attrition, where they are desperate to get people off the sites.” Extinction Rebellion designated Oxford Circus a place to discuss the campaign with members of the public who have questions. On Saturday, bank holiday shoppers were keen to engage. Michelle, 30, and Lee, 31, from St Helens in Merseyside, were eager to speak to activists during an Easter break in London after watching the campaign unfold on TV during the week. “I agree with some of the points but I disagree with the methods,” Michelle said after a lengthy discussion with an activist, adding that the movement appeared quite London-centric. “It wouldn’t happen in St Helens,” added her partner. Milo, seven, was in Oxford Circus with his father and said he thought the protests were a good thing. #ExtinctionRebellion pic.twitter.com/pWgEpLQZaJ If climate change is not avoided, “it’s going to get so hot like Venus. Everyone is going to die and there’s going to be a total extinction. If the government listens, they might fly less planes and drive less cars,” he said. Nick, a 56-year-old civil servant who was chained to the road at Oxford Circus, said it was “an unusual way to spend his annual leave”. He said he was not happy to be there and he did not take the possibility of being arrested lightly “but I’m going to be here as long as it takes”. After actor Emma Thompson’s appearance at Oxford Circus on Friday, Olympic gold medalist Etienne Stott was among the latest celebrities to lend their support to the demonstrators. The London 2012 canoe slalom champion turned up at Waterloo Bridge after joining protests in Nottingham, and told the Press Association: “I joined the protests because I don’t think there is anything more meaningful that I could be doing in my life right now. “The climate emergency is just such a serious thing, and for me I’m willing to put in as much time and energy as I can spare and try and use everything I can to try and make the situation better.” The singer Charlotte Church tweeted her support saying that she would join the protesters in the future. @ExtinctionR I'll be with you for the next one. I wanted to watch for a while, sorry not super brave,  but having seen how peaceful,creative, purposeful and family friendly your protest was I will join you next time. Thank you for your giving. Xx Late on Saturday, just before midnight, there still appeared to be significant numbers of activists at three London sites – Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square – despite the call from the Met chief to confine their demonstration to Marble Arch.  Thanks for the support @charlottechurch and by the way the Rebellion has not finished. Our Rebels in London are still rebelling for life. So please do go there if you can because it would be great to have you there and you do not have to get arrested if you do not want to. 🌴🌻🍄 https://t.co/QeIMY3yGna"
"Police have cleared the remaining Extinction Rebellion activists from Waterloo Bridge in London, despite earlier calls on social media for people that were willing to be arrested to “go there and save it”. The roads around Parliament Square were cleared of protesters earlier on Sunday, with the northbound carriageway of Waterloo Bridge reopened to traffic by the evening. On Sunday night, police continued their operations, moving to remove the last activists, who had glued themselves to the bridge and to each other. Officers had earlier warned people that remaining on the bridge was an “arrestable offence”, and requested that the activists move to Marble Arch, the designated protest area, where hundreds of activists remain. However, many demonstrators chose to stay at the Waterloo Bridge site, drumming, dancing and singing all along the bridge. At least six campaigners were chained to each other by their hands, with their arms covered with various substances to slow the process of removal by officers. Two men who had glued their hands to the lampposts on Waterloo Bridge were cut free by officers and arrested. The last protester on the bridge, a 70-year-old woman who did not wish to be named, told the Press Association that said she felt embarrassed to be the last one and was “trying to look dignified”. Having already been arrested at Oxford Circus “chasing after a pink yacht”, she said she would rather be arrested again than walk away, as per the requests of officers. Asked why it was important for her to join the movement, she said: “I have been a nurse and a childminder most of my life. The world we are leaving for the children and grandchildren is going to be horrendous and we let it happen. It happened on our watch. So we have to stand up and fight or lie down and fight.” The Metropolitan police has requested about 200 extra officers to help deal with the protests, in which 963 people have been arrested and 42 people, aged from 19 to 77, charged. Extinction Rebellion have said there will be a “people’s assembly” at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week, with the movement appearing split on what next steps to take in their campaign of non-violent civil disobedience. Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate campaigner, made a speech in solidarity with the protesters in Marble Arch. The Swedish student took aim at the “politicians and people in power” who had long been able to satisfy demands for action with “beautiful words and promises”, and declared that governments would no longer be able ignore the impending climate and ecological crisis. “I come from Sweden and back there it’s almost the same problem as here, as everywhere, that nothing is being done to stop an ecological crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises,” she said, after being greeted with loud cheers. “We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before. They have been ignored for decades and for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politicians will not get away with it for any longer.” Thunberg, who has been credited with inspiring a worldwide movement to reduce carbon emissions, said humanity was sitting at a crossroads. She told those gathered at Marble Arch that they had chosen which ecological path they wanted to take. She emphasised that they were now waiting for the rest of the world to follow their example. “We are the ones making a difference, we the people in this Extinction Rebellion and the children’s school strike for the climate,” she said. “It shouldn’t be like that, but since no one else is doing anything, we will have to do so.  “We will never stop fighting for this planet, for ourselves, our futures and for the futures of our children and grandchildren.” Later, Massive Attack played a concert for the crowds. Thunberg will meet MPs including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, next week. She has been touring Europe throughout her Easter holidays, imploring leaders to take radical action before it is too late. Last week, she poured scorn on EU leaders for holding three emergency summits on Brexit and none on the threat posed by climate change, suggesting that it evidenced politicians’ disinterest in tackling climate change. Her speech was given a standing ovation. Thousands of Extinction Rebellion campaigners had blocked four areas in central London on Monday, but on Saturday police regained control of Oxford Circus."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOttmar Edenhofer can hardly contain his glee – like a mad scientist thinking this time it’ll really end with a huge, spectacular result! That’s what he thinks his data show.
Face it, what we have in Germany are a group of out-of-control, dangerous academics, a group of elitist, unelected scientists, totally drunk on towering arrogance, given license to perform an experiment on an entire nation, and itching to perform it on the rest of the world. H/t: a reader by e-mail.

Prof. Ottmar Edenhofer wants to use Germany as an experimental economic guinea pig. (Photo: Marco Urban, PIK)
Just look at the PIK’s own words:
‘The energy transformation is one of the greatest experiments that an industrial society ever performed,’ Edenhofer said. ‘An experiment of this dimension needs to be supported by scientific policy advice.’ This should be organized as a social learning process, he pointed out. ‘Science is mapping possible pathways, but it is up to politics to decide which way to go,’ Edenhofer said.”

He calls it himself an “experiment”. They act like they can just gamble with an entire society. Do they think they’re in a casino! This is very close to madness. Read it all here.
The probloem with Edenhofer’s arrangement is that the citizenry is moved to the sidelines, stripped of having a say, and are expected to just accept whatever the scientists and leaders hand down. They no longer have the competence to decide it for themselves. Germany is entering a dictatorship by a scientific elite.
It doesn’t matter what data you present to them, or that other experts are already calling it “a capital destroyer of historical dimensions“, or that Germany’s entire solar manufacturing industry has already been wiped out despite 100 billion euros in subsidies. Oh no, just put the pedal to the metal – just drive right over the edge…don’t worry about the landing.
They are hell bent on pushing an entire nation over the precipice, once again, for the fourth time in the last 100 years.
The territory isn’t really uncharted; central planning has been tried many times before with the result being failure every single time. But the PIK, the WBGU, the drugged up on green leaders are convinced this time it’ll work – they made models that tell them so.
Maybe it’s time to cash in the chips and to move on to a saner place.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I got an e-mail from Hajo Smit of climategate.nl saying it was a shame that my site lacked social media buttons to allow readers to share NTZ articles easily and almost instantaneously. He was right, of course.
I have to admit that I never took the time to sit down and undertake this because I thought it was something difficult to do and I’d likely screw everything up. I’m not a very patient person. But Hajo made it sound easy and gave me a couple pointers on where to begin. It turned out to be really easy – just a matter of using a simple plug-in.
To take me by the hand and lead me through it, I found this Youtube video:

This is something I should have looked at long ago.
Anyway, now you can share NTZ posts with the social media share buttons at the end of the article or at the right side bar. I still have to play around a little bit to get it just the way I want.
Today social media like Twitter and Facebook are absolutely essential if you want to get the word out to as many people as possible.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother tasteless, shock-effect promotion video has been released, this one produced by one of Germany’s most prominent environmental groups BUND – for fund-raising!
The video, dubbed “Pesticides – manufactured to kill“, shows hundreds of beautiful babies in an agricultural field who end up getting gassed with pesticides sprayed by a passing airplane.

Hat/tip: Reader DirkH
This is what passes as “protest” by environmental groups nowadays. The more shocking and remote from the truth, the better. Stop at nothing in the pursuit of donations. Scream as loud as you can, shock as much as you can.
This reminds us of the infamous and explosive 10:10 No Pressure video released in 2010 where climate skeptics were blown to bits and pieces for complacency in energy saving. The text at the end of the clip reads as follows:
Pesticides manufactured to kill.
 Take action now.
 For a future without poison.

I have nothing against challenging the use of pesticides, but this is way over the top and lacks all sense of decency. And it has nothing to do with the truth.
Criminalizing agriculture
The BUND’s target of course is to emotionally incite using methods from the bottom drawer. Today anyone who disagrees with these zealot environmentalist gets labeled a murderer, or accused of killing.
Emotionalization is always what desperate debaters wind up using when they lack the facts to convince. And if these planet rescuers are so concerned about babies, then why don’t we ever see them lift a finger to protest abortion? These scammers are only concerned about money, power and attention.
As was the case with the 10:10 No Pressure video, the BUND Baby-Gassing video is going to backfire as well.
Already reaction has been harsh. Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes:
On the BUND’s new campaign against pesticides, business associations and trade groups have sharply criticized the environmental organization on Thursday. The German Federation of Agriculture accuses the BUND of ‘incitement’, ‘a virtual crusade’ and ‘false propaganda’.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany has sent a Letter of Protest to the Intendant of German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle demanding that it refrains from the illegal use of public funds and cancel its one-sided conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media.
The international conference, scheduled to take place in Bonn from June 21 till June 23, excludes all views that disagree with the extreme AGW gloom and doom, world downfall view.  However, because Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded institution, it is required by German Law to remain neutral and honest.
Instead, Deutsche Welle has decided on its own to abandon journalism and to resort to promoting one single extreme view on the topic of climate change, and to shut out the rest. It’s activism run amok.
One workshop is How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The workshop’s objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
This conference has infuriated a number of scientists and citizens. As a result EIKE has drafted and dispatched a letter of protest to Deutsche Welle. The letter states:

It certainly cannot be in the interest of a publicly financed broadcaster to put its own existence into question with a debate over its objectivity.
and
Enlightened thinking has always been at the centre of our culture, along with sceptical, critical and scrutinising thought. It is intolerable that, here in Germany, public funds are being illegally used under your supervision and under your responsibility to marginalise a large number persons (the majority!) who share a different opinion.
More information about Deutsche Welle and its conference is here and here.

To show that there is a wide range of opinions on the AGW topic in Germany, EIKE has a Petition refuting catastrophic AGW signed by 77 German scientists.

Photo: Meteorologist Dominik Jung, Wetter.net. 
Overall this year’s October was warmer and wetter than normal, and featured “surprising” snowfall early in the month, followed by warm temperatures, and then punctuated by the fall’s first severe storm at the end of the month.
Die Welt wonders if all that variability, particularly the severe storm, was really normal.
Jung replies that an evaluation indeed shows that “there has been no real increase in storms over the past years. More the contrary is the case.”
Jung then reminds readers that central Europe saw a number of warmer-than-normal and stormier winters during the 1990s and 2000s, but that this trend now seems to be over. Die Welt quotes Jung:

Climate experts leaned far out the windows and declaring that winters with snow and ice in Germany were over. To that I can only say: All complete nonsense! The last five winters compared to the 1961-1990 reference period were normal or even a bit too cold! And at times they were plentiful with snow.”
Die Welt at the end of the interview poses the question of whether 2013 will be “an extreme year”. Jung replies

No, it is an entirely normal year. […] Up to now the weather in 2013 has not been really extreme.”

Model shows nightmare euro-winter
Meanwhile a new seasonal forecast has been put out by Italian weather service Meteo Dolomiti and shows a nightmare shock-freeze winter gripping heavily populated central Europe: If that forecast turned out to be true, then Central Europe would find itself in a big heap trouble.
Fortunately long-term forecasts are not accurate and are highly speculative at best. Let’s hope that Europe’s winter turns out differently.

"Finland is heading towards a broad but potentially fragile left-right coalition government after the Social Democrats came top for the first time in 20 years. The centre-left SDP looks set to keep out the nationalist Finns party, which it beat by just 6,800 votes, and is likely instead to try to form a government with parties of the left and centre-right.  The SDP, led by Antti Rinne, a 56-year-old former trade union leader, will have 40 MPs in a fragmented 200-seat Eduskunta (parliament) after winning 17.7% of the vote after a fierce anti-austerity campaign. Nevertheless, the far-right, anti-immigration and increasingly radical Finns party did better than expected, winning 17.5% and 39 seats – almost exactly the same as its total in elections in 2011 and 2015, but significantly more than it might have hoped for earlier this year. On a good night generally for the left, the SDP finished with six more MPs than in the previous parliament, while the Greens gained five and the more radical Left Alliance four. Voters chose between 2,500 candidates from 19 political parties and movements. The result was further evidence of a modest social democratic fightback in Nordic countries, with left-leaning prime ministers now in power in Sweden and Iceland, and the Social Democrats leading in the polls in Denmark, where elections are due this summer. The biggest loser was the Centre party of the outgoing prime minister Juha Sipilä, who blamed the slump in its support – to 13.8% of the vote and fourth place – on the “difficult economic decisions” his government had had to make. Ninety-two of the 200 MPs in the new parliament are women, the second highest proportion in Europe after Iceland. Although the SDP’s victory is its first in 20 years, with no party winning more than 20% of the vote and deep divisions within all mainstream parties over the future of Finland’s widely admired welfare system – which the left want to preserve by increasing taxes, and the right to streamline because of rising costs – the centre-left party may find it hard to build a sustainable coalition. Final results will be published on Wednesday, with formal coalition talks likely to start on 25 April. The leader of the party with the most seats traditionally has the first stab at forming a government. Political analysts expect a coalition led by the Social Democrats, possibly including the conservative National Coalition, a junior member of the outgoing coalition, which won 38 seats, the Greens and the Swedish People’s party. The more radical Left Alliance might also seek to join the cabinet, but the Centre party’s heavy defeat is likely to exclude it. All parties have said they would find it difficult, if not impossible, to share power with the Finns party and its hardline leader, Jussi Halla-aho, who has shifted the party firmly to the right since a 2017 split that saw half its MPs leave. Rinne said his party disagreed with the Finns party on immigration, the EU, and economic policy, as well as, most importantly, in their core values. “I don’t think we can work with the Finns because of those differences,” he told Agence France-Presse, adding that he expected to be able to instead strike a deal with either the conservative National Coalition or the Centre party. “It’s very hard to see that the other parties would say no to the Social Democrats, because then we would be in a situation with Halla-aho trying to form a government and I just don’t see that happening,” said a political commentator, Sini Korpinen. Markku Jokisipilä, professor of political history at the University of Turku, said other parties were “at present rejecting the possibility of being in the same government with the Finns party. But it remains to be seen, because Finnish politics is rather pragmatic.” Halla-aho told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that although he could be interested in the job of interior minister, he would not repeat the mistakes his party made in 2015 when it haemorrhaged support after entering government and had to compromise on immigration and EU bailouts. “I don’t see it as possible that the Finns party would take part in a government which doesn’t clearly commit to reducing humanitarian migration,” he said. The strong finish by the Finns party, which was in fifth place in the polls less than six months ago, echoed similar recent performances by hard-right, anti-immigration parties across Europe. Halla-aho, who has transformed the party from being a populist Eurosceptic movement to a far more explicitly nationalist, far-right organisation that aims to cut immigration to “almost zero” and questions the need for tough action on climate change, ended up winning the most votes of any candidate in the election. Halla-aho, 47, who was fined by the supreme court in 2012 for blog comments linking Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft, has said the next government should not speed up cutting carbon emissions but instead pursue a “more moderate climate policy that does not chase industries away from Finland to countries like China”. The Finns party is among a number of populist far-right parties, including Germany’s far-right AfD, Italy’s League and the Danish People’s party, to announce plans to join forces after the European parliamentary elections on 23-26 May in an attempt to transform EU policies on migration, families and the environment."

This was the worst storm in 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, …well, make that 0.1 years.
Where I live the storm ended yesterday evening. One news media outlet (NDR radio) summed it nicely earlier this morning, saying that the storm “was worse than expected”, but then just two sentences later the report said “the damage was far less than expected”. This is like saying the day was hotter than they thought it would be, but that the thermometer rose less than expected.
All in all, Xaver was just a normal big North Sea storm of the type seen dozens of times already. If the hype served a purpose, it was that people were extra careful and so the loss of life was practically near zero.
 
20:45:
Where I live the wind has died down considerably. I went for a walk and there really wasn’t that much wind at all. Maybe it’s just a calm spell. The evening news have hyped it up as much as they could and seem to be hoping for a storm surge to flood Hamburg early in the morning. No deaths to report yet. Overall, it’s just another typical winter storm.
Latest wind gusts (km/hr) so far at some locations:
– Where I live: 78
– Helgoland (North Sea island): 128
– Sylt (North Sea island): 128
– Emden: 92
– Hamburg: 89
– Bremen: 89
– Rostock: 83

Some exaggerations going on in the media. For example, the northern port city of Kiel was reported (by Bild) to have seen a wind gust of 137 kph. but the weather station shows only 76 kph!
Winds appear to have peaked. In places like Hamburg and Bremen they are nowhere near reaching the forecast highs of up to 140 km/hr. Good news: so far no reported deaths, and only two injured. And no mention that the storm is caused by “climate change”.  Obviously the PIK has not issued any statements to the press up to now.

Meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann reports gusts of 154 km/hr in Helgoland, but he doesn’t expect any record wind speeds to be recorded. Matters not much better in the UK: www.bbc.co.uk/weather.
Already lots of media hyping it up as if Xaver were the storm of the century. But Kachelmann tweets: “And just for the record: Xaver is not and never will be the worst storm in decades.”
Top wind gusts (km /hr) so far at some locations:
Where I live: 85
Helgoland (North Sea island): 154
Sylt (North Sea island): 130
Emden: 81
Hamburg: 85

Rostock: 74
Keep in mind these are wind gusts, and not sustained wind speeds.
 
14:00
This morning at 8:30 am all was calm. But by mid morning the winds started acting up by mid morning. Now we are getting gusts over 70 km/hr and mixture of rain and ice.
The peak of the storm is expected to hit Hamburg by 4 pm. So far no reports of deaths or injuries. Also no comments from the PIK house of horrors or from Mojib Latif.
Top wind gusts so far:

Sylt (North Sea island): 116 km/hr
Emden: 77 km/hr
Hamburg: 80 km/hr
Bremen: 40 km/hr
Rostock: 65 km/hr
Expect the numbers to go up in the next hours.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo. Don’t get all your hopes up, all you conspiracy people out there. This is nothing really big and probably just has to do with how the mysterious inner machinery of Google works. I have absolutely no idea about how it works. To me it is just an amazing piece of machinery.
We know Wiki is infamous for its gatekeeping of climate content. But can we trust Google to deliver fair and balanced information searches? I bring this up because on the 31st of May I wrote a harmless blurb about Naomi Oreskes Naomi Oreskes Denial of Nonconsensus. After I posted it, I googled “Naomi Oreskes Denial” and my post appeared on page 1 at position 5 or 6, meaning anyone googling those words would have found it easily – right there on the first page. I remember feeling quite pleased about it.
But if I had been Ms Oreskes, I probably would not have been too happy about that. After all, in her world, there’s nothing but consensus out there, and so we can’t have any dissent, now can we?
A day later on June 1st I googled it again, and this time I was relegated to page 2, position no. 17 – meaning at that point I had already been put on the Google conveyor belt to obscurity. Today, 5 days later, I googled “Naomi Oreskes Denial” again. This time Google had moved my post down to page 5 position 56, meaning most searchers probably would not find it. Moreover, clicking on the link they provide no longer takes you directly to the post itself, but to my homepage instead. This assures that over time the post eventually gets buried. Naomi Oreskes’s illusion of consensus thus stays undisturbed.
I don’t know if other bloggers have had similar experiences. If so, it could be interesting to hear about them. There are lots of experiments we could try, like applying various inputs and to see what outputs are produced.
Try googling Googlegate! and see what happens.
As this is a harmless post, and I think Google may leave it at the top of their search results. Right Google?
Update: Many have already written about Googlegate. This is interesting: nationalpost lawrence-solomon

Share this...FacebookTwitterLe Monde here has an article which in large part re-iterates what NYT journalist Andrew Revkin wrote 3 days ago. The selfish, adolescent follies of the Turney expedition are seriously disrupting the supply of serious scientific operations in the Antarctic. A number of scientists worldwide have not found Turney’s charade amusing at all.
The piece is titled: “Scientists angered by cruise trapped in Antarctica“.
After describing how the botched expedition and the ensuing helicopter rescue, Le Monde writes how the relief operations are now “endangering several major research programs being conducted on different scientific bases of the sixth continent.” There’s only a 3-month window available for supply ships to make vital deliveries. Time is of the essence when it comes to logistics in Antarctica.
On the Turney expedition, Le Monde quotes Yves Frenot, the French Director of the Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor (IPEV):
It is a tourist pseudo-scientific expedition. It’s a little ‘cruise fun’.”
Glaciologist Jérôme Chappellaz of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l’Environnement, who is still at the Casey Antarctic base, said:
The expedition was presented as being scientific, but there are tourists on board who paid to go on a trip.”
Because of the distress call coming from the Turney’s chartered expedition vessel Akademik Shokalskiy, Le Monde writes: “Vital supplies comprising hundreds of tons of food, fuel and equipment could not be fully discharged from the Aurora Australis, which was requisitioned in emergency.”

The supply disruption is not the only thing that irked scientists on other Antarctic bases in need of vitally important supplies, but they later had to watch booze-cruise, spring break like going-ons onboard the ice-bound Akademik Shokalskiy. Le Monde quotes Mr. Chappellaz:
At Casey, when the colleagues learned the ‘Australis’ had been requisitioned, there was a little panic. What was most shocking was the manner in which the members on the Shokalskiy expedition communicated: on screens we saw them partying, singing, etc. – without at any time seeming to ask what they were putting in peril.”
Le Monde also quotes glaciologist Joe McConnell (Australian Antarctic Division) in the New York Times, who stated the rescue operations will also likely cause considerable disruptions for French and Chinese programs because their vessels had also also been diverted.
Le Monde writes that the cost of the Chinese and Australian ice breakers are close to $80,000 per day – each! And that doesn’t include the crew! Right now the Chinese Xue Long is trapped in ice and no one can say how long before it will get out.
M. Chappellaz vents:
It is not normal that this expedition, which uses science as a pretext for adventure-tourism, is jeopardizing multi-annual research programs.”

Finally Le Monde raises concerns that the pictures of a stranded “climate science vessel” trapped in deep ice may be leaving a long lasting false message on the subject of global warming in the minds of the worldwide public.
Finally, perhaps these two reports from the New York Times and Le Monde provide hope in that in the future they will start to distinguish between the sophomoric alarmist climate scientists who want to change the world in a rush, and those that are truly serious about doing real science.

"Environmental campaigners are hoping to mobilise thousands of people to block the streets of central London around the clock next week, in their latest attempt to raise public awareness and provoke action over the destruction of the biosphere. About 2,300 volunteers have signed up with Extinction Rebellion to obstruct some of the capital’s busiest roads for at least three days.  The disruption is to be the UK element of what organisers hope will be an international movement to protest against environmental and ecological destruction.  XR, which cites the civil rights movement and suffragettes as inspirations and is backed by senior scientists and academics, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, claims to have 331 groups in 49 countries, with 222 activists arrested worldwide for acts of non-violent civil disobedience since last autumn. Eighty-five people were arrested in London in November when thousands of protesters, including families and pensioners, occupied five bridges. The group is demanding immediate action over environmental destruction, after dire predictions that humans face an existential threat if climate change and the loss of biodiversity continues. It is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. “We don’t want to disrupt people, but our government’s failure over the last 30 years leaves us no choice,” an XR spokesperson said. “Governments prioritise the short-term interests of the economic elites so, to get their attention, we have to disrupt the economy.” On Monday at 11am, protesters in London plan to block traffic at Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus. Roadblocks will continue night and day at each site, reminiscent of the Occupy London protest camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral in 2011-12. Participants are being warned they will be invited to take part in non-violent civil disobedience, and might be arrested. Organisers have circulated legal advice to anyone planning to attend, requested they refrain from using drugs and alcohol during the protest, and asked that they treat passersby and the environment with respect. A Metropolitan police spokesperson declined to comment other than to say an appropriate policing plan will be in place. Tiana Jacout, an XR coordinator, said the protest’s success relied on recruiting enough people. “It’s literally a numbers game at the moment,” she said. “The more people we have, the easier it is to hold the space.” Organisers have promised a “full-scale festival of collective action and creative resistance”, including talks, workshops, musical and theatrical performances, and a roaming people’s assembly, hosted at each of the locations. “What I have been saying to people is that [the climate crisis] is not an unknown thing any more,” Jacout said. “Polls have shown 70-80% of people want it dealt with. If in the past 10 years you have been sitting at home, thinking this is not right, something needs to happen: come, this is it.” Almost 100 academics declared their support for XR in a letter published in the Guardian in October, which said: “When a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and to secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship. “The ‘social contract’ has been broken, and it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline CO2 Handel here reports that German news weekly FOCUS recently commissioned a survey on how Germans view climate change: According to the survey of 1004 persons, conducted by Emnid at the end of May:
63% of Germans think that warnings of future global warming are justified.
28% feel they are exaggerated.
8% think that the dangers of warmer climates are not dramatic enough.
By contrast, in the year 2007 FOCUS found that 85% of Germans found global warming to be a “threat”.
Online The Epoch Times also reports on the FOCUS survey, writing that:
Germans are predominantly calm about global warming: In an Emnid-survey for FOCUS news magazine, 35% said that the climate in their region had not gotten warmer over the last 10 years. 46% felt that the climate had been more or less unchanged. 17 percent said they thought that temperatures over the last ten years went up.”
What can we draw from the results? After 10 years of climate catastrophe media bombardment, a vast majority of Germans see no warming or little climate change.
The FOCUS site itself only has a short summary of the survey results. The title: Germans Not Perceiving Climate Warming.
A majority of Germans believe that global warming is taking place, yet most of them are unable to perceive it. It’s strange that a news magazine like FOCUS would pay Germany’s top polling organization for such a survey, and then remain quiet about the results.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the global temperature has not risen in 15 years, part of the German media is actually beginning to take a serious new look at the possibility of global cooling and are slowly questioning the alarmist assertion that the sun played little or no role in the climate change of the last 100 years.

Yesterday the online FOCUS magazine published a piece called: Scientists fear new little ice age.
What’s a bit surprising is that the article is written by typically warmist journalist Michael Odenwald.
In the FOCUS article Odenwald describes how solar cycle 24 started unusually slowly in 2008 and quotes David Hathaway of NASA: “It is not only the weakest cycle in the modern space age, but also the weakest in the last 100 years.“ Odenwald also tells readers how solar sunspots are driven by the solar dynamo, which also generates the sun’s magnetic field.
In Part 2 of Odenwald’s article, he points out that historical records suggest solar cycle 25 will very likely also be a weak cycle. In the recent past, alarmist climate scientists dismissed, or even scoffed at, the notion that weak solar activity could have a significant impact on the earth’s climate – a dismissal that flies in the face of a mountain of data showing a strong correlation between weak solar activity and cold periods.

Recently a growing number of scientists from the USA, Europe, and Russia have been warning of a potential approaching cooling period because of low solar activity, and the media are now taking more notice than ever. FOCUS quotes Hathaway’s colleague Matthew Penn of the National Solar Observatory (translated from the German):
Should this trend continue, then solar cycle 25 will have hardly any sunspots at all. Then we could reach a new Maunder Minimum.”
The Maunder Minimum, Odenwald writes, was an especially cold period during the Little Ice Age.
Still, Odenwald is hardly ready to give up believing that CO2 a major player in the overall climate scheme, insisting that a new grand solar minimum would not necessarily cool the planet. Odenwald cites that the Little Ice Age may in fact have been precipitated by a “giant volcanic eruption that supposedly occurred in the year 1257 in Indonesia“.
But to his credit, Odenwald concedes that solar activity could very well have a major role on climate:
It’s possible that the reduced solar activity may bring some good, which the scientists gathered at the AAS conference indicated. It could counter the global warming that man is causing with the continuously rising emissions of climate-impacting greenhouse gases.
Good to see responsible German warmist journalists opening their minds to alternatives theories. Give it a few more years.

"It’s the climate policy debate, so veering into Numptyville is par for the course, but I confess we are there earlier than even I expected. For the past few days of the election campaign, we have been having a conversation about the use of international permits – if you can call what’s been happening a conversation. It’s been more like a series of unconnected statements. A bout of incoherent shouting in a wardrobe.  In the interests of preserving sanity, let’s try and tether the debate to some basic facts and concepts. Labor has proposed using international permits as part of its climate policy measures to allow high-emitting businesses to reduce their pollution at least cost. Sticking with basic facts, using international permits to lower the costs associated with reducing pollution was something the Coalition said it was prepared do. Yes, that’s right. This government. The one that’s still in power. That happened in 2017, when it reviewed its climate policies. In December 2017, the government’s policy was to “support, in principle, the use of international units”. If you are curious enough to click through to that source document, let me save you five minutes. Look on page eight. So stay with me. The government that flagged using international permits, with a final decision about the timing and scope of use to be taken in 2020, is the same government that is now trying to sell the voters (and media outlets gullible enough to swallow and amplify the latest most lurid conspiracy about “carbon credits for Kazakhstan”) a big bucket of bollocks. The official line now is the use of international permits will cost an absolute motser, and end heavy industry in this country. Just while we are back in the vault, the same 2017 climate policy review also suggested the government would pursue a new light vehicle fuel efficiency standard to reduce transport emissions – another position the government now disavows because it wants to pretend that Bill Shorten has a secret plan to confiscate your ute. I mean seriously, this is pathetic. How cynical can you get? For people who have no idea about permits, why we are talking about them, what they are, why they are even remotely relevant, allow me to assist. If you want to reduce pollution there are a couple of ways to do it. One is high-cost. The other is least-cost. If you want to force down domestic emissions at any cost, you don’t use policy tools such as permits. You just set strict rules, and insist that heavy emitters reduce their pollution. Doing that might mean some firms go out of business, but that doesn’t matter to you if your objective is reducing pollution at any cost, because the science tells you there is an urgent problem to address. If you don’t want to do that, if you want to reduce pollution at least cost, then policy tools such as permits enter the mix. Labor’s proposal is an emissions reduction target of 45% for heavy polluters, and it has flagged allowing businesses to buy permits to help them meet their liabilities. Put at its simplest, having access to permits means businesses can buy emissions reduction occurring elsewhere. Having to buy permits imposes a cost on the business – but that’s the point. If the objective is to reduce pollution, there is a price associated with doing it. The only question is whether the price is high or lower. There is no free lunch. A point worth noting while we are on costs. The government has in recent years passed the costs of emissions reduction onto taxpayers rather than polluters. That’s what the emissions reduction fund is. It’s a pot of taxpayer money that pays for emissions reduction. So you are paying for emissions reduction now. You just don’t know it, because nobody sends you a detailed set of accounts. Back to our free lunch. Scott Morrison in the shadow of an election sent a number of public signals to try to reassure voters that the Coalition was taking climate change seriously. But the fact is the Coalition has retreated to the Tony Abbott position. That’s what the confected moral panic about international permits and ute confiscation tells us. We are back to the Abbott position. Back to hyperbole and wrecking in the hope that governing by graphic novel can win you an election. There are legitimate questions about the use of permits. The first is: should any government be allowing them in the mix when the science suggests the need to reduce pollution is urgent? The second is: are the permits junk? The third (which links to the first) is: how much usage should you permit? The fourth concerns the relative costs associated with using them versus not using them. It’s completely reasonable to ask Labor questions about the costs associated with its climate policies, just as it’s reasonable to ask the Morrison government about the cost of six years of inaction, which is this government’s legacy. But while it’s fine to ask questions, this conversation also has to touch reality, and ensuing reporting and analysis has to cut through the spin. By shouting about the dangers to the economy of businesses being forced to buy permits to reduce their carbon liabilities, the Coalition is drawing a bright red line that should not be missed. The government is saying it doesn’t support emissions reduction if that imposes a cost on businesses. The government is saying that emissions reduction that imposes a cost on anyone apart from you, the voter (because you are already paying), should not happen. Just give yourself a minute to absorb that position, and line it up against what the climate science tells us needs to happen. It’s an extraordinary thing to say in an election season where Australian voters are deeply worried about climate change."
"In September, the giant German polar research vessel Polarstern will set off from Tromsø in Norway on a remarkable voyage. It will sail across the Arctic Ocean and after a few weeks reach a point off the Siberian coast, around 85 deg N 120 deg E, where it will attach itself to the biggest, strongest-looking ice floe its crew can find. And then, for the next year, the Polarstern will remain moored to this giant slab of frozen water as it slides, with other polar pack ice, round the Arctic Ocean. For a year, teams of researchers from the ship will study conditions on the ice floe – which will be at least 2 sq km in area to satisfy researchers’ requirements. There they will set up instruments to study the atmosphere above them, the seabed below, the chemistry of the water around them, the Arctic Ocean’s sealife, and the behaviour of wildlife on the surface, including the occasional visiting polar bear. This is Mosaic – the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, the biggest international expedition ever launched in the Arctic. Its aim is to transform our knowledge of the north polar region, a place more affected by climate change than any other sector of our planet and which is expected to play a crucial role in determining how global warming impacts on the rest of the Earth. “The Arctic is closely linked to weather in our latitudes,” says expedition leader Markus Rex, of the Alfred Wegener Institut in Germany. “We can already see climate changes in the Arctic that are shaping our weather and climate. However, we won’t succeed in accurately forecasting climate developments if we don’t have reliable prognoses for the Arctic.” Backed by an international consortium led by the institute, Mosaic will cost more than £100m to complete. At any one time, around 50 scientists will be working on its prime vessel or on the ice to which it is moored. Regular visits by icebreakers from China, Russia and Sweden will keep the Polarstern supplied and recrewed so that by late 2020, when the project ends, more than 300 researchers from at least 17 nations will have taken turns to work there. The idea of simply letting a research vessel drift across the polar cap trapped in ice is not new. The Fram expedition, led by the great Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen, lasted from 1893 to 1896, as his boat, gripped in sea ice, drifted across the Arctic Ocean and demonstrated the feasibility of such arduous undertakings. By modern standards, the scientific measurements taken by its crew were limited, however. Mosaic, by contrast, will return reams of data, most of it aimed at helping researchers forecast the likely fate of our planet as it heats up as more and more greenhouse gases are pumped into the atmosphere. “The Arctic is crucial to understanding how climate change will affect the rest of the planet,” says Jeremy Wilkinson, a British physicist working on Mosaic. “We already monitor it constantly from space using satellites and also do a lot of work under the ice using robot submersibles. However, there is still a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done by humans, especially in the biological and the atmospheric sciences.” This point is backed by Markus Frey, a polar explorer based at the British Antarctic Survey. (Britain’s research in the north pole is managed by the Arctic Office at the British Antarctic Survey.) “In the Arctic Ocean – because there is no land on which to build research bases – there is a lack of data about conditions there apart from the information we get from satellites and a few other sources,” tells the Observer. “We need to calibrate the data we get from space with events and the observations we make on the ground, or to be more precise at sea level, in order to get a more accurate picture of what is going on there.” Consider the issue of sea-ice thickness in the Arctic. For more than 40 years satellites have swept over the north pole and charted dramatic declines in sea-ice cover as global warming has inexorably strengthened its grip on Earth. According to Nasa, the area covered by Arctic sea ice in summer has shrunk by about 40% since the 1980s. That represents the loss of several million square kilometres of sea ice – and as it disappears, more solar radiation will reach the dark, heat-absorbing waters of Arctic Ocean that once lurked underneath. As a result, temperatures will rise even further, researchers warn. Photographs from most polar satellites only give a two-dimensional picture of the sea ice, however. They do not reveal the extent to which it may be thinning or thickening. In some places, it may be only wafer-thin and set to disappear with dramatic rapidity. “Recent satellites have been fitted with radar that can measure ice thickness from space,” says Wilkinson. “They have been carefully tuned so they are not confused about levels of snow that have fallen on top of the surface of the ice and apparently altered its thickness.” The European Space Agency’s probe CryoSat-2 and the French-Indian satellite AltiKa are examples of space missions designed to measure Arctic sea-ice thickness using radar. However, scientists have found these devices do not always pinpoint the surface of the sea ice properly. They still get confused by light snow lying on top of ice. “And that means we are getting errors in our measurements of ice thickness,” adds Wilkinson. Mosaic should provide a solution. Radar instruments identical to those fitted to CryoSat and AltiKa will be taken on the Polarstern. “We will mount these on a sled and scientists will drag them across the sea ice,” says Wilkinson. “It will be like bringing the satellites down to the surface of the sea ice. Using them, we will then be able to compare the readings we get on the sea-ice surface with those that we got from space. We should be able to recalibrate the satellites’ instruments to get very much improved, more accurate readings of Arctic sea-ice thickness when measured from Earth orbit.” There will be a perimeter with tripwires and a lookout on the bridge. Bears are a serious issue In fact, he adds, dozens of related programmes will be carried out on Mosaic. “Other researchers are doing work on snow chemistry and snow properties and we can get our radar measurements married to their snow measurements to get this holistic understanding of how snow evolves in the Arctic.”  Another key focus for the researchers will be the unexpected role that salt plays in influencing the Arctic climate. Salt is crucial to the formation of clouds, it transpires, because cloud droplets grow on salt grains, says Frey. This raises a problem in understanding the polar climate, because if an ocean is frozen over, how can salt get from the sea to the sky and help clouds form? Frey’s work has revealed a possible route. “The top of the sea ice actually has this very salty brine on it. Then when sweet, freshwater snow falls on top of it, the mixture is whipped up into the air by the winds and you get a flux of salt flying into the air, even though the ocean is frozen.” Scientists still do not know exactly how this process works, however, and a key feature of Frey’s research will be to unravel the detailed way salt is spread round the Arctic atmosphere. “We need to understand how salt affects the formation of clouds. If you don’t understand that process, you will not get your climate forecasts right. It is a missing link in our meteorological knowledge, so this research is crucial. After all, clouds cut out sunlight and if they do not form for some reason, the region will heat up even more than is currently predicted.” It is all intriguing work, though carrying out these projects is not without risk. For a start, polar bears pose a real danger to researchers who will have to be protected by armed guards when working on the ice floe. “The guards will have night-vision goggles and rifles fitted with infrared scopes,” adds Frey. “There will be a 700-metre perimeter placed around project sites that will be protected with tripwires. There will also be someone on the bridge looking out at what is happening on the ice floe. However that will still be a challenge at night, especially when visibility is bad during storms. We will have to take constant care. Bears are a serious issue.” Nor will wildlife be the only risk. Extreme Arctic weather also poses danger as Frey found out during his last expedition. The N-ICE2015 project, led by the Norwegian Polar Institute, was a forerunner of Mosaic and involved the research vessel Lance getting frozen into the Arctic pack ice in January 2015 to study sea ice for several months. “It was a mini-Mosaic,” says Frey. “Just half a year in a much smaller boat.” A lot of lessons were learned nevertheless. “Four weeks into the expedition, a huge storm shattered the ice floe into pieces,” he says. “Our equipment was thrown everywhere and some became frozen into the ice. It was a horrible mess. People were up to their waists in slushy, ice-cold water and after a while we had to abandon equipment as well. We had to reset our position and start all over again.” What happens in the Arctic does not stay there. It affects the rest of the planet. It touches us all This time, Mosaic’s explorers have got themselves a bigger boat and will have a larger ice floe, so they are hoping they will be no repeat of the hardships their predecessors had to endure four years ago. “This is an extremely important project because it is clear that what happens in the Arctic does not stay there,” says Wilkinson. “The weather there affects the rest of the planet. It touches us all. Just consider the issue of ice. It reflects about 80% of the sunlight that pours down on it. Remove that ice, as we are doing now, and sunlight will shine straight on to the dark ocean. Its dark waters will absorb up to 80% of the radiation that hits it. Further heating is inevitable. “In other words, ice is essential. It controls our weather patterns. But it is changing in nature and amount in the Arctic. And that is one of the driving forces of the Polarstern. It is going to help us re-evaluate our knowledge of the new Arctic that we are creating.” "
"The Bank of England’s powers to tackle climate change risks in the financial system could be given an overhaul to reflect the scale of the “emergency” facing the planet, John McDonnell has said. Speaking after Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, used an article in the Guardian to warn financial firms that they faced an existential risk from global warming, the shadow chancellor said Labour was exploring ways to retool Threadneedle Street.  Welcoming Carney’s intervention in a tweet on Wednesday, McDonnell appeared to suggest that more action was required to meet the challenges of climate change. Mark Carney's intervention is breakthrough moment. In addition to rewriting government spending criteria we’ll now consult on changing the Bank of England's mandate to reflect the climate change emergency highlighted by #ExtinctionRebellion Rebellion demo. https://t.co/n7M7qBnp8j McDonnell has been examining various ways to reshape the Bank’s mandate, which is set by the government, should Labour come to power. He has previously focused on giving Threadneedle Street greater powers to direct the lending of commercial banks into more productive sectors of the economy, and away from property speculation. Labour is also considering ways to funnel more investment into green industries and technologies, which will encompass how the role of government and other agencies, such as the Bank, can be used to tackle climate change. The party has already said it would rewrite the Treasury’s green book, the manual for government spending decisions, and that the Office for Budget Responsibility, the tax and spending watchdog, would be mandated to consider climate risks in its economic forecasts. The Bank said on Wednesday it would disclose an assessment of how it managed climate-related financial risks as part of its 2019-20 annual report, a regular update on its work, which will come out next year. Carney said the central bank would adopt the framework of the taskforce for climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD) – a G20 initiative calling on commercial banks to disclose their lending to companies with carbon-related risks – to publish details of its own risks from climate change. “We need to lead by example and by providing such disclosures, we will be playing our part to secure the transition to sustainable financial system,” he said. Campaigners have argued that the Bank could do more to tackle risks from climate change, including forcing the mandatory disclosure of carbon-related assets, rather than asking banks to consider doing so. Threadneedle Street could also force banks to set aside more money to protect from losses on carbon assets, or encourage them to lend to green projects by reducing the amount of money they are required to set aside. Rob Macquarie, an economist at the lobby group Positive Money, said: “Central banks have a crucial role to play in decarbonising the financial system, but continually present their mandates as a restriction against adopting certain climate-friendly policies. We therefore welcome moves from the Labour party.”"
"Canadians on Prince Edward Island are preparing to vote on Tuesday in a regional election that could lead to a Green party forming a government for the first time in the country’s history. The party leader, Peter Bevan-Baker is a Scotland-born dentist who has transformed a routine election into a closely watched race as he seeks to upend expectation and precedent on 23 April.  The bucolic island – Canada’s smallest province – is best known internationally as the home of LM Montgomery’s classic children’s novel Anne of Green Gables. But it also remains a region heavily reliant on fishing and farming – industries that are increasingly precarious as the area grapples with the effects of climate change. Bevan-Baker’s potential win also underscores the unpredictability and diversity of Canadian politics. Last week, voters soundly rejected a progressive government that promised to tackle climate change in the heartlands of Canada’s oil industry. For generations, the 153,000 residents of Prince Edward Island have experienced a see-saw of political consistency, with the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives alternating power with remarkable predictability. But this belies an exciting history of Canadians firsts: Prince Edward Island elected the first non-European premier (Joseph Ghiz), the first elected female premier (Catherine Callbeck) and the first openly gay leader (incumbent premier Wade MacLauchlan). “Could we become the first province to elect the Green party? It’s possible,” said Paul MacNeill, publisher and political commentator on the island. No Green party in Canada has ever formed a provincial or national government. A win by Bevan-Baker would upend precedent, but even a minority government would be a first in the province since the 1800s. While the province’s economy is roaring, the public appears to have grown weary of what would amount to four consecutive terms of Liberal government if premier MacLauchlan is re-elected on Tuesday (though it would only be his second term). Bevan-Baker’s candidacy, however, promises to upset the status quo in a region known for its political moderation. “He is fiscally conservative. He’s socially responsible and he’s environmentally aware,” said MacNeill. “Between the lilt of his voice and his policies – which are middle of the road for the most part – he’s won a lot of converts.” And Bevan-Baker has been astute at reading the electorate. “They’ve been presenting themselves less as a party with an activist agenda on environmental issues and more as a party that will pay attention and is capable and interested in listening to the people,” said Don Desserud, a professor of political science at the University of Prince Edward Island. In a province heavily reliant on agriculture, courting the rural areas, especially given the declining prosperity of family farms, is key to any electoral breakthrough. “What Bevan Baker has done, is reformulated [the Greens’] message to say that they want to work with farmers, not against [them]. They want to help people. They want to support them,” said Desserud. The result is policy proposals from the Greens that dive deep into pesticide and chemical fertiliser rules, but one that also emphasises individual responsibility as opposed to government regulation. But a Green government also holds a certain poignancy for islanders on the front line of climate change: each day, the Atlantic Ocean eats away at its famed red cliffs and sections are expected to soon disappear beneath rising sea levels. “Living on an island, you start to see the effects of climate change in a tangible way, especially as a farming and fishing community,” said Colin Buchanan, a musician in the province’s capital Charlottetown, who plans to once again vote Green. While Canada has experimented with Green politicians in the past – most recently with Mike Schreiner, a small business owner in Guelph, Ontario, who won 45% of the vote in the province’s recent election – the country has been wary to fully embrace the party as a viable option in forming government. But the electoral strategy of the party in PEI might also portend a shift in thinking about how to court a wary electorate. “What the Green party has had to do is to basically rebrand themselves … as a far more comprehensive party,” said Desserud, likening its strategy to that of European Green parties. The Greens have enjoyed a surprisingly robust lead over the other two parties throughout the campaign, even in conservative rural areas, but recent polling suggests the election has tightened into a three-way race. The Progressive Conservative party leader and former journalist, Dennis King, is well-liked and seen as a moderate voice – and has slowly chipped away at Bevan-Baker’s outsized lead. But the campaign, which has been cordial and friendly, has also been beset by tragedy: on Friday, the Green candidate and local teacher Josh Underhay and his young son died in a canoeing accident, a shocking blow to the tight-knit community. “Josh brought humour, enthusiasm and boundless energy to every situation,” said Bevan-Baker in a statement the next day, announcing all campaign activities would be suspended over the weekend, with other parties also following suit. In the last election, Bevan-Baker’s 2015 seat was the lone Green representation in the province’s legislative assembly, capping 10 previously unsuccessful attempts at winning a seat in Canadian politics. Hanna Bell brought the party’s seat count to two, following a 2017 byelection win. But politics is a private matter for many and most residents are tight-lipped about their choice at the ballot box, making any predictions difficult. “Islanders are a lot more more traditional than the numbers likely show,” he said. “Maybe I’ll be wrong. I hope I am.”"

"Nathan, who was into his second day of protest, was sitting in the road in Piccadilly Circus in front of a large “rebel for life” banner laid across the ground. He was wearing boots stained blue with spray chalk. “We need to do something drastic to have action,” he said. “For the past 40 years we have known about climate change and we have tried to go through governments and peaceful marching through the streets and it hasn’t done anything.” Nathan has been working with Extinction Rebellion as an organiser, which he said had been an incredible experience. “I was able to pick up so many skills … I’ve met some amazing people.” He said he would be surprised if he made it to the end of the week without getting arrested. “I’ve had a couple of warnings from the police already,” he said. “But I’ve had training so I know my rights, I know what to do, so it’s not like this terrifying thing.” Asked what his parents thought, Nathan said they were not particularly pleased. “They were like: ‘We are glad you’re fighting for a cause, but if you get a fine we are going to be mad.’” Spindel had been in London since Sunday and said she was supporting friends who were prepared to be arrested, although she had decided to try not to be arrested herself. “I am just terrified that we will wipe our species out and take many others with us,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “I feel like our politicians are simply not doing nearly enough. We have been peacefully demonstrating about this issue for so long with no impact that I think this is our last chance to do something in time. “I have discussed this with my family and they are very proud and fully agree with my stance on this, although they are worried about me getting arrested.” Clarke said she hoped the protest would encourage politicians “to engage with the facts and begin to create the space to take meaningful action”. “There is nothing else left to do,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “We have tried protesting and we have tried making our case to the government calmly but they don’t listen. Now I feel we have to take part in civil disobedience in an attempt to meet the huge challenge we face. But because of Brexit it is very difficult at the moment to get our voice heard. It is frustrating because when you take a step back it is clear Brexit will be nothing if we don’t save the planet. Few people seem to realise that but that is genuinely the scale of what we are talking about here. “I hear some people in government and politics do get this … If ordinary people like me – I am not a hardcore environmentalist or activist – are prepared to take a stand and even get arrested then surely that has to count for something?” Kennedy was handing out Penguin biscuits to protesters as part of her duties as a wellbeing steward at the Extinction Rebellion event in Edinburgh. “I’m here because I’ve got grandchildren and I really think something has to be done,” she said. This was Kennedy’s first environmental protest, although she also marched against the Iraq war, and she commended the “really lovely” atmosphere. It was the significance of the protest that had brought her here, she said. “This is just so important. You have to be here – or be dead.” She said her role was to help maintain the atmosphere, keeping an eye out for anyone who looked like they were becoming upset or angry, and intervening before things escalated. Noting Monday’s protests in London, she said: “It’s not just happening across the UK but across the world and I don’t see it ending any time soon. It’s going to take a lot to make governments wake up to their responsibilities.” “The main reason I am doing this is because our government is lying,” said Griffiths, who was taking part in the blockade of Waterloo Bridge in London. “They are lying about issues on which there is concrete scientific consensus. For me it is totally unacceptable to lie against scientists who have spent their careers painstakingly researching this stuff. “Protests around these environmental issues have been going on for decades and nothing has created meaningful proportionate change. I don’t want to be arrested but I am prepared to do that because what else is there? Write a letter to my MP, join Greenpeace – none of it seems to make much difference, so I feel there is no option but to take a stand.” Finegan, also at Waterloo Bridge, said it was the first time he had been on this sort of protest, and it was “really positive and interesting”. “I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking. The government is not facing up to the evidence of what is happening, so I am here to try my best to get them to respond. “My family and friends sort of agree about the climate stuff but don’t really want to face it properly and many of them are not the sort of people to take part in something like this, though I wish they would. But I am terrified. It is quite a terrifying prospect when you look at the facts. That’s why I’m here.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke of the German blog Die Welt has a report claiming that how sea levels are not rising anywhere near as fast as climate science alarmists are claiming.
First Kulke reminds readers that measuring sea level is no easy task because, depending on the location, sea levels can vary by several decimeters – even up to a meter. Much of the science relies on complex statistical computations and the results depend on the methods used.
Kulke writes:
A scientific study by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has closely examined data from the measurement stations located mainly at the coasts and reached the result that sea level rise calculations were exaggerated upwards. In the study Michael Beenstock and colleagues reached the result that sea level rise on a global average is only 1 millimeter and that by the end of the century it will rise only 10 centimeters; only 1/3 of the stations showed a detectable rise, 61% showed no movement and 4% showed a drop.”
Overall 1 mm/year is about 67% less than what Jason TOPEX satellite altimetry is showing (3 mm). If anything, Beenstock’s result indicate a sea level rise slowdown.

Beenstock is not the only scientist who has found sea level rise is much slower than believed. Kulke writes that other peer-reviewed studies reach similar conclusions. For example Nicola Scafetta of Duke University (see full paper here) shows that sea level is subject to 60-year cycles and concludes that the human impact on sea level is too small and is statistically insignificant.
Unfortunately these finding were not available in time to be included in the last IPCC assessment report AR5. Kulke writes that this was also “the case for other studies which recently showed that Co2’s effect on the global climate is present, but is however greatly exaggerated“.
Kulke cites another study that shows that the extraction of groundwater has caused close to half of the sea level rise of the last years. Kulke concludes that there’s no indication that sea level is rising faster because of man-made CO2 and that we are facing the fall of civilization, even if “scientists like Stefan Rahmstorf tirelessly paint pictures of man-made apocalypses on the wall“.
The studies cited here tell us one thing: Whoever tells us that there is a consensus among scientists that climate change is happening faster and faster, is just plain wrong.”

"Over the past few days, I have watched members of the Extinction Rebellion movement block bridges, disrupt public transport and lock themselves to lorries. I have been moved by their bravery and inspired by their message, but puzzled by their strategy. On the face of it, the rebels have been effective. They have disrupted major cities, gained publicity and built bonds of solidarity. But are they achieving their aim of building a more sustainable world? According to Stanford University’s Doug McAdam, the climate change movement has historically been a failure when compared with other movements. Climate activists have struggled to engage politicians, been unable to build influential organisations, and failed to connect with the wider public. The Extinction Rebellion may mark a turning point. The rebels have injected a sense of urgency and emotion back into the issue of climate change, but creating meaningful and long-lasting change requires more. A movement must reach out beyond true believers and connect with a wider base of potential supporters – wherever they might be found on the political spectrum.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam Climate activists talk about saving the natural environment from “harm”, “caring” for the planet and working towards climate “justice”. Such language appeals to the left but antagonises the right. Researchers have found that conservatives heed messages about climate change when they are couched in values they hold dear – that means talking about saving the climate as obeying authority, preserving the purity of nature or defending your country. A recent study published in the journal Nature: Climate Change found that “interventions that increase angry opposition to action on climate change are especially problematic”. The only sound way forward was to “transform intergroup relations”. That meant being able to reach out beyond one’s political tribe and draw in other groups. You do that through their values, their language and their rituals. Extinction Rebellion’s call for “ecological justice” will appeal to people on the left, but it will miss out those in the centre and alienate folks on the right. If the rebels want to reach out, they could instead talk about “preserving the purity of nature” or “saving our national natural heritage”. Their tactics are also likely to push away many potential supporters. Acts of civil disobedience such as occupying bridges, guerrilla gardening and protest puppetry may appeal to seasoned activists, but are a turnoff for thousands of potential supporters who might walk past such occupations. If the rebels want to reach out, they should use social rituals which other groups are familiar with – instead of glueing themselves to DLR trains, they might hold tea parties at local fetes. The identity offered by the Extinction Rebellion movement will resonate with would-be rebels, but the majority of people who could potentially be won over to their cause don’t see themselves as “rebels”. Instead they identify as parents, workers, neighbours, members of ethnic or religious groups and many other things. To effectively reach out, the climate change movement needs to connect with these identities. After all, one of the main reasons people change their minds is when they have an extended conversation with someone who is like them but who has changed an opinion. But perhaps the Extinction Rebels do not want to reach out. Their avowed aim is to encourage 3.5% of population to undertake system change. If the Extinction Rebels continue to focus on attracting a relatively small group of activists they will open up a space for a mass movement which can appeal across political boundaries. If such a mass movement does indeed come about, the Extinction Rebels are likely to provide an important service. This will be due to what’s called the radical flank effect. This is when more extreme groups make us aware of the problem, in turn forcing the authorities to work with more moderate movements to create the solutions. • André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London"
"More than 100 people were arrested on Wednesday in the climate protests that have caused major disruption in central London, Scotland Yard said, taking the total number of arrests to almost 400. Activists stepped up the demonstrations on their third day, targeting the capital’s rail network and the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Traders in the West End warned that the protests, which have seen protesters block four London landmarks for the past three days, had already cost them tens of millions of pounds. The first estimate of the financial impact of the so-called climate rebellion came as activists targeted London’s rail network. Just after 11am, three people glued themselves to a train at Canary Wharf station, causing delays on the Docklands Light Railway. A few hours later, four protesters glued their hands together and chained themselves to a fence outside Corbyn’s house, saying he was “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, adding that they were there to “support him” to go further. Thousands of people, including parents and young children, pensioners, scientists and environmentalists, have taken part in Extinction Rebellion protests. On Wednesday afternoon, the four sites that protesters had occupied in London since Monday – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under their control, causing ongoing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow.

The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The Metropolitan police has designated Marble Arch as a legitimate protest site. By early evening, large numbers of police officers had turned out in force at the other three sites announcing they were imposing a section 14 order requiring protesters to leave.  Several hundred officers appeared in Parliament Square, removed sparsely manned roadblocks and took down gazebos, apparently retaking the space without difficulty. However, there were reports that activists had managed to hold the space after the arrival of a samba band, while others tried to set up new barriers around the square. In Oxford Circus, police circulated among the crowd, who had been dancing all day to music from a stage mounted on a pink boat, serving notice on each. Police made a concerted attempt to clear Waterloo Bridge by walking among the crowd and serving section 14 notices on all the people assembled there, telling them they had the right to either to go home or continue their protest in Marble Arch. Anyone who refused to comply was arrested. By 9pm the Guardian had witnessed police carry away at least a dozen protesters, while many others left of their own accord. People who had already been served notice were arrested straight away if they did not leave after a few minutes. There was pandemonium at times as police officers walked through the crowd, picking individuals apparently at random. A large number of police officers arrived as reinforcements at about 8.30pm. However, numbers of protesters remained strong and cheers erupted each time an arrest was made. By 9.15pm they were led in a call and response song and chants of “whose police? our police. Whose hearts? Our hearts. Whose souls? Our souls.” On Tuesday, organisers had warned that they were planning to disrupt London’s rail and tube network, and just after 11am three activists glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, unfurling a banner reading, “Climate emergency – act now.” Two people then glued themselves to the top of the train. Another man, who gave his name as Mark, glued himself to the side of the train. The protesters were finally removed from the roof by police at 12.40pm. Cathy Eastburn, 51, was one of those taking part in the transport disruption. She said she decided to make a stand for her teenage daughters. “I don’t want to be here today and I’m really sorry for the disruption, but I feel I have been forced to do this,” she said. “I have two daughters and I can’t sit by while their future is threatened … The government is doing nothing – we have to force them to act.” Gail Bradbrook, one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, who was at the scene, said: “This [Canary Wharf] is the heart of the system that is bringing us to our knees causing huge disruption and chaos around the world … so we want people to pause and reflect.”  A few hours later another group of activists glued themselves together, then chained themselves to the fence of Corbyn’s house. The Labour leader left his home a few hours later saying he never gave interviews, or arranged meetings, outside his house. The activists left shortly after, saying Labour had offered to meet Extinction Rebellion next week. David Lambert, 60, was one of those taking part. “We are here because we are supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and he is the best hope this country has got to get us out of this,” he said. “But we need system change and a transformation of our consumer economy and we know he is a person who has the authority and power to deliver that.” The events in London are part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by the UK-based Extinction Rebellion. Protests had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries, from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague , activists occupied the international criminal court building on Tuesday. Twenty-nine arrests were made in Edinburgh on Tuesday night after police cleared remaining activists who who staged a sit-in on North Bridge. By 6am on Wednesday, they had all had been released and charged with breach of the peace, to appear in court at a later date. In London, Extinction Rebellion protesters, activists and legal observers said some of those arrested were being taken to police stations outside of London, lending credence to persistent rumours that the Metropolitan police’s holding cells were reaching capacity. Several people reported cases of people being taken to Luton, Brighton and Essex. The Met would not confirm or deny the claim. On Wednesday, Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of New West End Company which represents Oxford Street and central London retailers, told Sky News the protests were hitting business hard. “We have seen a 25% drop in spend – it was £12m yesterday and obviously we have had disruption today. The impact is customers thinking they are not going to come up over the bank holiday so this could go into the hundreds of millions of pounds if we do not grip this.” "

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman national daily Die Welt here reports on the desolate state of Germany’s renewable energies, particularly solar and biofuel, written by Daniel Wetzel.
Once believed to hold the key to future jobs and prosperity, renewable energies in Germany are now emerging as a complete flop and a national embarrassment.
Coming on the heels of the solar industry collapse, now comes the end of the bio-fuel industry, so reports Die Welt.

For years the transition to renewable energies was sold as an industrial political project: In the sector of renewable energy hundreds of thousands of jobs would be created, they claimed. […] It’s time to put the visionary exuberance under a reality check. The number of jobs in the sector of renewable energy is again shrinking.”

“$130 billion solar flash in the pan”
Germany’s green industry collapse is happening faster than anyone could have ever anticipated, and has caught the media by surprise. Die Welt writes:

The German solar industry is dissolving faster than you can even see. One third of all companies disappeared from the market within one year. Solar power subsidies of more than 100 billion euros [$130 billion] over 20 years have led to only a mere flash in the pan. According to the official numbers, today there are barely 6000 employees in the German solar cell and module production.”

$130 billion for 6000 jobs? That works out to be over $20 million a job!

The cause of the solar energy collapse is in part due to the recent cuts in government subsidies (they’ve realized that it’s too expensive after all) and cheap imports from China.
Such is the miserable state of the solar industry in Germany. Wetzel then writes that also Germany’s highly subsidized bio-fuel industry is on the verge of collapse. In the link, Die Welt writes: “Biofuel production in Germany will likely completely collapse in just a few years.” and that leading German biofuel manufacturer Verbio AG in Saxony Anhalt “is deeply in the red for the first three quarters of its fiscal year” and that the company is reporting “a loss of 143 million euros since July 2012.”
Die Welt now telling readers “to critically question”
What’s especially peculiar is that Die Welt, once (and still is) a big believer of man-made climate change and green energies, seems to have developed sudden amnesia concerning it’s earlier positions on the issue. In the past the leading national daily often wrote highly supportive articles of the green movement, and aimed harsh words at climate science skeptics and green energy critics. Apparently, at least in its latest article, Die Welt now thinks it can lecture readers on the virtues of critical thnking:

The fall of both sectors is a reason to critically question whether it’s possible to usher in high-tech industries and employment miracles by using subsidies.”

My, how profound. Such amazing words of wisdom….and all coming after a mere 20 years and € 100 billion having been squandered.
We all I recall many reports from Die Welt warning of the coming climate apocalypse, and cheerleading for alternative energies like sun and biofuel. Now the once-green conservative daily wants us to “critically question”? Sorry Die Welt but you’re about a decade late, and so you can take a seat in the back.
I’m not blaming Wetzel here, who surely has written some critical pieces. My criticism is aimed at Die Welt’s naive editors. Hopefully they’ve woken up to reality and will soon stop believing the climate fairy tales spread by the PIK and other activist institutes.

"Recently, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, made a private overture to the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, a contact reflecting his view that Shorten, in the absence of “one hell of an upset”, will be prime minister on 18 May. In the event Di Natale’s working supposition is correct, and Shorten goes on to win the campaign, the Greens are Labor’s mostly likely dance partners in the Senate for a range of progressive reforms the ALP is taking to the contest, particularly climate change, which was the focus of the recent overture.  Shorten did not come back to him, but Di Natale says he remains hopeful that two progressive political leaders can find their level. “My hope is Bill Shorten and Labor recognise it’s important to have a constructive relationship with the Greens,” Di Natale says in an interview with Guardian Australia. If Australian voters on 18 May return a parliament where Labor is forced to govern in minority, then the Greens leader has some clear expectations. He wants a seat at the table as Labor implements its climate policy, as happened during the 43rd parliament. “I would hope Shorten would show the maturity that Julia Gillard demonstrated and bring people to the table to negotiate constructively.” In the event it’s not a minority government scenario, if Labor wins outright and the Greens are in balance of power in the Senate, Di Natale also wants it known that his party is prepared to vote against a climate policy it regards as insufficiently ambitious, as the Greens did once before, controversially, in 2009. Ahead of the election, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, warned the Greens against a repeat of 2009. Butler told Guardian Australia the Greens voting with Tony Abbott against Labor’s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level, which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade. The Greens leader says it is impossible to be definitive about a post-election decision right now, given Labor’s policy still contains several unknowns, but he says the policy Shorten and Butler are taking to the 2019 election is weaker than the policy of 2016 and “now is the time to base a policy on science”. Di Natale says if Labor’s climate policy, post-election, meets the Greens’ test of ambition, and one of the relevant tests of ambition is “a plan to phase out coal”, then Shorten can expect support. “But if it’s going to lock in failure, then we won’t support it. We will make a decision based on the policy.” The Greens leader is equally clear about his expectations about Labor’s stance on the Adani coal project should it win the election. Di Natale will on Thursday join Bob Brown’s convoy protesting against the proposed mine as it makes its way from Hobart to central Queensland. The Greens leader says he expects a Labor government to block the controversial project. Di Natale says he has zero sympathy with arguments that opposing a project that has already secured major approvals creates a significant sovereign risk problem for a party of government. “If the message we want to send is it’s risky to invest in coal in Australia, then I think that’s the right message,” he says. The Greens go into the contest needing to defend five Senate spots, and the party is ever hopeful of picking up an extra in the ACT. In the lower house, the objective is to return Adam Bandt to Melbourne, and to contest Kooyong, Higgins, McNamara, Wills and Canberra. The party has been plagued by open displays of internal dissent in recent times, and has underperformed in recent electoral contests, although Di Natale says he’s “very encouraged” by the party’s performance in the recent New South Wales election. He insists he’s worked hard to address complaints about the party’s internal culture, and he said the NSW Greens, often at odds with their federal counterparts, now “understood the need to work together”. Asked whether he thought the factional brawling and complaints about party culture had damaged the Greens, Di Natale says “it’s had a very small impact”. Di Natale, who arrived in Canberra presenting as a pragmatic and mild-mannered GP, now has a harder edge to his politicking. He says this reflects frustration that has built up “after spending three years in the parliament with one of the worst governments in Australian history, and I don’t say that lightly”. “It has an impact,” he says. “It has made me determined to throw them out”. Asked whether he has the appetite to remain party leader, given the recent adversity, and given the toxic nature of contemporary politics, Di Natale says party leadership remains the gift of his colleagues. Self-evidently the Greens’ performance in the coming poll will be a critical factor in whether he retains the backing of his party room. But he insists he’s not ground down by the obvious challenges. “I feel very positive about the job at the moment. The party has addressed some challenges and we’ve come through that.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAdd another to the list of absurd things claimed to be caused by global warming: Vessels getting trapped in unexpected sea ice!
This morning Switzerland’s online flagship daily NZZ here has a report on yesterday’s rescue of the Professor Chris Turney’s ill-fated Antarctic expedition. Once again we see naughty climatologist kids hiding behind mother media’s dress for protection.

Alvin Stone, media manager of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition and ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science blames global warming for vessel getting trapped in thick summertime sea ice. Photo: ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science.
Like many major western media outlets, the NZZ is well known for its biased, faith-based position when it comes to reporting on the man-made climate warming issue, often coming to the rescue of climate scientists whenever they find themselves in a jam. Turney’s expedition is no exception.
The article, written by Heidi Gmür, goes out of the way to defend Turney’s botched junket expedition, claiming that “passengers and crew on the ship were never in any immediate danger.”
The NZZ writes that it inquired directly with Alvin Stone, Media and Communications Manager at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales, to obtain more details about the expedition. According to Stone, except for the minor inconvenience of getting trapped in sea ice for nine days, the expedition was a success. The NZZ writes:
…the surprising turn of events that the expedition had taken didn’t hinder the scientists in finishing their work: ‘Fortunately the scientific measurements had been completed only hours before the vessel got stuck in ice’.”
The NZZ then looks at the massive internet and blog criticism that the debacle unleashed, characterizing it as “furious remarks and commentary from those who question climate warming“. The NZZ goes on to defend Turney’s expedition against the irony that his vessel got stuck in summertime sea ice and that the event starkly illustrates the myth of a warming Antarctic. The NZZ writes (my emphasis):

Wrongfully so, Alvin Stone claimed upon inquiry on Thursday. Moreover, indications are that it is precisely climate warming that led to the vessel’s awkward predicament. This is the ice in which the Shokalskiy got caught, so-called fast ice which had broken off from the continent years earlier, said Stone; moreover measurements show that there has been a decrease of precisely this kind of fast ice in the Antarctic – this in contrast to so-called sea ice that is created by the freezing of water around the continent.”
Blame all the thick vessel-trapping sea ice on climate warming. Can you believe it?
It’s also unclear whether the NZZ is telling readers untruths or if it is reporting out of plain ignorance. As ice on the continent grows, so would the rate of calving due to pressure.
Again we are being asked to accept that increased sea ice is a sign of climate warming, and the same goes for a decrease. This is not science – rather it very much appears as creative rationalization by those desperately clinging to doctrine.
The NZZ then informs that Turney suspects that the situation in the Commonwealth Bay, where the Shokalskiy got stuck, “has changed dynamically as three years earlier a spectacular collision between an ice berg with the Mertz Glacier took place.”
Now we see Turney is blaming his vessel getting stuck on climate warming. It couldn’t possibly get more desperate than that, nor more embarrassing for the institution of academics. I wonder if he intends to sue the fossil fuel industry for the millions in damages incurred by the expedition so far.
In reaction to the NZZ article, a vast majority of readers leaving comment are responding with outrage. Climate science crazy train has gone off the rails.
Finlly the NZZ writes that vessel owner will have to bear the costs of the rescue, citing international maritime law. The owner is reported to be the Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute of Russia. That will be interesting to watch, especially given the latest revelations discussed here.

It wouldn’t surprise me if the entire climate skeptic movement has already been mapped out and is now being monitored. What’s next? IRS audits? Harassment? We’ve already seen it with the Tea Party.
Warning: German Greens
I agree with much of what is written in the report. But I will warn readers not to trust any German Green. They are no better with the truth than any other historical misfits when it comes to climate science and environmental issues. These people are environmental tyrants dressed in liberty sheepskin.

"On Monday, a day of civil disobedience kicks off around the world. It will be led by climate change activists aiming to bring maximum non-violent disruption to civic life. And among those converging on Parliament Square, London, will be a playwright and a troupe of actors dressed as biblical figures: Noah, a parade of animals (going in two by two, of course), and even God himself. They might, on the face of it, look out of place and maybe even a little comical among the protesters and their placards: Noah’s wife’s dress has a touch of Wag about it, while God will be rocking a sharp white suit with his halo. There will be a crew of townspeople there, all readying themselves for a contemporary enactment of a medieval mystery play.  Mrs Noah is April De Angelis’s riotous retelling of the biblical flood story, starring Ade Adepitan as God and Naomi Paxton as Mrs Noah. But, far from being out of keeping with the day, this Christian tale of rising waves, endangered animals and near extinction of the human race could be the original “climate disaster” warning. “It is about extinction,” she says. “There is no bigger story.” De Angelis is a force of nature, as voluble, witty and rebellious as her work. A seasoned playwright and librettist, her dramas overlap with her activism, from her 80s entry point into theatre when she joined a women-only resistance group called Re-Sister (she chortles at the pun now) to her 1993 drama, Playhouse Creatures, set in the 17th century and exploring the moment when women were allowed to perform on stage.  A desire to place women’s lives at the heart of her stories runs through her work, and Mrs Noah is no exception. In De Angelis’s rebooted mystery play, Noah’s wife is a rebel and upstart, refusing to leave her group of female friends for her place on the ark. De Angelis did not need to invent Mrs Noah’s rebellion: “I had read the Chester Mystery Plays many decades ago and remembered that she refused to get on the ark in that version. It surprised me to reread it and realise that the writer, rather than being in service to the dogma of the church, was really getting inside Mrs Noah’s head.” Paxton feels that her character’s refusal is based as much on her political idealism as her loyalty to her friends. “It won’t solve the problem for Mrs Noah to save herself and her family in the ark. The problem remains, and she would only be moving away from it. She feels it’s an issue for everyone and that she can’t escape it.” It was last autumn that De Angelis had the idea to stage the biblical flood while she was at a meeting with members of Extinction Rebellion, the UK-based climate movement that counts Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Philip Pullman, Naomi Klein, and George Monbiot among its supporters. She joined the group after coming across a Facebook post. “I was in a low-level panic,” she says, “and when I read the post it went to high-level panic. I wanted to do something. I was numb and shocked and frightened. I felt ineffectual and without power. Writing this play changed that.” Now that politics appears so broken, she says it may be the case that the arts are becoming “the new politics” for younger generations. It’s certainly a great meeting place for the young to collaborate with other generations: the demographic of Extinction Rebellion ranges from millennials to people of her age. (She is 58.) De Angelis has also written a short duologue – an encounter between two scientists from opposing ideological camps that features bird songs – that will be acted out on street corners as a piece of guerrilla theatre with an eco-message. And, having been commissioned to write a play for the Royal Exchange, Manchester, she is thinking of ways to tell another climate story. The biggest challenge, for her, lies in turning the story of our planet’s destruction into compelling drama. Environmental disaster does not lack the dramatic elements, nor heart-wrenching personal stories. It’s just a case of rendering them in drama effectively. She recalls the divided critical opinions over 2071, a 75-minute talk by the scientist Chris Rapley (co-written with Duncan Macmillan) at the Royal Court, London, in 2014, which some said just wasn’t theatre. “I think he did a good job. There should not be one type of theatre – as long as it engages the audience and as long as it’s not preaching, because people don’t like to be preached to.” Adepitan agrees: “I travel all over the world as part of my job, and I’ve seen the devastating impact climate change is having on communities in Africa whose homes are becoming deserts as a result of global warming. We have to make sure as many people as possible understand how urgent an issue this is, and drama is a powerful and effective way to get to get this message across.” What is striking about Mrs Noah is the humour, song, rhyme and music that has been added to the climate message. God, frustrated by the town’s blindness to ecological danger, says at one point: “Don’t you read page six of the Guardian? The end of the world is coming.” There are plenty of other such moments. De Angelis wanted to insert enough laughs and winking contemporary references to catch the attention of the crowd in Parliament Square. This is essentially street theatre, she says. It must reach out and grab its viewer. • Mrs Noah will be staged at 6pm on 15 April in Parliament Square, London, as part of Extinction Rebellion."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the notion “the science is settled” isn’t dead by now, then it just got a few more 30D spikes pounded into its coffin. Make no mistake about it: THERE IS NO CONSENSUS.
Der Spiegel’s Axel Bojanowski has just published online a 7-part piece on the climate war between scientists.  http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,688175-7,00.html
I don’t have much time today, got some appointents and I have to take the bread home too. Here’s the general gist of it.
Part 1:  Bojanowski lays out the battlefield and describes how climate scientists got tangled up in conflict.
Part 2: Most scientists are somewhere in between the extreme views. There’s a lot of uncertainty concerning the consequences of AGW. Big Industry launched a sceptic campaign in the 1980s and 1990s.
Part 3: Climate scientists countered, and fiddled with activist environmental groups. Both pressured industry and politicians. Many German scientists fell in line with environmental groups. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK and the Max Planck Institute drew up position papers together with the WWF.
Part 4: The battle in the media. US media was balanced and alllowed Big Oil funded sceptic views to proliferate. Klaus Hasselmann blames the media for over-dramatizing climate scenarios. Sceptic scientists in Germany became marginalised. Media outlets reporting sceptic views came under fire from scientists and activists.

Part 5: Fighting in the trenches. Alarmist scientists were reluctant to reveal their work, fearing it would only be attacked. Their studies had great ranges of uncertainty, and this made it easy for sceptics to take them apart. Then Mann  put out the hockey stick curve, which turned out to be flawed. Briffa put out his curve in 1999, but warned of uncertainty, and wrote that the MWP was probably as warm as today. Mann’s stick was featured in TAR 2001, Btriffa’s curve not. Concerning hiding data sociologists believe that the damage is done. Without transparency, science is not credible.
Part 6: E-mails show Mann and Jones had too much influence on the journals, and acted as gatekeepers. Mann denies it, saying the journal editors decide the peer-reviewers. Conflicts in science are not unusual, but in climate science it has reached an extreme.
Part 7: Climate science is so politicised that it is now difficult to conduct. Mistakes were made in placing too much emphasis on consensus. Silvio Funtowicz sums it up: “Scientists who promise simple answers are best ignored”.
—————-
I wish I had more time to go into it more deeply – but I don’t right now. Hope to write more about this later.
Update: I made a small boo boo I think; the last sentence should read:
Sociologist Peter Weingart (and not Silvio Funtowicz!)  sums it up: “Scientists who promise simple answers are best ignored”.

How is it possible for leaders to think they can control the earth’s temperatures when they can’t even control their own deficits at home?
The next time you see a politician, ask him or her:
What is easier to control – your government’s spending or the earth’s temperature?

"Australians want environmental action. As Katharine Murphy explained a few weeks back, “private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007”.  A survey commissioned by the Australia Institute showed the majority of voters wanted to mobilise on climate “like they mobilised everyone during the world wars”. That result was consistent around Australia, with 57% of Queenslanders and 60% of Victorians agreeing that the country faced an emergency. The ABC Vote Compass found the environment ranked as the most important issue by 29% of respondents, up from 9% in 2016. Why, then, aren’t we seeing the parties in a bidding war to address such concerns? We know that if focus groups returned equivalent anxieties about refugees, the campaign would devolve into a contest to formulate new techniques for border cruelty. We’ve all seen that movie before. In 2013, Tony Abbott made the three-word slogan “stop the boats” central to his bid for election. Kevin Rudd desperately sought to counter by introducing the grotesque PNG solution, which incarcerated new boat arrivals on Manus Island and prohibited refugees from ever settling in Australia. He described it, correctly, as “a very hardline decision” – and yet at the time only 14% of Australians had nominated asylum seekers as one of the three most important issues determining their vote. If that tiny proportion could radically alter refugee policy at the election, why hasn’t the support of 53% of voters for a WWII-style climate mobilisation dramatically reshaped the 2019 contest? As we head to the polls, neither major party is promising anything like the “emergency action” the majority of Australians wants. The Coalition shows more enthusiasm for ridiculous fulminations against electric cars than any serious attempt to address global warming. As for Labor, Shorten’s policies represent a significant step back from the (inadequate) measures previously proposed by Gillard and Rudd. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Shane Wright rightly calls the ALP platform “as much an effort to neutralise the political attack as to find ways to truly reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions”. The reluctance of politicians to propose real environmental action might seem bizarre, given a context where that action would be not only right but also popular. But the comparison with refugees illustrates the peculiar dynamic of climate politics. Perversely, asylum seekers became such a preoccupation for both parties because, in one sense, border security was never a significant issue in Australia. Jordan houses nearly three million refugees; Pakistan, 1.4 million. Precisely because the refugee numbers arriving in this country were, in relative terms, utterly minuscule, governments could deliver “solutions” (albeit at great financial cost and with tremendous cruelty). Addressing the environmental crisis isn’t as easy as beating up on defenceless asylum seekers. A meaningful response entails challenging powerful vested interests. In particular, you can’t decarbonise an economy without defeating the corporations whose business practices depend on the despoliation of the planet. A recent study noted that just a hundred companies were responsible for more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. But those companies include some of the most significant corporate entities in the world – and mainstream politicians regard going toe to toe with multinational capital as “courageous” in the Humphrey Appleby sense of the word. To put it another way, in our system, the wishes of the voters don’t necessarily prevail. Think of the war in Afghanistan and how it dragged on and on, even though, for years, every survey showed most Australians wanted the troops brought home. What mattered then was not popular opinion but the elite consensus in support of the war. The same might be said about climate. Ordinary people want radical policies but corporate Australia doesn‘t. In Britain, hundreds of environmental protesters have been arrested for acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion. “We are facing an unprecedented global emergency,” ER’s manifesto reads. “Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown, and we are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making.” The group calls for governments to declare a “climate and ecological emergency”. But it also demands a “citizen’s assembly”, on the basis that professional politicians have proved themselves incapable of addressing the crisis. Let’s say it again: Australians want environmental action. We can’t afford more delays. .The majority of carbon emissions from fossil fuels have entered the atmosphere in the last 25 to 30 years – that is, during the period in which global warming was understood and governments were supposedly fighting it. Extinction Rebellion’s now an international movement, with an Australian group signing up those prepared to embrace civil disobedience, up to and including being arrested. It’s election season, the one period in which politicians supposedly listen, and there’s still no sign of the climate message getting through. We desperately need a people’s movement. As Tim Winton wrote in the Guardian on the weekend, “Enough cowardice. Enough bullshit. Time for action.” Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist "
"A report on the state of New Zealand’s environment has painted a bleak picture of catastrophic biodiversity loss, polluted waterways and the destructive rise of the dairy industry and urban sprawl. Environment Aotearoa is the first major environmental report in four years, and was compiled using data from Statistics New Zealand and the environment ministry.  It presents a sobering summary of a country that is starkly different from the pristine landscape promoted in the “Pure New Zealand” marketing campaign that lures millions of tourists every year. It found New Zealand is now considered one of the most invaded countries in the world, with 75 animal and plant species having gone extinct since human settlement. The once-vibrant bird life has fared particularly badly, with 90% of seabirds and 80% of shorebirds threatened with or at risk of extinction. Almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s rare ecosystems are under threat of collapse, and over the last 15 years the extinction risk worsened for 86 species, compared with the conservation status of just 26 species improving in the past 10 years. The scale of what is being lost is impossible to accurately gauge, as only about 20% of New Zealand’s species have been identified and recorded. Kevin Hague from the conservation group Forest and Bird said the report was chilling reading and captured the devastating affects of “decades of procrastination and denial”. “New Zealand is losing species and ecosystems faster than nearly any other country,” he said. “Four thousand of our native species are in trouble … from rampant dairy conversions to destructive seabed trawling – [we] are irreversibly harming our natural world.” The minister for the environment, David Parker, said the report offered “no big surprises” but reinforced the importance of cleaning up the waterways and becoming carbon neutral by 2050. “If, with all our advantages, New Zealand can’t overcome its environmental problems, then the world won’t,” Parker said. A massive rise in the country’s dairy herd over the last 20 years has had a devastating impact on the country’s freshwater quality, a key area being targeted by the government for improvement. During her election campaign, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pledged to make the country’s rivers and lakes swimmable again for the next generation. That could prove challenging, with the report finding that groundwater failed standards at 59% of wells owing to the presence of E coli, and at 13% of the wells owing to nitrates. Some 57% of monitored lakes registered poor water quality, and 76% of native freshwater fish are at risk of or threatened with extinction. A third of freshwater insects are also in danger of extinction. Forest and Bird said the main culprits for worsening freshwater quality were the intensive use of fertilisers, irrigation and cows. The Green party co-leader James Shaw, who is also the minister for climate change, said the environment was taking a further hammering with the effects of global warming starting to be felt, including sea-level rise, increasing land temperatures and warming ocean temperatures. “All the issues in this report are made worse by climate change and that is why this government is so determined to take strong action,” Shaw said. “The introduction of climate change legislation, establishing an independent climate change commission to guide emissions reductions, and the just transition to a low emissions economy are vital.” Hague said while the findings were sobering, the reality was far worse as the report missed “dangerous marine heatwaves” and the inadequacy of marine protections, with less than half a per cent of New Zealand’s sea area protected by marine reserves. “We must not waste any more time in fundamentally changing the way we interact with nature,” he said. “We need an economy that nurtures and restores our environment, not one that trashes it.”"
"Once, a night in with David Attenborough promised the TV equivalent of a warm blanket. It was a chance to watch spectacular creatures revelling in the beauty of their natural habitats, as the man with a voice as soothing as ice-cream described what we could see, from the violent to the serene. Those days are gone. Attenborough’s recent move to Netflix, for Our Planet, was deceptive: a seemingly gorgeous nature documentary that doubled up as animal kingdom snuff movies in which the beauty of those natural habitats was revealed as a crumbling paradise, ruined by people and particularly by greed. One of the main points of praise for Our Planet, which was well received, suggested that Attenborough was no longer tiptoeing around the issue of climate change, the implication being that he had done so before. You sense that Our Planet was unfortunately timed for the BBC. In Climate Change: The Facts, the gloves are now not so much off as thrown to the floor in a certain rage. It’s right there in the title, bold and stark. This hour-long documentary, part of the Our Planet Matters season, is wide-ranging yet concise, easy to understand, not blighted by the ego of, say, An Inconvenient Truth, and it is designed to do for climate change denial what 2017’s Blue Planet did for single-use plastic.  That’s not to say it should be Attenborough’s responsibility to get the wider public to pay attention, nor that it is down to the BBC. It isn’t. But Climate Change: The Facts is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. The first 40 minutes are given over to what Attenborough calls, without hyperbole, “our greatest threat in thousands of years”. Expert after expert explains the consequences of rising CO2 levels, on the ice caps, on coastal regions, on weather and wildlife and society itself. The most powerful moments are in footage shot not by expert crews who have spent years on location, but on shaky cameras, capturing the very moment at which the reality of our warming planet struck the person holding the phone. In Cairns, Australia, flying foxes are unable to survive the extreme temperatures; rescuers survey the terrible massacre, and we learn that while 350 were saved, 11,000 died. A man and his son talk through their escape from raging wildfires, over the film they took while attempting to drive through a cavern of blazing red trees. These are horror movies playing out in miniature. It is difficult to watch even five minutes of this and remain somehow neutral, or unconvinced. Yet as I kept on, scribbling down an increasingly grim list of statistics, most of which I knew, vaguely, though compiled like this they finally sound as dreadful as they truly are – 20 of the warmest years on record happened in the last 22 years; Greenland’s ice sheet is melting five times faster than it was 25 years ago – I started to wonder about responsibility, and if and where it would be placed. This would be a toothless film, in the end, if it were hamstrung by political neutrality, and if its inevitable “it’s not too late” message rested solely on individuals and what relatively little tweaks we might make as consumers. What about corporations? What about governments? Then, at that exact moment, having played the despair through to its crescendo, the experts served up unvarnished honesty. They lined up to lay out the facts, plain and simple. Fossil fuel companies are the most profitable businesses man has ever known, and they engage in PR offensives, using the same consultants as tobacco companies, and the resulting uncertainty and denial, designed to safeguard profits, has narrowed our window for action. It is unforgivable. I find it hard to believe that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, can watch footage of Trump calling climate change “a hoax ... a money-making industry” and not be left winded by such staggering ignorance or astonishing deceit, though it is, more likely, more bleakly, a catastrophic combination of the two. At least Nigel Lawson only appears here in archive footage, and his argument sounds limp, to put it kindly. Climate Change: The Facts should not have to change minds, but perhaps it will change them anyway, or at least make this seem as pressing as it needs to be. With the Extinction Rebellion protests across London this week, disrupting day-to-day business, and this, on primetime BBC One, maybe the message will filter through. At the very least, it should incite indignation that more was not done, sooner, and then urgency and a decision to both change and push for change at a much higher level. Because there is, for a brief moment, just possibly, still time."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwiss news magazine Weltwoche (World Week) print edition just published a stinging article about the now disgraced IPCC’s fifth assessment report Summary for Policymakers where it describes the refusal by scientists to acknowledge observations and their obstinate clinging to faulty models and doomsday scenarios.
Figure right: from Weltwoche report, “Faulty Prognoses from Scientists”
The introductory heading of the Weltwoche reports reads:
For a quarter of a century leading climate scientists have been warning of a dangerous global warming due to CO2 emissions. Now under Swiss leadership [Thomas Stocker] they publish a new report. It shows: The scientists were wrong. By Markus Schär.”
Weltwoche writes how IPCC lead scientist Thomas Stocker may have experienced an historic moment when he introduced the IPCC’s AR5 Summary for policymakers, but one he may not wish.
Crumbling consensus
Weltwoche writes that in the days leading up to the report’s release, a dispute prevailed among the delegates who were busy hammering out the final text. The Germans wanted no mention of the 15 years of no warming, the Belgians wanted to keep the year 1998 out of the statistics, the Hungarians advised to hold back facts in order “not to provide climate skeptics with ammunition“.
Weltwoche writes that Dutch delegates, however, insisted on including the natural impacts on climate change which refuted the claims of galloping global warming. One thing is sure, writes Weltwoche, the IPCC must come to terms with: “The consensus among the climate scientists that had been cemented over the last decades, is cracking – or is even crumbling completely.”
“Pitiful” model performance
To explain what is driving this crumbling consensus, Weltwoche looks at the history of global warming, reminding readers of the doomsday prognoses made in the past by experts like NASA’s James Hansen and by the IPCC years ago. For example in 1988 James Hansen “predicted that with an annual increase in CO2 emissions of 1.5%, the temperature would rise by 1.5°C by 2011. But in fact CO2 emissions rose 2.5% annually and the temperature ended only 0.3°C higher – even below the value that scientists had calculated if no CO2 had stopped being added beginning in the year 2000“.
Worse for the IPCC, British meteorologists recently forecasted a cooling ahead for the next few years, Weltwoche writes.
Weltwoche comments as follows on this miserable performance:
Anyone that far off is not a scientist, rather he’s a fortune teller – and one with a pitiful performance.”

IPCC devestated by observed data
Today, the IPCC’s latest report ends up contradicting all the earlier forecasts and warnings it made earlier. Weltwoche writes (my emphasis):
In its new report, the IPCC refutes itself. … They [scientists] tried time and again to defend their theory using tweaked models and honed studies. It gladly made itself vulnerable to attack by making forecasts that it could not live to see. After 25 years many of the forecasts can indeed now be evaluated – the result for the IPCC is devatasting.“
IPCC abandons Mann’s flawed hockey stick
Weltwoche then explains the sorrowful story of Michael Mann’s hockey stick in depth and how it was shown to be flawed by a Canadian statistics expert and how the IPCC eventually abandoned it altogether in that they conceded that the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were real after all. Weltwoche writes:
The draft of the new IPCC report also admits that the same warm temperatures we have today also prevailed at the peak of the Medieval Warm Period and that people suffered later on during the ‘Little Ice Age’ – the climate Bible of 2001 with its hockey stick chart was obviously wrong.”
Lomborg: 20 trillion euros for 0.05°C
Weltwoche writes that the IPCC has (quietly) reduced CO2 climate sensitivity values, yet continues to insist that the world embark on a crash-course energy supply transformation. Too expensive, says Danish scientist Bjorn Lomborg. Weltwoche quotes Lomborg:
But we also need to recognize that our current climate policy is too expensive. Every year the EU wants to spend 250 billion euros until the year 2100. With this 20 trillion euros, the temperature will drop by 0.05°C by 2100.”
But none of this impresses Stocker and the IPCC, who continue sounding the alarms louder than ever. Weltwoche concludes:
The important thing is alarm, as Stocker continues to maintain what he told Weltwoche in April: ‘The problem is there, and it is one of the biggest ever for mankind, and we have the choice of how big it is going to be.'”
In the models, or in reality?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German Der Spiegel has just come out with a piece called: The Myth of Climate Scepticism. You know all that scepticism you’ve been hearing about? Well, it never really existed. It was all just a myth, so says Der Spiegel.
You see, it’s all been disproven by a study coming out of Stanford. All those polls conducted earlier were simply misinterpreted! That’s right, there really isn’t any scepticism at all out there. It was all just a big miragee.
Climategate really has had no effect on what people think about climate change. In fact, there never really was a Climategate. The Oxbourgh report has proven that too.
Indeed last winter in Europe was actually very warm – the warmest we are allowed to remember. Didn’t we all go swimming in the Baltic Sea last February? Shit! A new study shows that too. Just ask Finland.
And weren’t all them potholes we had in the streets in March all caused by the blistering heat of last winter?
I guess all us sceptic bloggers have been just wasting all our time, and we really ought to stop blogging about all that scepticism. The Stanford report says so. Der Spiegel says so too.
A new reality is being manufactured and pulled over our eyes.

"Sajid Javid has called on police to use the “full force of the law” against Extinction Rebellion protesters causing disruption in London to draw attention to the issue of climate change. The home secretary, who is positioning himself for a run at the Conservative party leadership, made a series of tweets condemning “any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law”. He called on the police to “take a firm stance” against protesters who were “significantly disrupting the lives of others”. “Over recent days, commuters trying to earn a living have been unable to travel to work and businesses have been disrupted,” he said, following a meeting with Met police chiefs. “Emergency vehicles have faced difficulties navigating the road networks and the demonstrations have put added pressure on police officers whose job it is to solve crimes and protect the public. “Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law. They have no right to cause misery for the millions of people who are trying to lead their daily lives. Unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated.” Hundreds have been arrested and more than 1,000 officers deployed to police the protests, which entered their fourth day on Thursday. Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate. They said demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest but said there was no legal justification for more draconian tactics, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful. Politicians have struggled to respond to the protests, as they are keen to head off complaints that not enough is being done to tackle climate change at the same time as taking a tough stance against disruption to commuters. Javid and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, have come under pressure from the rightwing press in recent days to take a more outspoken stance against any protesters disrupting public transport or acting illegally. In a letter to the home secretary, Khan suggested that cuts to funding were restricting the ability of the Metropolitan police to cope with the activists. “The Met’s ability to police protests without impacting on core policing priorities – such as tackling knife crime – has been made significantly harder by the huge cuts to government police funding,” he said. Citing £850m of cuts to the force since 2010, he added: “Whether to tackle violent crime, or police protests, our brave police officers deserve the resources they need to keep us safe.” He highlighted the increasing cost of policing a growing number of protests in London, and said he was working with the Met to consider claiming for a special grant to help with costs for the current demonstrations. He has said on Twitter that the world is “facing a climate emergency” and that he “fully supports the right of protesters to protest on this vital issue”, while urging organisers to “work with police to ensure their demonstrations are peaceful and lawful and that disruption is kept to a minimum”. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said: “We’ve got the message,” after some activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to a garden fence at the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Claire Perry, the energy and climate change minister, also said that she “got the science, motivation and passion driving climate emergency protests” but could not see that “disrupting one of world’s busiest transport systems … blocking emergency routes and making life difficult for so many is going to build consensus and support for the changes we need”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here and here on how the junior partner (the FDP) of Angela Merkel’s coalition government has moved to block the re-appointment of Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber as the Chairman of the WBGU advisory council for another 4-year term.

WBGU advisory committee: Left to right: Nebojsa Nakicenovic, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber (Chairman), Inge Paulini (General Secretary), Claus Leggewie, Sabine Schlacke, Stefan Rahmstorf, Renate Schubert, Jürgen Schmid, Reinhold Leinfelder, Dirk Messner (Vice Chairman). Source: wbgu.de/beirat/.
The WBGU directly advises Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government on matters concerning environment and climate. It has ten members – all of them leading professors from various fields.
The FDP party, coalition partner of Merkel’s government, is growing increasingly dissatisfied with the direction and views of the influential WBGU advisory council, and apparently has decided that a major overhaul is long overdue. As Spiegel wrote yesterday, read here, the WBGU has become only a circle of Schellnhuber’s friends where debate on climate issues is unwelcome. The members of the WBGU are alarmists and are demanding that the government take drastic steps to curb CO2 – advice that the business friendly FDP classic liberal party finds inappropriate and increasingly off the wall. The FDP controls the Ministry of Economics, and it is that very Ministry that refuses to approve the re-appointment of the current board. The FDP party is seeking an overhaul, demanding fresh faces and ideas.
The approaching demise of the Schellnhuber and the current WBGU may have been in the works for a long time. The advisory council seemed to meander off from reality, and advocated naive plans that made no economic or scientific sense.
Over the years, Schellnhuber and his WBGU began showing a clear pattern of activism, dogmatism and a lost sense of reality.
In 2008 Professor Schellnhuber, who is also director of the climate-catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in a video with somber tones that the Earth would explode if the world population reached 9 billion, read here. In 2009 he claimed that unless the world heeded his message, “the Earth’s population would be devastated“, adding that “the carrying capacity of the planet is below 1 billion people.”
In Schellhnhuber’s and the WBGU’s mind, the climate science was settled and CO2 was going to warm the planet some 6°C by 2100 unless their plan for drastic reductions was implemented. To curb CO2 emissions, Schellnhuber and the WBGU introduced in April 2011 its “Masterplan” for “The Great Transformation” of global society, read here, which called for a more authoritarian global government, watered-down democracy, and the marginalization of climate science dissidents and skeptics. Prof. Hans von Storch called this sort of arrangement where citizens and society have no say and are expected to just sit there and listen to clever scientists explain how the situation is, and what policy has to be implemented, as “almost a Medieval political understanding”, read here. He even went on to say that some of the PIK scientists seemed to have “taken on the role of prophets“.
Schellnhuber even once repeated in a video the preposterous claim that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035.

Frustrated by the slow progress Germany seemed to be making in leading the world to a carbon-free society, Spiegel wrote that Schellnhuber publicly criticised Angela Merkel, read here. Some may argue that this incident showed the growing rift between Merkel and her climate advisor.
In recent years, it became clear that Germany’s transition to renewable energy was causing severe energy inflation for consumers and hurting German industry. But rather than slowing down the pace to a green energy economy to alleviate the pain consumers were feeling, Schellnhuber and his WBGU insisted that the government defy the laws of economics and push the green agenda even harder – consumers be damned. The advisory council seemed to have lost its sense of reality.
Then, in what for many appeared as totally bizarre, the WBGU recently published a 140-page comic book (for the indoctrination of children) where Schellnhuber and his WBGU colleagues are portrayed as heroes rescuing the planet from greenhouse gases, read here. The comic book even portrayed carbon emitters as villains that had to be stopped.

The WBGU clearly had forgotten its original mission, and lost its reality bearings. The combination of their comic book, their denial of economic reality, and criticism of Merkel last year probably led to the events of the last weeks. Now it appears FDP party chief Philipp Rösler has no problems dealing with the WBGU and giving Schellnhuber the heave ho.
Criticism of Schellnhuber’s brand of science came to head early this year as Professor Hans von Storch published a stingingly critical book that aimed harsh criticism at activist science, particularly at Schellnhuber’s Potsdam Institute. The book carries the subtitle: “The dangerous proximity of politics and climate science“. Hans von Storch accuses them of having oversold the science.
Yesterday Spiegel named a number of former scientists who have also become highly critical of the WBGU, read here.
Reaction to the news of Schellnhuber’s blocked appointment was met by jubilation on the skeptic side, and outrage on the warmist side. Some called the block the move “outrageous“, with one former green minister describing it as a “mass mobbing“. But one Dutch scientist, a longtime critic of the IPCC and the PIK, sent me an e-mail and called the news “sensational”.
Whether Schellnhuber ends up staying or not, expect new faces to join the WBGU, and thus the end of the advisory board as we know it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDepleted of scare stories, the global warming scare industry is desperate and has resorted to the latest scare tactic, claiming that warming leads to violent conflict.
The online Spiegel reports here on a study appearing in the journal Science by Solomon Hsiang et al claiming that global warming causes shortages in resources and thus increases the risk of war and violent conflict. The title of the Spiegel article: Global Warming: Study on Climate Change/War Met With Harsh Criticism.
In a nutshell, Spiegel discovers that the Hsiang study is hardly worth the paper it’s printed on.
The Hsiang study is even too absurd for the leftist Spiegel to swallow. In their study, Hsiang of the University of California in Berkeley and his team of researchers conclude:
We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each 1 standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%.”
Spiegel writes, according to Hsiang’s study, that should the global temperature rise by 2 – 4 sigma by 2050, then the frequency of violent conflicts could rise by 50% in some regions. No region is exempt, the scientists say.
“Gross errors and a distortive selection of data”
Even the left-leaning Spiegel finds that assessment suspicious, and so the renowned news weekly asked a number of top experts (most of them warmists) and discovered that they massively criticize Hsiang’s findings and flat out dismiss the study’s conclusions. Spiegel writes that the:
Experts accuse the authors of gross errors and a distortive selection of data.”
Data was cherry-picked
Jürgen Scheffran, Professor for Climate Change and Security at the University of Hamburg and his colleagues evaluated 27 studies and found that 16 were statistically significant in showing that global warming increased the probability of violent conflict, but that 11 studies said they could actually have the opposite effect, i.e. decrease the likelihood of violent conflict. Eight of these papers were not even considered by Hsiang and his colleagues, Scheffran says.

Moreover, Spiegel then writes that Oslo economist Halvard Buhaug is quoted saying that Hsiang and his team “ignored data”. Worse, Buhang says that the “authors used data that produced the strongest results“.
Alternative explanations were “wiped off the table”
Spiegel writes that Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, was also highly critical of Hsiang’s methodology, saying that alternative explanations were “wiped off the table” in order to give climate fluctuations maximum power as an explanation. Spiegel writes:
All in all, Marotzke says that he is ‘skeptical when it comes to the robustness of the results’.”
Authors confused weather with climate
Spiegel also reports that economics professor Richard Tol of the University of Sussex also has expressed “massive criticism” on the Hsiang paper, saying that the authors confused weather as climate. Spiegel writes:
Most of the Hsiang team’s evaluated studies had to do with weather phenomena, Tol believes. ‘Forecasts on the conflict-enhancing effect of future climate was therefore strongly exaggerated’.”
Hsiang et al ignores man’s ability to adapt
Finally Sociology Professor Nico Stehr and climate scientist Hans von Storch also told Spiegel that the worst error in the Hsiang study was that it ignores man’s ability to adapt to weather and climate events. Hans von Storch says “they falsely assume that man’s reaction to climatic stimulations would be unchanged“. Another expert reminds us that man will be even better equipped in the future to adapt to changes than we are today.
Readers will find a complete debunking of the preposterous notion that warmer climates lead to more violent conflict, read here.

"Janet Laurence is wearing a living plant in a glass vial around her neck. The bright pop of green stands out against her flowing white dress. It’s as if she’s just stepped out of one of her own artworks – perhaps the one in which endangered rainforest plants are grown in beakers of laboratory glass, with lines of transparent tubing connecting the plants’ roots. “All my life I’ve been very empathetic with other species,” she says. “I have incredibly vivid memories of always being very caring of things in nature, of plants and other animals.”  Meeting Laurence feels startlingly serendipitous. The Australian artist’s work has been exhibited in Paris, London, Berlin and is held by museums the world over. Her career spans more than three decades, yet the concerns at the centre of her art have never been more urgent – climate change, environmental destruction, humanity’s failure to adequately reassess its relationship with nature. Laurence’s art feels like a project that’s more important than ever, especially for those of us who have desperately tried to make sense of the catastrophe we’re facing – extreme weather events becoming alarmingly more frequent, pollution infiltrating the deepest oceans and highest mountains, governmental failure to address any of it – and fretted about how to reconcile that with our daily lives. But her work hasn’t always been well received. “When I first started making art and wanting to work with nature, I was really criticised a lot for it,” she tells Guardian Australia. “In the feminist era I was told, you shouldn’t work with nature.” To do so would be to reiterate reductive ideas about women as nurturers – as opposed to men, who were, well, everything else. “It was very odd.” After Nature, now showing at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art, is the first major survey of Laurence’s work. The title, a reference to the nature writer WG Sebald’s prose poem of the same name, evokes both the idea of a time post-nature, and an homage to it – threads that Laurence’s work deals with simultaneously. While she sees herself as part of the fight against the destruction of the natural world, she’s equally concerned with our ability to transcend the very concept – to do away with the artificial separation between humanity and the rest of the living earth. The installation of endangered rainforest plants, Cellular Gardens (where breathing begins), forms part of the retrospective. In a room nearby is Deep Breathing: Resuscitation for the Reef: coral and fish skeletons are tagged, wrapped in brightly coloured thread, sewn into translucent pouches and held in glass vials inside stacked perspex boxes, while footage of the living – for now – Great Barrier Reef is projected onto the surrounding walls. It was Laurence’s – and Australia’s – contribution to the Artists 4 Paris Climate Exhibition that was held alongside the 2015 climate change conference. In the Theatre of Trees, a new installation created for MCA, a flowing fabric structure of concentric rings, like the growth rings of a tree, fills the centre of the room. Walking through it in the dappled, moving light, you can hear birds, the breeze, leaves falling. Outside the tree in the corners of the room are three smaller installations: Knowledge, Wonder and Desire. The first is a partly interactive reading room full of works that Laurence says have inspired her. (She cites the writing of Luce Irigaray, Deborah Bird Rose, Judith Wright as influences; she singles out Amitav Ghosh’s “beautifully explicit” book The Great Derangement in particular.) The second is a herbarium; the third an “elixir lab” in which audiences can book tasting sessions to sample liquid infusions of different Australian trees: ginger, a native mint, Davidson plum, lemon myrtle and pine pollen. Laurence’s work is, before everything, very beautiful. The beauty of it is partly to entice an audience. “I am very aware in my practice of creating an attraction to enter a space,” she says. “I want you to linger.” This aesthetic is tightly coupled with politics; hers is an activist practice. Yet her work feels less like a polemic than a way of angling the light to catch the filmy webs that connect, say, the breath of a sleeping tiger to human vulnerability; blood vessels to the seedling of an endangered plant; and things as disparate as a taxidermied owl, a fallen tree, test tubes and bandages. If all this seems to border on the mystical, that’s not entirely an accident. In the 90s, Laurence’s work focused on alchemy and the transformation of matter; over the last decade, she has interrogated the potential of medicinal and psychotropic plants as a way to overturn archaic modes of understanding the world. We’re so accustomed to associating nature with the unknowable, the “other”; to thinking about civilisation and the natural world as two opposing concepts, rather than interconnecting parts of the same whole. That division, Laurence says, has been “culturally enforced and religiously enforced for so long, it’s the biggest obstacle we have”. “We have to get back in touch with nature in order to care for it. We’ll all be lost if we don’t do that,” she says. “There’s an amazing groundswell of activity happening, of caring for the planet happening, but how can we deal with this enormous global capitalist force that’s still so powerful? And it’s almost incomprehensible how it’s still so powerful. So I do believe it’s going to take probably something almost disastrous to break that.” It would be easy to give in to despair in the face of that, but Laurence says her resilience comes, in part, from her art. “Because I’m involved in what I think of as an activist practice and because by acting we get hope, I don’t feel overwhelmed by those forces myself,” she says. “But I know they’re there.” There is an inspiring honesty about the blur between Laurence’s work and how she tries to live her life. During our conversation, she tells me that she gardens a piece of public land on Sydney Harbour. It now includes two enormous bay trees that began life in a hospital for native plants she created for the 2010 Sydney biennale, called Waiting: A Medicinal Garden for Ailing Plants, full of damaged or impaired seedlings and saplings covered in bandages and gauze. The plants that died were preserved and used as part of a subsequent artwork; those that survived, she planted. “I want to bring you into an intimacy with nature. I feel the most important thing we have to do today on the planet is care for it and recognise our interconnection with it. And of course, what are we fighting against? We know the weight of our civilisation.” • Janet Laurence: After Nature is showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, until 10 June"
"The UK government’s active support for fossil fuels and airport expansion is “beyond absurd”, Greta Thunberg has told MPs. The 16-year-old Swedish student, who sparked a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, gave a typically blunt speech. She told MPs: “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind.” Thunberg, who had earlier met the heads of several of the UK’s political parties, also said today’s generation of leaders around the world had not acted fast enough to halt climate change. “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to,” she said. “You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.” Some consider the UK to be a leader in the fight against global warming, but Thunberg was fierce in her criticism: “The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels, like for example the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports, as well as the planning permission for a brand new coalmine, is beyond absurd.” She said the UK had a “mind-blowing historical carbon debt”, referring to the nation’s cumulative emissions since the industrial revolution. The UK government also uses “very creative carbon accounting”, she said, by not including the emissions from imported goods in headline figures. The former UN chief Ban Ki-Moon also recently criticised the UK government’s funding of fossil fuel projects in other countries. Thunberg said there was still just about time to stop climate change: “I’m sure that the moment we start behaving as if we were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe. Humans are very adaptable. But the opportunity to do so will not last for long.” She said the deciding factor for every new economic development must be the level of carbon emissions it will produce. “Every time we make a decision we should ask ourselves; how will this decision affect that [emissions] curve?” About 1.6 million students are estimated to have skipped school to protest against climate inaction, prompting some criticism over lost education. Thunberg said: “I assure you we will go back to school the moment you start listening to science and give us a future. Is that really too much to ask?” Earlier on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn and several other Westminster party leaders met Thunberg at parliament, with a symbolic place left at the table for the absent Theresa May. Thunberg, who came to London to speak at the Extinction Rebellion environmental protests, and was due to address activists at Parliament Square later on Tuesday, met Corbyn, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts. May was chairing cabinet on Tuesday morning. Her spokesman said he did not have information about whether the prime minister had been invited to see Thunberg. Organisers of the event said May had been invited, but there had been no response. A place at the table was left empty, with the prime minister’s name. Thunberg told the MPs: “We just want people to listen to the science.” Corbyn told her: “Well done for what you have done.” Lucas, the former Green leader who is the party’s sole MP, told the activist: “I think all of us are really committed to trying to ensure that there’s an ongoing way to really make sure that all of our policies and all of our work in parliament is properly scrutinised by young people with a perspective on climate in particular. “We want young people’s voices to be heard in parliament. This is such an important moment, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say we have just 11 years left to get off the collision course we are on for climate catastrophe. “That sense of urgency is here as never before, at a time when there have been protests on the streets not just of London but around the country and all the different nations of the UK. More than ever, politicians have our ears open to your message.” While in parliament Thunberg also met the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, as well as the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran. Outside on Parliament Square, more demonstrators supporting the Extinction Rebellion group were massing, with police warning they risked arrest if they did not remain in a certain area and the protest continued after midnight. More than 1,000 people have been arrested amid sit-in protests in London over the past week, which blocked Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge. Activists are still at Marble Arch. More than 10,000 police were deployed to contain and then break up the protests."
"It is the near future. You wake in a house warmed by a heat pump that extracts energy from deep below the ground and delivers it to your home. (Your gas boiler was outlawed years ago.) You rise and make yourself a cup of tea – from water boiled on a hydrogen-burning kitchen stove. Then you head to work – in a robot-driven electric car directed by central control network to avoid traffic jams. At midday, you pause for lunch: a sandwich made of meat grown in a laboratory. At the end of the day, you are taken home by a robot car – through countryside festooned with solar panels and turbines. Welcome to carbon-free Britain, a nation stripped of its petrol cars, diesel trucks and trains, gas heating, methane-belching cows, and jumbo jets. The UK of tomorrow is a zero-emissions haven. Or at least that is the dream, one that is now being pursued with passion by growing numbers of UK citizens. Indignant at the lack of political effort being made to curtail global warming, they have responded with mounting outrage which last week reached a peak during Extinction Rebellion’s protests in London. Creating a zero-emission society in the UK has become a major cause and it will receive further serious promotion next week when the government’s climate change committee publishes its report on how, and when, Britain can achieve this status and play a proper part in the battle against global warming. It will be hard work, as the committee will make clear. Last year 6.8 tonnes of greenhouse gases were emitted into the atmosphere per head of population in the UK. To decarbonise the nation, that figure will have to be reduced to zero. The crucial question is: when? Just how quickly can we eliminate our carbon emissions? Extinction Rebellion protesters are clear. They want the UK to be decarbonised by 2025. That will mean massive curtailment of travel by car or plane, major changes in food production – steaks would become culinary treats of the past – and the construction of swathes of wind and solar plants. But given that we face disastrous climatic change, only massive, widespread, rapid interventions can now save us from a fiery global fate, they say. Many experts disagree, however. They argue that such an imminent target is completely impractical. “Yes, you could decarbonise Britain by 2025 but the cost of implementing such vast changes at that speed would be massive and hugely unpopular,” says Lord Turner, former chairman of the climate change committee. Most expect the climate change committee will plump for 2050 as Britain’s ideal decarbonisation date. “2050 is do-able and desirable and would have an insignificant overall cost to the economy,” states Turner, who is now chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission. According to this scenario, developed nations, including Britain, would aim to achieve zero-emissions status by 2050 and then use the decarbonising technologies they have developed to achieve this goal – hydrogen plants, carbon dioxide storage vaults and advanced renewable generators – to help developing nations halt their greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. We would then have a reasonable chance of restricting global warming to less than 2C and so avoid the worst effects of climate change: unprecedented storms, melting ice caps, disappearing coral reefs, rising sea levels and drowned cities. But just how straightforward will it be to create a zero-emissions society? How easily will we be able to kick the carbon habit? At first glance, the evidence looks encouraging. Britain has already embarked on a path of carbon emissions reduction for its power generation industry. Fossil fuel plants have been closed and wind farms have been built in their place. And the change has already been reflected in Britain’s power statistics. In 2013, 62.5% of UK electricity was generated by oil, coal and gas stations, while renewable provided only 14.5%. In 2018, the figure for oil, coal and gas had been reduced to 44% while renewables were generating 31.7%. It is a distinct improvement – though we have yet to be given a date when engineers expect the last UK fossil-fuelled power plant to produce its final watts of electricity and to emit its last puffs of carbon dioxide. “Decarbonising UK power production is going well,” says George Day, head of policy for the technology and innovation centre Energy Systems Catapult. “There is a clear path forward.” But as he points out, there are many other sources of carbon dioxide in the UK. “The next big challenge will be heating. Gas boilers are major carbon emitters and dealing with them is going to be very difficult.” According to Day, about 90% of British people have gas boilers in their homes, most having been fitted relatively recently – over the past 20 to 30 years or so. “And we have really come to love them,” he states. “You get hot water and heating at a flick of a switch, after all. And that is a problem, he argues. “Dislodging that incumbent technology in a way that is socially acceptable is going to be really hard. Indeed it is probably the toughest challenge we face in decarbonising Britain because you are talking about homes where people are used to making their own decisions.” A solution would be to price gas out of common use, by putting increasingly heavy carbon taxes on household supplies so people can no longer afford them and are forced to change heating systems. But that would only lead to widespread protests, says Day. “Just look at the gilets jaunes,” he points out. Instead, ways will have to be found to entice householders – not compel them – to move away from gas heating to alternatives such as electric heating, heat pumps and hydrogen-burning radiators. “They will have to see it as a better alternative to gas heating,” says Day. “It will be a big task but I believe it can be done.” Time will be a key consideration. At present around 20,000 homes a year are being converted into low-carbon housing units. “However if we are serious about reaching zero emissions by 2050 then we are going to move with a lot more urgency,” adds Day. “By 2025, we will have to be converting around a million houses a year.” Nor is household heating the only headache facing the decarbonisation of the UK. Steel-making, cement manufacture, shipping, aviation and trucking also pose problems. Consider cement. It is the basic ingredient of concrete, the second most consumed substance in the world – behind water. Around 10 million tonnes of cement are used every year in a host of construction projects across the UK, from homes to new underground lines. (Hundreds of thousand of tonnes are being used to build the access shafts, underground stations, and tunnels for Crossrail, for example.) Cement manufacture requires heat which could be supplied using electricity generated by renewables. But a major problem remains: making cement involves breaking down limestone to obtain calcium oxide and that process releases carbon dioxide in significant amounts. It is estimated that cement manufacture is responsible for about 8% of current global emissions. Nor is it obvious how to find ways to eradicate them completely. Then there are farms and planes. “In the case of aviation, you might use batteries and hydrogen to power relatively small aircraft for short distances: a 100-seater for a flight of an hour or so,” says Turner. “But for a jumbo across the Atlantic you will still need fuels with the energy density of heavy liquid hydrocarbons.” As for agriculture, it is estimated that around 6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are emitted from farms around the world. Major reductions could be achieved through improved management practices, say researchers. Nevertheless eating the meat of belching cows, no matter how tasty is the resulting steak, undoubtedly has a major impact on emission levels. Changes in the British diet will be needed. In the end, it will simply not be possible to reduce Britain’s fossil-fuel emissions to zero, say scientists. To compensate, we will have to take carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere. “That is the logical, inevitable consequence of trying to achieve zero net emissions in this country,” argues Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia. “If you are looking for any net zero target then you have to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.” This can be done in three ways: naturally, by planting trees and shrubs that absorb carbon dioxide. Or artificially – on a larger scale – the gas can be removed as it is produced at a factory or power station that burns trees for energy. Or it can be removed by huge numbers of man-made air filters, known as direct air capture. The carbon dioxide can be liquefied and stored underground in underground caverns, or old, depleted gas fields under the North Sea. This is known as carbon capture utilisation and underground storage (CCUS). “In the end, your choice of replanting or of building underground storage facilities depends on how much carbon you will need to remove,” says Le Quéré. “Most calculations suggest Britain will need to take quite a lot of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to keep its net emissions at zero.” That arithmetic clearly implies that Britain will need to build a number of CCUS plants, a point backed by Charlotte Morgan, who chaired a recent task force that urged the construction of several carbon storage facilities in the UK. Each of these would be able to hold millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. “These could create an enormous industry for Britain,” says Morgan, who envisages the creation of five industrial clusters – in Humberside, Merseyside, South Wales, central Scotland and Teeside – where CCUS facilities could be built and attract industries from around the world. “However, if we want to these up and running by the end of the next decade, we need to act quickly.” This need for speed is shared by many other parts of the zero-emissions programme, as we have seen. It may seem odd given it is unlikely it will reach its conclusion for another three decades. Nevertheless, scientists are adamant that even if choose 2050 for our decarbonisation date, we need to act now. This urgency of the task is emphasized by Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London. “If the world limits emissions of carbon dioxide to no more than 420 billion tonnes this century, we will have a two in three chance of keeping global warming down to around 1.5C. “However, if we go above to 580 billion tonnes then our chances will be reduced to 50-50. The problem is that in 2017 alone, a total of 42 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted in a single year. By that calculation, we clearly do not have a lot of time to waste.”"

The aim is to squeeze out the fossil fuel energy that’s fed in. The problem however is that wild, unpredictable fluctuations in the supply of wind and solar energy often lead to huge, uncontrollable grid overloads.
The print edition of the Handelsblatt described in a feature titled “Energy Madness” how the absurd Germany’s energy feed-in act has become. Hat-tip: Hans Labohm here. He quotes the Handelsblatt:  
For the green energy branch, Sunday June 16 was a special day to celebrate. The sun shone for hours and a strong northwest wind blew across Germany. At 2 p.m. solar panels were sizzling with power and the wind turbines up north were turning strongly. Green energy was being fed into the power grid to the tune of 29,600 megawatts, and so provided 61% of the power demand. Never before had Germany’s power supply been so green.
However, the employees of the power grid operators were far less inclined to celebrate. As is the case every Sunday, the demand for power was relatively small. And as mandated by the renewable energy feed-in act, they were required to somehow get all the solar and wind power to the consumers. After all, green power has the right of way in the power grid. This meant gas-fired power plants had to be shut down, and Holland, Czech Republic and Poland had to accept, against their will, the excess German solar and wind power.
Power customers in the industry were delighted with all the green power on June 16: They could consume as much power as they wanted – and were credited with cash for doing so. One chemical concern that was able to take in more power between 2 – 3 p.m. than thought, did not have to pay the usual 30 to 60 euros per megawatt-hour. No, instead the company got more than 100 euros. The important thing was to somehow get the power out of the grid.
This is a story from Absurdistan, from the land of the Energiewende.”
Large companies with energy gobbling equipment are paid 100 euros for every megawatt they can burn. I guess they switch on as many of their huge furnaces, kilns or whatever and run them empty at full blast. Just burn off as much power as you can! – and get paid to do it.

Just the opposite is demanded in the dead of winter when there is no sun and when the wind dies down. During the week, energy demand soars and their is often not enough supply to meet the demand. And because many power companies are finding it unprofitable to run conventional systems part-time, many are simply mothballing such plants completely, thus making supply even rarer. As a result, the risk of blackouts is becoming a real increasing threat in Germany with each coming winter.
The chart that follows shows German power supply and consumption over the last 30 days. Solar energy is shown in yellow and wind in blue. Gray represents the conventional supply and the red line is the total demand. Often wind and sun spike and excess power needs to get dumped quickly…somehow, somewhere.

Note all the wild fluctuations, and so it is necessary to always have conventional power on stand by for calm sunless days.
Little wonder that the Handelsblatt, once a huge proponent of alternative energies, now calls it “energy madness”. Climate activists and greens, however, claim it’s a model for the world.

"A heavenly green spectacle is spreading northwards across the country as trees open their new leaves. The delicate green of tree leaves in spring is remarkable and perhaps the greatest spectacle is the flush of new beech leaves that are so translucent they cast a green glow across woodland floors. This green colour comes from the chlorophyll pigment in the leaf chloroplasts, the tiny cell bodies that perform photosynthesis. As the young leaves are still developing their chloroplasts, the leaves tend to be a lighter green. The new leaves are also thinner, with fewer waxy or tough layers, making them more translucent. What’s more, the leaves look brighter because they tend to have fewer additional pigments other than chlorophyll, so the green colour can shine through more clearly. But this is only a passing phase before the leaves turn darker green as their chloroplasts mature and the leaves grow thicker and more opaque.  Another striking feature is how the trees in springtime have been tending to come into leaf earlier over recent decades, and that reflects how average spring temperatures across the UK have risen by about 1C over the last few decades. Spring even moves up the country faster for many plants and animals, averaging 1.2mph between 1891 and 1947, and 1.8mph between 1998 and 2014."
"In the manner of a droid desperately seeking a docking station, I am constantly searching for a leader who can offer me some direction and energy in the battle for the biosphere. Until now, there’s been something of a leadership void. Anyone who so much as uttered the words “climate change” might find me looking up at them, awaiting instruction. Now I feel like I can pick and choose. Perhaps it’s because people are competing with Greta Thunberg, the teenage agitator behind the climate strikes, but good adults are stepping into the limelight.  My latest climate crush is Dr Mae Jemison. Despite being famous for spending time in space – she became the first African American female in space in 1992, serving as a mission specialist on the space shuttle Endeavour – she is all about tackling climate change, on Earth and doing it now. The funny thing about astronauts is that they are rare in everyday life but abundant on the climate circuit. Even I’ve met five. They are particularly prized for their “blue marble” moment, the point at which they glimpse the Earth from space. Their macro-perspective gives us some indication of where our micro-actions can help. But what I particularly rate about Jemison (and she is not one of those I’ve met) is the fact that her main message is essentially “get over yourself, human”. The Earth will carry on without you, so get focused on making sure you’re not ejected. Last week, as part of a panel at Women in the World in New York, alongside Oprah Winfrey, she also kicked into touch the idea that we might up sticks and move our chaos to space when our tenancy here ends due to bad behaviour. “We must not use Mars as our Plan B,” she said. Similar climate perspective was shown by Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano Lliuya (another of my personal climate leaders) when he filed a lawsuit against RWE, the German energy giant, alleging that its immense emissions threatened his family, his property and his home city of Huaraz, 6,500 miles away. The case recently entered the evidentiary phase before the higher regional court in Hamburg. That might sound like a boring bit of process, but it’s of fundamental significance. The Lliuya case shows that everyday people can take on big emitters. It’s the David and Goliath showdown of our time. At the last count, 1,302 climate lawsuits were progressing through legal systems across the world. Some of them will win and change the stakes. I’m wary of raising false hopes, but I think we may have found the purpose of Instagram. @ PreachersNSneakers takes a forensic look at the apparel choices of a clique of celebrity preachers that has coalesced around Justin Bieber. Since Bieber embraced evangelical Christianity a few years ago, celebrity-connected pastors have entered the mainstream. These include Chad Veach, sometimes referred to as “Bieber’s pastor”; Carl Lentz, who apparently baptised Bieber in an NBA player’s bath; and one Rich Wilkerson Jr, who officiated at the wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. They amass huge audiences and Instagram followings and rock Bieber-inspired wardrobes. Scrutinising the pictures of pastors at work has reaped rich rewards. Rather literally, the most expensive spot being a pair of Air Yeezy 2 “Red Octobers” worn by pastor John Gray, with a resale value of $5,611. This has raised questions over what the good lord might make of such materialism and whether a megachurch pastor should be a hype-beast. Under fire over his $1,980 Gucci backpack and $794 Traxedos track pants, Chad Veach is the only man of (expensive) cloth to attempt a comeback so far, posting that he didn’t pay for his outfit. He quickly thought better of it and deleted it. As with all trends propagated by social media, we should be wary of contagion. I recommend UK clergy restrict themselves to modestly priced Hush Puppies, with typical orthopaedic support. The last thing we need now is Rev Alan from The Archers attempting to hide his Yeezys under his cassock. Hey, Jude Law, how does it feel to get a 100% approval rating? That’s what I’d ask at the end of the week when images of the actor filming (The New Pope) in white budgie smugglers generated meltdown. It goes deeper than the prurient. Timing was important: Brexit day 9,000 or trunks? But the images also delivered meme heaven and played into a weird trend for objectifying priests (thanks, Fleabag). But the unexpected element was how we felt about Jude. He’s been in our lives for many years. He’s had bad times and indeed bad films. But we’ve always rooted for him. “Has anyone in the history of humankind reacted to losing his hair better than Jude Law?” asked writer Joe Reid as we gloried in Jude’s buff pontiff snaps. It’s not all sunlit uplands. Jude’s briefs have launched a hundred beach-body-ready guides increasing body image pressure on men. They will generate beachwear angst. “Holiday get-up for men is tricky territory,” advised the Telegraph, which is understatement of the year if you’re proposing tight white trunks. My advice – do not go there. But Jude did, and he gave us a day off and broke the internet, so well done."
"On Monday morning a strange sight appeared, edging its way through the buses, taxis and shoppers on Oxford Street in London. A bright pink boat, named Berta Cáceres after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, was being pulled carefully through the traffic, eventually coming to a halt in the middle of one of London’s busiest thoroughfares.  Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam Bemused onlookers watched as activists secured “Berta” to the road, while others glued themselves to its garish hull. And with this act of flamboyant defiance, Extinction Rebellion’s climate protests had begun. In the five days that followed, thousand of people, from pensioners to young parents with toddlers, scientists to city workers, teenagers to teachers, have occupied four landmarks in the capital, defying repeated police attempts to remove them and causing widespread disruption. Smaller disruptive events have taken place across the UK and in 33 other countries. By late Friday evening police were saying that 682 people had been arrested in London. Three supporters who glued themselves to a train on Wednesday have been imprisoned. That same day four more attached themselves to the fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, declaring the Labour leader “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the unfolding climate crisis. And on Friday about 20 young protesters, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner on a road outside Heathrow airport, asking: “Are we the the last generation?” But perhaps the protesters’ biggest achievement is that millions of people have heard their message that the world is in a spiralling climate emergency that demands transformative change to avoid catastrophe. Through hundreds of articles, editorials, and radio and TV interviews, including some hostile critiques of its tactics, Extinction Rebellion’s message has gone mainstream. “It’s been a resounding success,” said one of the group’s organisers, Howard Rees, surveying the scene on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday afternoon. “What are we on? Day four? We are holding all the sites, we are attracting loads of new members, everybody’s having a great time, there’s a party atmosphere everywhere … the police are generally positive and friendly towards us and agree with what we’re doing. And we are getting our message out there. It couldn’t be going better, really.” The four occupied sites, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, were all blockaded in quick succession on Monday morning, bringing widespread disruption to central London. And although activists gathering in the sunshine on Waterloo Bridge had no idea how long they would be there – or what the police reaction would be – there was a jubilant atmosphere as they swarmed on to the road. “I am so worried about what’s happening to the planet,” said Laura Sorensen, a retired teacher from Somerset. “We are on a knife-edge now and I felt strongly that I needed to get out and show myself, rather than just talk about it in the pub.” A little further along Waterloo Bridge was Josiah Finegan, a 22-year-old who had never been on a protest before. “I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking.” Before going to join the protest, Finegan added: “I have no idea what to expect or what might happen … I just heard about it and felt I had to come.” Police mingled with protesters, chatting and watching as flowers, trees in large tubs, a mini skate ramp and even a lorry were dragged into place on the normally traffic-choked bridge. Looking on, one senior officer said the police response would be proportionate. “These people are explicitly peaceful, they have liaised closely with us over their plans and have a legitimate cause. We all have a limit on what we think is the right level of action to take but I think everyone is worried about climate change.” Over the ensuing days, the success, tactics and sheer determination of the demonstrations took many by surprise, even though they had been more than a year in the planning. The strategy of peaceful mass disruption was tested in a much smaller series of protests over air pollution last year, with activists blocking busy junctions for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. The group hopes such protests act in two ways: they put economic pressure on the government by disrupting the infrastructure, and they force people to confront the reality of the climate emergency by interrupting their daily lives. Once they had honed the process, organisers spent months holding public meetings around the country. Thousands of people gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the climate emergency and what they could do about it, with hundreds signing up to take part in larger-scale rebellions and be arrested. Speaking to the Guardian after a meeting last summer, Roger Hallam, one of the key figures behind this week’s protests, said: “It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing.” Ten months later, it seems he was right. The group’s success this week has not come without internal tensions, exacerbated by the non-hierarchical structure of the group. The decision to block trains, and potentially tubes, was hotly debated long into the night on Tuesday. A similar discussion took place over the plan to hit Heathrow. And as the week has gone on, and the attention of the world’s media has slowly turned to the protests, the pressure on the volunteers trying to organise and control it has only increased. “The phones never stop ringing, we have press inquiries round the clock from media around the world … it wasn’t like this at my old job,” said one of Extinction Rebellion’s young media team, who took a break from her career to volunteer a few months ago. “But this has been one of the most exhausting, exhilarating weeks of my life.” Extinction Rebellion says thousands of people are signing up every day. The group’s rise to prominence has come amid mounting evidence of climate breakdown, from floods to heatwaves, melting ice sheets to poor harvests. Its message about the scale of the climate crisis has resonated because it is backed up with science. On Thursday night David Attenborough presented a primetime documentary on the BBC, Climate Change: The Facts, supporting Extinction Rebellion’s central claim that the world is in a climate emergency. Earlier in the week, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform. As the sun goes down on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday night, Finegan is dancing and laughing with a group of 20 or so people of all ages and backgrounds, accompanied by a collection of drummers and other musicians. “It’s been insane, amazing,” he says. “I have been worrying about this stuff so much but the last few days, well, I feel like this has changed everything.”"

"Governments will no longer be able ignore the impending climate and ecological crisis, Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, has told Extinction Rebellion protesters gathered at Marble Arch in London. In a speech on Sunday night where she took aim at politicians who have for too long been able to satisfy demands for action with “beautiful words and promises”, the Swedish 16-year-old said humanity was sitting at a crossroads, but that those gathered had chosen which path they wish to take. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam “I come from Sweden and back there its almost the same problem as here, as everywhere, that nothing is being done to stop an ecological crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises,” she told the crowd. “We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before, they have been ignored for decades. “And for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politician’s will not get away with it for any longer.” Her speech came amid police efforts to forcibly clear Extinction Rebellion protesters from Waterloo Bridge as the group debated whether to continue its campaign of mass civil disobedience. Police said on Sunday night they had cleared all the protesters from Parliament Square. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the disruption was “counter-productive” to the cause of climate change and was stretching resources so much it could damage police’s ability to fight violent crime. Extinction Rebellion had earlier said it expected its supporters would be cleared out of the two sites occupied without permission as police prepared to evict them if they declined to leave voluntarily. Last week, the group gained global coverage for the disruption its tactics of civil disobedience caused in central London. On Sunday, the organisers said they intended to change tack and would offer to vacate some sites in exchange for the mayor acting on some of their demands. The Metropolitan police said they had made 963 arrests and charged 42 people. The force’s leader, Cressida Dick, said the group’s tactics, centred on peaceful direct action, had caused too much disruption. On Saturday, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus were returned to normal use, after complaints from businesses about the blocking of some of the capital’s key arteries. On Sunday, activists rushed to Parliament Square, when police turned up in force to try to clear five roadblocks. Activists were using lock-on devices to hold the space, as well as gluing themselves to the ground and each other in order to slow down the police. Activists said there were three people locked on trees in the square with more ready to go up. They promised attempts to evict them would be “spectacular” and could take police all night. However, by Sunday evening the police said the square had been cleared. The stage-truck on Waterloo Bridge was finally removed by 5am on Sunday after police spent most of Saturday and well into the night removing protesters glued and locked on to it. Police spent hours using angle grinders to cut free the two protesters who had locked themselves down on the top of truck, before winching them down and carrying them into the back of waiting police vans. By Sunday night they were moving the activists to one side of the carriageway, and arresting those who are refusing to move. The Met has needed support from about 200 officers from other forces to deal with the protests, which have been peaceful. Khan said 9,000 officers had been involved in policing the protest so far. He said: “I share the passion about tackling climate change of those protesting, and support the democratic right to peaceful and lawful protest, but this is now taking a real toll on our city – our communities, businesses and police. This is counter-productive to the cause and our city.” The mayor added: “I remain in close contact with the Met commissioner, and agree that Londoners have suffered too much disruption and that the policing operation has been extremely challenging for our over-stretched and under-resourced police. “I’m extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer. It simply isn’t right to put Londoners’ safety at risk like this.” The protest group said a phalanx of police vans were gathered around Waterloo Bridge on Sunday amid mounting expectation protesters would be forced out. Ronan McNern, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, said: “We think they want everything cleared by the end of the week. People are willing to be arrested. There is a deep sense we do not want to be attached to any single site. What this disruption is doing, we are the news now. It is making people talk in pubs and buses about Extinction Rebellion. It makes them think about their existence which is under threat.” Extinction Rebellion is discussing withdrawing from some sites in return for being allowed to remain in others and having its demands met. One manifesto from Farhana Yamin, an international environmental lawyer, advocated a “pause” in disruption next week to better project their demands and press for negotiations with government. She wrote: “Today marks a transition from week one, which focused on actions that were vision-holding but also caused mass ‘disruption’ across many dimensions (economic, cultural, emotional, social). Week two marks a new phase of rebellion focused on ‘negotiations’ where the focus will shift to our actual political demands.” She continued: “We want to show that XR [Extinction Rebellion] is a cohesive long-term, global force, not some flash in the pan.” Others in the group’s leadership were planning further disruption and a meeting this week will attempt to decide on the group’s strategy."
"I’ve been asking myself a question – and even posing it makes me queasy. Is it too late – are we beyond saving?  As a culture and a polity, when it comes to climate change, have we arrived at a point where we are now expected – even trained – to abandon hope and submit to the inevitable? OK, I guess that’s two questions. In good faith I can still say that the answer to the first is no. But I’d be a liar and a fool to give the same response to the second. No, it isn’t too late. But we’ve squandered decades of opportunities to mitigate and forestall impacts and we’re making a pig’s breakfast of responding to what is now a crisis. Even so, humans are not yet beyond saving themselves from the worst ravages of global warming. There’s fight in us yet, even if it’s a bit shapeless. The problem – and it’s an existential threat both profound and perverse – is that those who lead us and have power over our shared destiny are ignoring global warming to the point of criminal negligence. Worse than that, their policies, language, patronal obligations and acts of bad faith are poisoning us, training citizens to accept the prospect of inexorable loss, unstoppable chaos, certain doom. Business as usual is robbing people of hope, white-anting the promise of change. That’s not just delinquent, it’s unforgivable. Over the last 15 years in Australia our national governments have failed to respond effectively to the challenge of climate change, and for most of that time we actually gave ourselves the luxury of calling it a challenge. Now it’s more of a crisis. And it’s not as if our leaders are incapable of producing a timely response to a crisis. After all, in 2009 the government took bold steps to avoid an economic depression. And in the matter of refugees arriving by boat, governments still spend billions on emergency-level funding and infrastructure to meet what they view as a crisis of national security. But in the case of climate change there’s no equivalent sense of immediacy, no sense of priority commensurate with the dangers it poses to our future ability to feed ourselves, defend our largely coastal settlements, insure our homes, maintain national security and keep our children safe from harm. The message implicit in our governments’ refusal to act is that we should all just suck it up – as in “climate change is bullshit, and even if it’s not there’s nothing you can do about it”. Once internalised, this narrative is profoundly dangerous, not only for individuals, but for the entire community. It’s a licence for nihilism, a ticket to hell in a handbasket. And the cohort responsible for this mixture of denial and fatalism is far removed from the daily experience of the ordinary citizen, especially the youngest and poorest of us. They have become a threat to our shared future and we must hold them to account, immediately and without reservation. In the last 25 years I’ve observed a peculiar social phenomenon in individuals and communities that I mistakenly thought I understood because I was a child of the cold war. While working to help save ecosystems across Australia I’ve noticed a bruised attitude of beleaguerment in individuals and within groups that’s increasingly hard to ignore, a mounting grimness in the faces and language of people barely holding on in the face of steady, cumulative and unrelenting losses. They’re losing places, ecosystems, potential. It’s not restricted to activists; I see it in neighbourhoods and towns, I read it online, I get it in the mail. Ordinary folks – young and old – watching their waterways curdle, their soils blow away, their green spaces bulldozed, their fish gasping for air. Feeling wounded and betrayed, some are clinging to the last tendrils of hope, others are falling into despair. And that worries me. Ecological depletion is being experienced communally as a mounting loss of access and an erosion of possibility. In essence, a pruning back of future prospects. It’s expressed as grief, and the most palpable, widespread and immediate expression of it is now brewing over climate change. Beneath that grief there’s rage. I worry that this widely-shared grief and unfocussed rage may become the signal human disposition of our time, that the Anthropocene will be marked by fury and hopelessness. This frightens me just as much as the prospect of beachside properties falling into the sea, or even the death of our coral reefs. Acidifying cultures are as chaotic and dangerous as acidifying oceans. Younger people in particular have begun to feel abandoned by their leaders and elders. They suspect they’ll be left without food or ammunition to stage a fighting retreat in which every battle is a defeat foreseen and every bit of territory was surrendered in advance by politicians and CEOs who deserted them long ago to hide in their privileged bunkers and silos. So what hope for our kids? Why should we be surprised they’d walk out of school and march? Their futures are being traded away before their eyes. They see what many of their elders and betters refuse to acknowledge. That they’re being robbed. During the cold war many of us were gripped by dread – it was personal and communal – and in the books and films of the era our anxiety was palpable. We lived every day with the prospect of nuclear annihilation, and sometimes that possibility was clear, present and extremely proximate, a matter of hours and minutes when a possibility became an actual probability. And for some time now I’ve been trying to see our current crisis through that lived experience. Because we survived, didn’t we? The worst never happened. No one pressed the button. So, chances are, all will be well this time, too – right? But the reason humanity survived the cold war is because world leaders paid attention. They took emergent crises seriously. And in each instance of utmost danger, arguments of ideology and nationalism eventually fell away before the sacred importance of life itself. Beneath all the posturing there was, finally, a bedrock of humanity informing the technocrats and generals. Stepping back from the brink was expensive. Think what it cost in terms of pride, political prestige, assets, even territory. Consider the expenditure of ingenuity and infrastructure. And there’s our problem. Because in this country, when it comes to climate change, there’s no equivalent attention to the crisis. For some there’s no crisis at all. Our governments and corporations are ensnared in a feedback loop of “common sense” and mutual self-preservation that’s little more than a bespoke form of nihilism. Ideology, prestige, assets and territory are now tacitly understood to be worth more than all life, human or otherwise. And the four great capacities of humanity to solve a crisis – ingenuity, discipline, courage and sacrifice – these seem to be reserved for more important enterprises. The future, by all accounts, can wait. But the future is already with us. The button has been pushed – again and again. In 2011, along hundreds of kilometres of the West Australian coast, abalone crawled off the reefs to die in their untold thousands on the baking white beaches because of a 2-degree spike in sea temperature. A little further north at Shark Bay, the world’s largest seagrass meadows suffered a sudden mortality of 20%. In the Northern Territory two years later, mangrove forests died along a 1,000km stretch of coast. And the Great Barrier Reef experienced successive bleaching events so catastrophic they caused the nation’s most senior coral scientists to weep. Here’s the thing. To our current national government climate change is but a dry-lightning storm in a district unknown. For the denialists who control policy, the storm itself is an endlessly debatable phenomenon. And if the parish it’s lighting up really does exist, then it can safely be dismissed as remote and insignificant. But that district is real. Most of us know it as the immediate future. Some know it as the present. And it’s already burning. It’s peopled with folks who weep and seethe and dread what else may lie ahead. We can no longer wait patiently for our leaders to catch up. We cannot allow ourselves to be trained to accept hopelessness. Not by business, nor by governments. Both have subjected us to a steady diet of loss and depletion. It’s sapped us and left us mourning a future we can see fading before it even arrives. There’s no good reason to submit to this. No sane purpose in putting up with it. Because grief will paralyse us, and despair renders doom inevitable. We can afford neither. Australians can make a bad outcome inexorable by submitting to it meekly. Or we can fight for a viable future and meet this crisis shoulder to shoulder. I am of the passionate belief that we can and will. But to do this we’ll need to get our house in order – and fast. That means calling bullshit on what’s been happening in our name for the past 15 years. It’s time to make sharp demands of our representatives, time to remove those who refuse to act in our common interest, time to elect people with courage, ingenuity and discipline, people who’ll sacrifice pride, privilege and even perks for the sake of something sacred. Because there’s something bigger at stake here than culture wars and the mediocrity of so-called common-sense. It’s the soil under our feet, the water we drink, the air we breathe. Life. It’s worth the fight. But, by God, after decades of appeasement, defeatism and denialism, it’s going to take a fight. Time’s short. So, let’s give our grief and fury some shape and purpose and reclaim our future together. Enough cowardice. Enough bullshit. Time for action.

“If you have 99 percent of doctors who tell you ‘you are sick’ and 1 percent that says ‘you’re fine,’ you probably want to hang out with, check it up with the 99. You know what I mean? The idea that we ignore that we are in some way involved in climate change is ridiculous. What’s the worst thing that happens? We clean up the earth a little bit?”
That’s the wrong question. The question Clooney needs to ask is:
If on one hand you have 99 quacks wearing lab coats pretending to be doctors and armed with phony charts, fudged data and scare stories, all of whom on the payroll of the pharmaceutical industry, asking you to pay $10,000 a year for a little snake oil or else you’ll die – and on the other hand you have a dozen of the most renowned doctors, among them Lindzen, Christy and Spence, saying the way you feel is normal and all part of life and it isn’t necessary to pay 10,000 a year, who are you going to listen to?
George Clooney is a Hollywood actor who parrots lines and only repeats things that have been written down for him. His highest educational achievement is nothing more than a high school diploma. Listening to Clooney on climate science would be as reckless as listening to John Wayne Gacey on responsible parenting.
Don’t expect Clooney to look at the data himself. He wouldn’t know where to begin.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA press release by the Max Planck Institute (MPI) describes how a recent study shows that people are not very willing to make sacrifices if the benefits follow only much later in the future. That’s no surprise.
Immediate rewards make our brains rejoice and when such a reward beckons we’re happy to behave cooperatively. But if achieving a common goal won’t be rewarded until a few weeks have gone by, we are rather less euphoric and less cooperative. And if, instead of money, we’re offered the prospect of a benefit for future generations, our enthusiasm for fair play wanes still further.
Climate change is the largest public goods game that has ever been played and the whole of humanity are its players. The problem is that while we are now making the payments, the fruits of our efforts will only be enjoyed very much later and they will be shared among the whole of humanity. We ourselves or our children will thus benefit only very slightly from any restrictions we place on our lives today and our motivation actually to do something is correspondingly low.
You can read the entire Max Planck Institute press release here.
What’s remarkable about the study is that it accepts, as proven fact, that the climate will be much worse in the future – although we know 98% of the climate models have completely overstated the warming for the last 15 years.
Just imagine what the results of the study would have been had the test subjects been shown the models’ true performance beforehand. Why sacrifice when you know there isn’t going to be any benefit at all, ever?
And why inflict pain on yourself when you know the politicians, elitists and scientists will simply continue jetting around and living high on the hog while letting the poor taxpaying masses make all the sacrifice?
What do the study’s results imply?

The MPI press release writes:
‘The result of our experiment paints a gloomy picture of the future;’ summarizes Milinski. ‘We were unfortunately able to confirm Schelling’s prediction – it’s a disaster.'”
Yes, it’s a disaster: people aren’t going to sacrifice and embrace Spartan green living.
As a solution, the MPI proposes providing “short term benefits” to make going green more attractive. But how? Very disappointingly, the only short-term benefit the MPI is able to come up with is the benefit of “exporting technology”. But that won’t work because only a very few people would benefit quickly from exporting green technology (and my how they’ve benefitted so far!), and the rest of us would have to, well, keep sacrificing.
Only option left: force people to sacrifice
It seems the only option left, the MPI implies, is to force the necessary sacrifices onto the citizens, i.e. to ram it down their throats. Wouldn’t that be the ultimate demonstration of power?
Politicians and activist scientists have already convinced many among us to open up wide and to let the big pill gun into their mouths. All that’s left to do now is to force it down with one mighty thrust.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year the media were overflowing with reports about how a “super El Niño” was shaping up and that it could be a powerful one, so powerful in fact that it would make 2015 “very likely to become the hottest year on record by far.” Read for example posts by noted climate end-of-world theorists/cheerleaders Joe Romm, Andrew Freedman, Stefan Rahmstorf, Live Science…
Today German blog site Die kalte Sonn here brings us up to speed on the “super El Niño” topic. To sum it up, once again predictions by leading “experts” have turned out to be completely wrong. Call it climate false-alarmism.
=============================
Australian Meteorological Institute sees little chance of an El Nino in 2014
By Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In mid May we reported here on developments in the tropical Pacific and directed attention to a possible El Niño, but left out the use of vocabulary such as “wreak”, “catastrophe” and “chaos”. But other German media outlets didn’t hold back:
Focus 24 February 2014: Global climate problem: Floods, hurricanes, droughts– this is what El Niño has done
FAZ am 12 May 2014: Warming and weather chaos: “El Niño” is taking off
Neue Zürcher Zeitung: «El Niño» could lead to chaos

And also one or the other followers of alarmism were hoping the heat from the ocean would finally end the observed global temperature stagnation.
Already in early June 2014 we warned here at our blog that the probability of an El Niño was less than what the models had been projecting. On 29 July 2014 the Australian Meteorological Institute announced at their website that the probability of an El Nino developing in the near future was greatly reduced:
EL NINO INDICATORS EASE
Despite the tropical Pacific Ocean being primed for an El Niño during much of the first half of 2014, the atmosphere above has largely failed to respond, and hence the ocean and atmosphere have not reinforced each other. As a result, some cooling has now taken place in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, with most of the key NINO regions returning to neutral values. While the chance of an El Niño in 2014 has clearly eased, warmer-than-average waters persist in parts of the tropical Pacific, and the (slight) majority of climate models suggest El Niño remains likely for spring. Hence the establishment of El Niño before year’s end cannot be ruled out. If an El Niño were to occur, it is increasingly unlikely to be a strong event. Given the current observations and the climate model outlooks, the Bureau’s ENSO Tracker has shifted to El Niño WATCH status. This means the chance of El Niño developing in 2014 is approximately 50%, which remains significant at double the normal likelihood of an event. El Niño is often associated with wide scale below-average rainfall over southern and eastern inland areas of Australia and above-average daytime temperatures over southern Australia. Similar impacts prior to the event becoming fully established regularly occur. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index has been below −0.4 °C (the negative IOD threshold) since mid-June, but needs to remain negative into August to be considered an event. Model outlooks suggest this negative IOD is likely to be short lived, and return to neutral by spring. A negative IOD pattern typically brings wetter winter and spring conditions to inland and southern Australia.
The “missing heat” (as the temperatures have stood still since the start of our new millennium and thus are no longer in harmony with the pretty models…) now also appears nowhere to be found in the water. Keep searching!

"Youth activists have taken the Extinction Rebellion protests to Heathrow on the fifth day of action, demonstrating beside the main roundabout on the road to the airport. The activists, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner asking: “Are we the the last generation?” as dozens of police prevented them from blocking the road.  The protesters said they were risking arrest to highlight the dangers of climate change. “To everyone reading about this, I’m here because I love you and fear for your future and my future,” said Oscar Idle, 17, from Bristol. “It’s that love and that fear that gives me courage.” About 20 protesters were moved on to the pavement by police at one of the road entrances to the airport. Protesters stood by the tunnel that leads to terminals two and three, but all roads around the roundabout were open and there was no disruption to motor traffic as the group remained surrounded by police. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam About 25 police, some of them reportedly brought in from Cardiff and other regions, repeatedly warned the teenage protesters they could be arrested if they did not move on, but four of the activists refused to budge for more than an hour. The representatives of Extinction Rebellion Youth, which operates with some autonomy from the wider organisation, said they never planned to disrupt flights, though they had planned to block traffic intermittently. Several among the group chanted “People power” and: “We are the youth and we’re doing what’s right. We are the youth and we are fighting for our lives.” Some were in tears but held their ground. They said they were crying as much because of the climate crisis as the stress of the standoff. “We are consistently being punched in the face by the truth, but nobody is doing anything,” said Savannah Lovelock, a 19-year-old student from the University of Falmouth. “I just want to go home. But we have no choice. If other people stood up for the next generation, we wouldn’t have to.” “I shouldn’t be here, I should be revising for my end-of-year exams,” said Talia Woodin, 19, who is at Goldsmiths. “But I have to be here. What good is a degree if there is a possibility that there is no future?” “We know the risks and they are worth taking. I’m incredibly proud to be here with the others,” said Samar, 14. “We’re facing a complete disaster and I refuse to stand by and watch this happen without doing something.” At about 10am, the four activists moved on, holding hands with their arms raised. The action came as the number of arrests from Extinction Rebellion’s week of protest passed the 500 mark. Despite the detentions, activists have held roadblocks at four locations in central London since Monday and expect more to join them on Friday, the start of the Easter weekend holiday. They believe the BBC programme Climate Change: the Facts, which aired on Thursday night, will strengthen their cause. “The David Attenborough documentary will have a huge impact,” predicted Ronan McNern, a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion. He said the group’s disruptions over the past six months were shifting the debate. “We are creating conversations. For the first time people are talking at the breakfast table, in pubs and on the tube about the climate crisis. That’s what this is all about.” They have been boosted by wide media coverage and endorsements from prominent figures in the science community and entertainment world. In an open letter on Friday, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”. The latest high-profile supporter is the actor Emma Thompson, who joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning. Hundreds of people sat in the street and listened to poetry readings. When dozens of police officers moved in to try to disperse them, Thompson – who was on top of a boat in the middle of the junction – joked: “I want to remind the police that Nanny McPhee is up here, and I have my stick with me.”  The home secretary, Sajid Javid – considered a contender in the Conservative party’s leadership race – called for police to use “the full force of the law” against the demonstrators. On Thursday night the Metropolitan police said they had cancelled leave for some officers over Easter. “This is putting a strain on the Met and we have now asked officers on the boroughs to work 12-hour shifts; we have cancelled rest days and our violent crime taskforce have had their leave cancelled,” the force said in a statement. The linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said. “The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”"
"Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old founder of the school strikes for action against climate change, has said she hopes to join the Extinction Rebellion protests when she visits London next week. The Swedish activist will also take the campaign to the UK parliament, where she will speak to dozens of MPs including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove. Her arrival on Sunday coincides with a surge of concern about the climate. On Thursday the BBC screened a documentary about the crisis, narrated by David Attenborough. In recent days, the governor of the Bank of England, groups of scientists and members of the clergy have added their voices to the call for more ambitious cuts to emissions. Thousands of Extinction Rebellion campaigners have blocked four areas in central London since the start of the week, and youth activists are staging a demonstration at Heathrow on Friday. Police have made more than 500 arrests but organisers have vowed to continue for another week. There have also been demonstrations by the group in New York, Paris, The Hague and dozens of other cities. Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories of the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament at the invitation of Lucas, meet student activists in the UK and to talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian. Before her visit, she said she was keen to join the campaigners on the streets. “I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting. I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.” Extinction Rebellion plans to ramp up its protest over the weekend, when it hopes more people will join because of the bank holiday and the warmer weather. More actions, including a picnic on a motorway, are planned for Monday, Earth Day. Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg’s support. “She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the School Strike 4 Climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.” Thunberg has become a global figurehead for the climate movement in the past year. During her Easter holidays, she has been on a European speaking tour and has, so far, met Pope Francis and addressed the European parliament. MEPs gave her speech, which harangued them for spending too long on Brexit and not enough time on climate, a standing ovation. In the UK parliament next week, she will meet the Speaker of the House of Commons and talk to several dozen MPs.  “Greta is coming to the UK at a time of unprecedented public awareness and action around climate change – and will deliver a powerful message to politicians that they cannot ignore either the rising seas or the rising citizens’ movements demanding action,” said Lucas. “It’s especially significant given the divisiveness around Brexit and how vital it is that we put aside any political or other differences we might have to respond to the climate emergency. “All the main opposition parties have agreed to sit down and listen to her and the UK climate strikers she has inspired, and I think this could be a defining moment for how the UK responds to the climate and wider environmental crises.”"

By Ed Caryl
There have been many worried papers and articles on tropical rainforest destruction (including by this author), and this destruction’s effect on CO2 sequestration. There are countervailing forces in play, however. Tropical forests cut for “slash and burn” farming are typically allowed to return to the forest state as the soil is depleted after a few years of harvesting crops, unless the ground is reserved for permanent pasture. The crops themselves replace part of the biosphere. In temperate forests, clear-cuts are replanted. Forest regeneration typically takes from 40 to over a hundred years, but the average is probably about 80 years. An evergreen forest destroyed by forest fire that I helped replant as a Boy Scout 60 years ago was recently harvested and replanted again. Another plot in the same area that was clear-cut 90 years ago, was naturally re-seeded and harvested again three years ago. Most of that carbon was sequestered into homes.
CO2 fertilization improves biosphere growth. Present CO2 levels are more than 100 ppm over pre-industrial levels, and are allowing about 15% increased primary biosphere production. The problem is that both forest destruction and CO2 fertilization are not known very accurately for the biome as a whole. The guesses in the literature range from 1.5 Gigatons to 4 Gigatons carbon annually released to the atmosphere from forest destruction, and 10 to 20% CO2 fertilization. In the following figures, 2 Gigatons forest destruction to date and 1 Gigaton future destruction have been used, and 15% CO2 fertilization for 100 ppm CO2 increase.

Figure 1 is a plot of total biosphere assuming 2 Gigatons forest annually burned to date and 1 Gigaton burned annually in the future, along with 15% fertilization for each 100 ppm CO2 increase, plus a 1.25% annual regrowth of tropical forests.

The result is a declining biosphere where destruction exceeds growth until about 1966. But then there is an increasing growth rate since as the CO2 level increases, where growth exceeds destruction.
The amount of carbon taken up by the oceans is another factor that is not known very accurately. The current “consensus” guess is that the ocean takes up half of the carbon that is emitted by man’s activities. Here is my attempt to chart land and ocean CO2 flux over time from 1946 to the present and projecting into the future to 2075. The resulting atmospheric CO2 is also plotted. The historical fossil carbon emissions are plotted, with a future increase to 10 Gigatons annually. The land numbers are based on the data used in notrickszone.com/ and the above 15% figure for CO2 fertilization. The ocean CO2 uptake numbers are based on this paper and are linearly projected into the future.

Figure 2 is a plot of CO2 (blue curve, left scale), biosphere carbon uptake with CO2 fertilization (red curve, right scale), and ocean carbon uptake (green line, right scale).
If the world holds fossil carbon emissions to less than 10 Gigatons per year, CO2 should never exceed 430 ppm, and will begin falling after mid-century. If we put modest effort into tropical forest preservation, and replanting temperate forests, along with other biome improvements, we might stop the increase at an even lower figure. We don’t need to reduce carbon emissions. We will never see CO2 doubling. No one has projected the impact of CO2 biosphere fertilization on the CO2 increase in the atmosphere. NASA has projected that CO2 will be 550 to 800 ppm by the end of the century. This could only be true if the biosphere is severely damaged by forest destruction.

Life is beginning to lose all meaning and purpose for some, as their religion collapses. For the AGW alarmists, it was so good despising and feeling superior to all the unenlightened flat-earthers and the rest of the planet-destroying humanity, and punishing them for their behaviour.
Sadly, the infliction of punishment is one primary element that makes the AGW religion so attractive for some, especially its leaders. In this religion it’s actually a virtue to seek ways to punish and control people instead of loving them. Those who join it are promised rescue, esteem and acceptance.

Inflicting punishment is a position of power. And when it comes to inflicting punishment, there’s an eerie thing about how people just queue up to do it – especially if there’s a social mechanism in place to reward it. Psychological experiments have confirmed this time and again, just as a recent French experiment on inflicting torture on pleading victims shows:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYHRq7oMnZQ
http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1972981,00.html
In the experiment, those who inflicted the punishment eventually came back to their senses and were later horrified to see how they had been duped into taking it to such extremes. They even had to be psychologically debriefed.

"Because I am concerned about inequality and about the environment, I am usually classed as a progressive, a liberal. But it seems to me that what I care most about is preserving a world that bears some resemblance to the past: a world with some ice at the top and bottom and the odd coral reef in between; a world where people are connected to the past and future (and to one another) instead of turned into obsolete software. And those seem to me profoundly conservative positions. Meanwhile, oil companies and tech barons strike me as deeply radical, willing to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, eager to confer immortality.  There is a native conservatism in human beings that resists such efforts, a visceral sense of what’s right or dangerous, rash or proper. You needn’t understand every nuance of germline engineering or the carbon cycle to understand why monkeying around on this scale might be a bad idea. And indeed, polling suggests that most people instinctively oppose, say, living forever or designing babies, just as they want government action to stabilise the climate. Luckily, we have two relatively new inventions that could prove decisive to solving global warming before it destroys the planet. One is the solar panel, and the other is the nonviolent movement. Obviously, they are not the same sort of inventions: the solar panel (and its cousins, the wind turbine and the lithium-ion battery) is hardware, while the ability to organise en masse for change is more akin to software. Indeed, even to call nonviolent campaigning a “technology” will strike some as odd. Each is still in its infancy; we deploy them, but fairly blindly, finding out by trial and error their best uses. Both come with inherent limits: neither is as decisive or as immediately powerful as, say, a nuclear weapon or a coal-fired power plant. But both are transformative nonetheless – and, crucially, the power they wield is human in scale. Before we can best employ these technologies, we need to address the two most insidious ideas deployed in defence of the status quo. The first is that there is no need for mass resistance because each of us should choose for ourselves the future we want. The second is that there is no possibility of resistance because the die is already cast. Choice is the mantra that unites people of many political persuasions. Conservatives say, “you’re not the boss of me”, when it comes to paying taxes; liberals say it when the topic is marijuana. The easiest, laziest way to dispense with a controversy is to say: “Do what you want; don’t tell me what to do.”  If “let anyone do what they want” is a flawed argument, then “no one can stop them anyway” is an infuriating one. Insisting that some horror is inevitable no matter what you do is the response of those who don’t want to be bothered trying to stop it, and I’ve heard it too often to take it entirely seriously. I remember, for instance, when investigative reporters proved that Exxon had known all about global warming and had covered up that knowledge. Plenty of people on the professionally jaded left told me, in one form or another, “of course they did”, or “all corporations lie”, or “nothing will ever happen to them anyway”. This kind of knowing cynicism is a gift to the Exxons of the world. Happily, far more people reacted with usefully naive outrage: before too long, people were comparing the oil giants with the tobacco companies, and some of the biggest cities in the US were suing them for damages. We don’t know yet precisely how it will end, only that giving them a pass because of their power makes no sense. Innovation doesn’t scare me. I think that if we back off the most crazed frontiers of technology, we can still figure out how to keep humans healthy, safe, productive – and human. Not everyone agrees. Some harbour a deep pessimism about human nature which I confess, as an American in the age of Donald Trump, occasionally seems sound. Of all the arguments for unhindered technological growth, the single saddest (in the sense that it just gives up on human beings) comes from the Oxford don Julian Savulescu. In essence he contends that, left to themselves, democracies can’t solve climate change, “for in order to do so a majority of their voters must support the adoption of substantial restrictions on their excessively consumerist lifestyle, and there is no indication they would be willing to make such sacrifices”. Also, our ingrained suspicion of outsiders keeps us from working together globally. And so, faced with the need to move quickly, we should “morally bio-enhance” our children or, more likely, use genetic engineering, so they will cooperate.  This is roughly akin to “geoengineering the atmosphere” to prevent climate change – some people, having given up on taming the fossil-fuel companies, want to instead pump the atmosphere full of sulphur to block incoming solar radiation. Both cases are based on the premise that we humans won’t rise to the occasion. I hope Savulescu seriously underestimates the power of both technology and democracy – of the solar panel and of nonviolence. I believe we have the means at hand to solve our problems short of turning our children into saintly robots – which, in any event, wouldn’t do a thing to solve climate change, given that by the time these morally improved youths had grown into positions of power, the damage would long since have been done. And I’m convinced Savulescu is wrong about people’s selfishness presenting the main obstacle to solving climate change: around the world, polling shows that people are not just highly concerned about global warming, but also willing to pay a price to solve it. Americans, for instance, said in 2017 that they were willing to see their energy bills rise 15% and have the money spent on clean energy programmes – that’s about in line with the size of the carbon taxes that national groups have been campaigning for. The reason we don’t have a solution to climate change has less to do with the greed of the great, unengineered unwashed than with the greed of the almost unbelievably small percentage of people at the top of the energy heap. That is to say, the Koch brothers and the Exxon execs have never been willing to take a 15% slice off their profits, not when they could spend a much smaller share of their winnings corrupting the political debate with rolls of cash. If you wanted to “morally enhance” anyone, that’s where you’d start – if there are Grinches in need of hearts, it’s pretty obvious who should be at the front of the line. But let’s not win that way. Let’s operate on the assumption that human beings are not grossly defective. That we’re capable of acting together to do remarkable things. • Bill McKibben is an environmentalist, author and journalist This is an edited extract from Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? by Bill McKibben (Headline)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJournal Nature can no longer be bothered to check facts anymore. Bad enough that they rarely subject global warming climate papers to real, rigorous peer-review, and so now even the most obvious rubbish gets by.
In a Nature comment, Professor Turney seems to be responding in part to harsh articles published by Cambridge University News and the The Mail on Sunday. Both these media outlets cited veteran polar explorer Robert Headland, who said “an ice-strengthened ship was totally unsuitable for the area where Turney conducted his expedition“.
Headland also accused Turney of carrying out the expedition “on the cheap” and that he had “needlessly taken many risks“.
In Turney’s Nature reaction to all the criticism, This was no pleasure cruise, Turney writes the following (my emphasis):
For the past six weeks on board the Russian icebreaker MV Akademik Shokalskiy, my colleague Chris Fogwill and I have led a team of scientists, science communicators and volunteers on a voyage from the New Zealand subantarctic islands to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.”
Turney claims that the ship is an icebreaker when clearly it is not. That’s a falsehood, if not an outright lie. The fact is that the Akademik Shokalskiy is simply reinforced for travel in icy areas and has only the lowly UL rating, meaning it is suitable for “independent navigation in the Arctic in summer and autumn in light ice conditions and in the non-arctic freezing seas all the year round“, see www.globalsecurity.org.
In the Nature comment Turney also writes:

That is the reality of polar science. It is difficult. Almost every season, ships get caught in sea ice, teams lose communications and planes are sometimes tragically lost.”
All the more reason for taking a real icebreaker – which he didn’t. Gee, the whole time I thought it was an icebreaker!
Turney is proving to be a basket-case
The Turney story is becoming ever more comical. What we have here is a humiliated scientist who wants everyone to believe the Antarctic is melting away, yet claims he went down there in what he thinks is an ice breaker to break through ice; says he knew that conditions there were treacherous, yet took his family and tourists along anyway; says that conditions there are unpredictable, but claims that the sea ice and wind unpredictability caught him by surprise; says the expedition was no pleasure cruise, yet had a fully-stocked bar and we saw pictures of partying almost daily.
Even funnier is that Turney is now trying to fool himself and others into believing that he has done the whole world a huge favor in that he created a “remarkable rekindling of public interest in science and exploration” and that he will wow the world with “the quality of the research“.
After this fiasco (even Andy Revkin of the New York Times calls it just that) it’s clear that Turney is someone who is incapable of acknowledging errors. Worse, and even scarier, he and Nature seem to be telling us that he deserves a medal for what he has done.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace is back in the media, right where it likes to be. This is what brings in the donations. But this time they are not finding the headlines quite to their liking as 30 of its members are now being accused of piracy by Russian authorities. Piracy? You mean the peaceful and angelic Greenpeace activists may have criminally behaved like pirates?
Greenpeace is arguing that the piracy charge is nonsense. Piracy, after all, “involves weapons and taking control of another vessel” and that isn’t what the activists were trying to do, at least that’s what the mother of a detained Greenpeace activist is claiming.
Al Jazeera writes: “Several activists scaled the oil platform in the Barents Sea to denounce Russia’s plans to drill in the pristine Arctic.”
Unfortunately for the activists, Greenpeace has a long history of taking the law into its own hands and putting other people’s lives in real danger. Many of their actions do involve real violence. Today Ottawa Citizen.com quotes the mother of one of the protesters: “Nicole Paul said her son has travelled the globe the last seven years to defend his ideals and that he once spent a night in prison in Scotland before being released without charge.” No doubt from that the kid probably learned he can get away with mischief simply by fancying himself as a hero who’s rescuing the world.
Russia throws the book at world-saving activists
I have my doubts about the Greenpeace activists being peaceful. My guess is that plenty of video footage was taken during the whole publicity-seeking stunt. And now that the Russian authorities have reviewed all the material, they’ve decided to throw the book at the Greenpeace out-of-control brats. One of the protesters was a Russian free-lance photographer, according to news reports.
Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said the charges are being laid against those “whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience.” The media also portray the activists as innocent and peaceful protesters, obviously relying solely on Greenpeace statements and not bothering to really check the story.
About three years ago I wrote a piece on Greenpeace violence. What happened in the Arctic waters just seems to fit an all-too-familiar pattern. This time they picked the wrong people to mess with.
Greenpeace has a history of seeking violent confrontation
What follows are some examples and videos of “peaceful” Greenpeace action. Now imagine if the Tea Party or climate skeptics behaved like that.
First let’s recall how a leading Greenpeace official made threats directed at global warming skeptics. Prison Planet writes (my emphasis):
An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda, while ominously threatening climate skeptics, ‘we know where you live.'”
Next is a video of a Greenpeace ship “peacefully” ramming a Japanese vessel:

Next is an angry and threatening Greenpeace-brainwashed kid, trained to hate those who have a different opinion:

Poor kid will probably have to spend a lifetime in therapy.
Next is Greenpeace resisting arrest in Rotterdam:

Here’s Greenpeace trying to breach security at a G8 meeting. In this fracas some “peaceful” activists were injured:

Also here’s another “peaceful” activist injured by French fishermen, who obviously had become fed up with being harassed:

Just some examples. There are many more out there for sure.
Sure people have the right to protest, but not to put yourself above the law and illegally, and at times dangerously, violate other people’s space.  There are civilized ways of protest.
Greenpeace activists do behave very much like pirates at times, and they do put other people’s lives in very real danger.
Of course their target is not to capture and steal property, rather it is to capture attention – lots of it. The real cash flows in once their on-board filmmakers cut and edit all the raw footage and get it out to the media and television for cash-generating publicity.
What was Greenpeace management thinking sending a group of young, naïve protesters up to the Russian Arctic? Are they using them as pawns for generating cash and publicity? Seems to me that Greenpeace has lots of questions to answer.
If you have a link to a clip of “peaceful” Greenpeace planet rescuers, do post it!

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago I wrote about an article published in the print copy of Swiss magazine Weltwoche.
That same article also had a side feature story on the myth of climate science consensus titled: Skeptics On The Rise – by Alex Reichmuth.
Reichmuth writes that the claim of a scientific consensus in climate science is nothing but an illusion and that attempts to assert it has become a “ritual“. Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Ban Ki Moon and Naomi Oreskes have all tried to declare the climate science debate as ended. Yet, Weltwoche writes, the skeptics and dissidents are refusing to go away and that their ranks are swelling. Reichmuth cites almost a half a dozen petitions signed by scientists over the years refuting that the science is settled.
And skepticism is not isolated to Europe and USA, but is also found in Japan, Russia. Website Popular Technology.net lists 1100 peer-reviewed publications that support the arguments of skeptics.
Weltwoche also quotes German physicist Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, who wrote in his book Energie und Klima:
Climate skeptics outnumber climate alarmists and have much greater credibility”.
Reichmuth then focuses on John Cook’s survey, calling it one-sided” and that it uses a “trick” to produce the appearance of consensus. Stefan Rahmstorf used the same tactic in a recent interview with the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung:



<!--

That our greenhouse gases are leading to global warming belongs to the foundation of climate science.”
Reichmuth then adds that ‘climate scientists’ use the trick of trying to make skeptics appear as incompetent by claiming they aren’t real climate scientists who can be trusted. Yet Reichmuth points out that experts from other fields are indeed very well equipped to expose errors in climate science.
Even academics who have never researched climate are able to make valuable contributions. This is illustrated by Canadian mining specialist Stephen McIntyre. He showed that the hockey stick curve from leading IPCC scientists was based on a false statistical approach.”
Another example is the duo of Prof Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s IPCC critical book, Die kalte Sonne, which reignited the climate debate in Germany last year.
Reichmuth concludes:
‘The science is settled,’ Al Gore has been claiming for years. Yet there is absolutely no trace of consensus in climate science.”
Weltwoche’s report not only tells us that climate science consensus is a myth, but it also shows that the media in Europe are beginning to add to the dissent.

"Scotland Yard has defended its response to the rolling protests in London that have caused disruption to millions and pushed climate change towards the top of the national news agenda. The Metropolitan police has come under increasing pressure to crack down on the Extinction Rebellion demonstrators who have blocked transport networks in the capital in recent days; not least from the home secretary, Sajid Javid, who has urged officers to “take a firm stance”.  On Thursday, the force said the demonstrations were proving such a drain on resources that police were having to release under investigation many of those arrested, even if that meant they simply returned to the protest sites, while Easter leave was being cancelled for officers who were being asked to work 12-hour shifts. Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate. It came on the same day as the protesters said their next target would be the UK’s largest airport – Heathrow. Police said the demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest and said there was no legal justification for more draconian measures, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful. “Those arrested are then taken into custody which again means our officers are off the streets temporarily while that process takes place,” the statement said. Police added: “We have been asked why we are not using tactics such as containment, physically and forcibly stopping the protesters from moving around. The simple answer is we have no legal basis to do so. These are peaceful protesters; while disruptive, their actions are not violent towards police, themselves or other members of the public. “We are looking at other tactics, such as tighter police cordons, but again that is resource-intensive in terms of officer numbers and, more often than not, it just shifts the protesters to another location nearby and does not assist in reopening roads.” Police said that, by Thursday night, more than 500 people had been arrested in connection with the protests; primarily on suspicion of minor offences. Ten of those have been charged with breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act, under which police can impose conditions on public assemblies to prevent serious disruption, and obstruction of the highway. Police added: “It is better for us to keep our resources and custody capacity moving and flexible than leave protesters sitting in cells for up to 12 hours before going to court for what, although highly disruptive, are lower level offences. “So, everyone else arrested has been released under investigation and will be brought back to be formally interviewed and charged as appropriate in due course. We are aware that means some protesters immediately return to the area to resume their activities; those people will be arrested again.” Scotland Yard warned the protesters they face a “robust response” if they target Heathrow on Friday. The force said it has “strong plans” in place, while the airport said it is “working with the authorities” to address the issue. Earlier on Thursday, Javid held talks with the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick. He said: “Everyone has the right to protest peacefully … But people do not have the right to break the law.” Javid added: “Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law ... I expect the police to take a firm stance and use the full force of the law.” The Met said it considered London’s Marble Arch a legal protest site but that three others – affected areas Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge – were not and that conditions prohibiting demonstrations there had been extended until Sunday, Saturday and Friday, respectively."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like Lewandowsky has bungled again.
At Klimazwiebel Dennis Bray reacts to a poorly thought-out attack by Lewandowsky.
Bray writes:
Lewandowsky, in reference to the 2003 Survey of Climate Scientists, accuses me of violating ‘all internet survey methodological standards by not recording dates, times, and IP numbers of respondents’.  [….] So please, for all of the conspiracy theory (of any persuasion) critics of the surveys of climate scientists, try to know a little of what you speak before you speak. Apparently Lewandowsky complained that there was ‘no way to check or verify the integrity of the data’ and therefore the data was probably ‘useless’. Lewandowsky said that the study should not have been published ‘without the authors demonstrating the integrity of their data’.  Steve McIntrye goes on to point out that the work of Lewandowsky is not without blemish.”
Lewandowsky and his kind must be more desperate than we thought. When you finally stoop to going after fellow scientists in the way that Lewandowsky has, it represents a “push-comes-to-shove” mode – a last, desperate Hail Mary attempt to salvage the endeavor. Seems Lewandowsky has reached that phase.

This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
That’s right, journalists are being encouraged to throw investigative reporting and balance overboard, i.e. to take up the role of propaganda outlet for press releases put out by the Climate Science Politburo. The panelists go on to warn:

Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life.
Yes, the alarmist zealots think the very basis of life hinges on this.
A few journalists in Germany have actually practiced journalism on the issue of climate science recently, and this has infuriated the Established Climate “Science” Community. They too are threatened with the Big Cutoff. You see, although journalists have the competence to report critically on “rudimentary” issues like economics, finance, politics, law,  civics and so on, climate science is far too complex with too much at stake to leave in their hands.
Not only are the alarmist zealots calling for a suspension of democracy, claiming casus belli, but now they’re also demanding that journalists abandon journalism altogether. What gate-name ought I assign to this one? Dummkopf Journalism-gate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Bundesnachrichtendienst (Federal Intelligence Service) BND is Germany’s version of the CIA, and it has just released a report on the threat posed by climate change and CO2 emissions. It claims that the conflicts of the future will be over CO2 emission allowances!

Image: Cropped from photo by A.Fiedler, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic license.
First, readers need to be cautioned that such reports issued by intelligence agencies (always eagerly released to the public) often times have very little to do with reality, and most are designed to manipulate public sentiment. Those familiar with climate science will quickly put the report on par with reports of Martians preparing to attack the planet. In simple terms: it’s a lot of BS.
Germany’s leading political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) wrote yesterday a piece titled: Bundesnachrichtendienst sounds the alarm on climate change.
The good news: “Energy supply security no longer an issue”
Before getting into the scary CO2 climate conflict details from the BND report, there are some very good news – news we’ve suspected all along – especially amid all the reports on the discoveries of huge shale gas and crude oil reserves popping up almost daily. The BND report writes (my emphasis):
The conflicts of the future now revolve around carbon dioxide. Energy supply security is no longer an issue.”
The bad news however, so projects the BND, is that future conflicts will be about “who will be able to emit how much CO2.” Countries will be fighting over CO2 emission rights, BND scenarios suggest.
Now that there are no longer any natural developments left to fight over like water, oil, food, living space, natural resources, etc., the German government seems to be creating an artificial global conflict by designating CO2 as a pollutant that mustn’t be emitted. Too bad the BND never bothered reading the latest scientific literature on global temperatures and CO2 climate sensitivity. Expect the German government to eagerly use the BND report to justify more intervention into private lives.
Wikipedia writes that the “BND acts as an early warning system to alert the German government to threats to German interests from abroad. It depends heavily on wiretapping and electronic surveillance of international communications.” Somehow from these activities the BND has concluded that climate is the worst threat.

Green Party officials immediately seized on the report. The FAZ quotes Green Party chief Simone Peter: “Whoever keeps using fossil energies such as coal and oil, accelerates climate change, exacerbates international conflicts, and is messing with the coming generations of the future.“
The BND writes that the problem is that emerging countries will emit increasing amounts of CO2 as they develop, thus quickly exhausting the world’s emission allowances, which in turn will lead to international conflict.
Another problem is America’s booming shale gas revolution, which will act to depress prices worldwide. Consequently renewable sources will have no chance to compete. Cheap US coal is already being exported by the USA to Germany, throwing sand into the gears of the country’s renewable energy transition. The FAZ adds:
And the earlier worries of oil and gas reserves running out are gone. [..] The reason for this is new technologies that have made it possible to exploit previously in accessible reserves.”
Again the historical pattern of false doomsday scenarios is once again clear and confirmed…developing, unexpected technology repeatedly canceling earlier seemingly certain projections of disaster. Five years ago few people believed the world had enough reserves of fossil fuels to last 50 years. That was one of the argumentation pillars used by green energy proponents. Today we find ourselves practically drowning in fossil fuels. Prices are in a free fall.
Any journalist investing 30 minutes time researching earlier projections made by intelligence services globally will find most of them at one time or another issued doomsday reports of “fossil fuels running out and global conflict erupting as a result.”
Expert: CO2 conflict claims are “pure comedy”
These earlier doomsday projections probably were legitimate at the time, as it did appear reserves were in decline: The data suggested this to some extent. But the latest projections that CO2 will lead to conflict are not even based on data and observations, but on bogus computer scenarios. They are utterly baseless.
In an email, geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning called the BND’s latest CO2 conflict claims “pure comedy” and “brain-washing”.
The BND also states that in the future there is going to be a “CO2 disposal problem” because CO2 concentrations are expected to reach the critical 450 ppm level, a level that activist scientists say may cause the climate “to tip”.

"Richard Di Natale has warned Bill Shorten should ignore the Greens at his peril when it comes to climate change action. The Greens leader committed to hold Labor to account in the Senate on its pledge to legislate the coalition’s national energy guarantee.  Di Natale said he had reached out to the Labor leader, after the opposition committed to the Neg as a way to end the climate wars. Asked if he was genuine about cooperation or would stick to pure positions, Di Natale said the ball was in Shorten’s court. “I have reached out to Bill Shorten. It is up to him to decide whether he wants to continue to ignore the Greens. He does that at his peril,” Di Natale told ABC TV on Sunday. “At the moment, what he’s doing is adopting a weaker policy on climate than the policy he took in 2016, which is weaker again than the 2013 policy.” Earlier this week, the Greens MP Adam Bandt wouldn’t say whether the minor party will torpedo Labor’s policy if it is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, as the party did in 2009 when it rejected Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme. “The Greens in the Senate will work hard, cooperatively, pushing Labor, holding them to account and making sure we do what needs to be done,” Di Natale said. The Victorian senator seized on a report in the Age newspaper revealing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority believes limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5C or below “is critical to maintain the ecological function of the Great Barrier Reef”. “We’re on track to exceed that,” Di Natale said. “The scientists are saying that the Great Barrier Reef is gone if we continue to burn coal and ship it off overseas.” While the major parties have flagged they may pause electioneering over Easter, Di Natale said he’ll be part of an anti-Adani coal mine convoy across the country. “We won’t be doing anything on Anzac Day. We will be campaigning hard through the Easter period,” Di Natale said. Di Natale believes the Melbourne blue ribbon Liberal seats of Higgins and Kooyong are “winnable for the Greens”. “What stronger message can the people of Higgins and Kooyong send to the Liberal party than to elect Greens in those seats and say: ‘We are sick of the climate denialism of the Liberal party’,” he said. He said bullying problems within the Victorian Greens ranks have been sorted. “We’ve reformed some of our conflict resolution processes, our candidate management processes, and we’re in good shape,” Di Natale said."

"Bea Ruiz, a veteran progressive coordinator, has been telling scores of first-time climate change protesters they face being harassed and beaten by police next week. Most seem happy with the deal. “I told a 72-year-old volunteer that he will probably be targeted by police,” said Ruiz, who is based in Eureka, California and is helping organize the first US rollout of Extinction Rebellion, a group founded in the UK that has grabbed attention through disruptive protests leading to mass arrests.  “He paused and then said: ‘OK, yes.’” Following a foray into New York in January, several thousand protestors will aim to cause similar mischief in dozens of US cities next week. “This is a coordinated rebellion that targets industry and government indefinitely, to shut the country down,” Ruiz said. “In my 30 years plus of activism I’ve never seen so many everyday people worried in such a visceral way, for themselves, their children, their grandchildren. It’s unprecedented.” Some activists hope the arrival of Extinction Rebellion will be a watershed moment for the US environmental movement, shifting it from what they see as a tepid response to the cavalcade of disasters threatening the livability of the planet. Extinction Rebellion is aimed at spurring a muscular, punkish outpouring of civil disobedience, snarling cities and frogmarching politicians towards meaningful action. In the UK, Extinction Rebellion members have caused uproar by halting traffic on bridges in central London, stripping naked in parliament and blockading the BBC. Last week, protestors glued themselves to the entrance of a fracking conference. “Troublemakers change the world,” said Roger Hallam, one the group’s founders. Elsewhere in Europe, Swedish teen Greta Thunberg sparked a series of walkout strikes by schoolchildren over the sclerotic response by adults to climate change. Such sustained protest, in countries where planet-warming emissions are sharply falling and gasoline-powered cars are increasingly banned from city streets, is unusual in the US, where the Trump administration has promoted fossil fuels, dismantled climate regulations and overseen a rise in emissions. American protesters have shown willingness to chain themselves to oil drills or, in the case of the Keystone XL pipeline, be rounded up outside the White House. Native Americans, regularly subject to the collateral damage of extractive industry, rose up in the face of savage policing during the Standing Rock protests of 2017. But some activists feel forceful confrontation needs to become the norm. “The mainstream environmental movement has been asking so little of people here, whereas we are saying, ‘We are in danger and we are asking you to act accordingly, to put your lives on the line,’” said Ruiz. “Very commonly, the big environmental groups will send emails saying, ‘Donate $5 today, call your congressman’ and then ask for very symbolic action where people won’t be held for long. “We want to remind people that people in civil resistance in the past have been willing to risk their lives. The Freedom Riders [of the 1960s civil rights movement] signed their wills before they got on the buses. We have no time left, we have no time for incrementalism.” Differences in policing approaches could be a factor in the varying intensity of protests. Extinction Rebellion, which cites nonviolent disobedience in the mold of Mahatma Gandhi, triggered dozens of arrests but no fights when activists shut down five London bridges in November. By contrast, police in North Dakota deployed water cannon and rubber bullets against protestors at Standing Rock. “We are incredibly lucky in England to have a police force that isn’t perfect but is honourable and maintains peaceful protests,” said Tiana Jacout, a UK-based Extinction Rebellion organizer. “You can be willing to martyr yourself by going to prison here but it’s a different ball game in America. “It’s easier to protest when you’re not being brutally beaten. I just hope they can get the revolutionary bug again.” Some experienced climate campaigners reject the idea that their actions have not matched the fervor shown by their European counterparts, pointing to a raft of marches and other actions to decry Trump’s disdain for climate science and its dire implications for millions of Americans who risk being upended by flooding, wildfires, extreme heat and water insecurity. Trump’s term has also seen cities such as San Francisco declare a “climate emergency” and the emergence of the Green New Deal, a Democrat resolution urging a second world war-level effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Activists are nagged by the timed nature of the challenge, however: according to a landmark United Nations report the world has little more than a decade to avert disastrous ravages from climate change. “I think it’s crazy that we have to do this in order to get politicians to act on the greatest crisis we face but manifestly we do,” said Bill McKibben, the co-founder of climate group 350.org and a Guardian contributor who estimates he has been put in handcuffs “seven or eight times”. “Nonviolent direct action is never an end in itself, but carefully used it underlines the moral urgency of the moment. I think it mostly needs to become bigger, everywhere. And dramatic action – conducted with care, so that people aren’t turned off – has a serious role to play in that.”"

Aurora Australis on standby as a precautionary measure 
Xue Long notified AMSA at 1pm AEDT this afternoon it has concerns about their ability to move through heavy ice in the area. The Aurora Australis has been placed on standby by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s (AMSA) Rescue Coordination Centre Australia (RCC Australia) to remain in open water in the area as a precautionary measure. The Xue Long has advised RCC Australia that it will attempt to manoeuvre through the ice when tidal conditions are most suitable during the early hours of 4 January 2014.
There is no immediate danger to personnel on board the Xue Long.”
Prof Turney tweets he is gutted by the news. I guess he can’t believe that climate warming could trap so many ships in sea ice. His communication manager just announced that all the new sea ice is caused by global warming, see my last post.

1) Hans von Storch at Klimazwiebel comments of the WBGU.
Hans is known for his direct speech and speaking his mind. Yet, I found a comment he left at his blog even more direct than usual – about the German FDP party blocking the re-assignment of the WBGU, the advisory board of alarmist “experts” who are tasked to advise the German government of matters concerning the environment and climate.
For me the WBGU is essentially a club of alarmists that is suffering from planet-rescue fantasies and a chronic overstepping of competence. Actually it is a good thing that a political group is for once requesting a reining in.”
Unfortunately the latest news is that the FDP party has ended its resistance to the re-appointment of the WBGU members. So they will still be there, yet no one says they will have to be listened to.
2. Stefan Rahmstorf concedes natural factors (at least when it cools).
At the German RealClimate sister-blog klimalounge, bedwetter in-chief Stefan Rahmstorf boasts about the Klimalounge site getting a million hits since coming online 5 years ago (NTZ reached that mark after just a year, and WUWT gets three times that every month). Anyway, while boasting about that, Rahmstorf brings up the global temperature stagnation, telling readers not to worry, the climate catastrophe is coming. For those who question this:

The answer is still the same as in 2008: no, global warming is unfortunately not over and has not slowed down significantly, the deviations from a steady, continuous warming trend are part of the usual short-term fluctuations, which are caused by, among other things, El Niño, ocean circulation fluctuations and solar activity.”
(My emphasis) At least he finally admits natural factors, though only for the short-term. So you see how simple it is for them.  When it cools, it’s because of natural factors. But when it warms it’s all because of CO2. Not surprisingly, this is how they’ve rigged their models. And so you warmists can all go on wetting your beds without worry.
3. Joe Bastardi on climate science at his Saturday Summary of the 4th of May (see video, right side bar). The warmists he says are only making excuses when they start changing the terminology:
You folks have to understand that it’s been getting cold in a lot of places and that it hasn’t been reported on. And of course, the value, if you want to call it that, in this climate fight that is going on, the value is that it’s waking some people up in America. They’re saying, ‘Where in the heck did this come from?’ And again, I don’t think you can change the playing field from global warming to climate change. You know, you just change the terminology – you know you’re wrong about what is going on, and you’re giving us excuses. So that’s what I think. Get used to it because that’s what nature does.”
4. Neil Cavuto in a Fox News interview with Joe Bastardi on Al Gore’s latest unhinged performance in Hollywood, at the end of the clip:
He’s nuts, by the way. I just think he’s nuts. But that’s just me.”

Suddenly all the salivating among the alarmists has turned to gloom – no Arctic meltdown on which to feast upon this year.
But hope is still holding out among the alarmists as there is a chance some freak storm or something will scatter the sea ice and send the 2013 curve downwards to a near record low. But if 2013’s current course continues, then it will wind up closer 2005-2006 levels. That of course would be a major setback for the alarmists, who then would have to search elsewhere for disaster stories this fall. The next 10 – 14 days will be decisive.
Already we are getting close to being a solid 1 million sq. km over last year, as to most datasets. The DMI even shows us approaching 1.5 million sq. km over last year. If that keeps up, it’s going to be painful for the alarmists.
As far as Antarctica is concerned, record highs are being recorded daily. Here we have absolute dead silence from the media and purveyors of gloom.
As the chances for an Arctic sea ice melt disaster fade with each passing day, expect the focus of the alarmists to increasingly shift to the hurricane season.

"Your coverage of the Extinction Rebellion protest has been exemplary. In line with their demand to “tell the truth”, perhaps headlines about climate change affecting us right now could take a less celebratory tone (Temperature records tumble as UK basks in Easter sunshine, 22 April).Caroline BettertonChichester, West Sussex • I cannot top Emily Maitlis’s claim that she once spotted Bill Clinton reading the Kama Sutra in a hotel bookshop (Report, 19 April).

"I hope Extinction Rebellion pushes climate chaos to the top of the political agenda, but Ben Smoke is right that glorifying arrest won’t advance the climate cause (Journal, 16 April). As well as diverting effort into battles with the criminal justice system, it distracts from thousands of ways to decarbonise the economy: pension funds, insurance companies and banks control $400tn in assets, making decisions daily about where to invest, as well as influencing company boards, as Larry Elliott points out (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers to take climate change seriously, 16 April). Local authorities shape our environment (and own £400bn in assets), and soon voters will decide who should run them. Every employer, school and household can make decisions that turn away from chaos.  The suffragettes’ battle for the vote is celebrated as a great victory for direct action, but 100 years later the struggle for women’s equality is still being waged within countless institutions. Creating lasting change takes political skill, as well as passion and persistence. For democracies to solve difficult problems like climate change and inequality, schools need to teach practical politics as a basic skill.Titus AlexanderAuthor of Practical Politics: Lessons in Power and Democracy; convener, Democracy Matters • I agree with Ben Smoke that it’s important not to fetishise the number of arrests in relation to current protests. Extinction Rebellion places too much emphasis on number of arrests. Think the government will negotiate on matters of substance? Think again. I speak as one taking part in the actions this week. The urgency is real, and people need to know the truth. But it will take profound public pressure on other parts of our system that hold us in stasis – vested interests, fossil fuel companies particularly, MPs and ministers, the media, finance, and local government. We need to listen to our allies and work with them, community groups and NGOs particularly. Extinction Rebellion’s sophistication around direct action will need to be matched by effective political strategy to achieve the kind of changes needed.Gill WestcottCheriton Bishop, Exeter • Thirty years ago I was chair of the Green party’s media committee. Caroline Lucas was the party’s press officer. We were working on the 1989 European election campaign – the one where the Greens won 15% of the vote but no seats (no PR then). Two days ago, I visited three of the four Extinction Rebellion sites and talked to activists. They were deeply impressive, committed people – non-violent, refusing to blame and shame, empathic, compassionate and universalist (Climate protesters target transport and Corbyn, as disruption hits traders, 18 April). Everything the Green party said 30 years ago is coming to pass. The planet can’t wait much longer. I commend the bravery, passion and wit of Extinction rebels. Recognised routes of influencing events have failed. Non-violent direct action led to the birth of civil rights for all in the US. Maybe it can lead to a Green New Deal here. This may be our last chance.Lyn DadeTwickenham, Middlesex • I read the article by Mark Carney, François Villeroy de Galhau and Frank Elderson of the Network for Greening the Financial System (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, 17 April) on the way to an investor meeting, which I had to cancel due to the Extinction Rebellion protests at Oxford Circus. I’m raising investment for a reusable plastic-free biodegradable and compostable paint tin, to stop plastic single-use items ending up in landfill or the ocean in their hundreds of millions. I don’t disagree with the aims of the protest, but targeting all the business community is not right. Some of us get it and are doing something about it; please, activists, focus your protests on those who aren’t.Kim ThongerFinedon, Northamptonshire • The letter about HS2 from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram (19 April), mayors of Manchester and Liverpool, might be persuasive if it were not written while Extinction Rebellion takes action against climate catastrophe and David Attenborough delivers his powerful piece on BBC One. The mayors’ letter is peppered with words and phrases that mean growth: economic potential, released capacity and, of course, the yearned-for “powerhouse”. But what the young people of Extinction Rebellion are saying is: how can you offer us a future based on growth? What is the point of releasing capacity if we run out of the planet’s fundamental resources: water, clean air, space to live that will not be flooded with seawater, soil in which food can grow? What we need is a plan – a transport plan, an everything plan – that considers every single aspect in relation to the threat to these resources.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire Tall glass buildings have a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, Journal, 17 April). They produce more CO2 per metre squared in construction and operation for every higher floor they support. Their huge energy demand spikes at the hottest/coldest times of day/year, driving grids to the brink of collapse. In future extreme heatwaves, like that of 2003, they can cause power outages across whole regions and resulting citizen deaths. They increase pedestrian discomfort, even killing people with the superwinds created around their structures. When they burn catastrophically, people above the fire may not survive. They reflect heat on to adjacent buildings, driving up their energy consumption and discomfort in those opposite. They shade whole urban areas from winter sun and the ability to generate solar energy in their shadow. They can destroy the mental peace of neighbourhoods by their overbearing dominance of the skyline, like the Walkie Talkie in London. Who will pay to demolish them when they catastrophically fail, like Grenfell Tower did? Yet planners ignore such risks and fall over themselves to give permission for the next one. Norman Foster’s Tulip is the latest unnecessary London ego trip. The Tulip is indeed a huge (light) bulb heating up the sky and driving climate change. Bankers must take the responsible step of de-risking cities by never again financing these structures that should now be seen as gigantic climate risks.Susan RoafOxford In a week when Brexit for once did not lead the headlines, it is the world’s most critical problem that has come back to the fore – the dire concerns over climate change. Mark Carney’s warning to financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world to “raise the bar” can’t come soon enough. The Extinction Rebellion movement has very much focused attention this week on climate change, and whatever their methods, it is really important we focus public policy on this massive threat to our long-term wellbeing. Councils are fully aware of their important responsibility in this as local leaders, and the raft of climate emergency resolutions, coupled with developing programmes of radical action, is our contribution to dealing with this existential threat. It is about time the financiers picked up the baton, as the major societal change required to come anywhere close to dealing with this challenge needs both lots of money and the transformation of economies to work. So I encourage this sector to work more effectively with government at all levels and stop investing in high-carbon fossil fuels, but also in nuclear power, which is just too slow to realise and too expensive to deal with the urgency of the climate crisis. Billions, if not trillions, needs to be invested now in low-carbon energy, storage, efficiency, transport and heating solutions. Politicians can only do so much. Extinction Rebellion is right in that we should have been taking much more urgent action over the past 40 years, and as policymakers we should accept that common failure. Now is the time for rapid change so that all our grandchildren and future generations can have a real chance of a decent life. To the financial sector, I urge them to get on with supporting us in that endeavour.Councillor David BlackburnChair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities steering committee The article by Clive Lewis MP was excellent (Labour’s message to UK’s young climate strikers, theguardian.com, 12 April). But Labour’s ambition for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century is not fast enough. We will be committed to at least 2C warming by then due to CO2’s long lifecycle. The scientists who publish the IPCC report have been clear – we have 12 years to transform our power infrastructure. That transformation will cost $45tn according to the International Energy Agency. Your article on Mark Carney’s warning to the financial sector cites a figure of $20tn for assets at risk due to climate change. There are only three choices regarding who will pay these gigantic bills: governments, consumers or shareholders. Only the government has the balance sheet, the borrowing capacity and the timeframe to mothball fossil fuel-driven power plants and build new renewable energy assets. As Gordon Brown taught the world in the 2008 financial meltdown, if you want to move fast, nationalise. The only practical way to turbocharge the energy transition is to nationalise the power sector, allowing existing shareholders an exit or opportunity to swap their shares into a renewable sector de-risked by government involvement. In simple terms, a government exists to do what citizens cannot do for themselves. The ability to mobilise resources in the face of an external threat led the UK to its “finest hour”, as Churchill observed. The first paper connecting CO2 and the greenhouse effect came out in the 1970s. Nearly 50 years later the nations of the world have failed to rein in the pollutants responsible for global warming. The next generation are demanding a response to the climate crisis and those with the experience to legislate, to finance and to procure must advance bold measures such as nationalisation to deliver a better future.John CurtisDirector, Ventnor Botanic Garden Regarding Andre Spicer’s article about Extinction Rebellion (The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why, theguardian.com, 19 April), semantics are important on the left/right political axis, but what’s more important is the plurality of messaging. Extinction Rebellion cannot be all things to all people. In the wake of the current protests and David Attenborough’s Climate Change – The Facts programme, it’s now the job of other voices across the political and cultural spectrum to sound the clarion of change in language their respective demographics will understand. Extinction Rebellion and Attenborough’s team have opened the door to making that possible. Those of us in the media, the arts and beyond have a duty to get on with it.Blake WellstedLondon Sajid Javid referred to protesters “disrupting the lives of others” (Report, 19 April). Presumably far better to leave it until their lives are disrupted by rising sea levels, ferocious storms, flood, drought, crop failure, starvation, mass migration and extinction of much of the life of the biosphere. Any politician with the intelligence, or care for humanity, to see beyond the next election would be in Westminster right now urgently working out how to save the world from approaching catastrophe – but maybe that’s somewhere on the list, after the next-but-one Brexit extension.Hilary LangFrome, Somerset • Thank you for the ideas to mitigate climate change (Team green: firms and nations with a conscience, 19 April).

"European lorry makers face having to cut the carbon dioxide emissions for new trucks by almost a third by 2030, while a UK government body has called for a total ban on new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles by 2040. Lorries are the latest target of attempts to radically reduce vehicle emissions and force the automotive industry to move away from fossil fuels amid increased concern over global warming and air pollution.  The European parliament on Thursday will vote on laws that would force lorry makers to cut carbon emissions from new trucks by 15% by 2025 and by 30% by 2030. Lorries, buses and coaches produce more than a quarter of the EU’s CO2 emissions from road transport and about 6% of total CO2 emissions, according to EU data. It is thought to be highly likely that the proposals will pass the parliamentary vote. The new rules would apply to the UK after Brexit, as the government is committed to emissions standards that are at least as ambitious as current arrangements governed by the EU. Separately, the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), which is appointed by the Treasury, on Wednesday said British ministers should ban the sale of new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles no later than 2040, matching a similar ban on internal combustion engine cars. The vast majority of goods vehicles on British roads run on diesel because of its higher fuel efficiency. However, the NIC said that the industry would be able to move to hydrogen fuel cell and battery lorries in the early 2020s. The haulage industry and business groups have strongly objected to the NIC’s proposals. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, described the proposed ban as “simplistic”, not realistic and not credible given the lack of alternative fuel sources for long-haul heavy goods vehicles. The tougher attitude towards lorries comes amid a crackdown on carbon emissions across the road transport sector. From 2021, EU carmakers will have to meet an average CO2 emissions target for new cars of 95g per kilometre. The looming deadline has raised the prospect of carmakers paying billions in fines for failing to improve their carbon footprint. Only Tesla and Smart already meet the target out of 50 major brands, according to analysis by Jato Dynamics, a data company. Jato suggested the car industry could pay as much as €33.6bn (£29bn) in fines from 2021 if it remained at 2018 emissions levels. However, Transport & Environment (T&E), a Brussels-based campaign group, has raised multiple concerns that carmakers are using loopholes to game the system, avoiding the penalties. T&E highlighted the potential for carmakers to sell “fake” electric cars, hybrids that mainly rely on petrol power alongside a little-used, low-range electric motor. Selling more electric vehicles means carmakers are allowed to meet less stringent carbon-reduction measures. Fiat Chrysler is planning to use another loophole to avoid a big fine for producing dirty cars, reportedly paying Tesla hundreds of millions of euros so that the US carmaker’s electric vehicles – with zero direct carbon emissions – are included in its fleet. Pooling emissions in this way is legal but means that the carmaker’s overall carbon emissions will likely fall more slowly than if it stopped producing cars that run on fossil fuels. An Fiat Chrysler spokesman said: “The purchase pool provides flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance with the lowest-cost approach.” Julia Poliscanova, T&E’s manager of clean vehicles and emobility, said: “Fiat bet excessively on diesel technology and now is paying the cost of declining diesel sales due to the air pollution crisis in our cities. “They could have followed other paths to make cleaner cars and thus meet the CO2 targets, like accelerating sales of electric cars or converting some of their heavy-polluting SUVs as plug-in hybrids. At one point, bad business choices come back to haunt you.” Miriam Dalli, a Maltese Labour MEP who was part of the negotiations on the EU carbon limits, told the Guardian the rules had faced fierce opposition from the industry and some member states, including industry-backed studies with “unrealistic assumptions that led to totally misleading results”. She added that the European commission would also test cars under real-world conditions to avoid a repeat of the “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal, in which Volkswagen installed software to trick emissions tests."

"The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has chided EU leaders for holding three emergency summits on Brexit and none on the threat posed by climate change. In a clarion call to Europe’s political leaders ahead of European parliament elections in May, the founder of the school strike movement said if politicians were serious about tackling climate change they would not spend all their time “talking about taxes or Brexit”. In a typically blunt speech, she said politicians were failing to take enough action on climate change and the threats to the natural world. “Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly because at the moment they are not,” the 16-year old schoolgirl from Sweden told a standing room-only meeting of MEPs and EU officials in Strasbourg. “If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like we do today,” she said. “If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t hold three emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment.” While climate change is sometimes discussed at the EU’s regular summits, the issue has never dominated because Brexit, migration or the eurozone crisis have monopolised the attention of Europe’s top leaders. In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. Greta’s 10-minute speech was interrupted by frequent applause and ended with a 30-second standing ovation. Before she began speaking, many in the room rose to their feet to applaud and take photos of her as she sat on the podium surrounded by cameras. As the young climate activist spoke of a “sixth mass extinction”, her voice faltered. “The extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day,” she said. “Erosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of the rainforest, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, acidification of our oceans – these are all disastrous trends.” She was applauded after getting to the end of the passage and continued the speech without faltering again. Greta had previously addressed the UN climate change summit in Poland and the World Economic Forum in Davos since her lone protest outside the Swedish parliament last August triggered a worldwide school strike movement to raise the alarm about climate change.Neither was it the first time Greta had taken her uncompromising message to the EU institutions. In February, she told an audience including the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU needed to double the ambition of its climate targets. At that time, the parliament’s senior leaders, led by the European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, decided against inviting Greta to address MEPs in the parliament’s debating chamber. Centre-right and liberal groups argued against the invitation, which had been proposed by the Greens. Objections ranged from the potential vulnerability of a child exposed to the chamber to a desire to reserve the plenary address for politicians or senior officials. The meeting took place in the more low-key setting of a special meeting of the European parliament’s environment committee. Noting the imminent European elections and the fact that her generation could not vote, Greta urged MEPs to listen to scientists and millions of children who had taken part in school strikes. “In this election, you vote for the future living conditions of humankind,” she said. Referring to Monday’s fire at Notre Dame in Paris in her speech, Greta called for “cathedral thinking” to tackle climate change. “It is still not too late to act. It will take a far-reaching vision, it will take courage, it will take fierce, fierce determination to act now, to lay the foundations where we may not know all the details about how to shape the ceiling,” she said. “In other words it will take cathedral thinking. I ask you to please wake up and make changes required possible.” • This article was amended on 17 April 2019 because an earlier version misquoted Greta Thunberg as saying: “The extinction rate is up to six times faster than what is considered normal”. Thunberg said “up to 10,000 times faster”. This has been corrected."

It’s late, and so hopefully there won’t be too many misspellings. It seems the global warming regime is imploding in Germany.
A short time ago a report at the online Spiegel, authored by Axel Bojanowski, appeared concerning the blocked Schellnhuber-appointment as director of the WBGU. More details are surfacing. The once influential WBGU council appears to be in for a major overhaul. A major shake-up would spell the end.
The WBGU is the advisory council for the German government on environmental issues, and it is one of the oldest councils in Germany, existing since 1992.
Spiegel writes that “an ominous dispute has obstructed the start of the advisory council” and that “it has been reshuffled. The situation is curious“. The legislative period for the WBGU actually ended in late October last year, and it is now awaiting approval by the government in order to resume its work. However, the German Ministry of Economics, headed by FDP chief Philipp Rösler, refuses to give its stamp of approval.
Bojanowski writes:

According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, four of the council members are to be replaced; the nine WBGU-members are all considered to be environmentally oriented professors.”

It appears Merkel’s junior coalition partner the FDP is pushing to replace some members with others who have economic expertise – in order to create a council that is more balanced and to give it a completely new orientation. The four professors that are aimed to be replaced are: Ellen Matthies, environmental psychologist; Frauke Kraas, geographer; Uwe Schneidewind, economist; Peter Lemke, polar/ocean scientist.
Spiegel adds:

Especially in the Ministry of Economics there are reservations against Schellnhuber, the WBGU Chairman. He would be ‘retired professor in the middle of his term and by then will have been a member of the WBGU for a quarter of a century’ – this is the stated reason given to SPIEGEL ONLINE from circles within the Ministry. In order ‘to revitalise the debate’, they have proposed two economists as alternatives.”

The FDP part of the government is obviously fed up with the climate dogmatism that has blinded the WBGU and the general arrogance that has taken over.

Clearly Merkel, and especially the opposition Greens and environmental activists, want to keep a lid on the turmoil that has erupted. The last thing the environmentalists want is a public debate to erupt and to rage on for weeks. Now with Spiegel focusing on the issue, keeping the lid on will be increasingly difficult to do.
Spiegel writes that over the years the WBGU has become a circle of Schellnhuber’s friends.

‘The voice of economic reason’ is missing says a council member from the 1990s. The WBGU has become a sort of a circle of friends of the years-long Chairman, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber.”

Spiegel writes that the WBGU’s latest report drew harsh criticism. “The council renewed its demand for a ‘Great Transformation’ of civilization.” Critics even labelled the council an “eco-dictatorship”.

The ‘ideological pamphlet’ damaged the WBGU, former colleagues of Schellnhuber griped. It confirmed the fear that Schellnhuber lacked counterparts in the council. In the 1990s the WBGU was occupied completely by ‘neo-liberal economic scientists”, the old colleagues disparagingly call them today.

As Spiegel online describes it, the WBGU is due for a major overhaul. The target is to produce a council of debate, and not one filled with people who nod yes every time Pope Schellnhuber says something.
According to political scientist Susanne Cassel of the “Econwatch”, Spiegel writes, “councils like the WBGU always kept their discussions confidential in order to be able to present only their consensus.” Openness was only on the surface.
Near the end of its article Spiegel tells us that the WBGU’s influence was not that great after all.
Also former Saxony President Kurt Biedenkopf regards the impact of the assessment reports as very limited: ‘Ongoing councils are for the most part ineffective,’ he said. Sometimes the assessments gave the politicians a bad conscience. However, only very few proposals were ever implemented.”
It looks more and more like Germany’s FDP Party is about to knock down a major domino. This may be the tipping point we’ve been waiting for.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBlogging never ceases to amaze me. I started this blog simply as a daily journal of thoughts, which others could read if they cared to. Just for fun. So I am a bit surprised, and of course delighted, when a syndicated columnist like Cal Thomas at the Washington Examiner makes use of my stuff.
I was just checking out Marc Morano’s  Climate Depot and happened to run across Cal’s piece there.
Cal Thomas, an evil conservative, quotes (using my exact words in bold, but I don’t have anything against that):

The German online news magazine Focus recently carried a story, “Warm Times Will Soon Be Over!” Commenting on the “new NASA high temperature record,” which may be set, the magazine blames it on El Nino.
Meteorologists, like Joe D’Aleo of the Weather Channel, are publicly distancing themselves from the false doctrine of global warming. D’Aleo says, “We’ll have La Nina conditions before the summer is over, and it will intensify further through the fall and winter. Thus we’ll have cooler temperatures for the next couple of years.”
These are the exact words, which I translated from the original German, I used in my post here.
My 6th grade English teacher, Mrs. Emma Brown at the Barton Academy, would be proud, I think. The best I could do in her class was a C+.
Just yesterday I wrote that I’d continue to focus on writing about stories that readers might otherwise not hear about. Well, I think it’s safe to say that at least some of us now have heard about the FOCUS story.

"The catastrophic effects of climate change are already visible around the world. From blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south-east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia, no country or community is immune. These events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth. And they are extremely costly: insured losses have risen five-fold in the past three decades. The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing. The impact of climate change has compelled governments to act. Catalysed by the Paris agreement, governments around the world are putting policies in place to limit the global rise in temperatures to 2C, and preferably as close to 1.5C as possible. The actions undertaken by individual countries will deliver a collective transition to a low-carbon economy. But this transition brings its own risks. Carbon emissions have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by 2050. This requires a massive reallocation of capital. If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist.  The prime responsibility for climate policy will continue to sit with governments. And the private sector will determine the success of the adjustment. But as financial policymakers and prudential supervisors, we cannot ignore the obvious risks before our eyes. That is why 34 central banks and supervisors – representing five continents, half of global greenhouse gas emissions and the supervision of two-thirds of the global systemically important banks and insurers – joined forces in 2017 to create a coalition of the willing: the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). On Wednesday, this coalition’s first comprehensive report seeks to translate commitments to act on climate-related financial risks into concrete action. The four recommendations in the report provide all central banks, supervisors and the financial community with deliverable goals that will help to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. We therefore call on policymakers and the financial sector to do the following. First, integrate the monitoring of climate-related financial risks into day-to-day supervisory work, financial stability monitoring and board risk management. Supervisors are encouraged to set expectations to ensure financial firms are adequately addressing the financial risks from climate change, including by conducting scenario analysis to assess their strategic resilience to climate change policy. Firms are encouraged to take a long-term, strategic approach to the consideration of these risks, and to embed them into their business-as-usual governance and risk-management frameworks. Second, lead by example, specifically central banks are encouraged to integrate sustainability into their own portfolio management. Third, collaborate to bridge the data gaps to enhance the assessment of climate-related risks. Public authorities should share and if possible make publicly available any climate-risk data. Fourth, build in-house capacity and share knowledge with other stakeholders on management of climate-related financial risks. An important element to achieving effective consideration of climate risks across the financial system is to support internal and external collaboration. The success of these recommendations relies on two important factors, which lead to two broader calls to action on disclosure and classification of climate-related financial risks. First, to support the market and regulators in adequately assessing the risks and opportunities from climate change, robust and internationally consistent disclosure is vital. The market and policymakers must continue to work together to determine the most decision-useful metrics for climate-related financial disclosures. Second, the NGFS encourages regulators to develop an adequate classification system to identify which economic activities contribute to the transition to a green and low-carbon economy. This will be particularly valuable in supporting financial actors to make sustainable investment and lending decisions. If the financial community acts on these recommendations we will be two big steps closer to ensuring an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy. We recognise that the challenges we face are unprecedented, urgent and analytically difficult. The stakes are undoubtedly high, but the commitment of all actors in the financial system to act on these recommendations will help avoid a climate-driven “Minsky moment” – the term we use to refer to a sudden collapse in asset prices. As long as temperatures and sea levels continue to rise and with them climate-related financial risks, central banks, supervisors and financial institutions will continue to raise the bar to address these climate-related risks and to “green” the financial system. We need collective leadership and action across countries and we need to be ambitious. The NGFS is the core of the response of central banks and supervisors. But climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a crucial role to play. • Mark Carney is governor of the Bank of England.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online FOCUS news magazine has a short article on the results of a climate survey conducted by the ISOE – Institute for Social-Ecological Research of people in the German financial capital of Frankfurt.
The institute surveyed 1000 people on climate and facets of their day-to-day lifestyles like mobility and eating. Although 90% said the climate issue is important – the concern pretty much stops there. FOCUS gives the results:
Only one in five persons behave in an exemplary manner when it comes to climate protection. Another 40% have a lifestyle that is at least in parts climate friendly. Every third person held the opinion that the risks of climate have been portrayed as exaggerated.”
That “one third” is certainly a a figure that is much higher than say 5 years ago.
Another way of looking at it: 73% of the people surveyed in Frankfurt aren’t really up to changing their lives that much to protect the climate. That means they’ll accept minor policy changes, but nothing major that would disrupt their comfortable lives. It also suggests that all the hyping and exaggerating hurt the cause more than it helped.
The overall tone that I gather from the FOCUS piece is one of disappointment over the fact more people aren’t willing to do more. In the press release, project leader Immanuel Stieß said that “there’s still plenty of room for more climate protection commitment.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week in Potsdam, Germany, the First World Conference on Climate Impact took place.
No matter how many studies come out contradicting the models of catastrophic climate change, the Potsdam and IPCC scientists insist catastrophic warming is a fact and can only be averted by implementing drastic CO2 reduction measures, i.e. transforming society. The catastrophe is just postponed a bit.

In the press conference video above at the 7:19 mark, Connie Hedegaard tells the press concerning the Otto et al paper:
“I was in my home city of Copenhagen last weekend, and there last week some knowledge came out that maaaaybe things are slowing down a bit because, yes, we have past the 400 parts per million mark, but did the temperature really follow suit? And I think the interesting things is that there is something in the nature of man that makes us grasp this so that you immediately find the headlines: “Climate Change is Postponed” or we can wait to do something, you know that sort of headlines. Although if you sort of came down to the details you could see that no,l it just meant that maaaaybe we have a bit more time… .
In other words she is telling everyone not to believe any news suggesting that climate warming has slowed down. Don’t believe the observations, just believe the models.
Schellnhuber was hardly able to hide that he too is puzzled by the 15 years of no warming and the claims of the Otto et al paper. At the 34:08 mark of the video above, a journalist asks Schellnhuber about the temperature stagnation we’ve seen over the last 15 years and the Otto et al paper:
First of all, this was a sort of a Leserbrief, a correspondence to Nature Geoscience, which was done actually by former members of the Potsdam Institute who work at Oxford University. And if you read it carefully, it tells you 2 different things: The first one is the long-term projections of the climate models are confirmed actually. So it means the big picture is intact. The second is, just taking into account what you said, what happened over the last 15 years, since the big El Nino event in 1998 actually. There has been a slowing of global warming at the Earth’s surface, yes, which is very important. Taking that into account, simply the projections, again projections, for the next two, three decades have been revised a little bit to the lower side, actually. So we see no surprise because everybody can see that we didn’t have a steeper rise in global temperature in the last decade as we had in the previous decade. But if you now analyze this, why does it happen? And there has been a number of important scientific papers on that recently, which did not make it to the media, is people had analyzed where does the heat go to? Because if you look at satellite data at the top of the atmosphere, you clearly see we have an excess of energy, more energy going into our planetary system then what is going out. This is the first law of thermodynamics: energy is conserved. So it has to go somewhere. So now obviously most of it is now going into the deeper layers of the ocean. And you have to appreciate that the top three meters of the ocean globally contain as much heat as the entire atmosphere. So things are going deeper down. Then of course you will have a certain slowing down of what is happening at the surface. So what we probably see now is a sort of saturation of deeper ocean layers, …but once the job is done, the surface will warm once again, and even faster actually later on. This is by the way accompanied by, if you look at the data as I did this morning, you had many more La Nina events, that is the cool phase in the Pacific, in the last decade then you had in the previous decade. This is in a sense precisely in a La Nina event the oceans more or less take up heat while in an El Nino event they release heat. So just wait for the next big El Nino and we will have again a boost in global temperature. So again, what does this tell us? It simply tells us that global warming does not happen in a linear way where every year the same amount of warming happens. Nobody was actually expecting that, we always talk about natural variability. So I’m as a physicist not at all surprised and there’s no reason, unfortunately, there’s no reason to call off global warming.”

Unbelievably, Schellnhuber says nobody was really expecting a steady rise (er, except 44 modellers and lots of other scientists), and so is indirectly saying that nobody really expected the models to get the short-term (first 20 years) right.
What Schellnhuber is saying can be summed up as follows: We are not surprised that the short-term (up to 2025) models have been wrong, but we are sure the long-term models are right.

Schellnhuber claims he is not at all surpised by the 15-year absence of warming. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.
The only conclusion that one can draw is: If the models up to 2025 are completely wrong, then the long-term models (2100 or 2200) are complete rubbish.
Looking at Roy Spencer’s chart above, the models expected a 0.5° rise from 1998 to 2013 – but we’ve gotten nothing. And the models expect another 0.5°C rise from 2017 to 2022. That too no longer looks tenable given the current ocean and solar cycles.
Schellnhuber’s only option now is to act like he is not surprised about the models getting the first 15 years completely wrong, and to insist the heat will come later, but with more strength.
Haven’t we heard that kind of talk before from slippery investment bankers?

"As the last Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared from Waterloo Bridge on Sunday night, many moved on to sites at Marble Arch and Parliament Square, marking a week-long occupation in London mirrored in 33 other countries. The protests have been met with both resounding support and disapproval. Still, millions of people have now heard their call for transformative and urgent change to avoid climate catastrophe. It’s a message echoed by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, who is speaking in parliament on Tuesday, and the young people across the world who continue to strike from school each Friday. The climate conversation has now gone mainstream; earlier in the week the BBC aired a primetime documentary from David Attenborough, Climate Change: The Facts, while Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change. It feels as though the message about the climate emergency is being pushed further than ever before. We want to know how you have been affected by this movement in the UK. Has it opened your eyes to the climate issue? Have the school strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests changed your perspective and understanding of the climate emergency? What are the reactions of people around you? Have you and others reacted positively or negatively? Do you feel hopeful or frightened for the future? If you’re having trouble using the form, click here. Read terms of service here."
"Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, has given her support for a general strike for the climate, saying the student movement she inspired needs more support from older generations to ensure politicians keep their promises under the Paris agreement. Speaking at a public event in London as Extinction Rebellion protests continued in the capital, the initiator of the school strike for climate movement was typically frank about the scale of the problem the world faces and the impact her campaign has made. “People are slowly becoming more aware, but emissions continue to rise. We can’t focus on small things. Basically, nothing has changed,” she said. At several points, she stressed the need for the protests to spread. “This is not just young people being sick of politicians. It’s an existential crisis,” Thunberg said. “It is something that will affect the future of our civilisation. It’s not just a movement. It’s a crisis and we must take action accordingly.” In a question and answer session, Franny Armstrong, the director of the climate documentary The Age of Stupid, asked whether it was time for a general strike. “Yes,” replied Thunberg in unison with the other members of the panel. Traditional unions have so far been wary of joining the strikes. Although workers’ federations in Italy made Thunberg an honorary member, most others have given either tepid support or none due to concerns about the possible impact on jobs. But there is growing support in the UK, the US and other countries for a Green New Deal that would increase spending on renewable energy. The talk took place on Earth Day, after a week of protests by Extinction Rebellion activists pushed the climate crisis on to news broadcasts and newspaper front pages. Police have arrested more than 1,000 demonstrators at Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge, but hundreds remain camped in Marble Arch, where Thunberg spoke on Sunday. “I support Extinction Rebellion. What they are doing is good. Civil disobedience is important to show this is an emergency. We need to do everything we can to put pressure on the people in power,” she told the audience on Monday, prompting cheers and applause. “Why study for a future that is being taken from us? Why study for facts when facts don’t matter in this society? It’s empowering to know I am doing something, I am taking a stand, I am disrupting.” The interest in the event was so intense that a long line of supporters stretched along Euston Road waiting for the doors to open at Friends House. Most guests appeared to be fellow school strikers. A handful wore shirts or headbands printed with the Extinction Rebellion symbol. But the audience included all age groups, and just about every major environment organisation associated itself with the talk, which was hosted by the Quakers and co-organised by Guardian Events. When Thunberg appeared on stage, she was greeted with thunderous applause. Armstrong said: “I’ve been to dozens of talks here over the years, but I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s the first time I have seen a standing ovation even before the event starts. She’s a rock star.” In the past week, Thunberg has met Pope Francis in the Vatican and addressed members of the European parliament. On Tuesday, she will visit the Houses of Parliament, meet the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and take part in an event with the leaders of all the main parties except Theresa May. She told the audience she had been taken by surprise at the swift spread of a movement that began less than a year ago, when she went on strike alone outside the Swedish parliament. “It is hard to understand what is happening during the last months. It has all happened so fast. I don’t have time to think it through,” she said. Veteran observers of the British parliament said she has helped push the climate issue higher up the UK political agenda than at any time since the 2008 Climate Change Act. Green party officials said they hoped the meeting on Tuesday could spur a new phase of cross-party collaboration on climate change, including monthly meetings, wider public consultations and an agreement that party manifestos should be vetted by an independent body such as the Committee on Climate Change to assess whether they are in line with the Paris agreement. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said the current wave of climate action on the streets and the school strikes gave her hope. “There is more political leadership there and here than I have seen in Westminster. It feels like a turning point in the history of how we defend our planet,” she said. “Young people are calling out against a system that is sadly broken … We are going to change the definition of what is politically possible so that it is what is scientifically necessary.” The discussion ranged from veganism and avoiding flying to political change throughout society. Thunberg said everything was necessary, though she put the focus on challenging the companies and governments that are responsible for the bulk of emissions. How to deal with with people in power was a frequent subject of questions to the panel. Thunberg said her autism helped her filter out much of the greenwashing. “We are more likely to see through lies. We don’t follow the stream. You can’t be a little bit sustainable – either you are sustainable or you are not,” she said. There were occasional moments of levity. At one point, Thunberg was asked how she dealt with climate deniers. “I don’t,” she replied. Thunberg’s earlier point was reiterated by Anna Taylor from the UK Student Climate Network. “We are not going to be satisfied by politicians saying ‘we support you’ and then walking away,” she said. “We won’t be satisfied until they meet our demands and act. That’s why simply taking a selfie or posting support on Twitter isn’t enough. That’s why we have to keep striking.” For all the talk of politics and protest, however, some of the most poignant and pertinent questions came from the youngest children. One asked: “If pollution continues, how much time have we got left?” Another wanted to know: “Can we achieve our goal in the time we have?” Thunberg, in response, was reassuring but measured: “Of course we can, it’s physically possible, the scientists say. It’s up to us. If we do this now then of course we will. But if we don’t, we might not do it. But yes, definitely we can.”"

Climate activists fret that there are too many cars in Russia. Photo: Taiga Forest, Siberia; author: sashapo, Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
The online Klimaretter (Climate Rescuers) here has a piece by Angelina Davydova on Russia’s rapidly expanding automobile culture and CO2 emissions.
After the Soviet Union imploded along with its Communist mismanaged, dilapidated industry in 1990, Russia’s CO2 emissions plummeted 29%. Throughout the nineties Russia suffered from economic malaise. Finally, during the 2000s, things began to turn around and today more and more Russians are getting to know for the first what prosperity is.
Davydova writes, citing a recent study released by the Russian Industry and Commerce Associations and the Brussels-based Climate Change Global Services (CCGS), that Russians are driving more automobiles than ever before, and that CO2 emissions have increased 4.5% in both 2010 and 2011. More and more Russians are buying their own car. In the last ten years the number of cars has risen 83 percent.
These statistics cannot be interpreted as anything else but as signs of real progress in prosperity and improving life for Russians. Although there is still a ways to go, most people view this as welcome news. Yet, for those who hate prosperity, it’s abhorring news. So it is for the granola eaters at Klimaretter.
Klimaretter frets that too many Russians are driving cars nowadays. Davydova writes:
Greenhouse gas emissions from the Russian transportation sector increased 150% from 2001 to 2011. There’s no end in sight for this trend. Just last year alone from 2010 to 2011 CO2 emissions in this sector increased by more than a third. In 2011 there were 36.5 million private automobiles registered in Russia. Therefore, however, automobile ownership is still below that of Germany where approx. 43 million cars are on the road. Statistically, while in Germany every second person has a car, in Russia every fourth person has one.”

Imagine that. Per capita Russians have the gall of driving half the number of cars that Germans do: Thirty six million cars in a country that is almost 50 times the size of Germany! And what’s worse and even more disturbing? Klimaretter writes:
Also the average CO2 emissions per vehicle is higher than in the previous years.”
Mend your ways or “feel the consequences of climate change”
The folks at the alarmist blogsite aren’t happy about the development taking place in Russia. At the end of her article Davydova warns of serious climatic consequences should Russians fail to mend their evil ways:
Russia would be wise to be more active in climate protection efforts. The country is going to seriously feel the consequences of climate change: According to a study by the Moscow University for Economics, the climate-related damages could be 150 – 500 million euros annually in just a few years.”
How these people can be taken seriously truly boggles even a half-witted mind. Climate kooks believe every climate catastrophe scenario that gets released, no matter how absurd it may be. Klimaretter continues:
Also in agriculture the consequences are clearly visible: Between 2010 and 2012 harvests in Russia have dropped by one quarter to one third due to droughts.”
And all because Russians are now driving half as many cars Germans in a country that is almost 50 times the size?
I bet Russian car drivers really get scared when someone tells them about all the serious climate “consequences” that supposedly result from sparse car-driving in a vast country. I’m sure they’re going to ditch their cars and all run back to the horse-and-buggy days – a time when Russian climate was balmy and fruitful.
PS: Car density in Germany is about 120 vehicles per sq km while in Russia it’s barely over 2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne site today writes about a new peer-reviewed study that shows that the Arctic is not warming quickly after all. For years alarmist scientists have told us that nowhere is warming happening faster than in the Arctic. Wrong again!

A study by an international team of scientists led by Germany’s Potsdam-based Alfred Wegener Institute was published in September in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. It’s a temperature reconstruction from the Siberian Arctic. By examining pollen, the scientists were able to determine the July temperatures for the transition zone between tundra and taiga over the last 12,000, i.e. the Holocene.
Now here’s the surprising result (quoted from the study’s abstract) my emphasis:
A climate reconstruction based on fossil pollen spectra from a Siberian Arctic lake sediment core spanning the Holocene yielded cold conditions for the Late Glacial (1–2 °C below present T-July). Warm and moist conditions were reconstructed for the early to mid Holocene (2 °C higher T-July than present), and climate conditions similar to modern ones were reconstructed for the last 4000 years. In conclusion, our modern pollen data set fills the gap of existing regional calibration sets with regard to the underrepresented Siberian tundra–taiga transition zone. The Holocene climate reconstruction indicates that the temperature deviation from modern values was only moderate despite the assumed Arctic sensitivity to present climate change.”
Die kalte Sonne site’s reaction:
One exciting result: Today’s summer temperatures are hardly different from the values of the last several thousand years and are even below those for much of the post ice-age time. The otherwise publicity hungry AWI unfortunately failed to even publish a press release on this remarkable new study.”

"An ambitious experiment deep in the Amazon rainforest aims to find out how the ecosystem is likely to respond to rising levels of carbon dioxide. In 2000 a research team at the UK’s Hadley Centre forecast that a combination of reduced rainfall and higher temperatures caused by global warming could decimate the Amazon by the end of the century. But the following decade another Hadley Centre team concluded that this scenario was unlikely. The contrary verdict was based largely on the researchers’ belief that extra carbon dioxide in the air would protect trees against the increasingly harsh conditions. The revised prediction did not reassure David Lapola, a Brazilian biologist who is running the new experiment. “Who knows,” he said. “Hypotheses are all we have now.” Lapola said nobody had tested the impact of increased carbon dioxide on trees in the Amazon. That is what he and an international team of scientists at a site 35 miles north of Manaus now intend to do. As Lapola spoke, a pair of construction workers in heavy boots paraded by carrying a large, flat, octagonal aluminium frame. Nearby, several more workers were putting the finishing touches to an open-topped greenhouse made of flexible window panels and more aluminium.  The structure was being put up around several spindly saplings, taking care to avoid trampling the soil. When all of Lapola’s chambers have been installed – eight altogether, scattered around an area of jungle twice the size of a football field – computer-controlled nozzles will spray carbon dioxide into four of them, boosting the concentration inside their walls to 50% higher than outside. The other four chambers will be controls and receive no extra CO2. Unless the growth in CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels around the world slows down, these raised levels of CO2 in the air will be normal by about 2050. Scientists have previously exposed saplings and full-grown trees from temperate forests, such as sweet gum and pine trees, to extra CO2. One experiment in the 1990s tested the effect of extra CO2 on the understory trees of a Panama jungle. The conclusion so far from scores of such experiments on how dozens of species in various places fare in CO2-enhanced air is: it depends. Since carbon extracted from carbon dioxide is the essential building block of plants, it makes sense that more CO2 in the air should help plants grow better. But sometimes other factors such as lack of critical nutrients prevent plants from taking advantage of extra CO2. Scientists do not yet know enough about how such limiting factors work to predict how a diverse natural forest such as the Amazon will behave in the air of the future. The question matters not just because the fate of this jungle’s assorted flora and fauna could be at stake. The Amazon stores a vast amount of CO2 in its tree trunks which, if the forest declines, will be released into the air, accelerating global warming. That would cause damage all around the world. Lapola’s chamber research will be the first time Amazon trees are tested with extra CO2 in otherwise almost-natural conditions. After it’s done, the scientists want to build a larger experiment that bathes a plot as big as a baseball diamond in CO2-enhanced air all the way from the ground to the lofty treetops. This could reveal whether mature trees behave differently to young ones. The chambers are expected to be ready in late April, at which point the experiment will begin. “I’ll probably be here,” said Lapola, a professor at the University of Campinas in São Paulo, who estimated he has visited the site 50 times already. “It’s hard to stay away.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s good to see that there are a few journalists who actually take journalism seriously and question what they are being told. One publication that has been doing a good job on this is Switzerland-based Weltwoche, which has written two pieces about the latest IPCC report. See here and here.

 Hat tip: Reader Kurt Arner
Now Weltwoche follows up with a commentary by veteran journalist Alex Reichmuth, titled: “The Perspiration of Fear” and Climate appearing in the print edition. In it he writes that the alarmist warnings of the IPCC have become a worn-out ritual, having little more than a bounce of a dead cat. Moreover, like all other environmental predictions of doom and gloom made in the past, man-made climate change will also be relegated to the dustbin of history.
IPCC has confused the public
Reichmuth writes that if anything, the climate scientists and the IPCC, in their desperate scramble to explain the unexpected changes in climate science, have been only successful in confusing the public. Last winter renowned climate institutes admitted the “climate pause” and the IPCC came under pressure to come up with an explanation for it. Climate change was no longer happening, the public was told, thus contradicting all the earlier claims of run-away warming that the IPCC had consistently preached for years and years. The science had been settled, but then it was not.  So what was the IPCC to do? Reichmuth:
Ultimately the IPCC decided that the pause could be explained as being unimportant.”
As Reichmuth describes it, the move by the IPCC resembled more a last-ditch effort to salvage the global warming scare. He writes:
Indeed only with great difficulty is the IPCC able to hide that it has a serious problem. […] If the thermometer remains stuck at its current level for a few more years, then all IPCC models calculations will become irrelevant and the basis for justifying CO2 reductions would be gone. So the IPCC decides to ignore the warming pause and claims that global warming continues and that man is responsible.”

And so the media and public get their cue to resume their panic. Few, however, are listening anymore.
In the 1980s dying forests refused to die
The call to resume the climate panic reminds Reichmuth of the 1980s forest die-off scare. Soon, because of man-made acid rain, the globe would become a barren wasteland, it was claimed – unless of course mankind stopped industry immediately. But the forests defied projections and refused to die. And as is the case today with CO2, authorities refused to acknowledge that reality and relentlessly insisted that the forest was indeed dying. Reichmuth writes, “It didn’t help. Just a few years later it become clear that the forests weren’t dying.”
Reichmuth writes that the IPCC is now threatened with the very same fate of irrelevance. Even worse the public is losing interest and few are heeding their cries of “wolf” anymore. Reichmuth points out that today only 39% of Germans (who for years had been relentlessly bombarded by dire predictions of a climate catastrophe and shielded from real dissenting views) are afraid of climate change  – that figure was 62% just seven years ago. The same trend holds for Switzerland. Reichmuth:
In 2007 the Swiss media databank reported 5200 articles that contained the word “climate change”. In 2009 the figure was down to 3700. This year at the end of September it was just over 1500. With the other environmental ‘hype stories’ a phase of declining interest was always followed by forgetting altogether”.
Scare goes from acid rains…to acid oceans
The environmentalists are on the move again to the next scare story. They went from population explosion in the 1960s, to global cooling in the 1970s, then to acid rain in the 1980s before moving on to global warming in the 1990s, and today they are gearing up to retrofit their freak show over to acid oceans.

"The president of the Seychelles has made a plea for stronger protection of the “beating blue heart of our planet”, in a speech delivered from deep below the ocean’s surface. Danny Faure’s call for action, billed as the first live speech from a submersible, came during a visit to an ambitious British-led science expedition exploring the Indian Ocean depths.  “Oceans cover over two-thirds of the world’s surface but remain, for the most part, uncharted. We have better maps of Mars than we do of the ocean floor,” Faure said. “This issue is bigger than all of us, and we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action, and running out of time.” The president was speaking from a manned submersible 120 metres (400ft) below the waves, on the seabed off the outer islands of the African nation. Wearing a Seychelles T-shirt and shorts, Faure said after his speech that the experience was “so, so cool”. It had made him more determined than ever to speak out for marine protection, he said. “We just need to do what needs to be done. The scientists have spoken.” The oceans’ role in regulating the climate and the threats they face are underestimated by many, even though, as Faure pointed out, they generate “half of the oxygen we breathe”. Scientific missions are crucial in taking stock of underwater ecosystems’ health. Small island nations are among the most vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. Land erosion, dying coral reefs and the increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten their existence. During the expedition, marine scientists from the University of Oxford have surveyed underwater life, mapped large areas of the sea floor and explored the depths with manned submersibles and underwater drones. Little is known about the oceans below depths of 30 metres, the limit to which a normal scuba diver can go. Operating down to 500 metres, the scientists were the first to explore areas of great diversity where sunlight weakens and the deep ocean begins. By the end of the mission, researchers expect to have conducted more than 300 deployments, collected about 1,400 samples and 16 terabytes of data and surveyed about 25,000 sq metres (269,100 sq ft) of seabed using high-resolution multi-beam sonar equipment. The data will be used to help the Seychelles expand its policy of protecting almost a third of its national waters by 2020. The initiative is important for the country’s “blue economy”, an attempt to balance development needs with those of the environment. “From this depth, I can see the incredible wildlife that needs our protection and the consequences of damaging this huge ecosystem that has existed for millennia,” Faure said in his speech. “Over the years we have created these problems. We can solve them.” About 5% of the world’s oceans are protected. Countries have agreed to increase the area to 10% by 2020. But experts and environmental campaigners say between 30% and 50% of the oceans outside nations’ territorial waters should get protected status to ensure marine biodiversity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s an interesting story brought to my attention by Readers Edition: http://www.readers-edition.de/2010/04/30/mein-klimagerechtes-leben/. German ZDF television, Germany’s version of the Beeb, shows its viewers how to live if you want to reach Salvation. It’s in German but you can read this post and then easily follow the clip.
Bathing Belgian in rainwater
The ZDF clip starts with a Belgian man using a fitness bike to power his laptop. He buys only second-hand clothes, bathes in rainwater – fish and meat of course are taboo. He cooks using only low energy methods; that is he removes the pot from the stove as soon as it starts to boil and places it inside an insulated box which he covers with his second-hand rags. The trapped heat does the rest. In all he cut his energy consumption by 70%. Not only does he save a lot of CO2, he also saves a lot of money – so much in fact that he has been able to buy a new shiny piano!  (Just don’t ask how the piano is manufactured or shipped).
This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes…  The one-year no-consumption experiment in New York City
Scene change over to New York, the capital of consumption, epicentre of trash production. Meet Colin Beavan, whose website http://noimpactman.typepad.com/ tells you how you too can be an “extraordinary person”. He conducted an experiment: one year without consumption. See how he and his family do not take the elevator, preferring to climb 22 flights of stairs. They neither use a car nor the subway, preferring to risk their daughter’s life on bikes. They do not produce any trash. They have their own compost in their appartment (Wow! imagine if we all had composts in our homes). And take a look at their leg-powered washing machine.
Beavan says: We have to consume way way less

So why does Colin put him and his family through all the trouble? He says he wants to find out what’s possible. How much can we refrain from in modern living? Beavan wants radical change. He says it’s not about changing your consumption habits, it’s about consuming “way way less”. The first step in the one-year no-consumption project was to throw out all those energy guzzling applicance and all the chemical products, and to impose an absolute halt on shopping. That’s right – no shopping for one year.
Beavan the ecostar
His wife Michelle is an editor for Businessweek and admits she was a typical consumer (er, sinner), who just couldn’t live without the modern vice called consumerism. But it’s Beavan’s project and the family decided to go along cold turkey. They kicked off the project by throwing a “lights-out” party and using candles for illumination. Beavan, the no-impact man, has since become an eco-star. His message: “Everybody can and must do something”.  My question is: Why “must”?
No toilet paper
Colin’s family did not even use an air conditioner during New York’s hot sticky summer and no refrigerator. They didn’t even use toilet paper – it’s waste of resources!  Some of Michelle’s BusinessWeek colleagues refused to shake her hand. Hot water? Didn’t mention it. Beavan did have second thoughts during the one-year ordeal. Yet he looked at the bright side, like better nutrition and more time with the family. Many habits have remained since the one-year experiment ended. For example he now uses canning jars as glasses. Ironically he says pessimism is the obstacle to change. That’s funny, aren’t the tree-huggers the ones always telling us a Climate Armegeddon is coming? How does one develop his brand of optimism?
Buy Beavan’s DVD, today!
By the way you can purchase Beavan’s story on a plastic DVD.  http://www.noimpactdoc.com/index_m.php.  Just don’t ask how the DVDs are recorded, manufactured, shipped, played or disposed of.  In fact, don’t bloody ask how German ZDF produced and aired it’s stupid report on Beavan, Ms BusinessWeek and Mr Secondhand Rags.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman sceptic site Readers Edition has a good story today about the Alpha Ventus windpark, Germany’s first offshore windpark, which officially started up with much media hype last April. It’s made up of twelve 5-MW turbines. It’s a €250-million pilot project that serves to spearhead several other coastal power plants in the coming years.The wind farm is operated by energy companies Eon, Vattenfall and EWE and is supposed to provide power to about 50,000 households. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists because of its threat to migratory birds.
But for now environmental problems are the least of concerns for the project’s backers. Technical problems have hampered the project from the get-go. Today it has been reported that two of the twelve wind turbines had been shut down for weeks.
Originally estimated to cost €189 million, the Alpha Ventus park has been plagued by cost overruns and delays.  In late summer and autumn of 2008, bad weather made installation of the first 6 turbines impossible.  Then the equipment to install the monster turbines was not available. Next there were major problems with the transformer facilities.
A few weeks ago the temperature of the bearings in the turbine made by Areva Multibrid was too high and thus they had to be taken out of operation. Now the turbines have to be removed from their 500+ ft. high towers and the bearings have to be replaced. Repair works will take weeks and extend into late summer. It’s still unclear if the other four of the Multibrid turbines have a problem. The remaining 6 turbines are made by Repower and are reported to be running smoothly. There are no reports on how high the costs for the troublesome dismantling and repair works will run.
And if that weren’t bad enough, the construction works on the massive Bard Offshore 1 commercial windparks have been delayed as a 300-foot foundation column crashed onto the construction ship Wind Lift 1 three weeks ago. Now other turbines have to be thoroughly inspected. The Bard project foresees the installation of 320 five-megawatt class turbines over the coming years. The cost for the first 80 Bard turbines alone is climbing far beyond original estimates. First they were estimated to cost over €500 million. Now it’s estimated costs will exceed a billion euros. German online newspaper projects the costs will even reach €1.2 billion.
The promoters of the offshore projects cannot say they weren’t warned of the risks of installing windparks in the North Sea’s harsh conditions. The Nysted offshore windpark and Horns Rev park in Denmark are examples, and have struggled with big problems. For example in 2007 a transformer malfunction occurred at Nysted just 4 years after being commissioned, causing a months-long shutdown. At the Horns Rev windpark there were problems with the turbines only 2 years after they had gone into operation. World leading turbine manufacturer Vestas had to remove all 80 turbines, haul them onshore and perform extensive repairs. Luckily these turbines were only of the smaller 2 to 2.3-MW class, and so much easier to do repair works. Repairs and maintenance on the 5-MW monsters will be much tougher and expensive.
But as long as windpark companies continue to have the full backing of wasteful governments, costs won’t matter.
UPDATE, 17 June 2010: I’m delighted to see one of my favourites, James Delingpole, has featured this post at his blog here. Thanks!

"James Cook University is considering its legal options after the federal circuit court ruled it had unlawfully sacked a professor who had criticised scientific research about the climate change impact on the Great Barrier Reef. Peter Ridd, who was the head of the physics department at the institution from 2009 until 2016, took legal action against his dismissal.  Judge Salvatore Vasta ruled on Tuesday the 17 findings made by the university, the two speech directions, the five confidentiality directions, the no satire direction, the censure, the final censure and the termination of Ridd’s employment were all unlawful. “Some have thought that this trial was about freedom of speech and intellectual freedom. Media reports have considered that this trial was about silencing persons with controversial or unpopular views,” Vasta said in his judgement. “Rather, this trial was purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an enterprise agreement.” The judgement noted Ridd had been in trouble with university management for contacting a News Corp journalist and making media appearances on Sky News after dark claiming he had breached a code of conduct. Ridd had started a GoFundMe page asking for donations to fund his legal expenses and he also published material from the internal disciplinary process on a blog. A number of media articles were also published where it was obvious that Prof Ridd had spoken to the journalist involved, the judgment said. “Professionally, Professor Ridd had been concerned with the quality of the scientific research that had been published about the state of health of the Great Barrier Reef,” the judgment said. “He had published a number of papers on the need for better quality assurance. In his opinion, the health of the Great Barrier Reef had been frequently misrepresented.” Judge Vasta said the university has not understood the whole concept of intellectual freedom. “[The] university has ‘played the man and not the ball’,” he said. “Intellectual freedom is so important. It allows academics to express their opinions without fear of reprisals. It allows a Charles Darwin to break free of the constraints of creationism. It allows an Albert Einstein to break free of the constraints of Newtonian physics. It allows the human race to question conventional wisdom in the never-ending search for knowledge and truth.” The Townsville-based university’s provost professor, Chris Cocklin, noted the judgment does not refer to any case law. “We disagree with the judgment and we maintain we have not taken issue with Dr Ridd’s nor any other employee’s rights to academic freedom,” Cocklin said in a statement. “Dr Ridd was not sacked because of his scientific views. Dr Ridd was never gagged or silenced about his scientific views, a matter which was admitted during the court hearing.” The case has been adjourned for a further hearing to award a penalty. Comment was sought from Ridd."

And if the last few days are any indication, then things are going to get awfully mean this winter. Expect sky-high heating bills and lots of frost damage, especially to streets. For example here are this morning’s lows for Germany – and October has barely begun:

Widespread frost over Germany. Source: www.wetter.com/hoechst tiefst werte/.
The www.wetter.net/ press release today explains the winter forecast for both December and January taken from US weather models. The December chart from meteociel.fr shows the Beast from the East, a.k.a. Siberian Express, rolling across central and southern Europe, before seriously intensifying in January.

The American long-term model remains true to a cold winter when compared to the 1961 – 1990 reference period. The two charts show the expected mean temperature in Central Europe in the months of December and January.”
Jung writes that there’s been a shift over the years to colder winters in Europe. After the last, at times, really cold winters, this is no longer a surprise. “The mild westerly wind pattern of the 1990s that provided us with mild and stormy years have gotten markedly less. Increasingly the icy high pressure weather patterns are dominating,“ explains Jung.
Though these long-term forecasts entail a lot of uncertainty, they do tell us what has already become clear: Europe has entered a period of cold winters – like those experienced in the 1970s. It tells us that the chances for a cold one are greater. This winter the dice is loaded in favor of a cold one.
To know for sure, we’ll just have to wait until April.

"If this were a film about humanity’s last hope before climate change wiped us out, Hollywood would be accused of flagrant typecasting. That’s because Dr Joanne Chory is too perfect for the role to be believable. The esteemed scientist – who has long banged the climate drum and now leads a project that could lower the Earth’s temperature – is perhaps the world’s leading botanist and is on the cusp of something so big that it could truly change our planet.  She’s also a woman in her 60s who is fighting a disease sapping her very life. In 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, which makes the timetable for success all the more tenuous. “We’re trying to do something that’s a huge, complicated thing even though it sounds so simple,” Chory says. “Plants evolved to suck up CO2 and they’re really good at it. And they concentrate it, which no machine can do, and they make it into useful materials, like sugar. They suck up all the CO2, they fix it, then it goes back up into the atmosphere.” She is now working to design plants capable of storing even more carbon dioxide in their roots. Her Ideal Plant project uses gene editing – via traditional horticulture and Crispr – to do so. On a large scale, this could suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere to slow down climate change. This concept basically splices the genes of regular crops and everyday plants like beans, corn and cotton, with a new compound that makes them absorb more carbon. Their roots then transfer it to the soil to keep it there.  This approach essentially supercharges what nature already does. “I get worked up when I talk about the project,” Chory tells me in an office at the Salk Institute, a revered bio research campus at the edge of the Pacific Ocean in southern California. Her desk is full of posies, awards, family photos and framed magazine covers from science journals. “We have to find a way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and I think plants are the only way to do that affordably,” Chory says. “I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders,” she says, letting out a laugh. “It is a lot of pressure.” Born in Boston to Lebanese parents, the third of six children, Chory received a PhD studying photosynthetic bacteria at the University of Illinois. She spent her postdoctoral years as a Harvard Medical School researcher, then joined the institute in 1988. Along the way, she’s discovered how plants respond to everything from light and environment to how they regulate size and growth. “It’s a philosophical issue, too,” she says, explaining why so many kick the can of global warming. “If I take pain now, maybe my great-grandchildren might see a benefit. People choose no pain now, that’s why we’ve done nothing about climate change.” Every now and then as we speak, Chory’s symptoms pop up like an uninvited guest, another stark reminder of time. Struggling to maintain control and ever aware of the implied humor in her movements, she doesn’t shy from the elephant in the room. “When I get excited I really get moving,” she mock-apologizes, letting out a coy chuckle. “I’m a lot better on Saturdays.” She pauses, collects her thoughts. “That’s why I want to do something that won’t cause pain to people. You never know when you’re making a global change. I don’t know if we can do it, but we have to try.” Temperatures are already at alarming levels even if we reach the Paris agreement of curbing a rise of 2C. The world is headed for major upheaval, it’s merely a question of the scale. If we have any chance as a species, Salk contends, it’s with big ideas like this. Right now, the institute is negotiating with seed companies and prepping tests on nine agricultural crops to introduce Ideal Plants on farms around the world. Field-testing begins later this year with wheat, soybeans, corn and cotton. Developing these Ideal Plants is step one in the Harnessing Plants Initiative, which amplifies root systems and production of suberin – which is essentially cork, or the rind on your cantaloupe, the magic key to plants holding more of that carbon – before transferring these genetic traits to row and cover crops. Given the right resources, and funding, prototypes of each crop are expected to be ready in the next five years. A $2m gift by Howard Newman, a Salk board member and private equity veteran who has invested in oil and gas, jump-started the project last June. In April, Salk received a TED Audacious grant totaling $35m to support the plan. Chory says these new plants will have deeper and stronger root systems that will also stop erosion, another byproduct of warming temperatures, which will make soil more healthy and boost production. When normal plants die, they release large amounts of CO2 back into the air; when Ideal Plants die, significantly less CO2 will be re-released due to more carbon being stored in deeper roots and soil for longer periods, and suberin’s natural ability as a carbon polymer to resist short-term decomposition. The first two meters of the Earth’s soil holds over three times the amount of carbon as the atmosphere, and can hold even more. Fossil fuel use was predicted to rise nearly 2% last year. Each year, we produce 18 more gigatons of CO2 than the Earth can currently handle; Salk believes their solution can achieve as much as a 46% annual reduction in excess CO2 emissions produced by humans. It’s an extremely ambitious idea full of so many unknowns – how to get global buy-in from farmers, how many years will it take for plants to reach maturity and will it then be too late, how will mother nature react to such genetic modification and how will these crops taste – that none of Salk’s brains have the answers to. The institute was founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, a biologist who discovered the cure for polio in 1955, two years before my own father’s identical twin died of the disease in communist Romania, a place where politics kept science at bay. Standing at the edge of the seaside campus designed by Louis Kahn, a sprawl of ominous cement towers and dramatic ocean views, it all feels straight out of the mind of Philip K Dick. Part Gattaca, part Logan’s Run, it’s easy to see why numerous films have been shot here. But there’s also an optimism in these labs that feels so far from the stark structures and climate narrative I’m used to. Many scientists have told me their role is something akin to historian, documenting the last days of a species or system. Not so here. “There is hope in dreams, in imagination and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality,” Jonas Salk once said. Inside these modernist blocks, they’re dreamers too, but rooted in reality. The biological research center, funded by government grants and private donors, has spent decades inching towards cures for everything from cancer to Alzheimer’s. In 1968, Robert W Holley, Salk Cancer Center’s founding director, won a Nobel prize; in 1975, Institute staff won another Nobel, and again in 1977 and 2002. More recently, Chory was awarded a $3m breakthrough prize for discovering how plants optimize their growth, development and cellular structure to transform sunlight into chemical energy. I see the optimism on a tour with Dr Joseph Noel, a biochemist focused on harnessing suberin, the project’s linchpin. He shows me seed-planting robots, which can bang out a day’s work in the time it would take a human weeks; state-of-the-art grow rooms capable of simulating almost any environmental condition; greenhouses sitting atop dramatic bluffs. All the while he breaks down the importance of cork. “It’s a spongy barrier that helps a plant regulate water coming in and out, gas exchange coming in and out. Think of it like a protective plastic around certain cells in the plant.” The institute’s founder, Jonas, once said “our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors,” and I think about the quote’s relevance as Noel shows me rows of simulation rooms full of cattails, marsh grasses, Lotus japonicus legumes and weed-like Arabidopsis thaliana, all in various states of growth as LEDs shine and humid air blasts while I take notes. “Instead of just growing in a greenhouse or artificial lights in a lab, we wanted to have the ability to simulate a particular climactic zone: quality of light, seasonal changes, cloud cover, temperatures,” Noel says. Since Arabidopsis “can go from seed to seed in six weeks” and its genome is entirely sequenced and resembles so many other species, the little mustard flower has become the project’s veritable Rosetta Stone. “It’s very easy to change the genetics of it on a massive scale,” he continues. “If we change a particular gene, we can find out if the roots get deeper, do they get more extensive, does the suberin content change. Their early ancestors have been doing photosynthesis for about 2.8bn years.” Without plants, life as we know it wouldn’t exist. The question is whether these ones will become our saviors. There’s a growing field of carbon dioxide removal projects which include machines pulling C02 out of the sky, known as direct air capture. There’s Bill Gates-backed Carbon Engineering and the Zurich startup Climeworks, and about 20 commercial carbon capture and storage facilities worldwide, but they’re price prohibitive.  There have been notable failures: Sir Richard Branson tried a $25m prize for carbon removal but never found a solution. Carbon removal initiatives are also criticized for preserving the status quo and big energy business models. “Ultimately, we all know that humanity’s response to climate change will, as the Ideal Plant project states, make or break our future,” says David Stern, the president and CEO of the Boyce Thompson Institute, a leading plant research facility in New York, who calls Chory a fearless, creative and open-minded scientist. “Given the complexities and scale of the problem, many types of solutions will be needed. Sequestration is undoubtedly one of them.” One big problem, Stern notes, is winning hearts and minds. Genetically modifying organisms saving the planet might be a tough sell in an era when GMO has become the antithesis for the green, organic movement. “While they are not proposing traditional transgenic lines nor are they proposing to do their work in food crops, the issue will still come up,” Stern adds. Chory maintains that plants have been modified for millennia – selecting the best strains to cultivate and taking a hand in their development is a form of genetic modification, after all – and the nutritional and yield values of such tweaked products still outweigh the drawbacks. Salk doesn’t introduce foreign genetic material in its plants, unlike many GMO products. The European Union outlawing modified organisms, plus crops with Crispr traits (as a result, the plants might not make it to the EU). Another issue is seed pricing and getting it to farmers around the world, so the wide-scale use is in question. “As with any GMO crop the big question is how do the changes affect nutritional quality and whether small farmers in developing countries would be able to buy the seeds on a large enough scale to make a difference?” wonders Dan Wenny, a senior biologist who studies land-bird seed dispersal at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory. Right now, the Mississippi delta in Louisiana is a test zone for a first batch of Ideal Plants in the wild, a major step to see if improved root systems can mitigate sea level rise. Still, Salk researchers are sober to the odds. “Any restoration effort, unlike our Arabidopsis that can grow from seed to seed in six weeks, these systems you plant them and then you wait. You wait a long time,” Noel laments. “We can’t afford to have these experiments not work.” Are we past the point of no return? “The world’s not going to be the world we live in right now,” Chory says. “I don’t know if we’re going to eliminate the whole human species, but I think if we don’t do something soon we will go that route. The misery index of humidity plus the heat will get so high mammals can’t live.” The Union of Concerned Scientists says the tipping point is here. “I don’t think it’s here yet,” Chory counters. Still, she concedes that “migration is already happening. Canada is going to make out well in this. The United States is not. We’re going to have a lot of changes in our agriculture.” She adds: “The farmers are the ones we really have to convince. We can’t continue to farm the way we farm any more. It can feed 8 to 10 billion people but 50 years from now, there won’t be any good soil left so you’re just putting the disaster off.” Chory glances at a picture of her daughter, Katie. “Look at me, I’m 64 years old. I’m not going to be around to see this project go to fruition, I’m not going to be working at Salk, probably. That urgency is there. The climate urgency is there. Every week there’s a new climate disaster. How can we get there? We can’t really get there any faster. I don’t know if we can do it, but I want to be part of the solution. I don’t just want to sit around and complain.” Adam Popescu is a Los Angeles writer. His debut novel, Nima, will be published on 21 May"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe French website Contrepoints (Counterpoints) has an excellent general summary on how the Turney Expedition course of events unfolded in an article titled: Akademik Shokalskiy: the time to ask questions. Turney really does appear to be in a lot of hot water.
Contrepoints introduction starts:
Persuaded to have nothing to worry about from ice in the Antarctic, an expedition of climatologists wound up getting caught in 5 meters of sea ice. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers are safe and sound, now come to the questions.”
Vessel was low budget, inadequate
Contrepoints starts by questioning the adequacy of the vessel chosen for the expedition, citing the harshness of the environment that would be entered. It is turning out that Commonwealth Bay is indeed notorious for ice blockage and that cruise companies generally avoid the area. The list of sunken shipwrecks littering the ocean floor is growing. Contrepoints presents examples that include the Explorer in 2007 and Brazilian ship Endless Sea in 2012:
Also, it seems the decision to charter a vessel of the type that is the Akademik Shokalskiy can be explained in large part by budgetary reasons, but also by the certainty of the organizers that there would be nothing to worry about from icebergs because of climate warming.”
Far more sea ice “than expected”
Contrepoints then informs its readers that in fact it has gotten colder in the Antarctic over the past years and presents a sea ice chart which shows near record high sea ice extents. This all raises questions on what the expedition organizers were thinking back in November, before starting the jouney, a time when sea ice charts were showing 1 million sq km more ice than normal, Contrepoints reminds us.
Tourism disguised as science
Contrepoints then questions the wisdom of bringing on tourists and family members onto the expedition.
Under these conditions, and based on the synopsis of the expedition, as well as the accounts of a more than festive ambiance on board, one is entitled to wonder about the real scientific character of this adventure.”
“An obvious amateurism…obstinacy and naivety”
When comparing Turney’s expedition to other scientific expeditions, like those of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute with its Polarstern ice-breaker, the qualitive differences are nothing short of glaring. Contrepoints writes that Turney’s expedition, when you boil it down, was “an obvious amateurism“. The French site writes that the answer to the questionas to why the ship got caught in ice “lies probably not in an error by the captain but in the obstinacy and naivety of expedition leader Chris Turney.”

Knew well in advance a storm was approaching
Contrepoints, citing the blog of onboard tourist and Australian Green politician Janet Rice, describes how passengers bungled about with an Argo craft, causing an hours-long delay in the departure of the boat as a storm rolled in. The storm it turns out, was not something unpredictable, but had actually been forecast already on December 22. Rice writes in the first sentence of her blog on December 22:
There’s a blizzard on the way apparently!”
Even more damning, Contrepoints writes:
While Mawson found the bay completely free of ice 100 years earlier, his successor Chris Turney found himself nose to nose with an immense floe of ice that covered the bay and forced his ship to stop close to 70 km from where Mawson had set foot on land. This was already on 19/20 Decembre according to the entries made by Turney at his blog.”
Fault of amateurism
Contrepoints concludes the description of the debacle with:
Finally, what had to happen happened and the next day on December 24: The ice finally trapped the Akademik Shokalskiy. In short, contrary to what Turney claims, the misadventure experienced by his team is more the fault of amateurism than of having no luck.”
Contrepoints then concludes the piece by describing how the Turney’s botched expedition is now adversely impacting the other scientific operations taking place in Antarctica, as logistics are now seriously in disarray.
After publishing my blog article Expedition on the cheap here some five days ago, one global warming activist reader reacted with a knee-jerk claiming I didn’t know what I was talking about. Today we now see stories appearing every day, confirming precisely what I brought up. Goes to show who really doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Who approved the expedition in the first place? 
There are other important questions, as not all the blame can be put on Turney or the vessel’s captain. This was a huge expedition, and so various authorizations, approvals and permits had to have been necessary. Who signed them? Who was too incompetent to see that it wasn’t up to standard and that Turney was an amateur?

"This afternoon an international sensation is taking to the stage in central London. She’s young, admired around the world and her name is Greta Thunberg. She’s a 16-year-old climate hero and I couldn’t be more proud to be co-hosting her visit. Greta’s rise to fame has been vertiginous. Last year she skipped school and sat in front of the Swedish parliament in protest against inaction on climate change – and now she is one of the figureheads of a school climate strike movement that has swept the globe, which more than a million young people taking to the streets last month to demand that world leaders step up to this monumental challenge. The success of the strike is not incidental. Every red light is flashing on the Earth’s dashboard. The 20 warmest years on record all happened in the last 22 years. Nature and wildlife populations are at crisis levels across the world. Wildfires and droughts are becoming increasingly common – with people in the global south already dying from the effects of climate change which were mostly caused by countries in the north. Here in the UK, communities are under serious threat from flooding, sea level rises, extreme heat and more. Of course Greta had to act. And of course thousands followed her. In the UK, Extinction Rebellion is also making waves. By putting their bodies on the line in protest against climate change, its members aren’t just creating headlines, they are showing moral courage at a time when too many politicians are taking us backwards. Greta arrives today in a country that talks the talk on climate, but simply won’t walk the walk. Not only are the government cheerleaders for dirty fossil fuels like fracking, but they’ve cut support for renewables like wind and solar. When we look back at this moment in a generation’s time, the real criminals won’t be seen as those blockading bridges – it will be those who understood the science of climate change, yet consistently blocked action to prevent its worst effects. Yet despite government intransigence, there are real grounds for hope. We have the means to start to tackle this crisis – from renewable energy to clean and sustainable public transport. It is cheap and it is here; we just need to the political will to scale it up and roll it out, the first steps towards utterly transforming the global economy. And we need to take every step together, in a new, genuinely inclusive politics. There is hope in a generation of people who are demanding from their leaders not just what seems politically possible but what is scientifically necessary to prevent total climate breakdown. That generation builds on longstanding struggles, particularly from environmental defenders who have risked – and given – their lives defending their land, water and rights against the power of fossil fuel firms who have stopped at nothing in their pursuit of the bottom line. So when Greta takes to the stage today, she will see in front of her hundreds of people of her age who aren’t afraid to take a stand, and she will stand on the shoulders of the many environmental defenders who have stood before her. Make no mistake, the climate movement has broken into the mainstream – and it is here to stay. Our task now is to meet every promise by a politician with a demand to go further, to scale up our ambition as those at the top seek to appease us with warm words and rousing rhetoric. We must be deadly serious about getting the work done to avoid the worst of this climate catastrophe. If we don’t rise to this task,and don’t rise to it now, then we condemn Greta’s generation, and generations to follow, to a future framed by wildfire and drought – it’s as simple as that. • Caroline Lucas is MP for Brighton Pavilion"

Share this...FacebookTwitter“It was just a photo of Antarctica that we happened to have around and we were in a hurry.” This is surely the kind of answer you would get if you asked the climate propaganda-meisters at the AP and The Weather Channel about their choice of photo for their latest story.
Hat-tip: Reader ES.

They’ll insist that the photo used to illustrate the story of record cold in the Antarctic was just something random they had given little thought about and that they were in a hurry. What a joke…these guys and gals think they are soooooo clever. Boy, they sure almost fooled us.
Anyone with just an inkling of experience in journalism knows that words and picture are carefully chosen to effectively communicate a message. So you have to wonder why Borenstein or The Weather Channel used a photo of melting ice to illustrate the headline story of Antarctica setting a record cold temperature of -135.8°F. Hey, why not use a parched-land photo to illustrate the next flood story…or overweight people to depict starvation in Africa!
The answer is clear. Science journalist Seth Borenstein and the Weather Channel are infamous for their alarmist positions on global warming and have long been known for their glaring bias when reporting on the issue. It was hard enough for them to have to print words on the record cold temperatures, and so by golly they weren’t about to depict it with a photo. That would be asking too much. No, better to use the “1000 words” to stealthfully tell the other story – the one that contradicts Antarctic reality…and make damn sure that picture gets placed right smack at the top of the story, immediately after the headline, where no one can miss it.
With a little luck, the melting ice photo will be just enough to distract readers from what’s really going on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy last 2 posts have been about this topic, where a one-sided international conference for journalists will provide their marching orders for the months ahead. Normally such a conference if organised privately would be legitimate.
But the shocking thing about this conference is that it is organised by a German publically funded radio and TV broadcaster – Deutsche Welle, and therefore the total absence of neutrality and objectivity is a violation of Germany’s Consitutional Law.
The conference calls on journalists to:
1. Abandon neutrality and to report only on the single extreme view of AGW calamity.
2. Abandon professional procedures in journalism. See here and here.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany has sent a Letter of Protest (in German) to Deutsche Welle demanding that they refrain from this misuse of public funds and cancel the one-sided conference which clearly excludes any views that disagree with the extreme gloom and doom world downfall view. It requests that it too obey the law, like every other citizen or guest in the country is rightfully expected to do. Currently the letter is only in German.
Hopefully EIKE will post a copy in English.
In the meantime, we urge readers to write or call Deutsche Welle at:
Phone: +49 228 429-2008 (Ask for a Mr Bettermann)
Fax: +49 228 429-2140
gmf@dw-world.de
They speak excellent English. Please politely ask him why they are violating the law by presenting only one radical side of the issue, and insist they present all the other wide range of views from other scientists and experts on climate change. Why is it they are presenting only the worst of scenarios? Is it really their job to emotionalise the audience with the aim to get them to think in one particular way?
Let us know what they tell you. I left my name and number with the secreatry, who said Mr Bettermann will call me back.

"On a recent Saturday in Brooklyn, against the unlikely backdrop of a huge blue-and-white Ikea outlet, several dozen volunteers hand-churned compost. Decomposing food scraps emit considerable heat, and the 6ft-tall compost heaps were warm to the touch. As shovels and pitchforks pierced the compost, gusts of steam rolled off like fog. A three-acre lot-turned-urban farm, the Red Hook Community Farms contains the largest compost site in America powered entirely by sustainable sources. During an orientation for new volunteers, one of the site managers explained that the operation was the brainchild of a lawyer and environmentalist named David Buckel, who supervised it until his death last year. He designed the site’s processes so it would run like clockwork, even in his absence. A woman asked, hesitantly: “Is he the one who … self-immolated?” “Yes,” the manager said. He didn’t elaborate but said he considered the site Buckel’s legacy, and that he and the other two managers felt honored to carry on its work. As the manager talked, a small wind turbine whizzed overhead. Energy from the turbine, plus several solar panels, fed into a generator that pumped air into the compost heaps not being churned by hand. On the other side of the lot grew rows of spinach, kale, tomatoes and other crops, which the farm sells or donates to food pantries. Terry Kaelber, Buckel’s husband and companion of 34 years, often volunteers at the compost site. When I asked him about the site, he thought carefully, then said: “There is something very simple and pure in coming together, in giving up your time, to take people’s food scraps and do the work that will enable those scraps to be turned back, over time, into food.” The site was a microcosm, he said, of the kind of self-sustaining, harmonious society Buckel wanted to build – the kind “I think in some ways we all subconsciously long for”. “I only wish,” he said, “that David had stuck it out.” Early on the morning of 14 April 2018, Buckel – a 60-year-old retired gay rights attorney – left his cozy, garden-surrounded Brooklyn house and walked to nearby Prospect Park. He made his way to a stretch of grass, where he emailed media outlets a statement decrying humanity’s passivity in the face of pollution and global warming. A few minutes later, he doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire. “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result,” his statement said. “[M]y early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.” With characteristic care, he also left a short note at the scene for emergency personnel. “I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide,” he wrote. “I apologize to you for the mess.” None of Buckel’s family or friends were aware of his intent, and we will never know for certain whether pre-existing mental distress may have contributed to his decision to take his life. But his writing made it clear he viewed his death in political terms and hoped it would galvanize mass action. His statement referred to the Buddhist monks who have burned themselves to death to protest against the occupation of Tibet. As someone who came of age during the Vietnam war, he was also surely familiar with the iconic photograph of Thich Quang Duc, a Saigon monk who self-immolated to protest against South Vietnamese persecution of Buddhists. He may have also known of Norman Morrison, a Quaker who killed himself in front of the Pentagon to protest against the Vietnam war. Around the same period, Jan Palach, a university student in Prague, self-immolated in an attempt to rally Czechoslovaks against Soviet occupation. Before he died of his burns, Palach said his target was less the Soviet regime itself than the fatalism and despair he feared had overcome his fellow citizens. Despite the risk of copycats, most people who have committed political self-immolation have indicated that they hoped to inspire mass mobilization, not further death. Sometimes mobilization does come: when Mohamed Bouazizi, an impoverished fruit vendor in Tunisia, set himself on fire in 2011 to protest government corruption, it catalyzed a mass protest that toppled the country’s dictatorship and inspired similar movements across the Arab world. It is difficult to say why some incidents of self-immolation are perceived as mental health tragedies and others as considered political acts; why some became enduring political iconography and others are relegated to obscurity; and why some catalyze change and others don’t. Buckel had led a distinguished legal career, and worked on famous cases including the Nebraska hate crime that inspired the film Boys Don’t Cry; for that reason, as well as the shocking circumstances of his death, his death received national news coverage. But in a reactive 24-hour news cycle, the story was rapidly buried by the ongoing drama of the Mueller investigation and airstrikes on Syria. The mass action Buckel had hoped for did not come. There was no Prague spring or Tunisian revolution for the planet. Writing in the New York Times less than a week later, the novelist Nathan Englander asked why Buckel’s death received so little attention compared with the “AR-15-level attention that we give the very worst among us”, mass killers. The muted response was probably, in part, an understandable reluctance to glorify suicide. A profile of Buckel in the Times, investigating what might have driven a seemingly healthy man to set himself on fire, acknowledged that the question was mostly impossible to answer. But perhaps there were even more fundamental, unresolvable questions making otherwise sympathetic people uneasy: was Buckel’s death an act of optimism, or surrender? And what is individual responsibility, when confronted by the seemingly insurmountable crisis of a rapidly changing planet? Buckel grew up in upstate New York, one of five children; his father was an agricultural consultant and his mother a florist. As a child he spent some time working on his relatives’ farm, but he was troubled by the slaughter of animals and later became a pescatarian. He met Kaelber while living in Rochester, and they later moved to New York, where they eventually settled near Prospect Park. They shared their home with a lesbian couple with whom they were co-raising a college-aged daughter. Buckel loved the natural world and had a lifelong commitment to environmental issues. His work as a lawyer, however, focused on poverty law and LGBT rights. He spent the bulk of his career at Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights organization based in New York. In the 1990s, when Buckel joined Lambda, LGBT rights were on shaky and sometimes non-existent legal footing. Homosexuality was banned in the military; some states still enforced sodomy laws; and most LGBT rights organizations were focused on securing basic employment and housing protections for gay people and fighting HIV/Aids discrimination. Marriage was far, far away. The legal arm of the gay rights movement was a long-shot insurgency, and attorneys working on LGBT issues sometimes felt as if they were in a jurisprudential wild west. “At the time it felt like, ‘There is no law here, there is no opening for this – so we’re just going to make one,’” Beatrice Dohrn, a former Lambda colleague of Buckel’s, told me. “Once gay rights had more legal footing the landscape changed. But at the time we really were kind of outlaws.” It would be easy, and not totally incorrect, to describe Buckel – fastidious in his habits and devoted to his work – as a strait-laced but formidable lawyer who excelled at working within the system to change it. In one sense, Dohrn said, he was. But that image would obscure his anti-establishment streak. “That suit he always wore?” she said. “That wasn’t David. That was something he forced himself into.” “David was a funny person with a wry, and sharp, wit,” Suzanne Goldberg, another former Lambda colleague, told me. In a parody of the conventions of legal correspondence, he sometimes signed his documents “DB/afq” – “David Buckel/another fucking queer”. He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives But he was also “a careful and deeply committed lawyer”, Goldberg said – a “meticulous” person who brought intense sense of purpose to his work. “He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives as a result of discrimination or harassment.” Although a private person, he radiated sincere interest in others. When you were in conversation with him, Dohrn said, you felt as if you were “the only person in the room”, so intense was his attention. He would ask question after question about your life and interests, listening carefully to the answers, then asking more. You could talk for ages, and only later realize that you never learned anything about him. Advocating for LGBT rights often meant navigating a legal framework in which anti-gay logics were “baked in”, Dohrn said. Lawyers and activists were sometimes forced to accept homophobic premises in order to achieve tactical wins. “A lot of lawyers would look for loopholes in the law, but we were like, ‘No, I don’t want to win that way.’” Buckel exemplified the second attitude. He believed in the righteousness of the cause, and seemed buoyed by faith in human nature. His refusal to compromise and his tendency to embrace uphill battles sometimes vexed his more pragmatic colleagues. Evan Wolfson, a former colleague, praised Buckel’s work but said he sometimes tended to “categorical” or “rigid” thinking. He could be “very black-and-white, very un-nuanced in his initial appraisals of things, and because he was also very methodical and very serious, we would have to kind of reel him back in, or open up a gradation, or try to persuade him to see a more flexible alternative”. His support for pursuing cases in conservative states – Utah, Iowa, Nebraska – considered poor soil for gay rights activism did, however, lead to several landmark victories. And he was also ahead of the curve in embracing issues – such as rights and protections for LGBT youth – regarded at the time as tangential or tactically risky. “The right wing was still very fixated on this idea that we – gay people – were trying to indoctrinate young people”, Dohrn said. To avoid encouraging that trope, gay groups tended to steer clear of issues involving youth. Buckel, however, urged Lambda to take more cases defending young people. They included Nabozny v Podlesny (1996), which determined that schools have a duty to protect students from bullying because of their sexuality; and East High Gay Straight Alliance v Board of Education of Salt Lake City (1999), which overturned the school district’s “unwritten policy” against gay-friendly student groups. He also worked on Dale v Boy Scouts of America (2000), an unsuccessful attempt to force the organization to end its then ban on gay members. He was also an early advocate for transgender rights, which Wolfson said he views as Buckel’s signature achievement at Lambda. In 1993, in Nebraska, two men raped Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old trans man. Teena reported the crime to the local sheriff’s department. The sheriff not only failed to take the allegation seriously, but tipped off the rapists, who murdered Teena and two witnesses. The events inspired a 1998 documentary, The Brandon Teena Story, and the 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry, for which Hilary Swank, portraying Teena, won an Academy award for best actress. With the support of Lambda and other organizations, Teena’s mother, JoAnn Brandon, sued the sheriff’s office and county government. In 2001, the Nebraska supreme court ruled that the sheriff had violated a duty to protect Teena. On the Teena case and others, Buckel’s talent for listening was crucial to earning clients’ trust, Dohrn said; his most powerful weapon was often his empathy. Buckel had always been a conservationist and he had “a revulsion for excess consumption”, Dohrn said. He brought his lunch to work every day in the blue plastic bag in which his morning paper was delivered. When he was looking for a home in Brooklyn, he was determined to find one near a park. He loved gardening and gave plants as gifts. When he retired from Lambda in 2008, it seemed like a good time to devote himself to the environment. While working on grant applications, he became interested in the Red Hook Community Farms. The lot had a small compost site that he believed was underused. With the aid of a grant from the sanitation department, he began expanding the operation into one that could process several tons of compost a week. He was determined to run the compost site, now supported by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the city government, using only human power and sustainable electricity. At the time it was generally considered difficult, if not impossible, to run a large-scale composting operation without significant help from machines. He threw himself at the challenge of proving that thinking wrong, and succeeded. “David often said that if he hadn’t become a lawyer he would have become an engineer,” Kaelber said. “He loved puzzles. In this case the puzzle was how to create a community composting site that didn’t have rats and vermin, that didn’t smell, that didn’t have the negative things people associate with composting. He believed it could be done.” Domingo Morales, now one of the site’s managers, considers Buckel his mentor. “He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known,” he said. His meticulousness was key to the site’s sustainability and scalability. “Whenever David sent an email to someone it was always a page long. He would answer all these questions that you might have.” Buckel was always upbeat when talking to volunteers, but privately he expressed more doubt. “He was realistic, in the sense that he knew we were barely scratching the surface,” Morales said. “There were times we would get into these discussions on the environment,” Morales said, “and they would get very dark. I got the sense from David that he didn’t really blame other people, but that he kind of considered himself to blame. Any environmental injustice, anything going wrong with the world – he didn’t just get mad at other people, he was mad at himself.” He walked a mile to work every day, to avoid using fossil fuels. He was painstakingly frugal in his habits. He tinkered with the compost processes for ever-greater efficiency. He seemed almost embarrassed of his own life on earth – the space he occupied; the resources he expended – and constantly sought new ways to offset what he viewed as his cost. But it never felt like enough. “I think some of David’s distress was just all that was going on,” Kaelber said. “The gutting of the [Environmental Protection Agency] since the election of Trump; the complete denial of climate change and the science behind it; the fact that they want to open more and more land to oil and gas drilling, instead of focusing on sustainable solutions.” During a conversation about two years before he died, Buckel asked Morales what he thought of the self-immolating Tibetan monks. They argued about the ethics of killing oneself as protest. Morales felt it was a foolish method of protest, especially if someone is a parent or spouse with obligations to living people, but Buckel felt it was an honorable act, maybe the most honorable act one can do. None of his friends or family noticed anything unusual in the days leading up to his death, but Kaelber said he was upset by news that Scott Pruitt, then head of the EPA, was rolling back numerous environmental regulations. Saturday 14 April was a mild day, good weather for composting, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Early in the morning, Morales remembers, “he texted me: ‘Hey, Domingo, I’m going to be out sick today.’ The past couple months he had been training me to run the site without him, but I thought nothing of it. So I said: ‘OK, cool, hope you’re all right, feel better.’ Then a few minutes later he emailed me the letter he sent the news outlets, with an additional note at the top to me. He apologized for leaving the way he did, and leaving me with this responsibility. He told me he was proud of me, personally and successfully, and he ended with a little joke, saying I should hire some temps. He was basically saying ‘the site must go on.’” Those who knew and loved Buckel wrestle with how to talk about his death. At his memorial service, one of the women with whom he and Kaelber were co-raising their daughter articulated the dilemma: they didn’t want to ignore the deep personal desperation they believe influenced his decision, but they also didn’t want to detract from his dedication to causes that meant a lot to him. His statement explaining his death is not a tightly argued, lawyerly brief, peppered with dire statistics about global warming; although it mentions pollution, the actual words “climate change” or “global warming” do not appear. The letter often feels more like a statement of frustration with human nature than about climate change, and reading it buttresses the sense, expressed by some who knew him, that he might have been using his political anxieties to rationalize a decision he had already made. “[My] privilege,” he wrote, is “feeling heavier than responsibility met.” But his concerns about the planet are clear; and, whether or not one agrees with the decision, so was his explanation for his self-immolation. “You know, it was a very conscious, deliberate choice he made,” Kaelber told me. “Not that I was aware of it beforehand. But he never did anything that wasn’t deliberate.” Dohrn, his former colleague, said: “I don’t think we can treat his death like it was a valiant, valid decision unaffected by things that hopefully people will get care for.” But “if his death is going to garner attention outside the immediate circle of people who are grieving – if it is going to have a public component – then I think that public component should reflect the issue he connected his death to”. During her eulogy, Buckel’s niece, Carrie Bryant, said: “David, I promise you – we promise you – that we will give voice to those who have been silenced; we will give love to those who need it; we will tend to this, our beloved great Earth; and we will honor you,” through “simple, individual acts, as you so courageously did to make this world a more loving and just place”. She added: “This much we owe to you.” Buckel hoped his death would catalyze immediate action. It didn’t. By apparent coincidence, however, the anniversary of his death, however, will overlap with what could be the largest-ever direct action over climate change. Extinction Rebellion, an international activist group, is planning a global wave of civil disobedience the week of 14 April. Extinction Rebellion, and similar groups such as the Sunrise Movement, believe mass civil disobedience is the most effective way to break through passivity and pressure governments to take concrete action on the climate. As a dry run of sorts, members of Extinction Rebellion were recently arrested in New York for blocking Fifth Avenue. In London, members stripped partly naked in parliament. Eve Mosher, a spokewoman, told me that the group hopes for hundreds of headline-grabbing arrests this month. The climate movement may be gaining momentum after all, even if Buckel didn’t live to see it. Yesterday, at the site where he died, Extinction Rebellion held a “funeral” for the species that have gone extinct because of climate change. He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves From everything we understand, climate change is a tragedy of the commons on a vast scale. Addressing it will require human beings do a lot of things they aren’t naturally inclined to do, like make short-term sacrifices for the sake of long-term common good: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that as early as 2030 the earth may warm 1.5C (2.7F) over pre-industrial levels – and that 1.5C is the highest level the planet can sustain without entering the realm of the catastrophic. Just limiting warming to that level will require, the IPCC said, mobilization of a scale with “no documented historic precedent”. It’s a sobering thought, and it invites the kind of fatalism that Buckel hoped to fight against. “I don’t think you can say he was either ‘pessimistic’ or ‘optimistic’” about human nature, Kaelber said. “He was more complicated than that. He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves.” He added: “If people want to honor David’s life they should look at how they can get involved, politically and in their own personal lives, in combating climate change.” His voice cracked with emotion. “In the thing that David wrote, the most meaningful part, to me, was: in the aggregated acts of millions of individuals, that is how change is going to occur.” Guests of the memorial service received tree saplings. Perhaps in 10 years, Kaelber told me, he will go visit them all and see what they have become. Buckel’s friends and family are also building a grove of trees on the space where he died. They have planted some dogwoods, staggered to bloom at different times. Kaelber hopes it will become a gathering place for contemplation, but also a place where people might hold community meetings to organize against global warming. “He always loved trees,” Kaelber said. He hopes the site will become known as David’s Grove. Beatrice Dohrn also told me a story about Buckel’s love of plants. “You know, in 1997 I had a breakup that I grieved very hard, and David, as if to cheer me up, gave me a jade plant. I’ve kept it for many, many years, and at some point it almost died,” she said. “It was down to a stump. But for some reason I didn’t give up on it.” • In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Maldives in the Indian Ocean have long been used by global warming alarmists to drive home the dangers of rising sea levels should polar ice sheets keep melting because of man-made global warming.

In 2012 former President of the Maldive Islands Mohamed Nasheed said: “If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today, my country will be underwater in seven years.”
With such a prediction and recalling how the latest UN IPCC report boosted its estimate of sea level rise, and taking into account that CO2 emissions show no signs of abating, you would think the Maldives would be the last place developers would build anything. The Maldives are barely more than a meter above sea level on average.
But according to veteran Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke at his Die Welt blog here in a piece titled Tourist industry does not believe in the downfall of the Maldives, this is not at all the case. Kulke writes:

30 additional new luxury class hotel complexes are planned for the next 6 to 10 years, never mind the countless smaller homes. Tourism is currently increasing 20% annually.”
Whatever is really behind all the rising sea level scare stories, huge commercial investors are obviously dismissing them. If anything, these scare stories are providing lots of publicity for the islands’ tourism industry. Already more than 1 million tourists are flocking to the islands every year and, Kulke writes, Nasheed says the islands can handle many more.
Kulke writes, “Environmental protection in the Maldives is practically non-existent.”
Moreover he suggests that the climate change issue is being used by Nasheed to generate lots of cash:
At the big climate conferences – and supposedly also in Warsaw in two weeks – Nasheed meets regularly to milk cash compensation from climate-sinning countries on behalf of his country and other island nations (on which environmental protection plays a subordinate role). Almost the entire supply of energy on the island for the millions of tourists flowing in, by the way, is produced by diesel generators, this while Nasheed continues to press for foreign countries to switch over to renewable energies.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen it comes to the climate debate, everyone knows that it really all boils down to how much is man’s impact. It has nothing to do with whether climate is changing or not. It always has.
The core question is how accurate are the climate models and are they really accurate enough to use for policymaking?
Skeptics have long argued that the models use a climate sensitivity for a doubling of Co2 that is much too high…even preposterously high. The alarmists, on the other hand, insist that it isn’t, and that the models are pretty much on target. Now that climate models have been making predictions for well over 15 years, we now have enough data to make a preliminary call.
If the models are right, then the observed temperature should be following the trend predicted of the ensemble of models. But if the two trends are diverging, then the models are inaccurate and should be revamped. C3 Headlines here has posted a chart comparing observed (blue) to model trend (red):

 Chart comparing model projections to observed temperature. The last few months have shown a record divergence. Chart: C3 Headlines.
As the above chart shows, the divergence between modeled temperature and observed is setting new records with every passing month. The divergence for the 36-month moving average is now at about 0.35°C, already an embarrassment for the climate modellers.

Even more stunning, the rate of divergence using the second order fitted trends shows that the models are performing even far worse than we thought. Rather than depicting a steady divergence, the curves show that the divergence is actually accelerating!
The following shows what the divergence will look like in about 10 years time should the current observed trend continue, i.e. a slight warming:

Extrapolating about 10 years out. By 2025, the divergence will be 0.6°C (and even more if the earth cools, which many scientists are projecting).
What does this all mean? Should the trend continue over the next decade or so, the error will be greater with each passing year, and it won’t be long before it’s glaring. Even the trickiest graphic layouts and chart manipulations soon will not be able to hide the gaping difference.
So even if the current decade manages to be a little warmer than the last, the model error will still be sticking out more than ever.
Time is truly on the side of the skeptics. For the alarmists, it is running out – fast!

"Day four of Extinction Rebellion, which has been a phenomenal success, as climate protesters occupy four pressure points in Britain’s congested capital. Everything has conspired to maximise attention for their climate cause, with the news unnaturally quiet in this pause in Brexit hostilities.  Compared to Brexit rage and fury, climate protesters are the soul of peace and goodwill, their pink boat welcoming Oxford Street shoppers, who mainly stop to talk. The surprisingly few police are friendly, with the 400 arrests curiously voluntary, people well-warned in advance so those who can’t be arrested step back. Is it true the police cuts have left too little capacity to arrest everyone? Two officers laugh: “You might say that, we couldn’t possibly comment”. The sun shines on them as Waterloo Bridge is magically transformed into the Boris Johnson £53m garden bridge that never was, with a long line of trees in big pots down the middle and rows of flowers. The calm of the carless river crossing is a good advertisement for how cities might be. “Come and join us, take time off work,” Gail Bradbrook, one of the organisers, exhorted Today programme listeners this morning. She’s right. All who can should be there. Those in tree-hugging outfits and carnival costumes may attract the cameras – but gathered here are all ages and occupations. The school strikes, started by the remarkable Greta Thunberg, caught the imagination around the world, just as this protest is echoed in 80 cities, from India to the US. Challenged by Nick Robinson for the nuisance caused, Bradbrook said “It gets you on the Today programme” – and that’s the blunt truth. By another stroke of protesters’ luck, tonight David Attenborough delivers his most devastating warning yet in BBC One’s Climate Change: The Facts. In the past the BBC has been criticised for avoiding climate controversy in its phenomenally successful, world bestselling Attenborough nature franchise. No longer. Possibly spurred on by Netflix poaching Attenborough for its more polemical series, the gloves are off. “If we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies,” he says. The 92-year-old naturalist speaks with resounding authority, as scientists lay out the undeniable evidence of what 1C extra heat has done already, and what risks becoming unstoppable. Among horrifying footage of wildfires, ice cliffs crumbling into the sea and permafrost melting to release methane many times more damaging than CO2, come eye-watering particulars: one foot of Louisiana is being lost every 45 minutes to rising sea levels. “It’s hard to exaggerate the peril we are in,” he says. But as ever, how do we turn the Attenborough evidence and public protest into politics? We have been here before in 2006 when Gordon Brown brought over Al Gore to show his equally devastating film, An Inconvenient Truth. I thought then this might be a political tipping point. At least now the UK climate deniers are trounced: the BBC rightly refuses them airtime. But guiltily, I am well aware that every day we obsess in the media about other things is another day lost to the monumental, all-consuming threat to the planet and humanity. Greta Thunberg tells us to stop “talking about taxes or Brexit” and focus on the survival of life on earth. It’s almost too big to think about. Or there is nothing new to say. The left/right divide has been a disaster: even if the respectable right no longer seriously denies climate change, it balks at solutions that look collectivist and socialist. Indeed, the need to take climate action, the need for state investment in a green new deal, gives new impetus to socialist thinking – an all-too-convenient excuse, the right suspects. Inequality blocks every remedy: how do you make everyone cut down on fossil fuels without helping the poor in cold homes and old cars, and giving aid to poorer countries in order to redistribute the pain? If the US, China, India or anywhere else isn’t doing enough, why should we? Reasons why politicians do too little are legion. As Larry Elliot writes today, it helps that Mark Carney of the Bank of England is warning of catastrophic financial consequences. Will he follow that through in everything the bank does? Extinction Rebellion wants net zero carbon emissions by 2025: existing targets are being badly missed. Protesters point to fracking, new coal mines, new incinerators and a Heathrow extension as perverse government polices. The government’s effective ban on land-based wind power just as it became profitable, to appease shire voters, was shocking. So was the sudden withdrawal of solar subsidies and the feed-in tariff, just as that industry was taking off, causing an immediate loss of 12,000 solar jobs. The government has asked the independent Committee on Climate Change to review its targets, results to be published shortly. What’s needed is a translation of fear into acceptable politics: the protesters are wise to demand a citizens’ assembly to examine all the evidence and gain public consent for what needs to be done outside the left-right battle-lines of conventional politics. The government should seize on that. Let’s hope the protest ends as elegantly as it has been conducted. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn my last post I wrote about how German public broadcasting network Deutsche Welle is holding a 3 day conference dubbed: Climate Change and the Media, which features a number of let’s-save-the-planet and let’s-redefine-journalism workshops. Click list of workshops. You’ll find some real doozies. Here are some interesting ones, in case you’re interested in attending.Psychotherapist Mark Bayne
One workshop: It’s about Attitudes: Understanding and Reporting the Psychology of Climate Change, is chaired by former BBC foreign correspondent turned psychotherapist Mark Brayne. In a German interview here, he:
 …is convinced that our media in its current form is overwhelmed and cannot handle this core task of the 21st century.
Bayne is also convinced that as long as politicians, business leaders and voters don’t grasp just how critical the situation is, there will be no chance for a change in opinion, and adds:
And what is the most powerful tool when it comes to changing how people think? The media!  In our reporting, we have to portray the coming collapse as unavoidable. Ironically, that could be the only chance to prevent it – maybe.”
I’d say here, we aren’t the ones in urgent need of psychotherapy.
Advocacy Media
Here’s another journalist workshop: Coverage vs. advocacy – Does the media guide or reflect cultural shift?. It calls on considering media advocacy in place of just plain old coverage.

‘Media advocacy isn’t about a mass audience. It’s not about reaching everybody. It’s about targeting the two or three per hundred who’ll get involved and make a difference. It’s about starting a chain reaction. And reaching critical mass.’
Informing the public is not enough; now it has to be told how to think. Does Germany still sound like a democratic country? Perhaps more and more like the old German Democratic Republic (East Germany – the one that built a wall to keep its people from running away).
Behavioural Changes Are Necessary 
The objective of another workshop Fragile environments in the Himalaya region – The responsibility of local media is to change human behaviour:
This workshop will examine the state of climate change effects now and in the near future and will analyze the role the local media can play in educating people about the environment and the behavioural changes necessary as a result of global warming.
I’m not making this up – it’s for real!
Clearly, with this conference, the publically funded Deutsche Welle is calling for a more dictated news reporting. But should this dictatorial approach be a surprise? Not really. A look at how German public radio and TV are  funded can tell you something about how these media elites operate. In Germany, all radio and TV owners are required to pay hefty licensing fees every year. The fees are collected by an organisation called GEZ – where they are often collected by plainclothes officials who go door-to-door busting fee-shirkers. It’s not enough that they take our money, now they want to tell us how to think and behave too.
Obsessed and drunk with something, the German media are going off course from journalism to thought control. Sound familiar?

"Compared with similar countries Australia is performing poorly when it comes to tackling homelessness and keeping cost of living down, and its electricity supply is more polluting, less reliable and more expensive. These are some of the findings from the Grattan Institute’s Orange Book published on Tuesday night, which sets policy reform priorities for the next government and rates Australia’s performance in areas such as health, housing, education, and energy.  There is also a crisis of trust in politicians, the report says, which over time risked undermining representative democracy. “Australian cynicism is now at an all time high ... Widespread loss of trust can make legislating policy change more complex, because it is harder for governments without political capital to enact ‘difficult but necessary’ reforms,” the report says. “While there are many causes of falling trust and exasperation with the political establishment, one is the growing sense that people in government look after their own interests, or those of powerful groups, rather than the public interest.” Grattan chief executive and lead author of the report John Daly said there were some positives, with retirement incomes generally sufficient [except for renters], and affordable health and education. But on many social issues, Australia rated poorly. “These are evidence-based policy recommendations designed to serve the interests of all Australians rather than sectional interests,” Daly said. The report says the next federal government should focus on tax reform, with some current tax arrangements “a big drag on economic growth”. Income tax should be reduced, while welfare and childcare means tests should be modified to remove barriers and increase incentives for women and older people to participate in the workforce. The report says that to pay for these changes and avoid other tax increases, the capital gains tax discount should be cut from 50% to 25%, while negative gearing should be wound back through quarantining wage and salary income so that passive investment losses can only be written off against other investment income. The GST should also be increased or broadened. To increase workforce participation of older Australians, the report suggests investigating the costs and benefits of raising the pension age to 70. Despite a push from various politicians for people to look beyond major cities and move to regional and rural areas, the Grattan Institute says the federal government should instead be lobbying the states to change planning laws to allow more medium-density housing in established suburbs. “It is not that people will not move to the regions: they did so in large numbers when the mining investment boom presented attractive job opportunities. However, it seems that the living and employment conditions currently on offer in some regional areas are not attractive enough to Australians to induce more internal or overseas migrants.” Carolyn Whitzman. a professor of urban planning at the university of Melbourne, said people would always prefer to live where jobs and opportunities were. “The strong preference is always going to be for the central city and there is a certain lock-the-gate aspect, with lots of people moving into the cities and then saying ‘there’s no more room’. “This issue isn’t a failure of immigration policy; it’s a failure of planning.” The Orange Book calls for a universal dental care scheme, and a comprehensive review of the private health sector, including private health insurance. It says rates of complications and questionable care in hospitals should be made public, a move also being called for by the Consumers Health Forum. The report said pharmacists should be able to provide repeat prescriptions with the agreement of doctors and patients, and work with doctors to help patients manage chronic conditions. But it said overall, the health system was affordable and resulting in Australians living longer. A health policy analyst with the Centre for Policy Development, Jennifer Doggett, said the Grattan report needed to be stronger on health equity. “Yes, our health system performs well overall but the gap between those of us who get the best outcomes and those who miss out is huge. The gap between the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non-Indigenous people means that Indigenous Australians have a life expectancy less than that of people in North Korea,” she said. “This is not just a health system problem but part of the solution needs to involve an explicit focus within the health system on addressing inequity.” She said though the health system worked well “on paper” this was partly due to the uncounted time and resources that consumers and their carers were forced to contribute to coordinating and managing their care. Doggett welcomed the call for powerful lobby groups to be held to account but said that would involve the government of the day taking on these groups. “It is not clear that either side of politics is prepared to do this,” she said. The government must “finish the job” on school funding by reintroducing the demand-driven higher education system, and control costs by increasing repayment of HELP debt. It also says entry into teaching should be made more prestigious, partly by pushing for prospective teachers to have an Atar (Australian tertiary admission rank) of about 80 or above. Prospective students should also be given more information about their chances of course completion, the report says. “Dis-enrol students who are not engaged with their studies so they don’t incur HELP debt.” The deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek has said if universities did not move to lift standards, a Labor government would move to make Atar caps mandatory. New school reform initiatives should be avoided unless evidence shows they are a good idea, and any government intervention should help and not hinder, the report said. A co-author of the Grattan report, Dr Peter Goss, said over the course of decades the academic backgrounds of teachers had weakened. “As a result of feminism women had more career choices so bright women were no longer pushed into teaching, which is great, but not good for schools,” Goss said. “We’re concerned less about how do you cut off the lowest-ranked teachers, and much more concerned about how to send a signal to young people that education is a course for high achievers and career opportunities.” The report calls for a code of conduct to be introduced for all parliamentarians on conflicts of interest. A Commonwealth Integrity Commission should be established to investigate corrupt and high-risk misconduct in the public sector, and investigate tip-offs. “Cap expenditure on political advertising during election campaigns, and lower the donations disclosure threshold to $5,000,” the report says. “Require political parties to aggregate donations below the threshold, and introduce ‘real time’ disclosure of donations. Publish ministerial diaries.” All lobbyists who enter parliament house should be subject to the Lobbying Code of Conduct, which should be enforced by criminal penalties, the report says. The report urges the incoming government to develop a credible climate change policy. “Our political leaders must be honest with voters: Australia needs to move to a low-emissions economy, and that transition will cost money,” the report says. “A raft of reforms to electricity generation, distribution and retailing are also required to push down energy costs.” While economy-wide carbon price would be the best way to reduce emissions, in the absence of the political consensus needed to implement the best policy, “we should work with what we have,” it says. “The work of the past two years means the incoming federal government, whether Coalition or Labor, will have the content and should have the political opportunity to introduce a stable and credible emissions reduction policy for the electricity sector. Reverting to subsidies and direct government funding would almost certainly be less effective and less efficient.” The report did not examine Indigenous affairs, foreign affairs and trade, most immigration issues, defence and security, law and order, industrial relations, communications, agriculture, many welfare payments, or human services because they have not been part of Grattan’s research."
