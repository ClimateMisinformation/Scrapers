"A vast river network that once carried water for hundreds of miles across Western Sahara has been discovered under the parched sands of Mauritania. Radar images taken from a Japanese Earth observation satellite spotted the ancient river system beneath the shallow, dusty surface, apparently winding its way from more than 500km inland towards the coast.  The buried waterway may have formed part of the proposed Tamanrasett River that is thought to have flowed across parts of Western Sahara in ancient times from sources in the southern Atlas mountains and Hoggar highlands in what is now Algeria. The French-led team behind the discovery believe the river carried water to the sea during the periodic humid spells that took hold in the region over the past 245,000 years. Water may last have coursed through the channels 5,000 years ago. The river would have helped people, plants and wildlife to thrive in what is now desert land, and would have carried nutrients crucial for marine organisms far into the sea. Were it still flowing today, the river system would rank 12th among the largest on Earth, the researchers write in the journal Nature Communications. Images taken from the satellite revealed that the hidden river beds aligned almost perfectly with a huge underwater canyon that extends off the coast of Mauritania into waters more than three kilometres deep. First mapped in 2003, the Cap Timiris Canyon is 2.5km wide and a kilometre deep in places. Russell Wynn at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton was among the researchers who created the first 3D map of the canyon from the German Meteor research vessel. Sediment cores brought up from the canyon bottom contained fine-grained river-borne particles that suggested a massive river had first formed, and later fed into, the deep channel carved into the continental shelf. “It’s a great geological detective story and it confirms more directly what we had expected. This is more compelling evidence that in the past there was a very big river system feeding into this canyon,” said Wynn, who was not involved in the latest study. “It tells us that as recently as five to six thousand years ago, the Sahara desert was a very vibrant, active river system.” In full flow, the river would have carried organic material from the land out into the ocean, where it sustained a rich ecosystem of filter feeders and other organisms in the canyon. But the river was destructive too, occasionally sending rapid, turbulent rushes of water and sediment down the canyon. Similar flows are still active off the coast of Taiwan today, and hold enough power to destroy submarine cables and other infrastructure. “People sometimes can’t get their head around climate change and how quickly it happens. Here’s an example where within just a couple of thousand years, the Sahara went from being wet and humid, with lots of sediment being transported into the canyon, to something that’s arid and dry,” Wynn said. "
"The Earth’s climate will enter a new “permanent reality” from next year when concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are likely to pass a historic milestone, the head of the UN’s weather agency has warned. The record concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were up 43% since pre-industrial times, said the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), prompting its secretary general Michel Jarraud to say immediate action was needed to cut CO2 emissions. The WMO’s latest greenhouse gas bulletin comes just three weeks before world leaders including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping and David Cameron meet in Paris in a bid to reach a new deal on cutting emissions. Concentrations of CO2 stood at a global annual average of 397.7ppm in 2014, up from about 278ppm in 1750, and the UN said the global annual average is likely to pass the symbolic 400ppm milestone in 2016. Scientists say that the ‘safe’ level of CO2 to avoid dangerous global warming is more like 350ppm.  “We will soon be living with globally averaged CO2 levels above 400 parts per million as a permanent reality,” said Jarraud. “We can’t see CO2. It is an invisible threat, but a very real one. It means hotter global temperatures, more extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, melting ice, rising sea levels and increased acidity of the oceans. This is happening now and we are moving into uncharted territory at a frightening speed,” he said. The increase in CO2 concentrations from 2013 to 2014 was 1.9ppm CO2, slightly lower than the mean for the last decade of 2.06ppm, but higher than the 1990s mean of 1.5ppm. The WMO also warned that the rising Earth surface temperature caused by these record CO2 concentrations created a vicious circle when it comes to water vapour. Higher temperatures lead to more atmospheric water vapour, which in turn traps even more heat.  Jarraud said that each year he announced new records for CO2 concentrations and that to keep temperatures within manageable levels, CO2 emissions from factories, cars and power plants needed to be cut now. “The laws of physics are non-negotiable,” he said."

"The New York attorney general is investigating whether ExxonMobil misled the public and investors about the dangers and potential business risks of climate change, sources familiar with the investigation said on Thursday. The company confirmed that it had received a subpoena from Eric Schneidermann, the New York attorney general, for financial records, email and other documents related to climate change.  Peabody Energy, the world’s biggest private coal company, is also under investigation, the legal sources confirmed. The two giants of the fossil fuel industry – Exxon and Peabody – have long come under criticism from environmental and science groups for funding climate denial front groups, and spreading disinformation about climate science. Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both called for investigations into Exxon, following revelations that the company knew for decades about the dangers of climate change, but continued to cast doubt about the science. The oil company denied the allegations, and said it had been forthcoming about the business risks of climate change in its shareholder and other reports. “We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research contained in media reports that are inaccurate distortions of ExxonMobil’s nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with the Department of Energy, academics and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” Richard Keil, a spokesman, said in an emailed statement. In Exxon’s case, the investigation will focus on any inconsistencies between the company’s knowledge of climate change – from its own in-house team of scientists and other experts – and its filings to the Securities Exchange Commission and other government regulatory agencies, the sources said. “The fundamental question is whether they were misleading the public and investors by having financial reports inconsistent with what they knew to be the science,” the sources said. “It could include the funding of climate denial science. It could involve funding straight science that showed the impact of climate change.” The investigators could make use of a New York statute known as the Martin Act which, it is believed, would make it easier to secure a conviction than under financial regulations. The investigation, first reported by the New York Times, follows investigations by Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times which revealed the company for decades disregarded the findings of its own top-flight science. The Guardian reported last July that Exxon’s own scientists were aware as early as 1981 that climate change could spell trouble for the oil business – years before global warming become a broad public concern.  The investigation by Inside Climate News pushed the clock on Exxon’s knowledge of climate change back even further to the 1970s. However, the company for years continued to cast doubt on whether climate change was occurring or was caused by the burning of fossil fuels. An investigation by Greenpeace found the company spent more than $30m spreading confusion about climate science before making a public commitment to end funding such front groups in 2008. However, Exxon continued to fund members of Congress who deny climate change such as Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican.  In the case of Peabody Energy, the company first disclosed in its SEC filings that it was under investigation. The world’s largest privately held coal company, Peabody Energy has pushed back aggressively on efforts to fight climate change, claiming that fossil fuels were essential to ending global poverty. The World Bank and other major financial institutions reject such arguments. Last year, at the height of the Ebola crisis, the company even went so far as to suggest that expanding coal use would have helped stop the public health crisis."

"English speakers are the least optimistic about humanity’s chances of avoiding dangerous climate change, according to a survey of readers in English, French, German and Italian conducted by the Guardian, Le Monde, Süddeutsche Zeitung and La Stampa. Among those who answered the questionnaire in English – mainly respondents in the UK, but also some from the US, Canada, Australia and across Europe – 64% were less optimistic than they were five years ago that humanity would be able to avoid dangerous climate change, 12% were more optimistic and 24% said they felt the same as they did in 2010. The Italians were the most hopeful, with 26% saying they felt more optimistic about the issue now than they did five years ago and 41% saying their feelings had not changed on the issue. Out of more than 6,000 self-selecting respondents, many expressed dismay at the slow pace of political action on climate change.   In the UK, there was a strong tendency among respondents to try to reduce their personal carbon footprint. Individuals focused on cutting back on eating meat, switching off appliances, changing the way houses are heated and swapping to low-carbon forms of transport.  “I don’t drive, I cycle or take public transport. I choose to live a vegetarian lifestyle and I switch off all electronics when not in use. It’s only small steps, but if the whole world followed with little things like this, it would have a huge overall impact in reducing carbon emissions,” said Lucy Ambler, from Manchester. Some respondents had dramatically altered their lives to reduce their impact on the environment, such as Annie, from Devon. “I haven’t taken a plane in 20 years, I have been vegan for 20 years (and vegetarian for 45 years), I try to use my car as little as possible. I produce in my home much more energy than I use, I only use rainwater to flush the loo, I try to buy only second-hand clothes and attend clothes swaps,” she wrote. “I have helped create a community orchard with my neighbours, I grow a lot of the food I eat. I have stopped owning pets (who consume meat) and instead welcome wildlife in my garden, I do not use Wi-Fi, I go round various public buildings turning lights off.” I go round public buildings turning lights off Respondents from around the world spoke of trying to cut down their transport emissions, with many saying they minimised their car use by cycling and using public transport. Many also tried to reduce the number of plane trips they went on each year. “I have never flown yet,” wrote one German respondent, in the 45-54 age bracket. A number of respondents spoke of their decision not to have children because of environmental concerns. Luke, in the 35-44 age bracket and from the UK, said that as well as adopting a vegan diet, buying local produce and eschewing plastic bottles and bags, he had decided to adopt rather than having biological children. Several respondents expressed a sense of despair that no matter how much they changed their lifestyles, unless worldwide political action occurred, it would make no difference. I have never flown yet “Anything I do would be negated by emerging economies and China,” said Connor, in the 55-64 bracket and from Lancashire. In contrast, one respondent from Mauritius, an island whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels, laid the responsibility for action at the feet of nations such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy. “It is not my responsibility. Let those who have a comfortable GDP, live in luxury, enjoying the very best in life, do the planet cleaning. Let those who have created riches by destroying the planet assume full responsibilities,” Cader wrote. According to the survey, when it comes to individual action to reduce emissions, Italians favour cycling, insulating their homes and installing solar panels. One respondent, Francesco Barsotti, said he used his bicycle for all journeys under 60km (37 miles). I tend to avoid using air conditioners and try to get food from the areas closest to me Gildo Serenego, a resident of Lombardy, said he was more worried about climate change than he used to be and had started turning down his thermostat and limiting the use of his car. “I tend to avoid using air conditioners in the summer and try to get food from the areas closest to me.” Germans prefer solar panels, changing windows for better insulation, minimising car use and travelling by train – a testament to Germany’s excellent rail system. “Our family needs less and less energy every year and we haven’t had a car for 31 years and we use local produce,” wrote Lesum, from Frankfurt. Other Germans spoke of joining tree-planting projects, ordering tap water at restaurants – environmentally friendly because it is not packaged or transported – and one respondent said he used warm water just twice a week in his energy-efficient house. While 30% of French people said they were doing nothing to reduce their emissions, a popular response among those who were taking action was to buy green electricity. Among the actions that French respondents thought their government should take was introducing policies to limit car use, introducing incentives for local food producers and a review of energy policy. French respondents also thought the government should model environmentally friendly behaviour by reducing its car fleet, cutting energy consumption of public buildings and doing away with Christmas lights. One French respondent implored the government: “Introduce unpopular laws for five or 10 years, that will produce [emissions] savings in the long term. Don’t be so preoccupied by short-term electoral problems.”"

"China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, has been dramatically underreporting the amount of coal it consumes each year, it has been claimed ahead of key climate talks in Paris. Official Chinese data, reported by the New York Times on Wednesday after being quietly released earlier this year, suggests China has been burning up to 17% more coal each year than previously disclosed by the government.   The revelation – which may mean China has emitted close to a billion additional tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year – could complicate the fight against global warming ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, which begins on 30 November.  In 2012 China consumed 600m more tonnes of coal – or more than 70% of the United States’ annual total – than previously disclosed, according to the revised data. China’s national bureau of statistics did not immediately confirm the report. However, speaking at a coal conference in Beijing, an adviser to the natural resources defence council said: “The new figures are more accurate than before.” Zhou Fengqi, the adviser, told AFP the updated figures “more accurately reflect the situation”.  Yang Fuqiang, a former Chinese energy official who advises the Natural Resources Defense Council in the US, told the New York Times: “This will have a big impact, because China has been burning so much more coal than we believed.” “It turns out that it was an even bigger emitter than we imagined. This helps to explain why China’s air quality is so poor, and that will make it easier to get national leaders to take this seriously.”  The report came as Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, said his country had a duty to humanity to bring its emissions under control. Speaking during a visit to China by the French president, François Hollande, Li said: “For a great many years, we consumed too much energy and resources to achieve our development, and this model has since become unsustainable.”  Li Shuo, the senior climate and energy policy officer for Greenpeace East Asia, said the revised data suggested a gap between official statistics and what was happening on the ground.  “It is quite a lot more than previously reported – it is basically equivalent to the whole national consumption of Germany, and Germany is a large coal-consumption country in Europe.” However, Li, who said environment experts and policymakers had been aware of the higher numbers since the start of this year, cautioned against an overly bleak reading of the figures. China is the world’s largest consumer of coal, with Chinese miners digging up 3.87bn tonnes last year alone. But Li said an economic slowdown and Beijing’s bold attempts to reduce its dependency on the fossil fuel meant consumption was now falling. “China’s coal consumption probably won’t get as high as what we saw for the past decade,” he said. “At [the very] least we are seeing a plateauing period now, which is quite significant.” Beijing was accused of wrecking climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 by opposing legally binding emissions cuts. But Li predicted China – which has pledged to hit “peak emissions” and make 20% of its energy mix renewable by 2030 – would play a more constructive role in Paris. “China is making a lot of effort and is actually getting quite proactive these days compared to six years ago in Copenhagen. Part of the reason is that they realise that their emissions portfolio is undergoing a fundamental change and that is working in their favour. That gives them the confidence … [to act] in a more positive way.” Lin Boqiang, the director of Xiamen University’s China centre for energy economics research, also downplayed the impact the revised coal data would have on the Paris talks.  “What people want to know about at the Paris summit are China’s future emissions projections. We should look forward rather than backward,” he said. “China does have huge carbon emissions but if we look forward China’s emissions will soon peak and begin to fall.” Additional reporting by Luna Lin"

"The Turnbull government’s “Direct Action” policy cannot meet even the “inadequate” emission reductions it will pledge at the UN climate meeting in Paris and in fact will allow Australia’s greenhouse pollution to rise, according to the Climate Institute. Malcolm Turnbull was forced to promise to keep Tony Abbott’s climate policy as he sought the prime ministership and has repeatedly pointed to a review scheduled for 2017 – after the next election. But institute chief executive John Connor says new policies are needed much sooner.  The institute is among the business, welfare and conservation groups pleading with political parties to unveil workable and clear climate policies. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the groups commissioned major consultancies to present on six climate policy options at a special closed-door summit this week, on the assumption that Direct Action is not sufficient to reach the 2030 emissions reduction target and will need substantial modification. In particular, the institute targets Direct Action’s “centre-piece” – the emissions reduction fund – with which the government buys carbon dioxide abatement in periodic auctions. The results of the second auction will be announced on Thursday. It says the fund might be a good add-on policy, but won’t come close to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions needed to meet Australia’s target, which the institute considers to be too weak.  The $5bn promised for the fund could buy only 14% of the emission reductions needed to achieve the target of a reduction in emissions of between 26% and 28% by 2030. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, has said another part of the policy – imposing “safeguard” baselines on high polluting electricity generators and industry – will reduce emissions by 200m tonnes by 2030. But as the institute notes, at the moment the baselines are set so leniently that emissions from industry will continue to rise. And while Hunt repeatedly claims the emissions reduction fund model is being copied around the world, Connor says nowhere else are government funds used to buy emission reduction as a country’s “core policy” or main means of carbon dioxide abatement. “Taxpayer funds should not be used to assist major polluters reduce emissions unless it can be demonstrated that no other mechanism would be as effective,” the institute said. The institute says the ERF might continue to be useful to reduce emissions from the land sector, but the government needs additional policies – including to phase out coal-fired electricity generation before 2050. The government is not expected to announce any policy changes before the Paris summit in December, but is considering options to increase its $200m contribution to the international Green Climate Fund, which will be a crucial issue at the talks. In what was seen as a shift in its stance on the global talks, Australia announced last week it had successfully sought to once again co-chair the fund, which was originally derided by Abbott before he finally agreed to contribute $200m over four years after strong international pressure. Among the ideas being discussed at officials level is setting up a Clean Energy Finance Corporation-style financing mechanism to lend money to climate projects in developing countries, supplementing the $200m in grants which was taken from the aid budget. The option would mean a funding increase would not hit the budget bottom line and is one of a number of ideas for announcements the government could make in Paris, where it will be represented at various times by Turnbull, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and Hunt. The fund is supposed to channel $100bn a year in public and private financing to developing countries by 2020. The OECD has calculated about $62bn a year has been committed, and making up the shortfall is a crucial demand from developing countries in the Paris negotiations. The former Labor government was an early donor, tipping in $500,000 in 2012 to help get the fund going, as well as almost $600m on a precursor “fast-start” fund. "
"The world must pair efforts to stabilise climate change with programmes to eliminate poverty if vulnerable people are to be kept from falling back into hardship as rising temperatures wreak havoc on food security and livelihoods, a report has said. As many as 100 million people could slide into extreme poverty because of rising temperatures, which are caused by greenhouse gas emissions, the World Bank report said. The bank’s most recent estimate puts the number of people living in extreme poverty this year at 702 million, or 9.6% of the world’s population. Climate change has led to crop failures, natural disasters, higher food prices and the spread of waterborne diseases, creating poverty and pushing people at risk into destitution, according to Shock Waves: Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty, released on Sunday. Efforts to stabilise climate change should incorporate strategies to eradicate poverty, said Stéphane Hallegatte, a senior economist at the World Bank’s climate change group and co-author of the report. “The policies, the investments, the financing, all of that should be integrated. Otherwise, we’re just less efficient.” Poor people need social safety nets and universal healthcare to sustainably eradicate poverty, according to the report. Programmes to lessen the impacts of climate change should not create new vulnerabilities and they should inform development policies by taking into account future climate conditions. “When we [build] infrastructure, for instance, [we need] to make sure it’s in a safe place today but also in a safe place with sea level rise and the change in rainfall and so on,” said Hallegatte. He added that the world needs to take urgent action to reduce the impacts of climate change if the sustainable development goal on eradicating extreme poverty is to be met. “We really want to reduce poverty before people get affected by even bigger climate impacts. It’s easier to get people out of extreme poverty now rather than doing it later,” said Hallegatte. Without proper planning, efforts to stabilise the impacts of climate change can undo decades of progress in lifting vulnerable people out of poverty, the study warned. Environmental taxes, designed to reduce emissions, can raise the cost of fuel and food, which hit poor people hardest. “These same policies can be designed to protect, and even benefit, poor people – for instance, by using fiscal resources from environmental taxes to improve social protection,” the report said. Ethiopia’s social protection and Rwanda’s health coverage have boosted long-term poverty reduction efforts in both countries, making it less likely that poor people will fall back into poverty as a result of climate change. “In most cases, what we want is a package of policies – the climate polices themselves and additional policies to smooth the transition and to support poor people in the transition,” said Hallegatte. Hallegatte is optimistic that world leaders will take urgent action to stabilise climate change, which he says will boost efforts to eradicate poverty. This year, a series of high-profile meetings took place, creating a sense of gathering momentum around the battle against global warming. A key step was the adoption of the global goals – which set a 2030 deadline for the eradication of poverty in all its forms and sought to galvanise action to combat climate change and its impacts – at the UN general assembly in September. Other milestones have included the Addis conference on financing for development and the Sendai conference on disaster risk reduction, while next month world leaders will convene in Paris for the 21st session of the conference of the parties to the UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change. “You can see there is a convergence – these conferences have been designed as a package and you can feel the urgency,” Hallegatte said. But many challenges remain. According to the report, the world needs to find $1tn (£645bn) more each year to boost key infrastructure if the goals are to be met. Climate summits have in the past been thwarted by the US and China, which have been reluctant to sacrifice economic growth for reduced emissions. Expectations for next month’s climate summit have been buoyed by fruitful talks held last year in Beijing, where China pledged to bring its emissions to a peak “around 2030”, and the US said it would cut its emissions by 26-28% of their 2005 level by 2025. Hallegatte said: “Now there is the implementation, and that’s really the challenge – to translate this willingness to act into something that makes a difference on the ground.”"
"As the world’s energy system shifts from fossil fuels to renewable sources, the question is no longer if the world will transition to sustainable energy, but how long it will take and whether the transition can be made in ways that maximise the benefits today and for future generations.  Changing our energy system is about more than replacing fossil resources with sun and wind. In fact, the economic model for renewables is completely different: 100% renewable energy can lead us to a more equal distribution of wealth.  The differences start in the way our energy system is structured. The fossil fuel-based energy system is characterised by complex, centralised infrastructures where the fuel is transported to the power plant, and energy production and distribution is controlled by very few entities. The supply chain is vertical, and the benefits are shared only among a few stakeholders.  Most renewable energies offer opportunities for more decentralised energy production and consumption. They have a horizontal supply chain and require innovation in infrastructure and energy markets. New stakeholders – including citizens, farmers and small businesses – are entering the system. They claim ownership rights and have direct impacts on the implementation.  While many energy experts and governments see citizen participation and the involvement of communities as a necessity to ensure acceptance and avoid nimbyism, the benefits go much beyond this. In fact, adopting a people-centered approach and empowering citizens, farmers and small businesses to invest in renewable energy projects, is a tool for socio-economic development and wealth distribution. Some countries have begun to realise the benefits. A recent German study [pdf] reveals that some €5.4bn was generated in Germany in 2012 through projects that were partially or fully owned by local investors, including citizens. Local private investments created a total of around 100,000 jobs that year in both the construction sector and operation.  Here are three examples of how local economies can be strengthened by transitioning to 100% renewable energy.  By 2050, Frankfurt will produce 100% of its energy consumption from local and regional renewable sources bringing down its current energy import costs from €2bn a year to zero. Thanks to its public local utility which drives this transition, the city not only benefits from these savings but generates additional income in the form of revenues and tax incomes. By prioritising energy production from within the city and the surrounding region – while still being connected to the larger national grid – the money will stay in the region.  Energy efficiency measures have saved Frankfurt €100m in energy costs, a number that is projected to rise. The city has also reduced emissions by 15%between 1990 and 2012, while its economy grew by 50% for its 715,000 inhabitants. One city leading the movement in North America is Vancouver. Widelyrecognised as the most livable city in the world, its environmental footprint is currently three times larger than it can sustain. Mayor Robertson and his team are committed to changing this, by putting the city on track to become the greenest in the world. By 2050, Vancouver will obtain 100% of the energy it uses from renewable sources and emit 80% fewer greenhouse gases than in 2007. It is not only the environment that motivates the government to take this action; Vancouver is a great example of how climate and environmental protection, and economic growth, can complement each other. A study by Brand Finance estimates that Vancouver’s brand is valued at $31bn due to its reputation as a “green, clean and sustainable” city. Steering the city towards 100% renewable energy and focusing on local sustainability, has helped create more than 3,000 new local green jobs in only five years.  The district of Kasese in Uganda (of approximately 130,000 households) is radically transforming. By 2020, Kasese will supply the energy needs of its population by only renewable sources. This ambitious target will be achieved by adopting a people-centered approach, with a wide variety of renewable sources such as biomass, solar, geothermal and mini-hydroelectric technologies. This will help the region overcome health issues strongly connected to the uncontrolled use of charcoal, firewood and kerosene, the main energy sources used for cooking and domestic electricity production.  By implementing a decentralised renewable energy system in the region, several clean energy businesses have been started since 2012, creating jobs for locals. They sell solar equipment, construct solar hubs, build biogas systems, improve cook stoves and deliver mini-hydro projects. The number of businesses in the local green economy has increased from five to 55 since 2012, and at least 1,650 people have been trained in the process.    With the international community starting to implement the new sustainable development goals, there is an urgent need for standards and indicators that allow policies and implementation to be measured and assessed, to provide guidance on a sustainable transition to 100% renewable energy. But as these case studies show, decentralised renewable energy technologies have the biggest impacts locally and regionally.  Anna Leidreiter is the senior programme manager for climate and energy at the World Future Council. Members of the Global 100% RE campaign, which includes the World Future Council, have initiated a consultation process to develop guiding indicators for policymakers on how to reach a sustainable 100% renewable energy vision.

"If the Indonesian authorities hoped to silence conversation about the 50th anniversary of the country’s anti-communist purges that killed an estimated 500,000 people in 1965, their 11th-hour curbs on the Ubud writers’ and readers’ festival failed spectacularly. Amid the bright floral garlands, free yoga sessions and Bintang beer bottles that dotted 38 venues across Bali’s self-styled “cultural capital”, politics hung heavy in the humid air. The year of 1965 wasn’t so much the elephant in the room as the monkey, popping up wherever it could to add punch and bite to the debate.  Just days before opening the festival, now in its 12th year, the founding director, Janet DeNeefe, was forced to cancel three sessions about the massacre and its aftermath, as well as a screening of Joshua Oppenheimer’s critically acclaimed documentary, The Look of Silence, and a photography exhibition, The Act of Living, inspired by the US film-maker’s work.  The response from the international literary community was unequivocal. More than 200 writers, including several guests of the festival, signed a PEN International statement condemning the “enforced silence” as a “deeply shocking” violation of free speech. DeNeefe reassured journalists that 1965 would still be discussed, if not actually named. But in the event it was referred to repeatedly, either directly or as “that thing we’re not supposed to talk about”. By banning @ubudwritersfest sessions on 1965, authorities have ensured that 1965 is by far the most discussed topic at #uwrf15. Ubud’s major drawcards this year included Pulitzer-winning author Michael Chabon, foreign correspondent Christina Lamb, New York Times critic and photographer Teju Cole, and Mpho Tutu, daughter of Desmond. Of 168 speakers from 25 countries, homegrown talent made up the largest portion, with 61 Indonesian novelists, poets, journalists and food writers taking part.  This year’s tagline – 17,000 Islands of the Imagination – was shared with the recent Frankfurt book fair, where Indonesia and authors from across the archipelago were guests of honour. History, memory, trauma – subjects so common to Indonesian literature – popped up in thematic talks across the four days in Ubud. But on Saturday a replacement panel, Uncensored, tackled the 1965 controversy head on. Did the cancellations signal a return to the dark “post-purge” past or a new, more insidious form of censorship? Where, ultimately, had the orders come from? And was a boycott of the festival – as some had proposed on social media – the correct response? No one could say. “That’s the beauty of censorship,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian journalist and researcher for Human Rights Watch. “It is an art. And only the censors get to talk to all sides.” Indonesians needed to mind the gap between takut (fear) and takluk (surrender), he stressed: “Kita boleh takut tapi jangan takluk” (“We might be scared but never give in”). The Indonesian author Eliza Vitri Handayani, who spoke from the floor about the pressures to self-censor and changes publishers made to her first book, wore a series of T-shirts featuring the text of her latest title, From Now On Everything Will Be Different, which was due to be launched at one of the cancelled sessions.  As this one came to an end, sections of the crowd stood up, raising hidden banners that read: Censored, Freedom of Speech = Human Rights, and Rezim Ini Memangsa Rakyatnya Sendiri (“This regime curbs its own people”).  All this on the day that new restrictions on public protest in Indonesia’s capital made the front page of the Jakarta Post. A practical move by the city governor, Basuki Tjahaha Purnama, or a sign of increasing restrictions in president Joko Widodo’s democracy? Again, the panelists could not agree on an answer. Refusing to be censored at #uwrf15 @andreasharsono pic.twitter.com/L271mMIJ9L It was Balinese police who demanded DeNeefe drop the 1965 talks and there was a small presence of blue shirts outside the festival hub, Indus – one of three Ubud restaurants she owns – throughout the festival. But they were outnumbered by the locals crying “Taksi! Taksi”, in the hopes of winning passengers from the tens of thousands of festival-goers trudging up its more-than-usually steamy streets. “Are you hot?” journalist and poet Debra H Yatim asked the audience during Going Under, a session on climate change and the very real threat that some of those aforementioned 17,000 islands would soon be underwater. “Heat like this, it’s not normal for October!” The panel talked at length about the devastating fires raging through Sumatra, spreading a thick haze across Indonesia and huge swaths of south-east Asia. Blame deforestation and the ravenous palm oil industry, they said. But also blame poor employment opportunities for poverty-stricken communities paid to do the dirty work of torching the ground at night.  Indonesians call them “land fires”, not forest fires, because it’s the land that’s burning – in deep pits of peat, three metres down. Moderator Tom Owen filled us in on the rest of the horrifying stats: a 5% spike in greenhouse emissions in the past month alone; half a million people facing acute respiratory problems.  A humanitarian crisis, then, as well as an environmental one. Yes, said Yatim. “Babies are dying right now. I must stop talking or I will cry.” Panelist Thor Kerr, an Australian academic, was due to speak at a second session, For Bali – cancelled more quietly amid the hoo-ha surrounding the 1965 panels – about Bali Tolak Reklamasi, the planned reclamation of 700 hectares of land by Indonesian developers. “We cannot talk freely about local environmental problems because they are political too,” he said.  And he should know. Kerr’s latest book, To the Beach, tackles coastal reclamation by property developers in Western Australia. As long as the media is in hock to big business, he lamented, these stories won’t be told – in Australia or in Indonesia. Media Watch saw academic Ross Tapsell, human rights lawyer and Guardian contributor Sunili Govinnage and Drew Ambrose of Al-Jazeera English in spiky debate about the negative impact of foreign bureau cuts in the region, the poor training and equipment available to local stringers and the colonialist approach to news reporting – “like a David Attenborough documentary”, said Govinnage. It was only a shame there were no Indonesian journalists on this panel. But right across the festival, Indonesian and Australian writers did share stages, casting recent diplomatic relations between the two states – including the Bali Nine executions – into harsh relief, while throwing up troubling commonalities, too. In a session on memory and writing, Indigenous Australian playwright Jane Harrison mapped the common ground between Indonesians struggling with the legacy of 1965 and Aboriginal communities dealing with the lasting impact of the stolen generation. “There can be a collective resistance to memorial,” noted novelist Michael Vatikiotis. “In Indonesia, I don’t find it always comes naturally.”  There was widespread fear in Indonesia that bringing 1965 back into the collective consciousness would bring new conflict, he said. As if on cue, from across the island came news that in the west Balinese village of Batuagung the bodies of nine victims had been peacefully exhumed to stop their spirits haunting the community. “Victims never forget,” observed Vatikiotis. “ Given the right circumstances, they want to remember.” It was no coincidence the Batuagung story sounded like the start of a book by Eka Kurniawan. The rising star of the Indonesian literary scene returned a hero to this year’s festival. His bawdy but epic novel, Beauty is a Wound – self-published in 2002 – has now found a global readership, thanks to a PEN award-winning English translation by Annie Tucker and publishing deals in 10 countries and counting. Kurniawan’s Q&A, the penultimate session of the festival, was a fitting end to what was ultimately, for all the politics, a books event for readers and writers. The author first started writing when he ran out of things to read, he told the audience, adding that early publishers rejected his novel for being “too literary”, “too thick”. Not so for punters at the festival bookshop, where Beauty is a Wound sold out in record time. Nor for the long line of fans queueing up for Kurniawan to sign their copies of his sometimes mad, always moving take on Indonesian identity and the legacy of 1965. That line is only set to grow. • This article was amended on 4 November 2015. An earlier version referred to Joseph, rather than Joshua, Oppenheimer."

"Kevin Rudd has mounted a scathing attack on Cardinal George Pell for being a “radical climate change sceptic” who is “muddying the ethical waters” ahead of the critical Paris climate change conference, in direct contradiction to the views of Pope Francis. Rudd says the ethical imperatives of strong climate action and the fact that Pell is now a “global figure”, means it is time to confront “head on” the views of the cleric, who was a strident critic of the Labor government’s climate policies as archbishop of Sydney and who is now a senior Vatican cardinal.   “After many years of silence in response to Cardinal Pell’s public critique of my government’s policy on climate change, the reason I have chosen to enter the debate now is, on the eve of the Paris conference, we once again enter into a critical time both for Australia and the world,” Rudd says in a lecture to be delivered at Melbourne University’s Trinity College on Tuesday night. “It is, therefore, no small matter, at this most critical of times, for the ethical waters, at least in the community of faith, to be so deeply muddied, by such radical climate change sceptics as Cardinal Pell, and for his commentary to go without challenge. Of course he is free to contribute to the public policy debate in any manner he wishes. But it is equally important, particularly now that Cardinal Pell has become a global figure, to have his ... statements on climate change challenged by others in the public space. It is high time his views were confronted head on. The stakes are now far too high for us all,” Rudd says in the Rowan Williams lecture. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said recently no energy source could have a “moral characteristic” and Australia just needed to make rational choices between the various abundant energy sources it had available. But Rudd insists that “anyone who claims in making policy judgments they are doing so oblivious to ethical considerations, and instead are simply acting on a simple ‘value free’ premise of ‘common sense’, is engaged in deep self-delusion”. And he strongly defends the right, and even obligation, of churches to engage in public debate as one of a number of “ethical voices”. “Unless there is at least one institution seeking to construct, maintain and argue the continuing ethical parameters within which the stated purposes and unintended consequences of government action should be considered, then there is a greater risk that public policy simply becomes ‘interest group politics’ or, even worse, retail politics by another name,” he says. Contrasting Pell’s views (including the statement that “in the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods, while today they demand reductions in carbon emissions”) with Pope Francis’s encyclical, Rudd remarks: “The pope says the science on climate change is sufficiently clear. Cardinal Pell says it is not, and further that the purported science is without foundation. The pope says all of humanity faces a common ethical challenge to protect the planet from climate change. Because Cardinal Pell disputes the science, he says there is little if any ethical imperative at all. And on the question of the policy imperative, the pope speaks with urgency. Cardinal Pell describes policy measures as an unnecessary fad and an unacceptable cost to both companies and consumers.” He says he is not arguing that Pell should not be free to express a view even though “his position happened to mirror precisely that of ... Tony Abbott”, but Rudd strongly argues that governments should instead listen to the “ethical guidance” of the pope. Rudd also addresses frequent criticisms that after declaring climate change “the greatest moral challenge of our time” he shelved his emissions trading scheme after it failed to pass the parliament. “Those who attacked this particular formulation were not only the usual legion of climate change sceptics and deniers. It included those corporations who concluded that policy change would be financially injurious to their bottom line, and who therefore found it convenient to join forces with the deniers,” he says. “But it also included those who accused me of not living up to my word by accepting the advice of my most senior ministers that following the second defeat of the government’s emissions trading scheme legislation, we should defer its implementation for two years until the conclusion of the Kyoto Protocol’s commitment period until 2012. As I was prime minister at the time, I accept responsibility for this decision and for the poor communication of it to the Australian public. “As for the related attack that my stated belief in the moral significance of climate change should have resulted in a double dissolution, I would draw attention to the fact that as of June 2010 [when Rudd was replaced as Labor leader by Julia Gillard] the window for calling a double dissolution was still open and remained open until August of that year.” Rudd points out Australia’s emissions declined by 7% over Labor’s time in office, and according to modelling firm Reputex will rise by 8.5% between 2014 and 2020."
"A weather forecaster for French state television has been fired after releasing and promoting a book criticising politicians, scientists and others for what he calls an exaggerated view of climate change. Philippe Verdier’s dismissal from France 2 comes a month before Paris hosts a UN conference aiming for the most ambitious worldwide agreement yet to limit global warming. He announced his dismissal in an online video over the weekend in which he described it as an attack on media freedom.  France Televisions, which owns France 2, would not comment on Monday. French media reported that the network said Verdier had violated ethical rules. Many media organisations have guidelines about journalists publicly expressing personal opinions on subjects they cover. Verdier was initially suspended a month ago, after his book, Climat Investigation (Climate Investigation), came out and he sent an open letter to François Hollande, the French president, saying the climate conference “won’t solve anything”. In an online video he released at the time, Verdier criticises the “complete hype on the climate” by scientists, politicians, business lobbies and environmental and religious groups. “You are dramatising things to underline your will to gather the world’s powerful and defuse a pending cataclysm,” he wrote to Hollande. Verdier questioned the president’s sincerity in promising to help the environment and asks him to plant a tree in the Élysée Palace to prove his “green” credentials. The conference from 30 November to 11 December is based on the results of more than 100 years of climate science, and top officials from 196 countries, including President Barack Obama, will arrive in Paris to talk about ways to slow climate change. Most climate scientists agree that the planet’s climate is changing largely because of human action. Though some public officials and a few climate scientists disagree, the world’s scientific organisations say changes such as increasingly extreme weather and rising sea levels are a result of the buildup of heat-trapping gases, especially carbon dioxide, from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Some weather forecasters in the US have faced similar issues. Donald Wuebbles, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois, notes the difference between television weather forecasters who look at daily weather and scientists who study long-term change over periods of at least 20 to 30 years. Often television weathermen do not study the long-term effects and statistics. Wuebbles said on Monday that Verdier’s claims that temperatures have levelled out are contradicted by data. Wuebbles added that temperatures may go up and down from year to year but that the overall long-term trend was upward. "
"The Turnbull government has bought another 45m tonnes of carbon abatement for $557m, but analysts say its Direct Action policy cannot reduce Australia’s greenhouse emissions or meet the promised long-term targets. The government has now spent almost half its $2.55bn emissions reduction fund to buy less than half of the greenhouse reductions needed to meet its 2020 target.  At its first auction, held in April, the government bought 47m tonnes of abatement for $660m – an average price of $13.50 a tonne. Across the two auctions it has bought 92m tonnes of abatement for an average price of $13.12 a tonne. But analysts say that while the auctions have been successful, emissions will still rise and the overall Direct Action policy will not reduce Australia’s emissions to meet its long-term, internationally promised reduction target for 2030. “While the ERF has again been successful in contracting abatement, the policy has not curbed Australia’s net emissions growth. Accounting for the ERF, we continue to forecast a 15% increase in national emissions through to 2030,” said Hugh Grossman, the chief executive director of the Reputex analytical firm. John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, said the emissions reduction fund was only ever a sidebar policy and could not meet long-term greenhouse goals. “The government has run another professional auction process, but now we need to get down to the policies that matter. We need to tackle the biggest polluting sector of the economy – the electricity sector. This starts with a closure plan for our old and inefficient coal-fired power plants so they can be replaced with clean energy alternatives. “The key point remains – the ERF is a supporting policy,” Connor said. A proportion of the greenhouse reductions bought will be delivered after 2020, the date by which the government has promised to reduce emissions by 5% compared with 2000 levels. They will count towards the longer-term 2030 target the government will pledge at the United Nations conference beginning in Paris in December.  Chloe Munro, the chair of the Clean Energy Regulator, which runs the auctions, said she was “pleased with the high level of participation and competitive bidding which has allowed us to source significant abatement at a lower average price than the first auction”. She said the CER had awarded 129 carbon abatement contracts, ranging from one to 10 years in length, including industrial and mining projects for the first time. Questions have been raised about whether all the emission reductions bought were “additional”, ie would not have happened without the government money, and thinktanks have pointed out that the fund can only achieve a tiny proportion of Australia’s promised longer-term greenhouse gas reductions. But the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the ERF was an international success. “I look forward to highlighting the success of the fund when I return to the Paris climate change talks and outline Australia’s strong suite of policies to reduce emissions,” he said in a statement. “The results today are further proof that we have one of the most effective systems in the world for significantly reducing emissions.” Labor’s environment spokesman Mark Butler said Australians weren’t getting “value for money” from a policy that had no hope of reaching Australia’s long-term goals. Greens spokesperson Senator Larissa Waters compared the emission reductions bought with the greenhouse gas that would be created from burning coal from Adani’s proposed $16bn Carmichael mine. “The government has just given half a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to big polluters to achieve pollution reduction of just 1% of the expected emissions of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine,” she said. On current projections the government needs 236m tonnes of abatement to meet the 2020 goal, but Hunt has said that figure is likely to be revised downwards and the government is also likely to receive for free up to 16m tonnes of abatement in the form of international permits from landfill operators who ended up with a windfall gain after the abolition of the emissions trading scheme. The first auction bought emission reductions mainly by paying for the continuation of projects conducted under the former government’s carbon farming initiative from farmers who promised not to clear land, and landfill operators that collect and flare, or use, methane. Land-use projects also dominated the second auction, but it also bought emission reduction from savannah burning projects, and a small number of industry projects, from companies like Wesfarmers, Energy Australia and Adelaide Brighton Cement. Reputex predicts the ERF money will be exhausted by the end of 2016, after one or two more auctions next year. And it predicts that without significant changes to other aspects of the Direct Action policy, Australia’s emissions will rise by 2030, not decline by between 26 and 28%, as Australia will promise at the United Nations meeting in Paris."
"Between the tropics and probably as far as the 33rd parallel, the sun could soon be a major source of energy for households and businesses alike.  Countries such as Mexico and Indonesia, long dependent on cheap home-produced oil and coal, are realising that a solar panel on every roof can reduce poverty by lowering energy costs as well as minimising the destabilising weather effects from higher CO2 emissions.  As the International Energy Agency (IEA) says in its World Energy Outlook 2015, the tumbling cost of installing photovoltaics, as much as a commitment to limiting climate change, is persuading these populous countries to switch to renewables. It predicts a cumulative $7.4trn global investment in renewable energy by 2040. Indonesia has forged ahead by limiting investment subsidies that have underpinned coal, oil and gas production for decades. China is also beginning to make the switch to renewables while moving away from dirty, energy-intensive industries. The result, says the IEA, could limit the demand for oil and keep the price relatively low for the rest of the decade. By 2030, the share of low-carbon power generation could grow to almost 45%, putting a lid on power emissions and containing a 40% rise in energy demand. But global investment in renewable energy may not be as large as it seems. The IEA’s $7.4trn figure represents only 15% of the total investment in global energy supply by 2040. So oil, coal and gas are still a major part of the energy mix 25 years from now. And predictions of a low oil price – possibly no more than $80 a barrel stretching beyond 2020 – could be upset by India. By 2040, the IEA says, the country’s energy demand will almost match that of the US, even though demand per head will remain 40% below the world average. Without a push to adopt renewables, India’s galloping demand for energy could send oil and gas prices spiralling up and scupper any hopes of limiting CO2 emissions. Should it invest in solar farms, India must persuade hundreds of millions of car drivers to ditch their petrol vehicles and thousands of road hauliers their diesel trucks, a stumbling block that could be beyond its democratically elected leaders."

"In a few weeks, world leaders will gather in Paris in an attempt to reach a deal that will have critical implications for our species. At the COP21 climate talks, they will try to find a formula for reducing the world’s carbon emissions and give humanity an evens chance of holding global warming to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels. Past efforts to negotiate such deals have been riddled with frustration and failures, in particular the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, which ended in disarray. However, there is a sense of guarded optimism in the air these days. Australian and Canadian premiers Tony Abbott and Stephen Harper – who led two of the planet’s worst fossil-fuel burning administrations – have recently been replaced by leaders who seem to understand our current plight. President Obama has begun to show some enthusiasm for the cause of climate-change action, while China and India, scheduled to become vast carbon emitters in coming decades, have made some promising pledges.  Hence the appearance of these two timely books, which provide invaluable background to the Paris talks – and which make it abundantly clear these negotiations are going to fall well short of saving the planet. Take Flannery, an Australian climate expert. He notes that projections now suggest that, at best, renewable energy sources will still only contribute a third of the planet’s power needs by 2040, while demand for coal, gas and oil will still be rising. Carbon emissions will not fall. “This all adds up to a world which has lost the opportunity to keep warming within 2C but instead is committed to a world 3C warmer or even more,” he says. Nor should we be surprised, adds Morton, a UK journalist. In 2013, the world’s industries emitted 30bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into our already overheated atmosphere. This was achieved by burning 3tn cubic metres of gas and 36bn barrels of oil. As for coal, 300 tonnes were burned – every second. This is a frightening output and it is maintained by a colossal infrastructure of mines, oil wells, power stations, railway lines, and armadas of lorries and ships. “The problem is that to stabilise the climate by means of emissions reduction means replacing the whole lot,” Morton notes. And that will not happen overnight. Indeed, it is hard to understand how it can be achieved in less than a century. By then global warming will have risen far above 2C, threatening Earth with all sorts of new ills. Methane plumes from the thawing permafrost of Canada and Russia could further raise global temperatures, while disappearing ice caps will no longer reflect sunlight back into space, thus heating the world even further. We are in a jam that is attributed, by the activist Bill McKibben, to the fact that the “vast piles of money [of fossil-fuel industries] have so far weighed more in the political balance than the vast piles of data accumulated by scientists”. The world has been misled by the selfish and the ignorant, in short. The question is: what do we do? Flannery, despite the jaunty title of his book, is actually the more pessimistic. He sees hope in the fact that innovation “is driving economies as never before” but is low in expectation for individual technologies. On the other hand, a belief that some success can be achieved at the talks is more realistically based, he says, while the arguments of deniers have been shown to be “transparently wrong and outdated”. By contrast, Morton is more specific about actions that are required. Cutting emissions will not be enough. Only by actively limiting solar radiation and by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can we hope to curtail temperature rises, he argues. This is the science of geo-engineering and it is controversial because such projects – which include spraying sulphur particles in the upper atmosphere to cut out sunlight – risk worsening, rather than improving our world. Morton is no zealot, however, and his arguments are intriguing and persuasive. Certainly, from the perspectives of both books, things look grim. Of course, negotiators could succeed in Paris and find a formula for capping emissions to keep temperature rises below 2C. The trouble is that Earth will still change dramatically in this best-of-all-possible-worlds scenario. Our atmosphere is already so heated that glaciers round the world are going to disappear alarmingly, sea caps will melt and our oceans acidify. These changes are inevitable, with the last being easily the most worrying. Today, our oceans are 30% more acidic than they were a few hundred years ago because seas are so good at absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Combined with rising water temperatures, this double whammy of heat and acid has devastated the world’s coral reefs. Already, half of the Great Barrier Reef has been destroyed, says Flannery. “My Great Barrier Reef is doomed,” he admits.

" Air travel should be taxed to protect the world’s vulnerable from drought, flooding and sea level rise.  A €180 ($196/£130) levy on business class tickets and €20 on economy class would raise the estimated €150bn a year needed for climate adaptation. That is one proposal by French economists Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty to address global inequalities between high-polluting individuals and the victims of climate change. “Taxing flights is one way to target high emitting lifestyles, especially if we tax business class more than economy class,” Chancel told Climate Home. “A tax on air tickets to finance development programs already exists in some countries. What we need is to increase its level and generalise it.” Piketty – author of Capital, a bestseller on wealth inequality – and Chancel outline huge disparities in people’s carbon footprints across the world. One-tenth of people are responsible for 45% of global emissions. “Economic inequalities are reaching record high levels and reducing them constitutes a key challenge to policymakers in the coming decades,” said Chancel. “It’s the same thing with carbon: another huge challenge that puts our societies at risk. If we fail to address both, our societies can collapse.” Increasingly, they say, inequalities within national borders are more important than those between countries. The richest 1% in America, Luxemburg and Saudi Arabia emit 200+ tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year, more than 25 times the global average. The poorest in Mozambique, Rwanda and Malawi are responsible for around 0.1t CO2e. But in between, a privileged elite in emerging economies is starting to outstrip working class Europeans. Even in Tanzania, classed as one of the world’s least developed countries, the richest 1% emit as much as the global average – and the same as the second poorest decile in France. Meanwhile, there is a persistent shortage of finance for measures such as drought-resistant seeds and flood defences to shield those endangered by carbon profligacy. Just 16% of climate finance in 2013/14 went to adaptation, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates, with the rest going to low carbon projects. The report suggests ways to close the gap, arguing it shouldn’t continue to rest on EU funds, given the growing emissions of China’s upper class. In one scenario, all above-average emitters are taxed on carbon above that average threshold. That implies North Americans contribute 36%, Europeans 20% and Chinese people 15%. In another, only the 1% pay. That skews the distribution way over to North America, which coughs up 57% of the total. An airline levy is mooted as a proxy for privilege. It “might be easier to implement but less well targeted at top emitters” than other options, the report says."
"French president François Hollande claimed China and France had taken an “historic” step towards tackling climate change on Monday after the two countries agreed any deal reached in Paris next month should include checks on whether signatories are keeping their commitments to reduce emissions. In a joint statement released weeks before the United Nations Climate Change Conference, China and France said such progress should be reviewed every five years in order to “reinforce mutual confidence and promote efficient implementation”. “The Paris agreement must send out a clear signal for the world to transition to green and low-carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable development,” the two countries said, also calling for an “ambitious and legally binding” deal in Paris. The statement – which described climate change as “one of the greatest challenges facing humanity” – came at the end of the first day of a two-day visit to China by Hollande. “What we have just established here in this declaration is a likelihood that the Paris conference will succeed,” the French president told reporters. “That doesn’t mean that the Paris conference is definitely going to be a success, but the conditions for success have been laid down in Beijing today.” “This visit is historic. And I am weighing my words,” he added, according to AFP.Hollande arrived in China on Monday for a meeting with president Xi Jinping intended to shore up Chinese support for next month’s climate talks. Before meeting Xi at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Hollande travelled to the south-western city of Chongqing where he visited a sewage treatment plant, according to the state-run People’s Daily newspaper. French President @fhollande Mon arrives in Chongqing for China visit, 1st stop Sino-French sewage treatment plant pic.twitter.com/48AUMrUQ4t Speaking there, the French president said China’s backing was “essential” for any deal that might be reached at the Paris conference, which runs from 30 November until 11 December. “The fight against global warming is a humanitarian issue – how the planet can be preserved – and it is also an issue of considerable economic importance, of what we call ‘green growth’,” he reportedly said. Hollande said he hoped the Paris talks would produce “a global and ambitious agreement that will allow global warming to be limited to two degrees”. Critics, including many European countries, accused China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, of derailing climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 by opposing any move to make emissions cuts legally binding. Ahead of next month’s talks in Paris there is greater optimism about Beijing’s possible role. In June China pledged that, by 2030, it would cut its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% compared to 2005 levels. China is also aiming to hit “peak emissions” by 2030. Environmental group Greenpeace described Monday’s joint statement as “an incremental step forward, while highlighting the ambition gap the world still needs to bridge”. “Exactly four weeks before world leaders convene in Paris, it is encouraging to see the ball rolling and diplomacy nudging us a small step forward,” said Li Shuo, Greenpeace’s China climate policy advisor. “Moreover, with the recent decline in coal consumption and robust renewable energy development, China is positioning itself at the front of climate leadership. This is drastically different from six years ago in Copenhagen.” “However, for Paris to be a success, a far bigger stretch is needed,” Li added. “After waving goodbye to President Hollande tomorrow, Chinese leaders need to think hard about what more to bring to the table when they see him again in Paris at the end of this month.” In a statement, Jean-François Julliard, the executive director of Greenpeace France said: “This is no time for champagne. This bilateral statement should be another springboard instead of the last word for the Paris agreement.” “What the world needs in Paris is a global long-term vision of a 100% renewable energy supply, for all, by mid-century and increased ambition by countries every five years starting from now.”"

"Volkswagen’s emissions cheating scandal could force German carmakers to come up with new and better ways to build more climate-friendly vehicles, a senior government official said on Wednesday.  Deputy environment minister, Jochen Flasbarth, said he did not believe the scandal had damaged Germany’s image as a leader in environmental protection ahead of a UN climate summit in Paris in December.   Climate talks in recent weeks had not been negatively impacted by the revelations that Volkswagen had installed software to rig diesel emissions tests, he told reporters.  “I expect that German carmakers, especially in the current environment, have little desire to break European laws,” he said. “If this doesn’t work with diesel, then they will have to do it a different way.“  Flasbarth drew a line between the Volkswagen scandal in particular and Germany’s green credentials in general.  “This is a dramatic case and it’s not good for us but I believe that you can differentiate between irresponsible action in a company and the general climate policy course that Germany is following,” he said. "
"Deforestation may have triggered the recent Ebola outbreak in west Africa, France’s environment minister Ségolène Royal told a London summit hosted by the Prince of Wales ahead of next month’s Cop21 conference. Addressing the British energy and climate change secretary, Amber Rudd, representatives from forest nation governments and global companies, Royal said researchers believe the destruction of forest habitat brought bats, known to carry the virus, into greater contact with humans. “They had to clear the forest to begin subsistence agriculture and the deforestation has also been caused by mining activity and large-scale logging for export,” she told the high-level meeting at Lancaster House. “This destruction of the natural habitat of fruit-eating bats drove the animals to approach human settlements to find food and the virus may have been transmitted during this increased contact resulting from deforestation,” she said. The one-day conference on deforestation and climate change, attended by environment ministers from Brazil, Panama, Congo and Norway, as well as senior representatives from Unilever, Marks & Spencer and Cargill, was hosted by the prince’s International Sustainability Unit. Next month Charles, who in 2007 set up the Prince’s Rainforest Group to find a solution to save the world’s threatened forests, will deliver a keynote speech at the invitation of the French president, François Hollande, before world leaders at the Paris Cop21 conference, as attempts are made to reach new international agreements to help limit global warming to no more than two degrees. Addressing delegates in London, he said: “Paris will be an absolutely crucial milestone, as you will all know better than I, in the long overdue international effort to keep to a two-degree world.” He added: “It must however send an unequivocal, long-term signal to the international community, and to global markets, that the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable, climate-compatibility economy is firmly and irreversibly under way. And that a two-degree world is therefore, still just, if we stretch every sinew by setting a proper price for carbon, within reach.” While “heartening” progress had been made over deforestation in recent years, he said “the hard and profoundly depressing fact is that rates of deforestation and degradation continue to increase”. Expressing his hopes for real progress in Paris, he concluded: “Billions of people and, indeed, what is left of the rest of a rapidly diminishing creation, depend upon whether this time, real concerted action, and not just words, can be taken.”"

"My people, the Turkana, live in Turkana county, one of the poorest regions in Kenya. As pastoralists who practise nomadism and tend to goats, camels, donkeys and zebus, we have lived off this dry, hot stretch of land near the Ugandan border for centuries. But like fellow Kenyans – and Africans – the changing climate has made our daily lives more difficult. With less rain, the lake and rivers we rely on for our drinking water – and to care for our animals – keep getting drier and shallower. Droughts and famines have resulted in death to our animals as well as disappearance of livestock watering holes that have served my people for ages. As a result, our jobs as herders are in peril and our life generally has become one of a struggle for survival.  When oil and gas extraction companies came into our territories in 2011, my people were hopeful that they would improve our lives by offering desperately needed jobs. But they only recruited from some villages, not others, leading to tension among our once-harmonious communities. And once these companies started oil and gas exploration, it had an impact on the water supply to our pasturelands, as there was less to go round.  The Turkana have always been in harmony with their land. In this pastoralist community, land has cultural and social importance and is believed to belong to our ancestors. The people have noticed the changes to their environment, and are very worried about the future. But more than 80% of my people are illiterate. They don’t fully understand the link between these changes and climate change – and the further pressures that the oil and gas companies are putting on our scarce resources.  After I earned my law degree from the University of Nairobi, I returned to my village to help my community fight against climate change and other pressures. I meet with villagers of all ages and talk to them about what they can do to protect themselves and their land against extreme weather and the impact of oil and gas exploitation.  Every week, I meet with a group of young people in my community to plan action and empower the local community. For example, we organise youth summits to outline our demands to the oil and gas companies, which include respecting our traditional practices, safeguarding our sacred lands, shielding our grazing sites and upholding environmental standards. We are not alone. Turkana youth in my village and neighbouring ones have also taken a stand to protect our lands, our culture and, most importantly, our people from the perils of climate change. Our collective success include installing a new drinking well that makes it easier for 1,000 community members to gather fresh, clean water.  Young people in my community have also led a tree-planting campaign that has added 77,000 new indigenous and exotic trees to our villages. We intend to carry out these activities now and in the future and contribute to the improvement of our environment in our small ways. Unfortunately, we don’t have a choice when it comes to implementing simple but powerful solutions to climate change in our own backyards. If we don’t take action, we could lose our homes and our way of life. Many young Africans have already been forced by the impacts of climate change to migrate to city slums, where they have lost their way of life, and their hope for the future. But I am still hopeful. And I have come to learn that young people in countries around the world facing similar prospects are also taking matters in their own hands. In December, I will join a group of these youth activists from Africa, Asia and Latin America in Paris for the global climate change talks. We’ll share our stories so that negotiators and world leaders realise that we are an important part of the climate change solution, and that if they support us, we can continue to help our people. And we’ll let them know that we’re watching, and expecting that they’ll take bold action to ensure that future generations don’t lose out against the changing climate.  To live, the Turkana people rely on animals, and we rely on the environment. Even if the results of the Paris talks disappoint, I will continue to defend my home against drought and developers – and anything else that comes our way. After all, if the youth of the world do not act, who will?"

"Australia should “tell the story of the Pacific to the world” when global leaders sit down to climate change talks in Paris at the end of this month, Labor has said. The impact of climate change on the nations of the Pacific is a focus for both the government and opposition ahead of COP21, where governments of more than 190 nations will gather to discuss a possible new global climate accord.  The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, accompanied by foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek and immigration spokesman Richard Marles, will visit Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati over four days this week, while the government’s minister for international development and the Pacific, Steve Ciobo, will travel to New Caledonia, Fiji and Niue. The Labor leaders said climate change was an existential threat to some countries in the region. “The dangerous consequences of climate change is no more evident than in the Pacific region. Pacific leaders have consistently identified climate change as the greatest threat to their livelihoods, food production, housing, security and wellbeing. “This is a serious problem that demands serious attention.” Marles, the former parliamentary secretary for Pacific island affairs, told Guardian Australia that it was important for Australia to have strong and constructive relations with its Pacific neighbours. He praised Pacific leaders, in particular Kiribati’s president, Anote Tong, for highlighting the issues being faced by Pacific nations on the international stage. “It is crucial that, in the lead-up to Paris, the world understands the problems being faced by the Pacific. And it’s important that Australia plays a role in telling that story of the Pacific to the world.” Ciobo said in a statement that climate change, along with the linked areas of economic growth and trade, were key challenges for Australia’s relationship with the region. “Australia recognises climate change is a critical issue for our region, with significant potential to impact prospects for economic growth and stability. We are working with Pacific island countries on resilience measures through the Green Climate Fund and our regional aid program.” Australia’s relationship with the Pacific, especially over the issue of climate change, was damaged in September when the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was picked up by a boom mic joking about climate change with then prime minister Tony Abbott. Joking with Abbott about a meeting starting late, Dutton quipped it was running to “Cape York time”, to which Abbott replied: “We had a bit of that up in Port Moresby.” Dutton replied: “Time doesn’t mean anything when you’re about to have water lapping at your door.” Pacific leaders excoriated the minister. The Marshall Islands’ foreign minister, Tony de Brum, said he was “dismayed” by the “insensitivity ... [of] the big polluting island down south”. PNG prime minister Peter O’Neill said the comments were unfortunate, and Tong described the joke as “vulgar”. “As long as there is this kind of attitude, this kind of arrogance in any position of leadership, we will continue to have a lot of tension,” Tong said. The impacts of climate change are being felt acutely by Pacific nations, many of which are low-lying, remote, and with vulnerable infrastructure. Eight Pacific nations are in the top 20 in the world of highest losses of gross domestic product (GDP) from natural disasters, the World Bank says. Natural disasters – an average of 41 tropical cyclones hit the region each year – cost the Pacific islands two percent of their GDP annually.  The Marshall Islands and Kiribati are particularly vulnerable. The land mass of the Marshall Islands is less than five metres above sea level and 97% of Kiribati’s land mass is below that level. Climate change effects are being exacerbated by a significant El Niño weather pattern in the southern hemisphere this summer, which has already caused widespread drought across the Pacific, and could threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions. An estimated 2.4 million people could face food and water shortages in Papua New Guinea alone, the country’s national disaster centre has reported. Up to two dozen people have already died from hunger and drinking contaminated water. In Fiji and Tonga, emergency water supplies are being shipped into remote areas. “El Niño has the potential to trigger a regional humanitarian emergency and we estimate as many as 4.1 million people are at risk from water shortages, food insecurity and disease across the Pacific,” said Sune Gudnitz from the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs."

"Our green obsession with windmills is bringing Britain’s electricity system to its knees, if Tory press commentators writing about last week’s grid problems are to be believed. In the Times, Matt Ridley demanded an electricity policy “rethink”, blaming the “emergency” on investment in renewables and the fact that “the wind was not blowing on a mild autumn day”.  Over at the Telegraph, in a column headlined “The obsession with global warming will put the lights out all over Britain”, Charles Moore observed that “there was almost no wind” during the day in question, noting without irony in his climate denialist piece that it was nonetheless “very warm for the time of year”.  Not to be outdone, Peter Hitchens thundered in the Mail on Sunday that the “pseudo-scientific dogma” of climate science is turning the UK into the Soviet Union, complete with accompanying (intellectual) gulags, and that because of “warmists armed with windmills” (to quote from the headline) “we came within inches of major power blackouts”.  It all sounds very worrying, and no doubt the rising tide of elite Tory opposition to Britain’s decarbonisation policies will be noted in both Downing Street and by ministers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. There’s only one problem: it isn’t true.  The reality is that last Wednesday’s brief “notification of inadequate system margin” (NISM) had nothing to do with wind power, as any of the writers quoted above could have discovered had they taken the trouble to call the National Grid and ask.  We did so, and with the grid’s help pieced together the following sequence of events. During Wednesday morning last week, the National Grid experienced what it told us were “multiple failures” of coal and gas-fired power stations. Though the grid won’t reveal which plants were affected, other sources report that there were at least three major power plants out of action, including the Fiddlers Ferry coal plant in Cheshire. At 1.30pm, the National Grid, anticipating a shortfall for later that day, issued its NISM calling for additional generation of 500MW to be offered to cover peak demand between 4.30 and 6.30pm that evening. (500MW is about 1% of peak UK demand for the time of year, so hardly a huge amount.) Don’t panic said the grid, the NISM “is part of our standard toolkit for balancing supply and demand and is not an indication there is an immediate risk of disruption to supply or blackouts”. What happened next was equally non-dramatic. The electricity market responded to the request and more plant was brought online. 40MW of demand was also offloaded, thanks to a rudimentary “smart grid” system where big electricity users are paid to switch off at critical periods. Ridley and other commentators breathlessly reported that prices reached a whopping “£2,500 a megawatt-hour - 40 times the normal price”. This is true, but the £2,500 offered was to a single generator, and only for 70 minutes of production of 147MW. Satisfied that sufficient margin had been restored, National Grid cancelled its NISM at 5.45pm, stating once again that the “issuing of a NISM does not mean we were at risk of blackouts”. Note that none of this is about wind. As the National Grid spokesperson told us, “our weather forecasts are very accurate”. Grid managers therefore had a day or more’s warning that Wednesday was likely to see very little wind generation, and planned accordingly. Yes, wind is intermittent - but that does not mean it is unpredictable. This saga showed not that wind is driving the UK towards blackouts, but that reliance on a small number of large generators - coal, gas or nuclear - carries the risk of inadequate margin if more than one of these big plants fails at the same time. Wind, being composed of lots of smaller generators, cannot by definition all fail unexpectedly together, so could be argued to be more resilient, not less. This is pretty much the opposite of the conclusion reached by the Tory commentariat, which hates wind turbines spoiling views in the Shires and takes any opportunity to criticise renewables and oppose climate change action. Let’s at least hope that the government listens to National Grid’s version of the story, not the misinformation peddled by Ridley, Moore and Hitchens.  "
"La ville marocaine de Ouarzazate est habituée aux grandes productions. Aux portes du désert du Sahara, au centre de l’industrie cinématographique “Ouallywood”, elle a participé à tout, de Lawrence d’Arabie et La Momie à The Living Daylights et même Game of Thrones. Maintenant, la ville commerciale, surnommée la « Porte du désert », accueille un autre « blockbuster » : un complexe de quatre méga-centrales solaires reliées les unes aux autres qui permettra aux énergies renouvelables de fournir près de la moitié de l’électricité du Maroc en 2020 avec, on l’espère, une certaine capacité à exporter vers l’Europe. Ce projet est un élément-clé pour les ambitions du Maroc qui veut utiliser ses déserts inexploités pour devenir une superpuissance solaire mondiale. Lorsque le complexe sera totalement opérationnel, ce sera la plus grande usine d’énergie solaire concentrée (CSP) dans le monde, et la première phase, appelée Noor 1, sera achevée le mois prochain. La technologie de miroirs qu’elle utilise est moins répandue et plus coûteuse que les panneaux photovoltaïques sur les toits que l’on voit partout dans le monde, mais elle aura l’avantage d’être en mesure de continuer à produire de l’énergie même après le coucher du soleil. Le potentiel de l’énergie solaire du désert est connu depuis des décennies. Après l’accident nucléaire de Tchernobyl en 1986, le physicien spécialiste en particules élémentaires allemand Gerhard Knies a calculé que les déserts du monde recevaient suffisamment d’énergie en quelques heures pour couvrir les besoins énergétiques de l’humanité sur toute une année. Le défi, cependant, a été de capter et stocker cette énergie avant de la transporter vers les zones habitées où elle est nécessaire. Alors que les ingénieurs mettent la touche finale à Noor 1, ses 500 000 miroirs solaires en forme de croissant scintillent dans le ciel du désert. Les 800 rangées suivent le soleil dans son parcours à travers les cieux, ronronnant tranquillement au bout de quelques minutes au fur et à mesure que leurs ombres glissent plus vers l’est. Quand elles seront achevées, les quatre centrales de Ouarzazate occuperont une surface grande comme la capitale du Maroc, Rabat, et généreront 580 MW d’électricité, assez pour alimenter un million de foyers. Noor 1 lui-même a une capacité de production de 160 MW. La ministre de l’Environnement du Maroc, Hakima el-Haite, estime que l’énergie solaire pourrait avoir le même impact durant ce siècle sur la région que la production de pétrole en a eu au siècle précédent. Mais le projet de 9 milliards de dollars a été entrepris avec des préoccupations plus immédiates, dit-elle. « Nous ne sommes pas un producteur de pétrole. Nous importons 94 % de notre énergie – des combustibles fossiles provenant de l’étranger – ce qui a des répercussions importantes sur le budget de l’État », a déclaré Hakima el-Haite. « Nous avons également l’habitude de subventionner les combustibles fossiles, qui ont un coût élevé, donc quand nous avons entendu parler du potentiel de l’énergie solaire, nous avons pensé : pourquoi pas ? » L’énergie solaire va représenter un tiers de l’approvisionnement en énergie renouvelable du Maroc en 2020, à part égale avec les énergies éolienne et hydraulique. « Nous sommes très fiers de ce projet », a ajouté Hakima el-Haite. « Je pense que c’est la centrale solaire la plus importante du monde. » Chaque miroir parabolique à une hauteur de 12 mètres et est centré sur une conduite en acier transportant un fluide caloporteur (HTF) chauffé à 393°C qui serpente le long d’une goulotte avant d’atteindre un moteur thermique. Il y est mélangé avec de l’eau pour créer de la vapeur qui fait tourner les turbines. Le HTF est composé d’une solution d’huile thermique synthétique pompée vers un réservoir de chaleur contenant des sables fondus, qui peut stocker la chaleur pendant trois heures, permettant à la centrale d’alimenter des maisons pendant la nuit. Les miroirs sont espacés dans des formations de niveau, afin de minimiser les dommages causés par le sable amené par les vents du désert. Les techniciens disent que les usines Noor 2 et 3, qui doivent ouvrir en 2017, pourront stocker l’énergie jusqu’à huit heures, ouvrant la perspective d’une énergie solaire 24 heures sur 24 et 7 heures du 7 dans le Sahara et la région environnante. « Le plus grand défi auquel nous avons été confrontés a été de pouvoir terminer le projet à temps avec le [niveau] de la performance dont nous avions besoin “, a déclaré Rachid Bayed, le directeur du projet. Mais alors même que la première phase du projet tire à sa fin, le Maroc lorgne vers des ambitions internationales grandioses. « Nous sommes déjà impliqués dans les lignes de transport à haute tension pour couvrir tout le Sud du Maroc et la Mauritanie dans un premier temps », a déclaré Ahmed Baroudi, directeur général de la Société d’investissements énergétiques, la firme nationale d’investissement en énergie renouvelable. Toutefois, a-t-il ajouté, l’impact éventuel du projet irait beaucoup plus loin, jusqu’au Moyen-Orient. « L’objectif [ultime] donnée par Sa Majesté le Roi est La Mecque. » Que cette ambition soit atteinte reste à voir, mais l’exportation d’énergie solaire pourrait avoir des effets de stabilisation dans la région à l’intérieur des pays et entre eux, selon l’agence de l’énergie solaire marocaine, MASEN. Des pourparlers sont en cours avec la Tunisie, et l’exportation de l’énergie vers le Nord à travers la Méditerranée reste un objectif clé, malgré l’effondrement en 2013 du projet Desertec, un plan allemand qui prévoyait d’acheminer 15 % de l’énergie solaire européenne du désert nord-africain en 2050. « Nous croyons qu’il est possible d’exporter de l’énergie vers l’Europe mais d’abord nous devrions construire les interconnexions qui n’existent pas encore », a déclaré Maha el-Kadiri, la porte-parole de MASEN. « Plus précisément, nous devrons construire des interconnexions qui ne passeraient pas par ceux qui existent en Espagne, puis commencer à exporter. » L’Espagne a renoncé à de nouveaux projets solaires en raison d’un manque d’interconnexions pour transmettre l’énergie en France. L’Union européenne a fixé pour objectif que 10 % de la puissance de chaque Etat membre puisse être transporté à l’étranger par câble d’ici 2020. En attendant, le Maroc se concentre sur l’utilisation de l’énergie solaire pour répondre à ses propres besoins d’indépendance énergétique. Cet objectif pourrait un jour inclure le dessalement de l’eau, dans un pays qui est de plus en plus touché par la sécheresse provoquée par le réchauffement climatique. Les responsables sont conscients d’avoir le programme d’énergie renouvelable le plus avancé dans la région Moyen-Orient - Afrique du Nord. « Nous sommes à l’avant-garde de l’énergie solaire », a déclaré Maha el-Kadiri. Une grande partie des 9 milliards de dollars investis dans le complexe Noor provient d’institutions internationales telles que la Banque européenne d’investissement et la Banque mondiale, soutenus par des garanties publiques marocaines. Des subventions à l’énergie du chef d’État héréditaire du Maroc, le Roi Mohammed VI, ont évité aux consommateurs de subir le coût de ces investissements. Un mois avant le lancement, plus de 1 000 travailleurs principalement marocains étaient toujours en train de poser des fils électriques, de démonter des échafaudages et d’installer l’isolation en laine de roche autour des conduites d’acier. Ils portaient des gilets jaunes et oranges, travaillaient parfois 12 heures d’affilée avec comme toile de fond les montagnes de l’Atlas. Des harnais avec des marteaux et des gants étaient accrochés à leurs ceintures par leurs côtés. Les casques de chantier, les chaussures de sécurité et les bouchons d’oreille donnent à la scène un air de camp de théâtre. Pour Hajar Lakhal, 25 ans, de Meknès, responsable de l’environnement et de la sécurité, les répétitions étaient presque terminées et le démarrage de la production était quasiment prêt à démarrer. « Nous avons terminé la construction et maintenant nous allons voir à quoi ces projets ressemblent après leur mise en route, » dit-elle. « C’est exactement comme la préparation d’un grand spectacle. »"
"The El Niño in the Pacific is now one of the three strongest ever recorded. The Bureau of Meteorology said sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, a key driver of the climatic phenomenon, were 2.4C above average – the highest since the El Niño was declared six months ago.  El Niño usually brings below-average rain and increased daytime temperatures, particularly to eastern Australia in the southern spring. The bureau’s latest El Niño southern oscillation wrap-up said the strength compares with the two strongest recorded – in 1997-98 and 1982-83. Both brought devastating droughts to eastern Australia. “International climate models suggest the peak in El Niño sea surface temperatures is likely to occur before the end of the year, then gradually ease in the first quarter of 2016,” the wrap-up said. Typically, El Niño’s influence on rainfall decreases, although warmer daytime and night-time temperatures tend to persist. But record warm sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean may cause below-average rainfall to drag on across Australia, the bureau warned. This warming, known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), has existed for more than three months, with temperatures now 0.88C above average – the highest anomaly since reliable records began in 1981. The record has already been broken twice this spring – in September (+0.52C) and October (+0.65C). An above-average IOD tends to reinforce the effect of an El Niño, especially in the south-east. It is expected the dipole will begin to degrade later in November. Despite recent rainfall in some areas, parts of inland Queensland, northern and western Victoria and southern South Australia have severe or record rainfall deficiencies stretching back as much as three years."

" Britain must abandon “Churchillian rhetoric” and claims it can “hold the line” against rising seas, and instead plan ahead for increasing coastal erosion, according to the National Trust.  Despite a growing risk of seaside flooding from climate change and rising sea levels, 12,495 new homes and businesses in England have been built in areas of medium to high risk from coastal change over the last 10 years. Launching an updated “shifting shores” strategy to adapt to coastal change on the 775 miles of coastline it owns, the National Trust called on central and local governments to take urgent action to cope with storm surges as sea levels rise by an expected 26-82cm this century. “We’re still putting new developments in coastal places that are at risk in spite of public policy warning local authorities and developers not to do that,” said Phil Dyke, coast and marine adviser at the National Trust. “There’s a sense of urgency about not storing up problems for future generations. This isn’t an abstract thing anymore. It’s become a reality. ” The National Trust is drawing up erosion adaptation plans at 80 priority “hotspots” around the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland where erosion is expected to be particularly pronounced. At Formby, north of Liverpool, the sand dunes are rolling back at a rate of four metres each year but storms in the winter of 2013-14 caused a retreat of 30m. At Traeth Llanbedrog, north Wales, the trust has introduced climate change-friendly beach huts, which can be picked up and moved away from the coast to protect them from winter storms. In Birling Gap, East Sussex, the new National Trust visitor centre is designed to be “rolled back” from the rapidly crumbling cliffs. Other coastal beauty spots likely to be transformed by rising seas and increased storminess include St Michael’s Mount and Boscastle in Cornwall; Portstewart Strand, Northern Ireland; Studland, Dorset; Orford Ness, Suffolk; and Lindisfarne Castle in Northumberland. According to research by the National Trust, one in three coastal planning authorities has no plan or policy to deal with rising sea levels. Local authority planning teams have experienced a 46% budget reduction over the last five years. Dyke said the trust wants coastal adaptation – “moving out of harm’s way” – to be an “equal partner” with engineered solutions, such as concrete sea defences. While he said that many coastal communities will always be “defended to the hilt” – such as London with its Thames Barrier, or Portsmouth, an island city whose sea defences will need updating to cope with projected sea level rise – it may prove too expensive to defend wilder coastlines with orthodox sea walls. The Environment Agency predicts that 700 homes will be lost to the sea by 2030. Under current law, the authorities have no obligation to compensate people for the loss of their homes, even if it was once protected by a sea wall. Dyke admitted that government compensation for homes lost to climate change would “open a can of worms” but said there should be more government help for vulnerable homeowners. He said he would like to see more experimental, government-funded schemes such as Happisburgh in Norfolk. Five years ago, local residents at risk of losing their homes were given a “planning right” which they could use to build a new home inland or sell to the local authority. This enabled one street to be “rolled back” from the rapidly eroding cliffs."
"France will reinstate controls on its borders – normally open to countries in Europe’s free-travel zone – for the period around a UN climate conference in Paris, the interior minister has said. Authorities are on alert for violent protesters as well as potential terrorist attacks around the conference, which takes place from 30 November to 11 December. Eighty heads of state, including President Barack Obama, and tens of thousands of other people are expected in Paris for the opening.  Bernard Cazeneuve said on BFM TV on Friday the controls would be in place for a month “in the context of terrorist threats that could come and stain this large international gathering that is carrying a grand message for humanity”. Europe’s so-called Schengen zone of countries with open borders allows for occasional reintroduction of internal border checks, which some countries have done during this year’s migrant crisis. France submitted a note to EU authorities last month announcing border checks at all airports with international flights and at 131 land crossings with Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Luxembourg. It cites Schengen rules allowing controls “when there is a serious threat to public policy”. France is still reeling from deadly attacks by Islamic extremists in January on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery store. Since then, several smaller attacks or attempts have occurred in the country: in August, a heavily armed Islamic radical was prevented by American passengers from attacking a high-speed train. France is also bombing Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq as part of a US-led coalition, and has troops fighting extremists in Africa. The climate conference aims to reach the most ambitious accord to date for world governments – to reduce emissions that cause global warming. Organisers expect at least 40,000 people in addition to tens of thousands of activists from environmental, human rights and other groups from around the world. A big march is planned through Paris on 29 November, and protest groups plan to try to blockade the conference site 11 and 12 December. France faces routine protests that are largely peaceful but sometimes degenerate into violence by an extremist fringe. There were particularly violent protests during a Nato summit in Strasbourg in 2009, when members of the violence-prone “black bloc” attacked police and set a hotel and customs station ablaze, leaving many injured and disrupting official meetings. The US embassy in Paris has warned American citizens to be particularly vigilant around the climate conference. The last time France reinstated national border controls was for a G20 summit in Cannes in 2011."

"Amid the rustling palm trees, blissed newlyweds and colourful attire of a tropical island resort, Pacific leaders have been getting blunt with wealthy nations about the unfolding calamity of climate change that is gradually gnawing away their remote idylls. We in the Pacific are innocent bystanders in the greatest act of folly of any age At a summit in Fiji last week, the last major gathering of Pacific island nations before crunch UN climate talks in Paris next month, islanders thrashed out their collective plea to the world to help address the health impacts of climate change, particularly upon women, infants and adolescents. Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, Fiji’s foreign minister, said the country was dealing with the re-emergence of climate-influenced diseases such as typhoid, dengue fever, leptospirosis and diarrhoeal illnesses. Last year, a dengue outbreak in Fiji infected 20,000 people. But the meeting also showed that Fiji, for one, is not pulling any more punches with large, industrialised nations it sees as culpable for climate change. “We in the Pacific are innocent bystanders in the greatest act of folly of any age,” said Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama. “Unless the world acts decisively in the coming weeks to begin addressing the greatest challenge of our age, then the Pacific, as we know it, is doomed.  “The industrialised nations putting the welfare of the entire planet at risk so that their economic growth is assured and their citizens can continue to enjoy lives of comparative ease. All at the expense of those of us in low-lying areas of the Pacific and the rest of the world.”  Bainimarama added that he has yet to see the “necessary political will” amongst wealthy nations to head off the worst impacts of climate change at the Paris talks.  These gloomy warnings are becoming grimly regular fodder for Pacific islanders to digest and, increasingly, experience first-hand. “It’s an everyday issue here,” said Dr Karen Allen, Unicef’s representative in 14 Pacific nations. “Children here in the Pacific talk about climate change like children elsewhere talk about school or TV. It’s so routine.” Media coverage of climate change in Fiji doesn’t have the luxury of wallowing in the sort of cosseted denialism seen in the US, Britain or Australia.  The lead story in the Fiji Times ​one day last week featured the tale of a seven-year-old child who drowned in an unprecedented high tide in the Namena district. A new FIJI$670,000 ($436,000) sea wall has been approved but the area’s commissioner, Meleti Bainimarama, conceded: “What we are doing is remedial action. I think the best thing to do is relocate the village, but it will come at a cost.”  The other front-page tale featured a man in the same village complaining how his house is regularly swamped by seawater that once lapped 20 metres from his front door. While wealthy nations mull over climate projections and agonise over potential dips in GDP, the stereotypically ebullient Pacific islanders aim to bring some steely reality to Paris. “I won’t be going to Paris wearing the usual friendly, compliant Pacific smile,” warned Bainimarama. “In fact, I won’t be going to Paris in a Pacific frame of mind at all. I fear that our interests are about to be sacrificed.”  Previous UN climate change forums, where dreary jargon often pours treacle over any sense of urgency, have been enlivened by entreaties from Pacific island leaders. But Paris will see an escalation. Pacific islanders will be turning up in numbers – almost all leaders are expected to attend, unlike in Copenhagen in 2009 – and with a string of demands. The latest, the Suva Declaration, calls for an end to new coalmines and a more ambitious limit to global warming. The language has sharpened beyond Fiji – Kiribati president Anote Tong recently called Australia, previously venerated as a benevolent protector in the Pacific, “selfish” for its continued enthusiasm for burning vast amounts of fossil fuels. The cause for concern is clear – Nasa recently reported the world’s sea level has risen nearly 8cm since 1992, with the Pacific experiencing a more rapid increase than other oceans.  A rise of around a metre by the end of the century now looks likely. For low-lying islands in the Pacific, this means coastal erosion, saltwater seeping into precious rainwater catchments and ruined crops.  Meanwhile, rising temperatures will heighten the risk of diseases, including those carried by mosquitos. Cyclones are expected to become more severe. The World Health Organisation estimates climate change will cause around 250,000 deaths globally between 2030 and 2050. At the Fiji summit, delegates wearing Sulu va Taga, a type of traditional kilt, and floral shirts spell out the problems and what must be done. Jarringly, the gathering is being held at a luxury resort on Denarau island, a manmade construction featuring manicured lawns, fountains and an 18-hole golf course, created through seabed dredging and reshaping of the coastline. But the Pacific islands mean business. A lack of regional leadership from Australia – where senior government ministers apparently consider seawater inundation hilarious – is forcing Pacific islanders to set aside their reputation for gentle amiability in order to make themselves heard internationally.  “We don’t want to change the way we are but we need to change our approach so that when we say enough is enough, we are heard,” said Satini Tulaga Manuella, health minister of Tuvalu, which is comprised of nine scattered islands, none of which peak higher than 4.5m above sea level. In March, Tuvalu was pummelled by Cyclone Pam, which washed huge waves over the atolls and ripped apart buildings with 350kmph winds. The dead were upturned from their resting place in cemeteries, crops were ruined, islands reshaped. Tuvalu, the fourth-smallest nation in the world at just 26 sqkm, caught a glimpse of what may cause its demise. But the government is determined the population will not migrate. “People are worried but they want to stay, our priority is to save our country,” Manuella said. “We say if you save Tuvalu you save the world, because if you bring down emissions enough to save us, the rest of the world will be OK. “Science is telling politicians in other countries what is happening. So why aren’t they listening? They have to look after their own people but they also have an obligation to the world. Imagine if a whole race, Tuvaluans, we have our own culture, our own ways, is made extinct overnight because we are hit by a cyclone.” There’s recognition that the smaller of the Pacific islands face the brunt of climate change, even among those in Fiji who have had to move due to its impact.  In January last year, the Fijian village of Vunidogoloa had to relocate several kilometres inland because of the merciless advance of the sea. Saline intrusion was causing crops such as barley and cabbage to fail. The leaves on the trees were turning yellow from the salt. Children were no longer left to play unsupervised after a king tide washed away a young boy. “We were most vulnerable at night because we didn’t know what was happening with the sea,” said Sailosi Ramatu, leader of the village. “Now people are happy, they can sleep at night. We have land that is higher up in Fiji but other countries don’t have that.” The unfairness of islanders suffering the consequences of greenhouse gases they mostly didn’t emit is mirrored by the raw deal suffered by the women who form the cornerstone of family life in the Pacific. The Fiji summit, hosted by the government and the UNFPA, focused on how to deal with the health and gender equity problems thrown up by climate change.  According to figures cited to delegates by Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan, ambassador for the Every Woman Every Child program, women and children are 14 times more likely to die in a natural disaster than men. “Cooking food, taking care of children, fetching water, taking care of livestock – climate change disrupts every element of a woman’s life,” said Zeid, who is the latest royal to lend stardust to the Pacific islands’ cause after Prince Albert of Monaco provided his backing, reportedly sinking a few cans of XXXX with aid workers at a recent call to arms in Kiribati. “When climate impacts are rapid, the consequences for women and children are also severe,” said Zeid. “The greater the gender inequality, the greater the difference.” As women in developing countries do the bulk of caring for children and elderly relatives, they are less likely to escape floods and cyclones. This was demonstrated by 2008’s cyclone Nargis in India, where most of the fatalities were women who held onto children while the men clung to coconut trees. In the Pacific, there are a myriad of problems to work through – many health clinics are at risk from inundation and are inaccessible to those in remote areas. Delivery of maternal and reproductive health is patchy and the risk of sexual assault and abuse is heightened following disaster. “In the Pacific, men surround their thatched homes and hold the poles together to keep their women and children safe inside during a cyclone,” said Unicef’s Allen. “The Pacific has the most incredible strong community spirit of anywhere in the world I’ve been. “That makes it all the harder to face the reality of abuse. Because when your whole culture is built around how much you love and care for each other, it may be difficult to face the fact abuse is increasing.” These challenges require money and Pacific islands are eying the $100bn in climate finance that has been repeatedly promised by wealthy nations. The Paris talks have left open the possibility of major help for adaptation, such as sea walls, new types of crops and relocated facilities, as well as a 1.5C, rather than 2C limit on warming. But proposals for a facility to deal with people displaced by climate change, required because they do not fall under the UN refugee convention, have been dropped, to the dismay of Kiribati, which has purchased land in Fiji and has a “migration with dignity” policy, and the Marshall Islands, where residents of the famous Bikini atoll are currently looking to relocate to the US. It’s a mixed picture that leaves Pacific leaders far from confident that this will finally be the year where their existential crisis triggers a response. “We will see,” said Jone Usamate, Fiji’s health minister. “The world is a system – you do something at one end of the world and it has an impact at the other end.  “So we all need to be responsible but this is not our fault. Unfortunately, we are paying the price for it.”"

"President Obama reputedly remarked of the forthcoming UN climate change summit: “I’m dragging the rest of the world behind me to Paris.” Later this month, 149 nations will congregate to agree national targets for reducing carbon emissions. But Britain, once regarded as a global leader, has relegated itself to the ranks of those reluctantly being pulled along in Obama’s wake. Since the election, the government has performed a series of dizzying U-turns on its green policies. It has announced cuts to subsidies for onshore wind and solar energy; scrapped the zero carbon homes standard; ended the green deal for home insulation; and reversed its promise to exclude national parks from fracking.  There is no question that the green policy framework has been ripe for reform. Some subsidies have been unnecessarily generous and the green levies that pay for them are highly regressive, costing poor households six times as much of their income than the most affluent. But to scrap many subsidies and regulations altogether will be hugely damaging to Britain’s efforts to reduce emissions and is antithetical to Mr Cameron’s 2010 pledge to lead the “greenest government ever”. It is vital that any framework provides long-term certainty to encourage private investment in green technology. Any reform therefore needs to be gradual and signalled well in advance to maintain industry confidence. But to the alarm of green NGOs and business groups alike, the government has ripped up its green policy framework overnight. This will have a long-term effect on investment, and not just in the green sector: business will question whether they can take government commitments at face value. The implications for the UK’s targets to reduce carbon emissions are serious: the independent advisory committee on climate change has warned they are now at risk. And internationally, the timing of the about-turn could not be worse, with global leadership more important than ever in the lead up to Paris. The success of the summit is predicated on countries pushing each other to go further in signing up to targets enshrined in national legislation than they would have done without international co-operation. The targets on the table represent huge progress since the 2009 Copenhagen summit, but more will be needed to limit global warming to the internationally agreed target of two degrees. International leadership will be critical in achieving this, but the UK has stepped back from the leadership role it previously played. George Osborne has explicitly argued that Britain should be going no further than other countries in reducing global warming. If the US, China and India took this attitude, the Paris summit would quickly result in a race to the bottom. The frustration the US is feeling with Britain was evident in Al Gore’s September speech in London: a damning indictment of Britain’s new backseat approach. The Tories have appeared cynical on climate change. In 2006, freshly elected as party leader, Cameron grasped on the green agenda as a way of modernising the Conservative brand. In coalition, the Lib Dems strongly pushed the green policies. So it has only really been since the election in May that the utter lack of Conservative commitment in this area has become so apparent. The green agenda is problematic for the leadership, with Tory backbenchers worried about the unpopularity of onshore wind and green energy levies. But it is clearly not an area Cameron is willing to push: climate change barely got a mention in his conference speech last month. This is in stark contrast to the second-term Obama, who is using the fact he no longer faces re-election to reinvigorate his leadership on climate change. It sets the UK out of kilter with the global dynamic: growing numbers of business leaders embracing the need for action, and countries such as China now part of the international consensus. The Bank of England governor Mark Carney’s recent speech to Lloyd’s on the financial risks of climate change was a signal that the debate had reached the zenith of business thinking. All national leaders have to manage the tension between domestic politics and international affairs. But whether on climate change or Europe, Britain increasingly looks a country for whom short-term domestic politics always trumps international relationships and global co-operation. Our lack of leadership to slow global warming is not just bad for our planet’s climate – it is bad for our long-term national interest."

"As humans warm the planet through the emission of heat-trapping gases, we expect weather to change. Some ways it has changed are clear and measurable. For instance, heat waves and droughts are setting in faster and are more severe. We are also seeing more intense precipitation events that lead to more flooding. But what about storms? We know that hotter ocean waters add fuel to storms, particularly typhoons and hurricanes. That tends to make them stronger. Also, the added heat increases rainfall and the rising seas make us more vulnerable to storm surge. But it isn’t this straightforward. Hurricanes need the right conditions to form and there is evidence that those conditions will become less likely. So, the general rule of thumb is, there may be fewer typhoons and hurricanes, but they will become more intense.  But that is the future, what has the past looked like? A recent paper has just been published which looks at this issue. Now, with good satellite and measurement coverage, we have a good sense of past storm trends. Are we in a hurricane drought or are there plenty of storms occurring now? To answer this, it depends on how you define hurricanes and their strength. Currently, storms are binned to 5 knot wind speeds (grouped together). However, the wind speeds are uncertain to 10 knots. So there is a good deal of uncertainty of the actual strength of a specific storm.  If we look at landfall hurricanes in the USA, the last major hurricane was Wilma in 2005. That hurricane had winds above 96 knots. The 9-year drought for hurricanes of this strength is pretty rare. But what if we define major hurricanes differently, using different thresholds? Then the drought becomes less significant. Furthermore, with an even better measure (pressure) the current hurricane drought disappears because Irene and Sandy made landfall in 2011 and 2012 and had very low pressures. So, what measure do we use, wind speed or pressure? And what levels do we define as major events in our categories? It seems that using the current somewhat arbitrary wind speed is not wise. Under that scheme, both Sandy and Irene are not significant events, even though they caused almost $100 billion in damages. The authors of the above-referenced paper write that even though both pressure and velocity differ in what they represent, both are valid metrics for the intensity of a hurricane. In fact, pressure is usually a better indicator of economic damage than is velocity.  As a further note, while the wind speed is a measure of the air velocity of a hurricane, the square of the speed gives you information about the pressure exerted on surfaces, and the cube of the speed gives you the power of the wind flow. In fact, when I design wind turbines, I routinely use wind speed cubed to estimate available wind power. The term Accumulated Cyclone Energy is a measure of the pressure exerted by wind (velocity squared). The term Power Dissipation Index is a measure of the flow power of wind (velocity cubed).  To me, (I study wind power and fluid mechanics but I am not a hurricane expert), the best measure of a hurricane/cyclone’s strength would be the power dissipation along with measures of the size of the storm and the precipitation. All of these factors work together to lead to economic damage. Perhaps the central pressure in the storm is the best single indicator of these multiple parameters. The authors give convincing evidence that pressure is a better yardstick than just velocity. When we use their yardstick, we see a continuous population of land-fall storms in the USA. The so-called “drought” has disappeared."
"Most Americans know the climate is changing, but they say they are just not that worried about it, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. And that is keeping the American public from demanding and getting the changes that are necessary to prevent global warming from reaching a crisis, according to climate and social scientists. As top-level international negotiations to try to limit greenhouse gas emissions start later this month in Paris, the AP-NORC poll taken in mid-October shows about two out of three Americans accept global warming and the vast majority of those say human activities are at least part of the cause. However, fewer than one in four Americans are extremely or very worried about it, according the poll of 1,058 people. About one out of three Americans are moderately worried and the highest percentage of those polled — 38% — were not too worried or not at all worried. Despite high-profile preaching by Pope Francis, only 36% of Americans see global warming as a moral issue, and only a quarter of those asked see it as a fairness issue, according to the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. “The big deal is that climate has not been a voting issue of the American population,” said Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland. “If the American population were left to lead on the issue of climate, it’s just not going to happen.” Linda Gebel, a 64-year-old retired bookkeeper who lives north of Minneapolis, has read up on global warming. “Everybody’s life would be totally disrupted,” Gebel said. “It will cause famines and wars, huge problems. I don’t know why people wouldn’t be worried about it.” And yet because she lives in the middle of the country – joking that she’ll be “the last one who will be submerged” – Gebel added she doesn’t “feel worried personally. I’m not sure this is going to happen in my lifetime, but I worry about my children. I worry about my grandchildren.” The “lukewarm” feeling and lack of worry has been consistent in polling over the years, even as temperatures have risen, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “The issue hasn’t quite boiled up enough so that people have put it on the top of things they want to focus on,” Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said. White House science adviser John Holdren said climate contrarians emphasize how large the problem is, essentially telling people “the result [of warming] is too scary, so let’s not believe it”. He said these groups have been “incredibly effective in sowing doubt” about global warming."

"Access to cheap, processed food that lacks nutrients is a real issue. In many cases these foods are cheaper and easier to access than healthy nutritious foods. In the UK, there have been campaigns to introduce a sugar tax on drinks and I believe the Scaling Up Nutrition - Civil Society Alliance in Zambia has been recommending this to the government too. This isn’t an outright solution, but making sugary drinks and processed foods more expensive and less attractive to people can make strides towards the SDG. Joanna Francis, food and nutrition policy officer, Concern Worldwide, London, UK, @JoannaFrancis_  The IAEG (the group of UN members states deciding the indicators for the SDG targets) has agreed that childhood wasting and stunting will be added as indicators. Advocacy has ensured that the wasting target will be made meaningful by the highest level of political monitoring, and it will get more attention as a result. Now, we need to push for other nutrition indicators. Glen Tarman, international advocacy director, Action Against Hunger, London, UK In 2006, Peru began a child malnutrition initiative and by 2011, stunting had fallen by a third to 20%. Among the poorest children, stunting prevalence declined from 56% to 44%. Peru’s success included a coalition of international agencies and NGOs that advocated for a commitment to reducing malnutrition, and a strong governmental commitment – nutrition was under the direct control of the prime minister’s office. Julia Krasevec, statistics and monitoring specialist on nutrition, UNICEF, New York, USA, @UNICEFData There is evidence of what works but we need more of the “how”. We also need to facilitate sharing and learning from experience. We started an initiative called Stories of change in nutrition to highlight the pathways and processes through which individuals and organisations grapple with the realities. Stuart Gillespie, CEO, Transform Nutrition, IFPRI, Lewes, UK, @ifpri At the 2014 SUN Global Gathering parliamentarians said that the nutrition community must engage them more as they pass important decisions for their people. Parliamentarians need to be equipped with up-to-date information in a format they can understand so that they can be advocates for nutrition. Boitshepo Bibi, senior nutritionist officer - policy and programmes, FAO, Rome, Italy, @BibiGiyose Women play such a crucial role in children’s nutrition yet they are at greater threat from gender-based violence, and are more likely to lose their lives during and after a disaster. This will have huge impacts on food security for them and their children. Climate change will only exacerbate these disasters so we must build community resilience to prevent setbacks in development and nutrition. Joanna Francis Data availability is slowly increasing for the WHO targets (stunting, wasting, overweight, breastfeeding and anaemia) but it’s not enough. High-income countries especially need to improve as very few of them have comparable data, for example for obesity rates in children under five. Most countries collect this data, but they are, in most cases, not aligned with UN protocols for definitions and collection methods, so the data can’t be compared across countries. Kamilla Eriksen, data analyst, Global Nutrition Report Secretariat, Cambridge, UK, @EriksenKamilla Doing anything in the world – business, trade, entertainment – without proper nutrition is like trying to drive a car without proper fuel. When people understand the central role nutrition plays in life, more sectors may get involved in addressing the challenge. Bruce Lee, director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center (GOPC), Baltimore, MD USA, @bruce_y_lee Let’s align research with what communities need and want, and what will be most useful. Some examples of groups already doing this are Lansa, HarvestPlus, and the Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science. Nabeeha M. Kazi, president and CEO of Humanitas Global and chair of the Community for Zero Hunger, Washington, DC, @nabeehakazi @zhcommunity Schools are the perfect place to reach children and parents or caregivers at the same time. The WHO’s Nutrition Friendly Schools Initiative (NFSI) is looking at how we can improve actions at school level. Workplaces and local stores are also good places to educate people about nutrition. Nabeeha M. Kazi Countries are still grappling with the challenges of implementing and scaling-up appropriate nutrition actions. To move ahead, we need a more focused, disaggregated approach to address these challenges in key countries. This has to be country-driven and will require better sub-national data, evidence, as well as major long-term investment in strengthening capacities at individual, organisational and system-wide levels. Stuart Gillespie We know food fortification works, is cost effective and safe – but only if done properly. We drafted an article on the different factors to consider with iron fortification for it be an effective health intervention. It has to be a top priority for donors, policymakers, and implementers to ensure that every step of the process is monitored. Greg S. Garrett, director of large-scale food fortification, Gain, Geneva, Switzerland, @gsgarrett We have to look at innovative solutions and important actors in the food systems. We will not address malnutrition unless we are able to harness the creative power of the private sector. International and domestic public finance must develop critical infrastructure, provide access to innovative technologies, and build skills and capacities to engage the private sector responsibly. Divya Mehra, policy officer, World Food Program, Rome, Italy, @WFP A zero-hunger world cannot be realised without global, national and regional action in wider domains that cause hunger and poor nutrition. We must address the root causes to existing and potential conflicts and work to reduce the impacts of conflicts and violence on people, hunger and undernutrition. This is why SDG 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies should preoccupy us as much as SDG 2. Glen Tarman Read the full Q&A here. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"It is almost impossible to convey the extraordinary landscape of an inhabited coral atoll without seeing it firsthand. From the sky, the thin strips of low-lying land surrounding turquoise blue lagoons make sense as a refuge for the explorer who has been months at sea. But as a place to live, build a home and create a culture it feels the most unlikely site for human society. At most points water can be seen on both sides of these strips of land. As sandbars between islets have been converted into roads the impression is created that in many places the width of the country is the width of the street.  Footpaths, guttering, sewerage, landfill – issues that were overcome decades ago in normal terrestrial environments – represent a complex set of problems in countries like the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu, for which viable solutions have yet to be found. Every square inch of land matters. On Kiribati, there is no escaping the ruthless geographic constraints – graves prove an odd sight in many people’s small front gardens – an unavoidable by-product of having no space to bury the dead. While land is a necessary precondition for life, people live on these atolls because of the sea. It is the source of food, culture and legend. These are marine people whose ancient understanding of the wind and the waves still often transcends what modern equipment has to offer. Yet as the greenhouse effect starts to take hold these winds are beginning to change. Predictable weather patterns in equatorial environments which produced constant temperatures, regular rains and seasonal storms are no longer behaving. Life is being disturbed. Of all the climate change threats to coral atolls the most pressing is water security. On Tarawa atoll in Kiribati, half the fresh ground water supply is now permanently salty. On Funafuti in Tuvalu there is no groundwater, which leaves people dependent on water tanks next to their homes – many of which have been provided by Australian aid. But even with extra tanks the water supply of the atoll amounts to about six weeks worth of water. In November 2011 reduced rainfall brought the atoll to a point where the water supply was down to just a few days. Drastic water restrictions were imposed which essentially allowed for little more than the bare minimum of drinking water. Australian and New Zealand mercy flights had to airlift an emergency supply of water on to the island. This community had lived on the atoll for centuries relying on highly predicable rainfall in order to have a supply of fresh water. Just a small shift in weather patterns had suddenly overwhelmed even the enhanced infrastructure to a point where there was almost no water. When winds and rain change, the conditions of life are thrown into question. This question raises another for Australia. Kiribati and Tuvalu are in a region where Australia has enormous influence and great obligations. We are for both countries the natural development partner and by far the largest aid donor. In large measure it is this work which sits atop our calling card as a good global citizen. And we derive much from that reputation. If climate change is beginning to raise the existential question in the Pacific then this also has implications for our obligations. To be sure, the desire for the peoples of the Pacific to migrate because of climate change will not happen tomorrow. The focus of all these communities right now is naturally on how they maintain their homes, lives and cultures. And currently they see the critical role for Australia as playing its part in reducing greenhouse emissions and in supporting them with adaptation efforts. But if climate change is placing the viability of communities in question, then inevitably some people will move as a result. So Australia being a destination for climate change migrants surely has to be up for discussion. Yet this is a public debate we have barely even begun. This does not have to be a scary debate for us. Australia has an annual net permanent migration intake of just over 200,000 people. The total combined population of the atoll nations of Kiribati and Tuvalu is about 120,000. Not all of these people will seek to come to Australia. Indeed none may come. And if any do, it will not be in the next few years and it will not be all at once. But if we are to avoid another fraught debate in a space which has been the source of more than its fair share, we have to talk about this now rather than wait until the issue is upon us. Australia is rightly proud of the generosity of our humanitarian immigration program. While our intake is proportionately the largest in the world, what this misses is that Australia is not adjacent to any large source of refugees. It is countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey which bear the biggest burden of the conflict in Syria. It is in this sense that the Pacific must be our issue. And the movement of people is a part of that. To deny this would be to dramatically alter Australia’s place in the world, both in terms of how the world views us and more importantly how we view ourselves."

"Before solar panels were installed at Masaki village’s only health centre, doctors, nurses and midwives had to use dim flashlights or the glow from their cellphones to deliver babies and treat night-time emergencies. In one case in 2010, a man arrived late after a motorcycle accident and needed a wound stitching. As the nurse began the procedure by the light of her torch, she felt a cold slithering sensation against her legs.  A large black snake was moving across the dark, cement floor. The nurse fled, leaving the patient in the dark with the snake. The work of the centre, which is five hours drive down a dirt track from the capital Dar es Salaam and serves a population of 1.5 million people in surrounding villages, is now transformed by a two kilowatt solar array installed on the roof at a cost of $15,000 (£9,700). And the government wants many more like it.  In February, it launched its One Million Solar Homes initiative to provide the sun’s power to 1m properties by 2017. Off Grid Electric, the Tanzanian company implementing the initiative, says it will provide power to 10% of the country’s homes. Currently, only 40% have access to grid power with access particularly sparse in rural areas. The challenge across Africa is daunting. Earlier this year, a report by Kofi Annan’s Africa Progress Panel spelled out that excluding South Africa, which generates half the region’s electricity, sub-Saharan Africa uses less electricity than Spain. It would take the average Tanzanian eight years to use as much electricity as an average European would consume in a single month. The report, titled Power, People, Planet: Seizing Africa’s Energy and Climate Opportunities, called for a 10-fold increase in power generation to provide all Africans with access to electricity by 2030.  If this shortfall is made up largely with fossil fuels - particularly coal - then the impact on the world’s climate will be significant. But solar is dropping rapidly in price and starting to compete with traditional forms of energy. World Bank energy data show that it costs 20 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 20 cents for hydropower, 25c for fuel oil and 10c for coal. Funding for the million homes initiative has come partly from the government’s Rural Energy Agency - which spends $400m a year - and international donors such as the World Bank. And in rural areas, microfinance organisations are now lending to allow householders to by solar panels. The total installation can cost up to $1,000. “People who have small shops no longer close their shops early because they don’t have electricity. They can now operate until late at night. The availability of solar electricity has helped control immigration of people to urban areas,” says alternative energy specialist Dr Brenda Kazimili at the University of Dar es Salaam. The government now wants all health centres and dispensaries that are not connected to the grid countrywide to be provided with solar panels.  Back at Masaki village health centre, the changes were much needed. “We’d begged for so long for solar power at this health centre. Life was unbearable here. We faced so many challenges and it was hard to work at night or do tests that required electricity,” said clinical officer Ahmed Mkamba. “[Now] we have even installed a satellite dish to keep the health workers entertained after work. Mothers no longer have to be sent to far-away health centres to conduct simple tests and health workers don’t have to walk long distances simply to charge mobile phones.”  Health workers use the power from the solar panels (and the battery installed so that they can use the power at night) to run a computer which keeps patient records, to light the centre’s compound which covers about three or four acres of land and to operate HIV/Aids testing equipment. This means that patients no longer need to be sent to the district hospital 28km away.  And says Mkamba: “The lights keep away the snakes.” "

"When we are in the midst of economic strife, as we saw in 2008, the health of our environment often gets shunted down the priority list by tough-talking governments. Environmental problems are often characterised as oppositional to raising living standards. Yet, tackling inequality (pdf) is exactly what we need to do if we are serious about building a safe and healthy natural environment, as well as essential for a sustainable economy.   Since the publication of Thomas Piketty’s Capital there has been increasing political and academic agreement that rampant inequality is bad economics, with Christine Lagarde and Mark Carney some of the more recent ambassadors for closing the gap between the haves and the have-nots. But it’s not just bad economics – it’s bad for the planet too.  Inequality of income, opportunity, and ability to participate often correlate and lead to the least well-off – and least able to effectively demand that things are done differently – being hit hardest by pollution and environmental impacts. To take just one topical example, particulate air pollution is higher in the poorest 20% of neighbourhoods in the UK. But it’s a common theme. Ask yourself how often a new incinerator is proposed for the middle of a millionaire’s row. People that are better off are simply more able to speak up – or perhaps more accurately, be heard – on things that affect them. That’s why Friends of the Earth has always been proud to stand with those at the sharp end of environmental problems. Just a few months ago we celebrated with Valley communities as Caerphilly Council threw out plans for a massive, open-cast coal mine in Nant Llesg in Wales – although we hear that the company is likely to appeal the planning decision.  The fundamental injustice of environmental damage is that it usually happens to those least able to act against it. This is writ large with crises like climate change: largely caused by rich countries, yet which overwhelmingly impact those in the poorest countries. It’s why a core focus for NGOs at the upcoming climate talks in Paris is ‘fair shares’ – with rich countries cutting their emissions fastest, and helping developing countries switch to clean energy.  Research also suggests that more unequal societies find it hardest to deliver strong environmental policies. Indeed, as Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson, authors of The Spirit Level, argue, “inequality is being taken up as an important environmental issue; because it drives status competition, it intensifies consumerism and adds to personal debt.”  Ultimately, tackling inequality is integral to giving everyone a chance of a decent life on an increasingly crowded, resource-stressed planet. Most governments see their overriding priority as delivering growth in GDP, but for as long as economic growth relies on consumption of natural resources, is there enough planet for everyone to aspire to the resource consumption of the very richest? I doubt it. If the aim is – as it should be – to deliver decent lives for all on a thriving and abundant planet, we’re going to have to share things out more effectively than we do at present.  One thing employers should do to narrow the gap between rich and poor is pay a decent living wage. Although Friends of the Earth has been paying well above the Living Wage for years, we’re very proud this week to add our name to the growing roster of Living Wage accredited organisations. Ignoring the wider macro economic and environmental problems, paying a decent wage is just the right thing for employers to do, and to be seen to be doing. The cost of living has soared relative to wages over the last decade, with the gulf particularly pronounced in London but keenly felt nationwide.  The Living Wage Foundation calculate the rate (newly confirmed today) as the amount people actually need to get by; it’s worked out by the actual cost of basic goods. George Osborne may have appropriated the phrase in his July 2015 Budget, but his new ‘National Living Wage’ – while a step in the right direction – isn’t calculated like this and isn’t good enough.  So paying the (real) Living Wage is an important start, and it’s great to see so many other organisations and businesses doing the right thing and accrediting, during Living Wage Week and beyond. But we need to look to our politicians to do much more on inequality in all its various incarnations. While the last 40 years has seen huge growth in the UK economy, this has been alongside big rises in inequality and no increase in reported wellbeing.  We need higher environmental standards and quality of life for everyone. Better priorities – reducing economic inequality, and giving people far stronger legal rights to influence decisions that affect them and their localities – would be a good start."
"Coal giant Peabody Energy has agreed to change the way it reports the risks posed to investors by climate change, ending an eight-year investigation by the New York attorney general. Peabody and attorney general Eric Schneiderman confirmed they had reached an agreement on Monday, after the company was accused of issuing misleading statements on the risks it could face from tightening climate change laws.      Previously, Peabody has argued that it was unable to predict the impacts of future policy on its revenues, even though it had made internal projections that regulations could hit the business, a statement from Schneiderman’s office said. Peabody has agreed to amend its disclosures but insisted it had not admitted wrongdoing, and faced no financial penalty. The company said it would now provide a more comprehensive analysis of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) world energy outlook scenarios, and include details on how future laws or regulations governing the coal industry could impact its business model. The agreement came in the same week the IEA published its latest annual outlook, carrying a stark warning for the future of coal. Currently the world’s largest source of energy, the IEA predicts the coal market is heading for a “turbulent” period. Slowing demand from China and government efforts to attract cleaner sources of energy mean only 10% of new energy supplies will come from coal by 2040, according to the IEA. The report details how the transition to a global low carbon energy system is gathering pace, with renewables set to become the largest source of new energy capacity over the next 35 years, largely at the expense of the coal market. “As a publicly traded company whose core business generates massive amounts of carbon emissions, Peabody Energy has a responsibility to be honest with its investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, now and in the future,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “I believe that full and fair disclosures by Peabody and other fossil fuel companies will lead investors to think long and hard about the damage these companies are doing to our planet.” The attorney general’s office had discovered Peabody’s own internal projections showed that coal sales in the US could fall by at least 33% as a result of tough regulations on existing power plants in the US. The attorney general also accused Peabody of presenting lopsided views of IEA reports, by choosing to report only on the “current policy scenario” which assumes governments fail to tighten up climate change policies, and ignoring the two other scenarios which paint a less favourable picture for coal growth. Last week, it emerged ExxonMobil is facing a separate investigation by the New York attorney general’s office over whether it misled the public and investors over the scale of the climate risks the oil giant faces. The New York Times revealed that Schneidermann has issued a subpoena to the company, calling for financial records, emails, and other documents relating to its work on climate change and its disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The paper also reported for the first time that a long-running investigation had been underway into Peabody Energy relating to whether it has adequately reported on climate risks to investors. ExxonMobil has rejected a series of recent allegations that it understood potential climate risks as early as the 1970s, while continuing to underplay the information and fund groups that cast doubt on mainstream climate science. In related news that could deal a further blow to the global coal market, the US has reportedly struck a deal with Japan to reduce credit agency financing for coal projects, as part of efforts to tackle climate change. According to the Financial Times, the plans will be debated at an OECD meeting in Paris next week."

"Concern about climate change among people in China – the world’s biggest carbon polluter – has plummeted in the past five years, according to new research. The Chinese were the least concerned among 40 nations surveyed. Only 18% of Chinese citizens are seriously concerned about the issue, a drop of 23 points since 2010, the US Pew Research Center report published on Thursday shows.  Nevertheless more than two-thirds of Chinese people support a global deal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the research states. China ranked as the country where citizens were least concerned about the issue among 40 nations participating in the study.  On average, 54% of the 45,000 people who participated globally expressed serious concern. Bruce Stokes, the co-author of the report, said there was “frankly, no explanation” for the drop, but suggested as a possible reason that “there must not be as much public discussion about climate change in China as there are in other parts of the world”. In 2010, China overtook the US to become both the biggest producer and biggest consumer of energy in the world. Its government has been applauded by some for its commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% from 2005 levels and to see its emissions peak by 2030. Despite their lack of concern about climate change, when asked which domestic issues they found most problematic, Chinese participants consistently named air pollution near the top. Air pollution is thought to cause thousands of deaths every day in the country, with coal accounting for two-thirds of China’s energy consumption. Despite the apparent absence of anxiety in China, 71% of people interviewed there gave their support to their government curbing greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international agreement due to be renegotiated at a crunch UN conference in Paris in December where leaders from more than 190 countries will meet. The study revealed marked support for an agreement in almost all of the countries surveyed – Pakistan was the sole exception – even in those countries where there was little anxiety about the issue. “The public are crying out for action,” said Stokes.  “Any public policy issue where you get that many people saying this is a concern to us it seems to me it is a wake-up call to governments. This is an issue that negotiators and governments have got to address,” he said. But in the US, where Barack Obama introduced landmark reforms in August, implementation of public policy would be hampered by stark political divisions, said Stokes.  While 45% of Americans described climate change as a very serious issue, only 20% of Republicans agreed, compared with 68% of Democrats.  American Catholics are more likely to be concerned than Protestants, with the findings published as another study suggests that they have been energised on the issue by Pope Francis’s call to action in his landmark encyclical in June and his visit to the US and address to Congress three months later.  Of those interviewed in the survey by the Yale project on Climate Change Communication, 35% of Catholics and 17% of Americans said their views on global warming had been influenced by the pontiff’s interventions.  Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK are experiencing similar divisions, suggests the report by the Pew Research Center.  In Australia, where emission reduction targets are lower than some comparable developing countries, 31% of rightwing Liberal party supporters expressed serious concern, compared to 65% of leftwing Labour voters. Climate change is seen as a priority in Latin America, where 76% see it as a serious concern. The highest level of concern (86%) was in Brazil, home to one of the planet’s largest carbon sinks in the Amazonian forest as well as the oil giant Petrobras. Drought was consistently cited as the most worrying consequence of climate change compared with the other options given: rising sea levels, hot weather patterns and severe weather events such as flooding or intense storms."

"The Turnbull government is considering options to increase its $200m contribution to the international Green Climate Fund, which will be a crucial issue at the UN climate meeting in Paris in December. In what was seen as a shift in its stance on the global talks, Australia announced last week it had successfully sought to once again co-chair the fund, which was originally derided by the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, before he finally agreed to contribute $200m over four years after strong international pressure.  The fund is supposed to channel $100bn a year in public and private financing to developing countries by 2020. The OECD has calculated about $62bn a year has been committed, and making up the shortfall is a crucial demand from developing countries in the Paris negotiations.  The former Labor government was an early donor, tipping in $500,000 in 2012 to help get the fund going, as well as almost $600m on a precursor “fast-start” fund. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, says the Turnbull government should at least restore that funding. “Tony Abbott ended up begrudgingly committing $200m but only after he had slashed the climate commitments our government had made and that were still in the forward estimates,” Butler told Guardian Australia. “Malcolm Turnbull still has ground to make up just to get back to where we were before Tony Abbott’s savage cuts … climate finance is going to be an important part of an agreement in Paris and Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop could undo some of the damage that Tony Abbott did if they followed our lead and put their money where their mouth is.”  Constrained by a promise before the leadership challenge to stick by Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy – at least until a review in 2017 – the Turnbull government is considering taking some additional pledges on climate financing to Paris. Among the ideas being discussed at officials level is setting up a Clean Energy Finance Corporation-style financing mechanism to lend money to climate projects in developing countries, supplementing the $200m in grants which was taken from the aid budget. The option would mean a funding increase would not hit the budget bottom line and is one of a number of ideas for announcements the government could make in Paris, where it will be represented at various times by Turnbull, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the environment minister, Greg Hunt. When he won government, Abbott criticised the Green Climate Fund as “a Bob Brown Bank on an international scale” to which Australia would make no contribution. It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to the fund in an attempt to reject any measures that were really “socialism masquerading as environmentalism”. The Abbott government also pointedly dissented from support for the fund – a move described by one commentator as “history-making” – in a communique from a November 2013 Commonwealth heads of government meeting – a stance backed by Canada. The former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper also eventually announced his country would contribute to the fund. Both Abbott and Harper have now been replaced, meaning the Chogm this month is unlikely to suffer such dissent. Ewen McDonald, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was appointed co-chair of the Green Climate Fund board alongside South Africa’s Zaheer Fakir for the first year of its operations – from August 2012 to August 2013. After that Australia still sat on the fund’s board, before being re-elected as co-chair. “Australia is seen as a pragmatic, constructive and results-focused member of the Green Climate Fund,” Bishop said in a statement announcing Australia was again co-chair. The Greens environment spokeswoman, Senator Larissa Waters, had called the government “hypocritical” for seeking to co-chair the fund when its own climate targets were “pathetic” and it continued to approve new coal mega-mines."
"Australia should be at the forefront of efforts to resettle climate change migrants forced from their homes across the Pacific, Labor says. The opposition immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, visited Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands and Kiribati last week, observing the impacts of climate change on the low-lying islands.  Writing for Guardian Australia, Marles argues that as climate change raises existential questions for the nations of the Pacific, “this also has implications for [Australia’s] obligations”. “The desire for the peoples of the Pacific to migrate because of climate change will not happen tomorrow,” he says. “The focus of all these communities right now is naturally on how they maintain their homes, lives and cultures. And currently they see the critical role for Australia as playing its part in reducing greenhouse emissions and in supporting them with adaptation efforts. “But if climate change is placing the viability of communities in question, then inevitably some people will move as a result. So Australia being a destination for climate change migrants surely has to be up for discussion.” Marles says Australia has enormous capacity to assist Pacific Island nations. Australia’s annual net migration intake is more than 200,000 people. The combined population of atoll nations Kiribati and Tuvalu is less than 120,000. “Not all of these people will seek to come to Australia,” Marles says. “Indeed none may come. And if any do it will not be in the next few years and it will not be all at once. But if we are to avoid another fraught debate in a space which has been the source of more than its fair share, then we have to talk about this now rather than wait until the issue is upon us. “It is in this sense that the Pacific must be our issue. And the movement of people is a part of that.” A new legal framework may be required to deal with forced migration caused by climate change. People displaced by rising seas, catastrophic weather events or climate impacts do not qualify as refugees under the 1951 refugee convention. An i-Kiribati man, Ioane Teitiota, failed to have his claim accepted by New Zealand courts as the world’s first climate change refugee and he was deported last month. Different Pacific nations have different migratory plans, and options. The population of the Marshall Islands – 72,000 people – has the right to migrate to the US. People from Palau, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and the Federated States of Micronesia have legal rights, or practical access, to labour markets in New Zealand or the US. But the people of PNG, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Nauru and Kiribati have no such rights, and essentially no place to go. Kiribati – population 105,000 – is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels: 97% of its land mass is less than five metres above sea level. The president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, who in September referred to Australia as “the big polluting island down south”, has implemented a program called Migration with Dignity, designed to provide his people with education and vocational training so they can find work abroad if – as most projections suggest – their homeland becomes unliveable. A policy analyst with the Migration Council Australia, Henry Sherrell, says although forced migration as a result of climate change is often overemphasised globally, the Pacific was unique. “There is a compelling case that a number of Pacific countries will become unliveable in future decades,” he says. “As one of the Pacific’s most prosperous countries, Australia must consider what role to play. Our capacity to assist Pacific citizens is unrivalled in terms of positive migration experiences.” Sherrell says Australia should begin discussing policy responses, such as a dedicated Pacific permanent visa lottery, immediately, not in two or three decades when movement was imminent and potentially disordered. “Being proactive instead of reactive on these issues will show this is an opportunity where Australia can help, and not in any way a threat,” he says.

"Ignorant as I am, I don’t think I’d ever fully appreciated the breadth of disciplines involved in social science until I was asked to help judge the Economic and Social Research Council’s (ESRC) writing competition this year. Held in conjunction with academic publisher Sage, and celebrating the ESRC’s 50th anniversary, the competition invited ESRC-funded PhD students from across the UK to use their creative and analytical skills and write a prediction of impact the social sciences and current research will have in 2065.  Science communication is currently something of a buzz phrase in the academic world, so it was particularly interesting to see how this crop of up-and-coming scientists set about encapsulating their hopes and fears for their disciplines over the next 50 years in under 800 words. The overall winner was James Fletcher, and entries by Gioia Barnbrook and Josephine Go Jefferies were highly commended. All three winning entries are below; they’re very different in tone, style and focus. They make thought-provoking reading and I hope you enjoy them as much as I and my fellow judges did. They are reproduced here exactly as they were submitted to the judging panel.  On February 12th 2015, I moved to London to begin my PhD. During my subsequent 50 years as a sociologist studying and living in them, cities have undergone momentous transitions. This brief history charts their recent prosperity through the story of London, a tale of decentralisation enabling visionary corporate finance and social science to recast the physical and socioeconomic architecture of cities.  I arrived in London just as the social sciences were beginning to develop the approaches that would ensure their success, focussing on practical impact, interdisciplinary collaboration and corporate involvement. I moved into the borough of Tower Hamlets, London’s economic powerhouse, with an economy worth £6billion annually and a young populace; more of whom had been born in Bangladesh than the UK. This wealth production, youth and diversity was representative of London more generally. Conversely, the rest of the UK had a faltering economy and an ageing conservative population with increasing immigration concerns. Thus, London and the UK were diverging. 2015 also saw unprecedented election gains for the Scottish National Party, triggering increased devolvement to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some cities. Strong SNP election performances in 2020 and 2025 forced the government to offer federalisation in 2027 to avoid a referendum on secession. Eventually, on December 12th 2042, England, Wales and Northern Ireland were also federalised, mirroring a global decentralisation trend.  Amidst decentralisation, London continued to grow, steadily gaining devolved powers. As 2043 arrived, the city into which I had moved 28 years previously was unrecognisable. From the 900m high tower in which I now lived, I surveyed a transforming cityscape, embracing recent technological developments. In 2022, Saudi Arabia completed Kingdom Tower, the world’s first kilometre high building. Besides technological innovation, it also had profound cultural implications; a range of social science consultants having pioneered community creation models. Under their guidance, its 5.5million ft2 of floor space offered offices, malls, accommodation and even artificial forests, stimulating a self-contained society with a culture of independence. Twelve years and four towers later, Kingdom City was a thriving metropolis of 2.1 million people. It represented a triumph for private finance and social science collaboration, setting a precedent for socially conscious corporation rule with minimal state involvement. Kingdom City prompted numerous equivalent developments throughout the Middle East and Asia in the late 2030s; social theory informed, self-contained, and privately administered. These express-cities dealt with population problems and boosted economies with ease, vindicating social planning.   Meanwhile, London had developed an immense housing crisis; its ballooning population shackled by construction regulation. London was desperate to emulate aforementioned eastern successes. It turned to its collection of world leading institutions, representing internationally renowned social psychologists, human geographers and many more, to plan ground-breaking reinvention. Throughout the 2040s, backed by multinational finance, London set about implementing their vision. Whilst primarily based around sociological community-seeding-housing ideas, this also facilitated a transport revolution. London already scorned cars, championing cycling and enjoying an unrivalled underground system following four Crossrail projects. Driverless electric vehicles had been increasingly present since the mid-2020s as battery technology improved. By the mid-30s, London proposed banning all human-driven petrol-fuelled vehicles, but the UK government was opposed; concerned that decreased fuel imports might jeopardise Gulf State relations. By the early-2040s, London was powerful enough to press ahead. Again the social sciences, bolstered by increasingly successful corporate ventures into city design, were instrumental in infrastructure planning, embedding the belief that public and corporate desires for liveability and efficiency were compatible. Resultantly, in 2053, the last human drove through the city. Simultaneously, influential internet scholars drove complete 5G rollout, providing unparalleled internet access. Contrastingly, large parts of the rest of the UK lacked 4G, creating a national digital divide. The scene was now set for divorce. In 2056 the government accepted a federalisation referendum. On May 4th 2058, London voted to become the UK’s fifth state.   Today, whilst technically federalised, London is essentially sovereign. Since the early-50s, state involvement has been nominal, particularly following parliament’s relocation to Manchester. London, like many 20th century capitals, now more closely resembles the Martian colonies than the nation surrounding it. These old nation states, largely unaltered from 2015, are increasingly inferior, especially as Space X’s mines and hydroponic innovations further improve city living standards. Social science’s guidance of private capital has enabled Jakarta, Doha and many more to smoothly transcend state structures, each now existing as a well-organised corporate amalgamation. This change is evident in my current work. Whilst trickledown economics and stringent immigration controls have all but ended real-term deprivation, inequality remains entrenched. Employed by London Inc., who are concerned by talent prevention, I am currently developing proposals to stimulate social mobility. This is just one example of how corporate-social science synergy is cultivating prosperous city societies in 2065. It is one of the most iconic visual representations of climate change: a lone polar bear stands on a thin ice floe, surrounded by a sea so grey it reaches the horizon and simply merges with the sky. In some variations the polar bear perches instead on rocks, its fur scraggly and muddy, standing protectively over cubs. Either way, the intended impact is the same; the picture tells us that these are the victims of the melting Arctic. It is rarer, at the moment at least, to see images of the human cost of climate change. We see its impacts primarily in terms of the natural world, and rarely think in terms of social costs. Communities in the Arctic, and the researchers who work alongside them, are already noticing drastic changes in their environment: rising temperatures are affecting sea ice and making traditional subsistence hunting activities far more precarious and dangerous; people have died travelling by snowmobile across previously solid ice that rising temperatures have made fragile. At the other extreme, record high temperatures across parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East have led to fatalities. At present we in the UK are protected by our location, but we know from past experience that the intricacies of global markets, resource trading and politics mean that difficulties in other parts of the world have global impact. What happens in any one part of the world can have global ramifications.  If, for the moment, we still think primarily in terms of the natural consequences of climate change, in 2065 it will be impossible to ignore its social and humanitarian impacts: food and water shortages, mass migration and resource wars seem likely, coupled with large-scale political and economic unrest. Perhaps it is fitting that some of the most popular books and films of the last decade have been set in dystopian futures. Dreams of tomorrow, once populated by hover-boards, flying cars and holidays to Mars, now seem far less hopeful: they no longer come to us in the technicolour joy of the sixties and seventies, but in a muted, washed-out sepia. From this vantage point, the future looks decidedly bleak, and we may well wonder what use we will have for the social sciences in a world of catastrophic environmental decline and change.  This would be a mistake. The social sciences are unique in their ability to enable us to understand the complexity of the conditions, networks and interconnections that influence human behaviour, and can operate on both the large and small scale. This information will be essential in aiding governments, NGOs and policy-makers with developing appropriate responses to the humanitarian and social crises climate change will bring. Those social sciences that emphasise long-term qualitative research, such as my own discipline of anthropology, will be of particular value in developing regional and group-specific responses. Anthropologists working in the Canadian Arctic and sub-arctic have already begun to work collaboratively with indigenous communities and scientific researchers in documenting the impacts of climate change and developing possible resilience and adaptation strategies. These studies also show how important interdisciplinary approaches are that involve local, scientific and social scientific perspectives: in the future we will be struggling with issues that have both natural and social causes and impacts, and we will need research that can synthesise these perspectives. Sustained ethnographic research, surveys and statistical modelling will help us to develop inter-disciplinary approaches that can do justice to the complexity of these challenges. In 2065 we will need the social sciences more than ever before. As they say: High! Welcome to the Scafell Pioneering Neighbourhood! Did you enjoy the view of the algae farm terraces on your way up? They’re here to keep us comfortable, rather than for survival per se, although thinking about it, they do provide mitochondrial biofuel to maintain vast server systems, so you could argue they are, in fact, for survival.  So far from sea level, we get most of our potable water through our aspiration of the atmosphere aided by hyaluronic acid supplements. We are clean air fanatics up here, and it’s nice to recycle and know that the quality you put in is what you get out in water terms. Your visit is sponsored by our historic brigade of mountain rescue volunteers – now that we’re all moving to higher ground where it’s cooler and drier, we do what we can, and hope you will too, to let your data be tracked while you’re up here to help advance the science of controlling human and natural conflagrations. I’ve trained as a Mountain Search and Rescue Volunteer but we’re all standing members of the Fire Service, as we anticipate global warming to trigger more drought and forest fires, especially in the lowlands. Our hope is to make wildfire and combustion relics of the past. Only nostalgia buffs and the most privileged innovators can afford to burn oxygen - really who would want to? We all agree it’s precious. Fire fighting is quite an interesting spectacle, actually, I don’t know if you’ll ever get to witness one unless it’s during a commemorative public fixture. Planned tabula rasa combats conflagration by asphyxiation - literally dialling down the oxygen in the atmosphere. It’s harder to control oxygen in the more populated areas, but they’re working on it. Ooh, good question! I think it was someone who thought of reversing the power of flash mobs – I mean it’s still about solidarity but now it’s kind of organised to maintain the balance of power in society – so everyone does their bit. I think there’s less inequality now, do you know what I mean? Forgive me, because I’m not an expert, but I think it started with experimental smart cities and they took up the idea from Zuurmond’s infocracies – I mean, the reason we managed to go solar initially is because the server farms required it, right? The power needed to run anticipatory rather than participatory democracies? Some say they manufacture dissent - for drama, and catharsis – but I think it’s also to flush out the data flow from shadow populations who are more apathetic – make everyone a heavy breather, at least for a little while, you know, just enough to register a reading and get a snapshot of oxygen consumption at a given time. You know what they say: Sport is good. Data rules... right? Anyway, during the spontaneous census they will interview me to see why I’m in favour of this and against that. Just to ensure my opinions haven’t been hacked, you know, to guard against corruption by harmful private interests. Data rules infocracies, and democracies people do! So how it works is the actions we take are screened for relevance to any given question. We consent to our acts and opinions being counted, and it’s made transparent in the continuous count so we understand the implications of our acts and opinions as a collective. Any inconsistencies are flagged, and we get an option to compare ourselves against the values of the electorate. What, actual elections? They’re kind of just ceremonial, really. I guess it’s less dramatic but we’re a more steady community - without all that manipulative rhetoric flying about in what’s left of the news media, making everyone angry and anxious. Life’s tough enough up here without making enemies of your neighbours. The small things seem to matter more these days, which I’m in favour of. My paid job is to test these wearables designed to optimise blood oxygen saturation. We’re all extreme sportswomen up here! Implants? Nah, it’s easier to upgrade with skins and surfaces are minimally invasive. Go smooth systems! These info drones help me to train at altitude, and will accompany the family on holiday soon. My Search and Rescue duties, my job and my life are intertwined. There were great ideological battles in the past about work-life balance, but that was before ubiquitous streaming, which gives our team advantages on the happiness meter, earning time-off in lieu. It’s just the idea of time-off, really, but ideas count! I think happiness matters more than bitcredit, care dollars and the million other point schemes you could choose. Anyway, while I’m on holiday, as long as the geo-climactic conditions and my exertion levels show positive alignment, I get professional development credit and a dopamine rush! Everyone’s happy!"

"Scientists at a research centre on Hawaii’s Coconut Island have embarked on an experiment to grow “super coral” that they hope can withstand the hotter and more acidic oceans that are expected with global warming. The quest to grow the hearty coral comes at a time when researchers are warning about the dire health of the world’s reefs, which create habitats for marine life, protect shorelines and drive tourist economies.  When coral is stressed by changing environmental conditions, it expels the symbiotic algae that live within it and the animal turns white or bright yellow, a process called bleaching, said Ruth Gates, director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. If the organisms are unable to recover from these bleaching events, especially when they recur over several consecutive years, the coral will die. Gates estimated that about 60 to 80% of the coral in Kaneohe Bay has bleached this year. “The bleaching has intensified and got much more serious,” said Gates, of the coral around the bay. Where they once looked for the bleached coral among the healthy, Gates said her team is now “looking for the healthy individuals in a sea of pale corals”. Gates and her team are taking the coral to their centre on the 29-acre isle and slowly exposing them to slightly more stressful water. They bathe chunks of coral that they’ve already identified as having strong genes in water that mimics the warmer and more acidic oceans. They are also taking resilient strains and breeding them with one another, helping perpetuate those stronger traits. The theory they are testing is called assisted evolution, and while it has been used for thousands of years on other plants and animals, the concept has not been applied to coral living in the wild. “We’ve given them experiences that we think are going to raise their ability to survive stress,” Gates said. She said they hope to see these corals, which will soon be transplanted into the bay, maintain their colour, grow normally and then reproduce next summer. In early October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said that coral reefs worldwide are experiencing bleaching, calling the event extensive and severe. “We may be looking at losing somewhere in the range of 10 to 20% of the coral reefs this year,” Noaa coral reef watch coordinator Mark Eakin said when the report was released. “Hawaii is getting hit with the worst coral bleaching they have ever seen.” And this is the second consecutive year Hawaii has experienced widespread bleaching. Scientists say some coral has already fallen victim to global warming. About 30% of the world’s coral population has already perished as a result of above average ocean temperatures, El Niño’s effects and acidification. Gates and her team understand the challenges of scalability and time. Having success locally does not necessarily mean they will be able to scale their project to address a massive, global marine crisis before much of the world’s coral reefs are already gone. Tom Oliver, a marine biologist and team leader at Noaa’s Coral Reef Ecosystem Division, said the project is scalable with the requisite amount of effort and funding. He said, “the question is not can they do it, it’s can they do it fast enough?” Oliver said that many reef restoration projects struggle because of the cost and time involved with raising standard coral and planting it in the ocean. “Restoration needs to have brood stock that can handle the changing conditions on reefs,” he said. Gates said more research needs to be done before they can begin to address scalability. In 2013, Gates and her Australian counterpart Dr Madeleine van Oppen, who does coral research at the Australia Institute of Marine Science, won the $10,000 (£6,500) Paul G Allen Ocean Challenge for their proposal to assist coral evolution. Allen’s foundation then asked them for a proposal to fully fund the idea, which they eventually did with a $4m grant in June. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, has various climate-related projects in his philanthropic portfolio. Hawaii’s Gates said that while the goal of their project is to help coral survive global warming, there is still a need to end human’s reliance on fossil fuels and to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. “Even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions today, there is still this lag in the atmosphere where climate change will continue for probably hundreds of years,” Van Oppen said. “It’s hard to imagine it’s not going to get worse.”"

"In the first two weeks of the Keystone fight, we couldn’t get any press to pay attention to our work to defeat the environmental disaster we knew it would be if it were approved – none at all. Because back then in the summer of 2011 everyone knew that we couldn’t win. No one ever beats big oil. Now I’m sitting here fielding dozens and dozens of phone calls and emails from reporters, because we did: Barack Obama announced on Friday that he had denied TransCanada’s proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline.   Sometimes all the money in the world – which is roughly what the fossil fuel industry has – can’t carry the day. Sometimes, with an awful lot of spirit and passion and creativity and sacrifice, movements erupt. This one erupted that summer, when 1,253 people went to jail for protesting the project. Soon after, 15,000 people were calling the White House. The following winter, 800,000 people emailed their senators on the same day – a new record. The year after that, millions submitted public comments to the State Department.  Eventually, through it all, two basic truths shone through.   One, the Keystone XL pipeline was indicative of the kinds of things we cannot continue to do: dig up vast tracts in faraway places to produce more carbon than the atmosphere can stand. It’s the epitome of senseless destruction.  Two, people aren’t going to stand for our governments ignoring climate change and environmental degradation any longer. By “people”, I don’t mean environmentalists as the media usually imagine them: I mean indigenous people, and people from front line communities, farmers and ranchers, scientists and lots of rabbis and ministers and imams. People are worried sick by climate change.  Usually we suppress our worries about climate change because, we ask ourselves, What can we do? It’s so big and we’re so small. But given a realistic chance to affect the future, people are ready to take action.  In retrospect, I’m not so sure that our chance really was realistic in 2011. We shouldn’t have won. But luck favors the committed – and people were remarkably committed. I remember spending 3 days in Central Cell Block in Washington DC with 50 or 60 colleagues, and no one’s spirit ever wavered. We’ll need lots more luck in the years ahead. Today was a good goal scored, but we’re still way behind. (If you want proof of that look at the hurricanes gouging the Arabian Sea, or look at the record temperatures month after month.) There’s no guarantee that we can beat climate change, but there’s every guarantee we’re going to give it a hell of a fight. "
" Australians are in the dark about the risks climate change poses for the local insurance industry because Australian insurers don’t disclose enough information, a new report claims.  According to the study by WWF, Australian insurers IAG, QBE and Suncorp tell customers far less than overseas insurers about the risks climate change could pose to their businesses, and also shy away from public statements about the need to act on global warming more than their international peers. Climate change poses risks for the insurance industry through increased claims and potential impacts on investments held by the insurer to pay on future claims, and could cause premium increases so steep that homes in some fire, flood or cyclone prone areas could become uninsurable. A study presented to the Actuaries Institute last year, “Can actuaries really afford to ignore climate change?” found claims were likely to rise but that it was difficult to predict by exactly how much. Bushfire claims were calculated to rise by between 29% and 116% by the end of the century, cyclones by up to 230% and river flooding by between 7% and 54%. “Global warming will have significant impacts on the insurance industry through increased claims, reputational damage, decline in insurance affordability, and an increase in uninsurable sectors or geographies,” WWF spokeswoman Monica Richter said. “Without full public disclosure of their climate-related risks and management strategies, Australian consumers and shareholders are left vulnerable to unexpected costs and regulatory shifts.” WWF argues Australian insurers should publicly disclose their position on climate change and how they are managing their risks and actively advocate for ambitious climate change policies. “Given the insurance industry’s expertise in risk management, weather-related impacts and prominent position in the business community, insurance companies have a responsibility to reduce risks and costs to consumers,” it says.  The research compared public climate change-related policies and statements from general insurers IAG, QBE and Suncorp with three international insurance companies, Allianz, Prudential Financial and AXA. It found only QBE disclosed climate-related business risks and none of the Australian insurers had made public statements on climate change policy. In September, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned a meeting of leading insurers at Lloyd’s of London that climate change would lead to financial crises and falling living standards unless the world’s leading countries did more to ensure that their companies came clean about their current and future carbon emissions. And the WWF study came after a report earlier in the year by The Climate Institute, which questioned why there had been no official examination of how climate change might affect Australia’s financial system.

"The roof of the world. That is what Tibet has long been known as. The phrase conjures up images of summits, with their mountain peaks, glaciers, permafrost and the nomads who live on the land. But a roof is also symbolic of a home, and is the structure that protects those who live there. And, as we all know, if the roof is structurally compromised, then so is the home.  Tibet’s glaciers are melting, and the world needs to notice. Its permafrost is degrading, and the world needs to care. Tibet is suffering from massive deforestation and damming projects, and the world needs to act. Why now? Because as world leaders gather in Paris this December for the United Nations COP 21 meetings on climate change, Tibet needs to be on the climate change agenda. It is an environmentally strategic area and its importance to the sustainability of the world’s fragile ecosystem cannot be overstated. At an average elevation of 4,000 metres above sea level, and with an area of 2.5m sq km, Tibet is the world’s highest and largest plateau. But, in addition to being the “roof of the world”, here are a few other equally suitable epithets. The third pole: the Tibetan plateau has 46,000 glaciers, making it home to the third largest concentration of ice after the south and north poles. The water tower of Asia: the Tibetan plateau is the head source of Asia’s six largest rivers. These waters are a critical resource to the more than 1.3 billion people in the world’s 10 most densely populated nations surrounding the plateau. The rain-maker: the Tibetan plateau influences the timing and intensity of monsoons in the region. And as world leaders sit in their climate-controlled rooms in Paris, they need only think back to this summer and the massive heatwave that affected most of Europe to see yet another example of the critical role Tibet plays in global weather systems. Those heatwaves have been linked to thinning snow cover on the Tibetan plateau. The plateau’s temperature has increased by 1.3C (34.4F) – three times the global average. Glaciers on the Tibetan plateau are melting at a rate of 7% annually and if the current rate continues, two-thirds of the glaciers on the plateau will be gone by 2050. The Alpine permafrost, critical for the health of the planet, is at serious risk. On the Tibetan plateau, the permafrost stores more than 12,300m tonnes of carbon. But 10% of this permafrost has degraded in the past decade. With the permafrost degradation and the resulting release of carbon, the impact on climate change will be, needless to say, devastating. A global environmental catastrophe can be avoided, but we must act now to ensure that the Tibetan plateau is protected. In the lead-up to COP 21, the Central Tibetan Administration is calling on world leaders to take urgent action on climate change, starting with a strong global climate agreement in Paris. Such an agreement needs to have meaningful and transparent commitments from all governments, including China. China recently committed to cap carbon emission by 2030. Although a welcome announcement, this commitment must not be realised by further damaging Tibet’s environment. China’s proposed expansion of hydropower dams is not the solution. China has already dammed every major river in Tibet. And more damming is expected. In China’s 12th five-year plan hydropower projects are a stated priority. Without proper consultation and impact assessments, these hydropower projects can cause serious, irreversible environmental damage. China should also become a signatory to the United Nations water convention, committing to protect the quantity and quality water resources. The United Nations must act by recognising the significance of the Tibetan plateau. A comprehensive understanding of global climate change is impossible without looking at Tibet. UN-led research studies are needed to better understand the impact of climate change on the Tibetan plateau and the critical role it plays in tackling climate change. Nomadic mobility is key to protecting the world’s dry lands. Unfortunately, China is forcing Tibetan nomads off their lands and into large scale settlements. To date, more than two million people have been moved. There must be an immediate halt to the forceful removal of Tibetan nomads from their lands and those already resettled should be allowed to return to their pastures. Tibetan nomads are the expert custodians of their lands and their traditional knowledge must be incorporated into climate mitigation and adaptation practices. Tibetans must have a say on what happens on their lands and Tibet must be on the climate change agenda in Paris. As the Dalai Lama has said: “This blue planet is our only home and Tibet is its roof. The Tibetan plateau needs to be protected, not just for Tibetans, but for the environmental health and sustainability of the entire world.” The world’s eyes are on Paris for COP 21. Solutions to the climate crisis exist. What is needed is political will and action to protect the roof of the world and, by extension, our home."

"Butterflies are full of surprises and this year they have saved their biggest until last: in the midst of an awful November, subtropical butterflies have been spotted on England’s south coast. The remarkable appearance of the long-tailed blue, a butterfly happiest in the heat of Africa or Australia, raises a mystery: will these insects simply die this winter? Until recently, the long-tailed blue, or Lampides boeticus, very occasionally arrived in hot summers: notably in 1945, and 1990 when it pitched up in Gillespie Park, north London. In 2013, however, there was an unprecedented invasion. Summer arrivals laid eggs on everlasting peas (ironically a garden plant gone wild, imported from Italy) and in October offspring emerged: 109 were counted. This year it’s happened again. But the emergence of a British born generation has been delayed by the gloomy autumn. If it stays mild and the rain stops, more could yet hatch.  Why this sudden influx? Neil Hulme, of Butterfly Conservation, says: “My suspicion is its zone of permanent residency has moved northwards through Europe because of climate change and we are now in strikingdistance.” He believes this dynamic little flyer (it ascends into the Himalayas) will become a regular migrant, like the painted lady. For 45 years, he says, he never saw a long-tailed blue, and now he’s seen 50 in three summers. “It’s unthinkable that one person could have seen 50 long-tailed blues in Britain five years ago.” But is Britain a dead end? Do the long-tailed blue’s offspring perish in winter? Hulme is convinced that British born long-tailed blues make a reverse migration, just like other migratory butterflies – heading south through Europe to escape our fatal frosts. “The evidence is circumstantial but it’s overwhelmingly in favour of their migrating back south, like painted ladies do.”"

"The head of the UN’s climate fund has hailed a “paradigm shift” as poor countries began receiving money to help them tackle global warming, weeks before climate talks take place in Paris. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is intended to be the major conduit for funding to flow from wealthy economies built on fossil fuels to those that will suffer most from climate change they did not cause. On Friday at its board meeting in Zambia, the fund released $183m (£122m) for eight projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America.  The executive director, Hela Cheikhrouhou, said the symbolic significance of getting the fund up and running before the Paris talks outweighed the relatively tiny amount released. “It is a very important step forward in the global effort to fight climate change,” she said. Many developing countries have indicated that their commitments to cut emissions are conditional on support from wealthy nations. The developed world has agreed that poor countries should receive $100bn a year by 2020, but have so far pledged just $10.2bn to the GCF. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said he was disappointed that when the climate finance floodgates had finally been thrown open, just a trickle had emerged. “At this pace it will take them years to disburse the funds they already have with them, let alone $100bn a year in five years from now,” he said. Cheikhrouhou said assessing projects took time and she was hopeful that significantly more funding would be released at the next board meeting in March. The successful projects had been chosen because they had the potential to be “truly transformational”, said the former investment banker. The awards include $23.6m to fight water shortages in the low-lying atolls of the Maldives and $217m of green bonds (not included in the $183m total) for energy efficiency projects in Latin America.  Funding to cut energy use lags far behind clean energy investment, but Cheikhrouhou said the bonds could kick start an energy efficiency boom in Latin America. “That’s what we mean by paradigm shift. It’s something that has a good chance to change the picture of how we invest on a day-to-day basis,” she said. A key challenge confronting the fund is the refusal of the US Congress to release any of the $3bn promised last year by the Obama administration. But Cheikhrouhou said the US delegate to the GCF had said talks with congressional Republicans, whose colleagues have attacked the GCF as a “slush fund”, were progressing and some money could be released when the budget is finalised in December. The meeting also elected new co-chairs from South Africa and Australia. It is the second time the Australian delegate, Ewen McDonald, will co-chair the board, despite the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott previously deriding the fund. “This is a continuation of a good engagement by the Australian administration,” said Cheikhrouhou, who would not comment on the country’s widely maligned climate policies. A statement from the office of the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said: “Australia is seen as a pragmatic, constructive and results-focused member of the Green Climate Fund.” ."
"In the small fishing town of Salcedo in the Philippines’ Eastern Samar province, fishermen and women have been struggling to feed themselves since Haiyan first made landfall 20km away on 8 November 2013. Already among the poorest people in the country, their livelihoods were shattered when eight-metre high waves wrecked the coral reef near their area.  “Before Haiyan, we were able to catch enough fish for us to eat and even sell so we could buy rice or oil. Now, we could barely catch enough for our own needs,” says 59-year-old Carlos Rosaldo, who lost his house, his bangka (outrigger boat) and fishing nets. “Yes, we lost our house, we lost everything. But me and my parents are lucky because we are all alive,” says Sharon, Carlos’ 21-year-old daughter, who has been leading a village youth group that gets young people involved in disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation.  “They say Haiyan came because of the warmer climate,” says Sharon, gesturing at the hot, humid surroundings. “I believe this because we’ve noticed the changes. We expect April and May to be hot and dry, but in the last few years it’s always been raining. Between June and August, we expect rains, but instead we have droughts. During November and December, we expect it to be getting colder, but now it still feels like summer,” she says. Carlos agrees. “It’s unpredictable. We’ve never experienced anything like this.”  In spite of the devastation, Sharon says some good things have come out of the disaster. “Because of Haiyan, many people, including my parents, are now taking advice from the government and NGOs more seriously. Not just evacuation orders, but also advice about fishing practices and what to do now that we’re experiencing El Niño,” she says. The Rosaldos’ neighbour, Cherry Ann Abud, 31, has also noticed positive changes. “People now join town meetings about preparedness and adaptation. This is new, especially for women like me,” says Abud, who is married to a fisherman and has an 18-month-old son. “Thanks to NGOs, I was encouraged to join an organisation with other women. We educate ourselves about climate change and how we can better adapt to it. When we hear that there’s a storm or drought coming, we find out how much food we should store, how soon we should evacuate, or what alternative livelihood we could take on,” says Abud, who was recently elected chairperson of the Barangay [Village] Water and Sanitation Association. The ability of communities – especially those in which livelihoods depend on fishing – to adapt their practices to a changing climate is key to withstanding extreme weather events like El Niño, which has been predicted to be the worst in the world’s history. However, with limited resources, they cannot do this by themselves. Last month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its fifth assessment report.  Dr Luèka Kajfež-Bogataj, one of the report’s authors, said: “Continued high emissions will increase risks. Key regional issues range from increased water scarcity, to flooding with the potential for widespread damages, to increases in wildfires and associated impacts. A wide diversity of adaptation options can help reduce these risks while building vibrant communities and robust economies.” The ball is now in the court of the world leaders due to meet at the 21st climate conference in Paris in a few weeks to hammer out a binding agreement to contain global warming. In a stark illustration of just how critical it is to act without delay, Typhoon Koppu made landfall over Aurora province in the northern Philippines on 18 October, unleashing winds of up to 210kph. Over three days, it brought torrential rains that caused extensive flooding and triggered deadly landslides, leaving more than 50 people dead and 83 injured . About 950,000 people were evacuated and there was an estimated $184m (£122m) of damage to agriculture. Koppu’s arrival marks the fourth time in the past four years that the Philippines has been hit by a major typhoon while global climate negotiations were under way.  For climate justice advocates, this coincidence is not just about bad luck: it is a sign of the times. “While developed countries continue to hesitate in providing much needed support to enhance adaptation actions, particularly vulnerable and poorer developing countries like the Philippines continue to bear the brunt of the destructive effects of climate change,” says Shubert Ciencia of Oxfam in the Philippines, a senior member of the Philippine delegation to the UN climate talks. “Rich countries, who have historical responsibility in causing climate change, must help developing countries who are suffering the most from its adverse impacts to cope and enhance their resilience,” he added. The question now is whether global leaders in Paris will commit the funds needed to help countries like the Philippines and towns like Salcedo adapt to climate change. Will they take the voices of people like the Rosaldos and Abud – those hardest hit by climate change, but least responsible for it – straight to the heart of the negotiations? One thing is sure: whatever they decide, it will affect millions of people across the world, whose lives and livelihoods are most at risk in the battle against climate change."

"Bernie Sanders launched a new climate campaign on Wednesday, aimed at fighting global warming by banning new coal, oil and gas mining on public land.  The Keep it in the Ground Act co-sponsored by the senator and Democratic presidential candidate aims at plugging one of the big gaps in Barack Obama’s climate change plan: his administration’s continued sanction of fossil fuel extraction on the government’s lands and waters. The bill, authored by Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and supported by Democratic senators Barbara Boxer of California, Ben Cardin of Maryland, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in addition to Sanders, says that the US could avoid the vast majority of fossil fuel emissions by stopping any new mining projects. The bill seeks to ban new drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans as well as on government lands in the West. On many of those areas, extraction is still in its very early stages. “The potential emissions resulting from extracting and burning all fossil fuels on Federal land and waters amounts to a significant percentage of the greenhouse gas emissions limit,” the bill says. “Ending new leases for fossil fuels will prevent the release of 90% of the potential emissions from Federal fossil fuels,” it went on. The International Energy Agency has declared that two-thirds of the world’s coal, oil and gas reserves must stay in the ground to avoid triggering dangerous and irreversible climate change.  Campaigners estimate up to 450bn tonnes of coal, oil and gas reserves remain in lands and water under US government control. Already, campaigners estimate, up to 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions originate from those fossil fuels mined in US public lands and waters. Extracting and burning those reserves undermine Obama’s efforts to avoid that climate-altered future. “We need to drive this understanding that for us to be good stewards of our planet, we must keep in the ground the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves,” Merkley told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. The initiative adds to growing pressure on the Obama administration from campaigners to do more to fight climate change on its own turf. In an open letter last September, more than 400 campaign groups called on Obama to stop the sale of new oil and gas leases on public lands.  “Over the past decade, the burning of fossil fuels from federal leasing has resulted in nearly a quarter of all US energy-related emissions and nearly 4 per cent of global emissions,” the letter said. “Despite this pollution and the looming climate threat, your administration continues to lease publicly owned fossil fuels, endangering the health and welfare of communities and the planet.” Obama has made some small steps to limit fossil fuel production in lands and waters under his government’s control. The administration last month cut off the prospects for future oil drilling in Arctic waters, cancelling two oil lease auctions and turning down requests from Shell and other companies for more time on their existing leases.  Wednesday’s initiative has almost no chance of becoming law. But it accomplishes two important goals for environmental campaigners: underscoring Obama’s reluctance to tackle the supply side of climate change; and keeping climate change on the political agenda ahead of next year’s presidential elections. Sanders’ support for the bill solidifies the Democratic presidential contender’s reputation as one of the greenest members of the Senate and – once again – puts him out ahead of Clinton in supporting strong action on climate change. Sanders was an early opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline and Arctic drilling, forcing Clinton to shift her positions on both issues in the last few months. Obama has won widespread praise from campaigners for his efforts to fight climate change – anchored by his plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants, the biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. But there is growing frustration that Obama has focused his measures so far on smokestack emissions rather than heading off the use of fossil fuels at the source, such as restricting mining leases on government lands. “President Obama has done more than any president in past to address climate change but the bills coming out of the administration have been focused on tail pipes and power plants. They haven’t been addressing the source of the emissions. But this bill would put pressure on the administration to focus on keeping fossil fuels in the grounds instead of digging them up in the first place,” said Marissa Knodel, climate campaigner from Friends of the Earth.  Democratic party operatives meanwhile exhibit growing confidence that climate change will emerge as an important wedge issue in the 2016 presidential elections, casting their Republican opponents as anti-science and detached from reality because of their refusal to acknowledge the existence of climate change or deal with its consequences."
"Leaders from business, welfare, the conservation movement, the electricity sector and the union movement have moved to try to fill Australia’s climate policy vacuum by starting a new slogan-free debate to help political parties find workable greenhouse policies. Mirroring the Turnbull government’s tax debate, in which all policy options are back “on the table”, the groups commissioned major consultancies to present on six climate policy options at a special closed-door summit this week. They intend to publish the results in a back-to-the-drawing-board policy “primer” to be released next year.  Indicating the extent to which six years of bitter climate policy war have forced wide-ranging discussion outside the political arena, advisers to environment minister Greg Hunt, resources minister Josh Frydenberg and Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler, as well as advisers to state governments, all attended the workshop as observers. The experts believe the Coalition’s Direct Action policy needs substantial modification to reach the 2030 emissions reduction target that the government will pledge at the Paris climate change meeting next month. Malcolm Turnbull has refused to be drawn on climate policy in the early months of his prime ministership, suggesting any reconsideration of Direct Action would happen in the review scheduled for 2017. Beyond promising that it will propose some form of emissions trading scheme and an “aspirational” goal to reach 50% renewable energy, Labor has not yet released specific policies. John Connor, chief executive of The Climate Institute, said the workshop had “started from the view that there has to be a new maturity in this policy discussion to meet Australia’s goals”. “Everyone there acknowledged that we can’t make advances if we are stuck in our policy, ideological or technological trenches and also that we don’t currently have policies on the table to get to our longer-term climate change goals.” The roundtable heard presentations on the pros and cons of baseline and credit trading schemes (from the Centre for International Economics), cap and trade emissions trading schemes (Ernst and Young), regulation to reduce emissions (Acil Allen), a straight carbon tax (Deloitte), other electricity sector schemes (PWC) and Direct Action-style schemes where governments buy abatement (Baker and McKenzie). Many participants still saw a full emissions trading scheme as the most efficient policy option, but politically difficult, and a straight carbon tax – which the Australian debate has historically confused with an ETS – as even more politically dangerous. Acil Allen is understood to have argued regulation was a relatively inefficient and high-cost way to force change, but that it might be useful where emissions were hard to measure, like agriculture, or where there were high transaction costs. Some energy companies, such as AGL, have suggested the government follow a Canadian-style policy of imposing age limits on Australia’s oldest brown coal-fired generators, to force their earlier retirement and soak up some of the oversupply in the east coast electricity market. It was seen as an advantage that the Coalition’s Direct Action policy had been designed so that it could be transformed into a baseline and credit trading scheme, but with the scheme best fitting the electricity sector rather than the whole economy. The government has refused to confirm that this is its intention. Abatement auctions – such as those conducted under Direct Action’s $2.5bn emissions reduction fund – were widely seen as useful in limited circumstances, but not able to be scaled up to provide the large reductions in greenhouse emissions required for Australia’s 2030 target. “We all know there has to be a change of direction from the Coalition after the next election, either ratcheting up Direct Action or changing it entirely,” one rountable participant said. “We all know Labor is still working on the details of their policy. We want to try to reopen up the space for them to move, to look at things logically. “We did not put one policy above another, we just discussed the pros and cons of all of them. We want to restart a sensible debate.” Among the groups who formed the climate roundtable last year were the Australian Aluminium Council, Australian Industry Group, the Climate Institute, Australian Conservation Foundation, the Business Council of Australia, WWF Australia, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Energy Supply Association of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Investor Group on Climate Change. The meeting also heard a presentation from climate scientist Graeme Pearman about the implications of the global target to limit warming to 2C."

"China has used up too much energy and too many resources in its quest for growth, premier Li Keqiang has told visiting French president François Hollande, adding that the country has a “duty to humanity” to clean itself up.  Li’s comments come ahead of a UN climate summit in Paris, which will seek to unite all the world’s nations in a single agreement on tackling climate change. Hollande said in a radio interview the summit’s success was “possible, not certain”, with some issues still to be settled. As the world’s largest polluter, China will be a key player at the event, in the face of disputes over whether developed or developing countries should bear more of the burden for reducing emissions. Li said more environmentally-friendly development would be “obligatory” for China to “promote a restructuring of its national economy”, currently experiencing its slowest growth in years. The shift was China’s “duty and a contribution to humanity” as one of the world’s largest countries, he added. China’s decades-long boom, which has propelled it to global prominence, largely depended on heavy industry, real estate and infrastructure investment. But growth has slowed in recent years and now stands at its lowest since the global financial crisis, according to official figures. “For a great many years, we consumed too much energy and resources to achieve our development, and this model has since become unsustainable,” Li said, adding that China must now rely more on developing its human resources. But he did not cite any specific measures it would take. On Monday China and France issued a joint declaration on climate change saying that the Paris accord – intended to cap warming at two degrees Celsius over pre-industrial revolution levels – should include checks for compliance. Each signatory’s progress should be reviewed every five years, the statement said, to “build mutual trust and confidence and promote effective implementation”. Hollande called the declaration a “historic” step forward, and on Tuesday, the final day of his two-day trip, urged Beijing to “discuss with and convince a number of countries known to be vital” to the negotiation process. “When China is committed, it of course commits itself, but it is an example, a benchmark.” In comments to Europe1 radio during his visit to China, Hollande said there “are still a few issues that have to be settled” before the Paris talks. “Yes, failure is still possible, but today I am confident,” he said. The UN summit, held from 30 November 30 to 11 December, will be opened by world leaders, including US president Barack Obama, China’s Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi of India. Hollande said it was encouraging that major emitters such as China and the United States, as well as developing nations, were all deeply engaged in the notoriously combative negotiating process. Asked if he thought the conference would be a success, he said: “It is possible, not certain.” Among the key points still in dispute, he cited $100bn (€91bn) in annual climate finance that rich nations had promised for developing countries from 2020. Some $65bn has been secured and another $20bn promised, said Hollande, but “we are not yet at $100bn”. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said a total of $62bn was paid in climate aid in 2014. Rich nations say this indicates progress towards the $100bn goal for 2020, while developing countries say the figure is not a useful measure. China is an important member of the largest negotiating bloc, the G77 group of developing nations, which insists that rich nations must bear more responsibility for cutting emissions since they have been polluting for longer. Developed nations point the finger, in turn, at emerging giants such as China and India, which burn massive amounts of fossil fuel to power their fast-growing economies and populations."

"Coal isn’t going anywhere, according to the boss of the World Coal Association (WCA), who said “sensible” investors should keep their money in the fossil fuel and avoid “political” moves to divest. Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and the industry has suffered heavily from the rapid rise of renewables in Europe and of shale gas in the US, with the threat of a greater crackdown on carbon emissions to come at a crunch UN climate change summit in Paris in December.   On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency said renewable energy is now the second-largest generator of electricity, attracting 60% of all investment, and is set to overtake coal in the early 2030s. But Benjamin Sporton, the chief executive of the WCA, told the Guardian that the energy world’s centre has moved to Asia, where coal will be burned for many more decades as developing nations seek an “affordable, reliable and accessible fuel”. “There is an assumption we can get rid of coal and that is how we can solve the climate problem,” Sporton said. “But coal plays a critical role in the world’s energy mix and is going to for a very long time to come. All sources of energy will increase, but coal isn’t going anywhere.” Sporton said that coal will be increasingly used in Asia and that action to curb global warming therefore requires a drive to ensure older, dirtier power stations are replaced with modern, less polluting ones, followed by the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), which buries CO2 emissions. Sporton noted both China and India cited the cleaner use of coal as part of their climate action pledges submitted to the UN. “The WCA has long recognised the need to reduce emissions,” he said. “The global objective is to reduce emissions to get us on the pathway to 2C [of global warming] and if we are going to achieve that [then] ‘high efficiency-low emissions’ and CCS technologies are needed.” The WCA is not alone in expecting coal burning to continue. The International Energy Agency’s 2015 report predicts coal will provide 10% of the increased energy demand by 2040, largely due to a tripling in coal demand in India and in south-east Asia, though consumption in OECD nations is projected to drop by 40%. Another recent report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS), showed there is “a global renaissance of coal majorly driven by poor, fast-growing countries that increasingly rely on coal to satisfy their growing energy demand”. Sporton said that renewables would play a role in bringing electricity to the 1.3 billion people who currently lack access, particularly in remote rural areas. But he said coal could provide much larger amounts of power: “Electricity for business and industry – that is where coal has a particularly important role to play.” However, even the latest, most efficient coal technology still emits more CO2 than gas-powered power plants. The scientists who did the PNAS research concluded: “If future economic growth of poor countries is fuelled mainly by coal, ambitious [climate change] targets very likely will become unfeasible ... International climate policy must find ways to offer viable alternatives to coal for developing countries.” Sporton said the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology which could slash CO2 emissions but is yet to be proven at commercial scale, was being held back by the lack of a level playing field with renewable energy. “We don’t see the same sort of policy support for CCS in most jurisdictions as we do for wind or solar,” he said, noting that the a £1bn CCS competition launched in 2007 by the UK government had “stuttered” and has yet to be awarded.  Asked why politicians were not backing CCS, Sporton said: “It’s probably a less attractive technology. It’s politically palatable to stand in front of a wind turbine and sell that whereas standing in front of a power station doesn’t look as interesting.” Sporton dismissed the decision by Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, to sell off its coal assets as having been taken for “presumably political reasons”. He said: “Coal is going to be an important part of the world’s energy mix for years to come, so any sensible, average investor should remain invested in coal.” He also challenged analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that estimated subsidies to the global coal industry at $2.5tn a year, mainly made up of the damage caused by air pollution and climate change. “When people look at the externalities, they are not conversely looking at the benefits. We need to look at both sides of the equation,” he said. “Coal provides affordable energy that helps economies grow and brings with that a whole pile of benefits that supports the developing and emerging economies in particular.”  However, climate economist Lord Nick Stern argues the IMF analysis “shatters the myth that fossil fuels are cheap by showing just how huge their real costs are.” A recent study linked emissions from fossil fuel power stations to about 500,000 premature deaths a year. “Obviously [we] need to recognise the fact that we need to reduce emissions from coal, and not just carbon, but we are addressing this through modern coal technology,” said Sporton. The Economist argued in 2014 that such technologies were too costly: “None of these [emissions-cutting technologies] seems scalable in the way needed to dent the colossal damage done by coal.” The World Bank, which has rejected the coal industry idea that its fuel provides a solution to poverty, has all but given up funding coal-fired power stations, as have other development banks.  “I think that is a mistake, because countries that don’t have the support to build the best technologies will build older, less efficient technology,” said Sporton, although he declined to specify a date by which heavily polluting coal power stations should be banned."
"Our planet’s fragile ozone layer is on a path toward full restoration by about 2050. But there’s a hitch: the success has hinged largely on replacing ozone-depleting substances with hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs) – chemicals we now know are highly damaging to the environment. It is time to reduce these pollutants. Air conditioning, refrigeration, and insulation often contain factory-made HFCs. They are greenhouse gases that can be hundreds or thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in damaging our climate system, yet their global use is rapidly increasing every year. It was the 1987 Montreal Protocol, one of the most successful environmental treaties in history, which led to HFCs replacing ozone-destroying pollutants. On 1 November, at the international meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Dubai, the United States will make a powerful case for better management of HFC pollution worldwide. Because of the importance of taking aggressive action on these chemicals to achieve global climate goals, I will be leading the United States delegation at that meeting.  President Obama’s Climate Action Plan pledges to reduce HFC emissions both at home and through international leadership; and the United States is delivering on that promise. Over the past year, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed four separate actions that both expand the list of safer alternatives to HFCs and prohibit them from certain uses in the refrigeration air conditioning, foam, and aerosol sectors where safer alternatives such as hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), hydrocarbons and lower-polluting blends are available. We’ve issued proposals that will take us even further down the road to reducing these pollutants. And the US Department of Defense is leading by example through installation of next-generation technologies that rely on carbon dioxide refrigerant instead of HFCs in parts of its fleet and military bases. America’s private sector is also stepping up. In 2014, and again this month, more than 20 business leaders made commitments to reduce HFC use and emissions by incorporating climate-friendly technologies into their air conditioners, refrigerators, foams and other products. Innovative technologies and new HFC alternatives are making this progress possible.  Commitments already made by the US government and private sector will reduce cumulative global consumption of these greenhouse gases by the equivalent of more than 1bn metric tons of CO2 through 2025 – that’s equal to taking 210m passenger vehicles off the road for an entire year.  Today, better solutions are available to replace ozone-depleting substances with safer alternatives. Global innovation has brought cutting-edge technologies and alternatives to market that can be used in the products we rely on without damaging our ozone layer or our climate system.  Altogether new technologies include foams blown with HFOs or methyl formate, and transcritical CO2 – a refrigeration technology already used in supermarkets. And newly optimized alternatives from long ago, such as water, ammonia and hydrocarbons, are also available.  Solutions are here, and it’s time to amend the Montreal Protocol to reflect that.  Countries that are ready to act on climate have come to the same conclusion. There are already 40 nations that have put forward proposals to amend the Montreal Protocol, with even more expressing support for such measures to phase down HFCs. Amending the Montreal Protocol would phase down the production and consumption of potent HFCs worldwide, bringing genuine progress to fight climate change. Such an amendment could avoid half a degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century, according to a study in the Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. But success in Dubai would propel us even further. It would set the stage for an ambitious and durable global climate agreement in December, when nearly all nations on Earth will come together in Paris to advance an unprecedented opportunity to protect our planet. An ambitious climate agreement in Paris would unlock the path to a global clean energy economy and avoid the worst climate change impacts that loom over our children and grandchildren. President Obama has taken step after step to curb emissions domestically and has set an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. But we can’t meet the global climate challenge alone. Nations around world must cooperate. Our immediate task is to formalize a global commitment to an HFC phasedown under the Montreal Protocol. Our broader charge is to come together as a world community and lay the foundation for a global agreement in Paris that will protect generations to come. Nations that are serious about fighting global climate change need to come to the table in Dubai with a sincere intent to negotiate a global agreement to phase down these harmful chemicals."
"Volkswagen has said it will foot the bill for extra taxes incurred by drivers after it admitted understating the carbon dioxide emissions of about 800,000 cars in Europe. In a letter to European Union finance ministers on Friday, seen by Reuters, Matthias Müller, the VW chief executive, asked member states to charge the carmaker rather than motorists for any additional taxes relating to fuel usage or CO2 emissions.  The initial emissions scandal, which erupted in September when Volkswagen admitted it had rigged US diesel emissions tests, affecting 11m vehicles globally, deepened this week when VW said it had also understated the carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption of 800,000 vehicles in Europe. Analysts say VW, Europe’s biggest carmaker, could face a bill of up to €35bn (£25bn) for fines, lawsuits and vehicle refits. To help meet some of the anticipated costs, VW has announced a €1bn programme of spending cuts.  The head of VW’s works council said the announcement of the cuts had broken strict rules in Germany on consultation with workers and demanded immediate talks with company bosses.  “Management is announcing savings measures unilaterally and without any foundation,” Bernd Osterloh said in an emailed statement. VW also confirmed on Friday that a third senior executive was leaving the company, following the departure of the former chief executive and the manager who had been designated to run VW’s North American business. The company said Walter Maria de Silva, the design chief responsible for models including the Golf Mk7 and Audi A5, would retire at the end of November. It did not name a successor. The German business daily Handelsblatt, citing company sources, had earlier said VW planned to cut costs in de Silva’s department, which spends about €100m a year. VW did not comment on the report. Since the emissions revelations, VW has been criticised by lawmakers, regulators, investors and customers frustrated at the time it is taking to get to the bottom of a scandal that has wiped almost a third off the carmaker’s market value. Mary Nichols, the head of the California Air Resources Board, which is investigating VW in the US, told the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche: “Volkswagen is so far not handling the scandal correctly.  “Every additional gram of nitrogen oxide increases the health risks for our citizens. Volkswagen has not acknowledged that in any way or made any effort to really solve the problem.”  The case is “the biggest direct breach of laws that I have ever uncovered ... This is a serious issue, which will certainly lead to very high penalties,” Nichols added.  The scandal has also piled pressure on European regulators, who have long been criticised by environmentalists on the grounds that on-road tests have consistently shown vehicles emitting more pollutants than official laboratory tests.  In an open letter, a group of leading investors urged the EU to toughen up vehicle testing. But it faces a battle because carmakers have traditionally had a strong influence on policy in countries such as Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, where they are an important source of jobs and export income.  The European commission sent a letter to all 28 EU member states on Thursday urging them to widen their investigations into potential breaches of vehicle emissions regulations.  Vehicle testing in the EU is overseen by national authorities, so the commission is reliant on each country to enforce the rules. A commission spokeswoman said: “Public trust is at stake. We need all the facts on the table and rigorous enforcement of existing legislation.”"
